attempts to fully fund the women infants and children program that provides food for the nations children it provides federal grants to states for supplemental foods nutrition education and health care referrals to lowincome pregnant and postpartum women infants and children up to 5 years old we must remember that children have always been the largest category of wic participants of the 8 7 million people who received wic benefits each month in fiscal year 2008 about 4 33 million were children and 2 2 million were infants this bill cuts 650 million out of wic and i am so glad my good friend from georgiaand i appreciate his friendshipjust got up and said the agricultural research service is pretty darn well funded 900 million i am simply asking to address the question of the staggering devastation of malnutrition in our children and i have indicated that when you look at worldwide numbers malnutrition can kill but here in the united states there are children that go to bed hungry there are women that do not eat properly there are babies that do not get nourishment in texas alone between 23 000 and 40 000 people are expected to be dropped from the wic program if the funding is not restored and each and every state in the union is going to receive that kind of devastating impact can you imagine 40 000 women infants and children not being able to eat because we wont restore full funding texas has three of the top 40 districts with the highest national food hardship rates and in the 18th congressional district there are 159 000 food insecure people the food insecurity rate is 23 percent and texas stands 32 in the nation out of 435 districts we are 32 in food insecurity so let me just say alongside of obesity eating wrong we have to face the actual question of hunger children who are served by the wic program in texas are less likely to eat fast food in comparison to children who are not in this program again i want you to look at this picture healthy children need to eat healthy and i ask my colleagues why in fact would we not want to fully fund the program of women and infant children i will say that the impact of not eating healthy is obesity and poor health this healthy baby healthylooking baby has a future that is undetermined when you have an issue of lack of healthy food and access to such so 650 million when were in essence funding research for 900 million i believe you can share a little because the wic program is beneficial in helping the most vulnerable in our country i ask the question who will speak for the children it is important that the wic program 9 2 million through 10 000 clinics among this group 4 9 million children 2 1 million infants and 1 million women have the ability to be served around the nation its a complementary program having healthy mothers healthy pregnant mothers to give birth to healthy babies to raise healthy children not obese nourished and ready to be leaders in this nation who are we if we are not going to speak for our children and i ask my colleagues to consider waiving procedural issues to ensure that children are served i believe that is an important issue and in my district in the 18th congressional district with 1 000 census tracts of people who are food insecure i am arguing vigorously for the full funding of the wic program to help our women our infants and their children who will speak for our children what will their future be and how will they lead this country if we do not invest with them today i ask my colleagues to support this amendment i rise today in support of my amendment to h r 2112 agriculture rural development food and drug administration and related agencies appropriations act 2112 as it restores full funding to the women infant and children wic program as the founder of the childrens caucus and a member of the womens caucus i have firmly stood in support of the nutritional needs of our nations families as a country we must protect and safeguard the health and nutrition of our nations lowincome families women infant and children wic provides federal grants to states for supplemental foods nutrition education and health care referrals to lowincome pregnant and postpartum women infants and children up to age 5 who are found to be at nutritional risk during the final quarter of fiscal year 2009 the number of women infants and children receiving wic benefits each month reached approximately 9 3 million we must remember that children have always been the largest category of wic participants of the 8 7 million people who received wic benefits each month in fiscal year 2008 about 4 33 million were children and 2 22 million were infants wic is essential because it affords many women especially women of color in lower income brackets the opportunity to care for themselves and their newborns after birth without programs such as wic many mothers would not be able to maintain a healthy lifestyle during pregnancies and after childbirth because of wic mothers can afford the nutritional foods they need to sustain their pregnancies and avoid miscarriages stillbirths and defects caused by malnourishment during pregnancy today i am proud to support a full restoration of funding to wic this program which is distinctly american demonstrates that we place a high value on feeding our nations children and tending to the needs of our nations poor thomas jefferson wrote in the declaration of independence that we are endowed with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed i believe that it is no coincidence that life is listed firstfor without it the founders realized no other rights can be realized over many years the millions of americans who could not access medical services were denied their right to lifea life with access to quality and affordable health care let me set the record straight wic is good for the american people and will go a long way in ensuring access to quality and affordable care to those millions of americans who will need access to proper nutrition wic helps to ensure that our country will not succumb to one of the most staggering causes of death in children around the world malnutrition malnutrition remains a significant problem worldwide particularly among children it should not be a problem within the united states that is why we have programs like wic according to the united nations world food programme severe acute malnutrition affects an estimated 20 million children under the age of five worldwide and is responsible in whole or in part for more than half of all deaths of children malnutrition kills approximately one million children each year or an average of one every thirty seconds this is not the direction we want to take the united states when i stand here today and reflect upon what we are about to embark upon i cannot help but think of some of the last words that the great senator ted kennedy shared in his letter to president obama the senator said and so because of your obamas vision and resolve i came to believe that soon very soon affordable health coverage will be available to all in an america where the state of a familys health will never again depend on the amount of a familys wealth and while i will not see the victory i was able to look forward and know that we willyes we willfulfill the promise of health care in america as a right and not a privilege well senator your lifes work shall today be proven to not be in vain i continue to stand by protecting the health needs of low income families and yes this program ensures the health of infants and children will never again depend on the amount of their familys income in the words of the great president john f kennedy the voters selected us in short because they had confidence in our judgment and our ability to exercise that judgment from a position where we could determine what were their own best interests as a part of the nations interest while my colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem to believe that without a cut to wic this will harm americans nothing could be further from the truth this bill is indeed in their best interests there are 110 million schoolaged children suffering from hunger every day and they are counting on americas leadership and generosity to provide them with an opportunity to break the cycle of poverty the wic program provides that leadership and generosity and it is for this reason that i urge my colleagues to join me in voting for restoring full funding to wic in the words of the great civil rights leader dr martin luther king jr we have also come to this hallowed spot to remind america of the fierce urgency of now we cannot wait we will not wait to protect the lives of our children we can not delay in

is really about protecting workers from corporations that retaliate against them simply for demanding their rights and organizing for their rights the republican bill changes the rules midtrial to benefit a particular fortune 500 company boeing but this bill has wideranging repercussions for american workers this bill does not protect or create jobs it just doesnt it forces american workers to fight over existing jobs by giving up their rights and underbidding each other its a race to the bottom the republican bill makes it easier to ship unitedstates jobs overseas theres no question about that and the republican bill creates an open season for ceos to punish workers for exercising their rights again this is a further assault on the rights and protections that workers have fought so hard for for so many decades and this bill undermines the duty to bargain in good faith this is an antiunion billthere is no questionamong other things the bill also encourages lawbreaking and intimidation by employers it removes a key disincentive against employers who unlawfully threaten employees with job loss during organizing drives the republican bill creates a new race to the bottom for american workers rights wages benefits and working conditions were going in the wrong direction with this bill this bill is one more assault on american workers on the american middle class time after time after time the republican leadership has stood up for big business and against the american middle class higher gas pricesrepublicans protect big oil tax breaks and do nothing to help the average consumer health care coverage for our kids through the age of 25republicans side with the health care companies that put profits over patients with this bill republicans are promoting job creation overseas by allowing companies to move overseas in retaliation of workers who are exercising their own legal rights not only that this bill goes back in time and applies this bill retroactively this is just like changing the value of a touchdown in the middle of the super bowl simply because you dont like the score of the game this bill would be a joke if it werent so serious i would urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle this is not about protecting righttowork states really this is not even about unions this is about the rights of workers in this country this is about protecting american jobs this is about urging companies to invest in the united states and not making it easier for them to create jobs overseas were in a difficult economy right now we should be debating on this floor the presidents job bill every day we should be doing something about jobs and instead here we are in september my republican colleagues have done nothing theyve done nothing except continue an assault on middle class families today its workers theyre going after medicare in the ryan budget their leading republican presidential candidate is talking about eliminating social

real business of the house we are voting on health care reform repeal the new republican majority has decided that this is the most important issue even though they know that its political theater a charade it may pass the house but it wont pass the senate and certainly the president would veto it so this is not becoming law at a time when we have so many pressing issues i am really saddened that the majority wants to conduct this political charade if there are problems with the health care law we dont have to repeal it we could change parts of it we could tweak it we could put out of the bill what we dont like and keep in the bill what we do like but unfortunately the attitude and the decision has been made to try to repeal the whole bill my constituents understand that as we speak now the rules committee is discussing what kind of amendments to allow and we know no real meaningful amendments if anything are going to be allowed the republican majority coming in says theyre going to have open rules and were not going to have really an open rule on the first bill that theyre going to attempt to pass which is a repeal of health care reform i think thats wrong i think there are many of us who feel strongly that there ought to be some amendments that we can put in to ensure that the good coverage that we have achieved in the health care bill is kept surely its not everything thats wrong with the health care bill which my colleagues oppose i want to ask them since they want to repeal the bill are they against the part of the bill which says that you can keep your child on your health care coverage until age 26 i think my constituents like that and i think theirs do as well do they want to repeal the part that says that an insurance company can no longer deny you coverage because of a socalled preexisting condition i think thats something that all constituents like and appreciate do the people that want to repeal the health care reform bill want to say to insurance companies that its okay to put caps on people so when they pay their premium year in and year out and then they finally get sick and ask for coverage the insurance companies can tell them well sorry not only do you have a preexisting condition but theres also a cap on benefits either an annual cap or a lifetime cap so therefore were not going to cover you at all i dont think anybodys constituents want that part to be repealed and what about the doughnut hole for seniors in medicare part d seniors have found it very very difficult they get part of their prescription drugs paid for and then theres a doughnut hole which is for a long time they have to pay for everything themselves while at the same time still paying their monthly premiums to the government and then at the end they get the government to come in and help them that has put a tremendous burden on seniors and what the health care bill which was passed by the last congress does is it eventually removes that doughnut hole for seniors seniors can get back money and it starts right away where they can get back money to pay for those prescription drugs so i think that we hear a lot about the lameduck session and how we all work together and how the big question of the new congress is going to be is it going to be a stalemate is it going to be gridlock or is it going to be people coming together in a bipartisan fashion to try to work together if the first bill that the republican majority is putting on the floor is any indication it seems to me that they have chosen gridlock and im really sorry about that because i will admit there are some things in the new health care law that should be changed and that we should work across the aisle together to make sure that changes but to repeal the provisions that benefit my constituents and everyone elses constituents all across america to me makes no sense whatsoever the big insurance companies have had it too big too long and my republican colleagues unfortunately are right in bed with them and i think that is something that the american people ought to see who do we care about the big insurance companies or do we care about the average american who is struggling day in and day out to get health care coverage we have almost 50 million americans without coverage and its not only the people who are not covered now but its working people who will find out in the days and months ahead if there is no health care bill that they will be added to the rolls of people who are uncovered and that people working hard will find out that the 50 million will swell to 60 million 70 million and maybe even more so it is going to affect all of us because the health care costs have been rising way way beyond the rate of inflation and that is why we needed to have health care reform i would say to my friends on the other side of the aisle lets not posture politically lets try to put our heads together and work in a bipartisan fashion to do something for the american people if there is something in the bill that needs to be changed then we should change it but repeal is not the answer every major bill from social security to the civil rights bills of the 1960s to medicare and medicaid all had to be tweaked after they were passed all had to be changed a little bit it is the same thing with this bill we should not repeal it we should fix it"],

trying so hard to have this rule contain an amendment that will allow us to vote on the extension of unemployment insurance for over 1 3 million americans who will lose those benefits if we do not pass that extension i would particularly salute congressman sandy levin of michigan the ranking member on the ways and means committee for his relentless championing of this issue of fairness to the american people we come here to talk about a bill that is to end the sequester and end the sequester it does i commend the conferees i am very proud of the work of congressman chris van hollen the ranking member on the budget committee on the democratic side nita lowey the ranking member on appropriations and our assistant leader mr clyburn representing the leadership in those negotiations i thank them for taking this to a place fighting it to a draw so that we come to the floor to fight some and end sequestration but the opportunity was so much greater apparently the republicans never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity when it comes to creating jobs mr van hollen had in his bill just a few points in terms of priorities one was to create jobs and economic growth for our country in the short term and in the long term if we close a loophole build the infrastructure of america close a loophole build a bridge close a loophole special interests tax loopholes for special interests invest in the human infrastructure of our country early childhood education longterm economic growth close a loophole pay for unemployment insurance i dont think it has to be paid for because it is emergency spending but nonetheless lets have an opportunity to vote to extend unemployment benefits when we do ignore those investments in the future we are not reducing the deficit we are increasing the deficit nothing brings more money to the treasury than creating jobs and the revenue that produces nothing brings more money to the treasury than the education of the american people starting with early childhood education as far as unemployment benefits are concerned the economic impact is clear every dollar spent on unemployment benefits grows the economy by 1 52 according to moodys analyticsa dollar and a half for every dollar we spent and that is a conservative estimate failing to extend unemployment benefits will cost us 200 000 jobs over the next year we cant do that a recent report shows that extending ui instead would produce 300 000 jobs so again this money if spent immediately injects demand into the economy creates jobs grows the economy as well as honoring our social compact that we have with the american people people work hard play by the rules and lose their job through no fault of their own insurance is what they have we should honor that insurance so it is disappointing yes because this package is so limited but as i said it was a fight to a draw and i recommend that our colleagues vote to support it so we can take it off the table and make way for the discussion we should be having about comprehensive immigration reform the votes are here give us a vote passing a farm bill that is very important to the economy of our country raise the minimum wage nearly twothirds of the people making the minimum wage are women paycheck equity have fairness in the workplace for women the list goes on and on enda ending discrimination against the lgbt community people in the workplace there are so many items on the agenda that have the support of the american people in large numbers yesterday was the anniversary of newtown pass the brady background bill all of these things are on an agenda we have neglected up until now we just havent had time for it i guess they havent been priorities for this congress but they are priorities for the american people and for the democrats in congress so again one reason to vote for this package even though you may think it is meager and you may not like all of its priorities as the gentleman said is to at least have an agreement on the budget that enables us to move forward for bigger fights that will improve policy and improve the lives of the american people and honor our responsibilities to them i urge our colleagues to vote for the budget but to vote against this rule because this rule says no it says no to the congress we are not even going to allow you to speak or vote on unemployment insurance benefits extension it says no to the american people that if you work hard and play by the rules and lose your job through no fault of your own the safety net is not there and that safety net is not there just for individuals it is there for the system our beautiful free market system grows in cycles and sometimes unemployment is higher than others and there are some outside forces at work that people lose their jobs because of and so it is a safety net for our economic system as well as individuals why would they not allow us to bring this up and extend the extension is it the money if it is the money we will find it is it the price do you think the price is to high to give people dignity to allow them to keep their homes and meet the needs of their children two million children would be affected by this tens of thousands of veterans will be affected by this we care about veterans here we care about children here but apparently not enough to extend unemployment benefits so why my republican colleagues would you not allow us to have a vote on this i know the support is there on the republican side i know that the democrats would vote 100 percent for this do you not believe that these people are worthy of receiving unemployment insurance i say insurance that is something paid into a benefit check if so let the american people know that but this debate will not end today while you may not give us a vote on the floor to extend these benefits so we see where everybody is on the subject and why this fight will continue because this is about the morality of our country the respect that we have for people the value that we place on work the pride we take in the great work ethic of the american people but sometimes it just seems the harder they work the forces are in a deck stacked against them and this congress is saying this deck is not going to include you as we deal out the cards so i cant explain it to anybody except to say it is a values decision and apparently there is not enough shared value on the subject of the respect we should have for our workers to even honor the subject with a vote on the floor of the house it is an outrageous rule to come to the floor i thank you for fighting it and i urge a very strong no vote on the rule vote no on the previous question which would allow us to bring the issue to the floor what are you afraid of are you afraid of the vote are you afraid of working people who are out of a job what are you afraid of let us have a vote on the floor with that i urge a no vote on the

calls upon all of us to stand not for our individual selfish interests but to look at the country as a united team that believes in lifting the boats of all people i want to thank my friends who have struggled on this committee to deal with the bare necessities of life of food that is why i come today unfortunately to oppose this legislation because it does not take into account that without sustenance and nutrition that people die it is plain and simple we are not talking about knicknacks or trains buses highways bridges all very important and job creators and in fact efforts that the democrats have made very clear that they are the job creating caucus for the press and push that we have made or are making in america we have asked our colleagues to join us but today we talk about feeding people i rose earlier today to say that it is in the dna of the 18th congressional district because one of my predecessors mickey leland actually died delivering food to starving people around the world he thought so much of hunger in america that he organized the select committee on hunger joined by tony hall and congressman emerson and his legacy was that we cannot do without substance so it makes no sense to cut 3 billion from wic a wic program that indicates that wic moms are more likely to have initiated breast feeding than lowincome nonwic moms middle to highincome moms are more likely to have initiated breast feeding than both wic and lowincome nonwic one in five children do not drink water easily wic children were more likely to drink juice daily than children not on wic ninetythree percent of children drink milk daily about onequarter of all children had drunk seven or more sugarsweetened beverages in the previous week these are without the ability to have nutritious meals this is in my own state of texas which indicates that food does not matter in terms of how wealthy a state may be so i cant imagine why as my colleagues have said we cant find 3 billion from the 10 billion a month that is being spent in afghanistan and the moneys that have been stolen in iraq where we dont even know where it is it is all about priorities so i rise today to express great consternation over the cut in wic and to indicate that wic is about growing it is about providing nutrition so that children can think so that they can be able to be strong leaders it is to grow children healthy it is to stop disease it is to provide the kind of immune system that thwarts disease in a state like texas the 18th congressional district which i represent has a strong work ethic i am so proud of them but they also have a rate of poverty that is frightening food insecurity in my district ranks number 32 in the nation that means that there are only 31 districts ahead that have that degree of food insecurity and yet i am going to have to go home and tell them that the priorities of this congress were something other than feeding children and providing mothers prenatal and prenatal condition and after birth the kind of resources to provide for a healthy child that means my prek little babies will be going to school hungry that means they will come home to a nondinner and that means that we as a country have failed in our natural value that we all are created equal with certain inalienable rights of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness it is shocking to be able to stand here today and know they are cutting medicare and medicaid and now they add insult to injury that they are cutting food stamps and the wic program so i guess our soldiers who themselves young soldiers young families on food stamps will suffer as well but the wic program that has gotten blamed for everything but what is right and that is the women infants and children program provides nutrition for healthy children and to stand here today to have to look americans in the face and those in the 18th congressional district who are 32nd in food insecurity and say that we do not have the money i am asking my colleagues to go back to the drawing board dont put this bill on the floor take it off because you are now handing to the children of this nation a ticket that says no food at

illness or injury we have a longterm care crisis in this country according to secretary sebelius an estimated 15 million americans will need some kind of longterm care and fewer than 3 percent have a longterm care policy because medicare and other existing programs do not cover these services we must work together to find a solution as my republican friends know however the class program as enacted will not be implemented secretary sebelius informed congress last october that she did not see a viable path forward for class implementation at this time in other words this legislation we are debating today is not needed instead of legislation to create jobs and grow our economy our republican friends are focused on repealing a program that has already been suspended i want to encourage my friends on the other side of the aisle to take a step back and focus on the things we could be doing together to make longterm care more affordable and accessible i have encountered in my own life the issue of providing longterm care my dear sweet mother before she passed away last summer received longterm care services for years and i will always remember the warmth and affection her caregivers showed her and my family day in and day out what we should be doing today is ensuring that the hardworking men and women who provide care for our seniors in their own homes earn a living wage because these jobs are the jobs that make a difference and that bring happiness to those who need their help the most with robust job growth predicted in the health care sector over the next decade it is imperative that we support longterm care services and those who provide those services this is a winwin for the american economy not only do longterm care services provide jobs but we know if our seniors can be taken care of in their own homes it can save americans money in the long run i fear however that this legislation is meant as a step towards dismantling the health care

reallytheyre taking america for a ride and we have to cut medicare their health care is too good and grandma and grandpa they didnt do enough for america so the democrats we turn around and say hey how about looking at it this way how about before you go after grandma and her medicare card and how about you say to warren buffet hey how about not taking those extra tax breaks and the republicans say we cant take away any tax breaks from warren buffet and all of the other multimultimillionaires and billionaires because theyve contributed so much to america we dont want to touch their money even though that would give us hundreds of billions of dollars and then we say to them well how about prescription drugs how about we negotiate the price for prescription drugs for medicare the way we do with the va that would save about a quarter of a trillion dollars over a 10year period they say that would be unfair to the drug companies we cant touch them either then we say to them well you know the war in iraq the war in afghanistan its winding down now maybe we could look into the defense budget and save a few billion dollars there before we ask grandma to sacrifice on the health care that she gets from medicare and the republicans say we cant do that either we cant look at any cuts in the defense budget that would be much too hard on those defense contractors so then we say to them how about the oil industry at least the oil industry the 40 billion in tax breaks which theyre going to get over the next 10 years i mean does anyone in america really believe that they need tax breaks in order to have an incentive to go out and drill for oil when people are paying 3 3 50 4 a gallon at the pump but the republicans say no you cant touch the oil companies either youve got to give big tax breaks to the oil industry as well even as theyre tipping grandma and grandpa upside down at the pump when theyre coming in to put in their unleaded 4 a gallon gasolineselfserve by the wayat the pump so what do they do instead what they do is they put an oil rig on top of the medicare card so that the oil industry can drill into grandmas medicare and pull out the funding in order to provide the tax breaks for big oil for warren buffet for the prescription drug industry for the wars in iraq and afghanistan its all off of grandma shes the one weve targeted the person responsible for all of the wasteful spending in the united states its all grandmas fault lets cut medicare she didnt do enough to build our country through the 1930s the 1940s the 1950s and the 1960s its all on grandma so this drill rig that they are building into the pocketbooks of grandma in order to find that funding thats what their plan is all about its an oil pipeline into the pocketbooks of the seniors they want to cut checkups for grandma while they cut checks for the oil companies they want to cut health care to grandma and give wealth care to big oil companies and to billionaires and to prescription drug companies their plan is big tax breaks for big oil and tough breaks for grandma and for the seniors in our country and the ceo of chevron he says its unamerican to think about increasing taxes on the oil industry you know what i say to him its unbelievable that you could make that argument but even more unbelievable that the republican party would accept that argument and cut medicare for grandma to privatize it to hand it over to the insurance industry to increase the cost by 6 000 per year for their costs even as they say to warren buffet the oil companies the big drug companies the arms contractors dont worry were going to protect your programs its just grandma thats on the cutting block so ladies and gentlemen this is a debate of historical dimensions and until the republicans come forward with a planwhich they dont have in order to make medicare solventby raising the revenues out of these other areas from millionaires from the oil industry and from others do not expect us to say to grandma its her fault its not her fault she built this country she deserves this benefit and we should not be cutting it this republican plan to end medicare is just

philosophy described as keynesian and ive heard talk of fiscal conservatism and regulation and rugged individualism we even heard talk of lebron james but one thing is really true we havent heard anyone on the other side of the aisle talk about hunger and even lebron james is not hungry so i want to talk about a really simple economic theory and its called hunger it means when you wake up in the morning and youre a young child in this country and your parents cant afford to feed you youre hungry the demand of hunger when youre going to school and you cant think through the school day because youre hungry its about going home on a weekend after receiving a school lunch on a friday but not eating through the entire weekend because youre hungry and really mr chair thats the only economic theory we need to discuss this afternoon so just before i came to the floor earlier in the day i had a physical i had to go 10 hours without eating i described myself as starving but clearly neither i nor any member of this house of representatives knows what its like to be really hungry today and so before i came to the floor i had my piece of chicken and you know what that was more than the republicans are prepared to give americas women infants and children and so i rise today in opposition to these extreme cuts to the women infant and children program and the underlying bill we know the program is essential to providing nutrition to our nations most vulnerable children now i dont need a study to know what it means to be hungry but studies show that women infant and children programs reap tremendous benefits to the participants they lead to fewer premature births fewer fetal and infant deaths and result in better cognitive and physical health for children thats the difference between eating a nutritious meal and being hungry i also rise today in support of my colleague lynn woolseys amendment to block the gops attempts to roll back our usda nutrition standards for our children because not only are some of our children hungry but we need to make sure that they are eating to a standard that allows them to learn in our classrooms the wic program is essential to ensuring our youngest americans receive the nutrition they need and the underlying amendments will ensure that children continue to receive nutritious foods throughout their school day now when i first came to congress i worked with our thenchairwoman and our friend rosa delauro to secure the afterschool supper program in my home state of maryland for hungry children we have fed millions of meals through this program and so i know that in my state and all across the country the women infant and children program served 140 000 women infants and children every month in the last year the program serves 9 2 million lowincome families across the country and as our nation continues to recover from a recession the benefits provided to these families are an essential safety net for our vulnerable populations and according to feeding america theres a 50 percent increase in need amongst families seniors and children right now this is a time when ensuring the economic security of the american people is critical and we cant stand by the republican pledge to cut essential safety net programs its no surprise to the american people that the republican conference selected yet another vulnerable group to slash while continuing to support big oil companies farm subsidies and huge tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires instead of supporting women infants and children in this 112th congress this new and bold republican majority began with an attack on women they proceeded to attack our seniors with a plan to eradicate medicare and now they are committed to an attack on our neediest and the health of our neediest infants and children its actually really shameful its even hard to talk about because its hard to believe in america that even those who sit on the other side of the aisle are willing to take away nutrition programs for needy women infants and children rather than take away the tax breaks for billionaires and take away the subsidies for oil companies while our gas prices rise i think that those on the other side of the aisle should be absolutely ashamed of themselves i know that some of my colleagues have quoted bible passages i dont know maybe quote

on the house natural resources committee which has jurisdiction over the various insular territories of the united states i wish to call the attention of my colleagues to the adverse impact of this bill on the 4 1 million americans who live on the five unitedstates territoriespuerto rico the virgin islands guam american samoa and the northern marianas islands of all the cuts being proposed by this bill today perhaps none is as cynical thoughtless and irresponsible as the republican proposal to repeal section 1204 of the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 which finally mitigated the profoundly unjust treatment that these americans in the five unitedstates territories have always been subject to under the medicaid program if this proposal is enacted it would cut total federal funding for medicaid in the territories by 65 over the next decadea crippling blow that would devastate the territories medicaid programs and drastically restrict the ability of millions of americans to receive care the territories medicaid programs are already vastly underfunded by law they are supposed to receive a 50 federal funding match but they get nowhere near it unlike the 50 states and the district of columbia the amount that the federal government can contribute to their medicaid programs is capped and so puerto rico for example receives less than a 20 match the 50 states and the district of columbia on the other hand receive up to an 80 match even the wealthiest stateswhich receive the lowest match ratesget 50 if the federal match for each of the territories was calculated the same way they are calculated for the states each of the territories would have federal medical assistance percentages fmap in the 75 to 83 range based on their poverty levels the results of this chronic underfunding by the federal government are both devastating and predictable too many patients in the territories receive inadequate care and too many providers in the territories are not adequately compensated for their services because the treatment of the territories under medicaid was a travesty from both a moral and public policy perspective the affordable care act aca sought to partially redress this profound inequality it provided 6 3 billion in additional medicaid funding to the territories between the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 and fiscal year 2019 the territories have already begun to useand will continue to usethis new funding to increase the number of lowincome individuals that can receive medicaid coverage and to provide beneficiaries with essential health services prior to this funding increase the territory governments could not afford to provide many basic services or to cover many of their neediest residents under medicaid every penny of this money will be used h r 5652 cuts funding that would merely narrow the inequality gap between the states and the territories it still would not come close to eliminating it it is important to remember that residents of the territories are americans who if they are not receiving adequate health care can relocate to the states and become eligible for fullyfunded medicaid whenever they wish thus treating territory residents like secondclass citizens under medicaid is extraordinarily shortsighted it is also important to remember that residents of the territories serve in disproportionate numbers in the unitedstates military residents of the territories have made tens of thousands of deployments to iraq afghanistan and the horn of africa since 2001 and nearly 170 service members from the territories have lost their lives the republicans should explain to the hundreds of thousands of soldiers and veterans from the territories why they are american enough to defend our country in combat but somehow not american enough to receive a modicum of fair treatment under critical health care programs i urge my colleagues to vote against this meanspirited bill"]],

boots they will not do anything even though the american people by a more than 70 percent majority say people making more than 1 million a year should contribute to what the problems are in this country so that fell apart then we had the gang of 6 senatorsthree republicans three democratswho had been on the bowlessimpson commission who said we should do something about this they were in the press they had press conferences and this was going down the road and doing all kinds of great things while that was going on there was a decision made and a law was passed to create a supercommittee to which i appointed senator patty murray of washington to run no one in the senate democrat or republican has more respect than patty murray she worked so hard with the other 11 members of congress to come up with something a few days before they were to arrive at a decisionand the gang of 6 members are out here doing all this stuff all the timei get a letter signed by virtually every republican senator saying we are not going to raise revenue for anything the supercommittee didnt work there the gang of 6 is gone so we passed this last august to fund government for 2 years and to say if we dont arrive at another 1 2 trillion in deficit reduction during this year it automatically kicks in at the end of this year or the beginning of next year so that is where we are and the republicans in the house are trying to change that so that is what this little history lesson has been all about i dont like to sequester i wish we didnt have to do it it was a hard pill to swallow but it was the right thing to do if we are ever going to reduce the staggering deficit we are going to have to make some hard decisions so that is what this is all about but that is the point it is hard to do therefore we have to do it to sequesterwhich in effect would take almost 500 billion from domestic programs and almost 500 billion from defense programs they were designed to be tough enough to force two sides to reach a balanced deal it hasnt happened yet as i said earlier with general eisenhowers statement i didnt make that up that is what he said my complaint about the republicans being so unreasonable about everything is something where i am not a lone wolf crying in the wilderness we have two longtime nonpartisan watchers of congress one from the american enterprise institute which is a conservative think tank another from brookings institute that wrote an article saying it is the republicans cant you see what they are doing here is one thing they said we have been studying washington politics in congress for more than 40 years and never have we seen them this dysfunctional in our past writings we have criticized both parties when we believed it was warranted today however we have no choice but to acknowledge that the core of the problem lies with the republican party they further said the gop has become an insurgent outlier in american politics it is ideologically extreme of scornful compromise unmoved by conventional understanding of facts evidence and science and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition what brave men to do that to write these commentswhich are true i have been saying that i dont want to fight about everything republicans insist on balancing the budget on the backs of the middle class seniors students single mothers and those who could least afford it that is what they are doing over there today it is their refusal to compromise that leaves us facing the threat of sequester and it is difficult but it is balanced going back to the august budget agreement now in order to protect wealthy special interests is no solution neither is refighting the battles of last year democrats agree we must reduce our deficits and make hard choices but we believe in a balanced approach that shares the pain as well as the responsibility is the sequester the best way to achieve that balance no but republicans refuse to consider a more reasonable approachone for example that asks every american to pay his fair share while making difficult choices to reduce spending democrats will not agree to a onesided solution that lets the superwealthy off the hook while forcing the middle class and those in greatest need to bear all the hardship democrats believe we can protect americans access to health care create jobs while investing in the future and protect the poor and elderly but we cant do it alone it will take work and compromise and so far republicans have been unwilling to make a serious effort to achieve that result republicans have rejected our balanced approach their onesided solution to acrosstheboard cuts would take away from the many to give to the few here is what the plan would donot all of it but here is what their plan would do remember they are taking it up over there in the house today it would cut medicaid benefits increasing the number of uninsured children parents seniorsand that is in addition to people with disabilitiesby hundreds of thousands just eliminate them it would also put seniors in nursing homes at risk some of them would have to move out of the nursing home i guess it would punish americans who receive tax credits to purchase health insurance when their financial circumstances change causing 350 000 americans to have no coverage this would add to the tens of millions who already exist that way it would weaken wall street reforms protecting big banks at the expense of consumers their legislation would once again target middleclass workers food inspectors air traffic controllers border patrol agents drug enforcement and fbi agents they would have to be laid off it would cut funding for preventive health care programs that fight chronic illnessessuch as heart disease cancer strokes and diabetesthat cause 70 percent of the deaths in america preventive care would be reined in it would slash block grant funding in the united states to help 23 million children seniors and disabled americans live independently and out of poverty no segment of the population is immune from this painful absurd republican planexcept maybe millionaires billionaires and wealthy corporations the republican proposal cuts meals on wheels and reduces food assistance for almost 2 million needy people one of the republican candidates running for president said president obama is the food stamp president there are more poor people our economy has been in bad shape people are struggling the millionaires are doing fine and in addition to what i have already mentioned this thing that they are taking up in the house today cuts off almost 300 000 children from free school lunches at a time when one in five children lives in poverty the unitedstates conference of catholic bishops said the republican plan fails a basic moral test this budget sets very clear priorities the problem is what they are taking up in the house sets up the wrong priorities president franklin roosevelt said human kindness has never weakened the stamina or softened the fiber of a free people a nation does not have to be cruel to be tough so republicans would do well to remember our

thank the gentleman the question we are facing today is should we leave afghanistan i think the answer is very clear and its not complicated of course we should as soon as we can this suggests that we can leave by the end of the year if we dont well be there for another decade would be my prediction the american people are now with us a group of us here in the congress a bipartisan group for nearly a decade have been talking about this arguing not to expand the war not to be over there not to be in nation building and the american people didnt pay much attention now they are the large majority of the american people now say its time to get out of afghanistan its a fruitless venture too much has been lost the chance of winning since we dont even know what we are going to win doesnt exist so they are tired of it financially theres a good reason to come home as well some argue we have to be there because if we leave under these circumstances well lose face it will look embarrassing to leave so how many more men and women have to die how many more dollars have to be spent to save face that is one of the worst arguments possible we are not there under legal conditions this is a war who says it isnt a war everybody talks about the afghan war was the war declared of course not it wasnt declared there was a resolution passed that said that the president at that time under the emergency of 9 11 could go and deal with al qaeda those who brought upon the 9 11 bombings but al qaeda is not there anymore so we are fighting the taliban the taliban used to be our allies at one time when the soviets were there the talibans main goal is to keep the foreign occupation out they want foreigners out of their country they are not al qaeda yet most americansmaybe less so now but the argument here on the floor is we have got to go after al qaeda this is not a war against al qaeda if anything it gives the incentive for al qaeda to grow in numbers rather than dealing with them the money issue we are talking about a lot of money how much do we spend a year probably about 130 billion up to 1 trillion now in this past decade later on in the day we are going to have two votes we are going to have a vote on doing something sensible making sense out of our foreign policy bringing our troops home and saving hundreds of billions of dollars then we also will have a vote against npr to cut the funding of npr there is a serious question about whether that will even cut one penny but at least the fiscal conservatives are going to be overwhelmingly in support of slashing npr and then go home and brag about how they are such great fiscal conservatives and the very most they might save is 10 million and thats their claim to fame for slashing the budget at the same time they wont consider for a minute cutting a real significant amount of money all empires end for fiscal reasons because they spread themselves too far around the world and thats what we are facing we are in the midst of a military conflict that is contributing to this inevitable crisis and its financial and you would think there would be a message there how did the soviets come down by doing the very same thing that were doing perpetual occupation of a country we dont need to be occupying afghanistan or any other country we dont even need to be considering going into libya or anywhere else fortunately i guess for those of us who would like to see less of this killing we will have to quit because we wont be able to afford it the process that we are going through is following the war powers resolution this is a proper procedure it calls attention to how we slip into these wars i have always claimed that its the way we get into the wars that is the problem if we would be precise and only go to war with a declaration of war with the people behind us knowing who the enemy is and fight win and get it over with that would be more legitimate they dont do it now because the

inspectors is redundant performed by employees of other agencies such as the department of transportation osha or epa and on and on what they do is ultimately slow down commerce on our nations rails and highways since 2008 tsa has more than doubled the size of the transportation inspection workforce and quadrupled the programs budget yet according to the majority of stakeholders we heard from there has been almost no tangible improvement in security as a result of these investments last year tsas entire surface transportation security budget was 126 million of this amount surface inspectors cost taxpayers 54 million which does not even include headquarters administration oversight and staff associated with the program this means that the surface transportation inspection

than tombstone all the way to the border and douglas arizona which is in the corner the southwestern corner of arizona and next to new mexico and along that portion of the southern border of the united states visiting primarily with the people that were in charge of border security the border patrol and the ranchers who live along the border let me talk about the ranchers first one of those ranchers mr krentz a year ago was murdered on his ranch apparently by illegals coming into the united states he was gunned down and killed the culprits that committed that crime by the way have not been brought to justice i met with other ranchers in the entire region and just asked them the question tell me what its like to live on the border of the united states and mexico as a ranch owner and they went on forever and forever and told me things that i was just really somewhat surprised about how they feel like the border is wide open that people cross across their ranches people come in they destroy their property they destroy their water lines all of this costs money to the ranchers and of course they have to be the ones that pick up the bill for the destruction on their property and they dont feel safe about the people that cross into the united states across their land they feel like the federal government has really not protected them and their rights and seems to neglect them even though the border patrol who i also met with i believe is doing as good a job as they possibly can do i want to make that clear the border patrol is doing as good a job as they can do as we will let them do as a nation and they are trying to protect the border the best that they possibly can and so i talked to both groups but in reality the people who live there are very concerned about their own safety and the consequences they have to pay for people illegally coming into the united states i heard something that was kind of surprising to me when illegals not all but when some come into the united states and they are captured by border patrol some of them ask the question are they in the 9th court or the 10th court and i said what are they talking about the 9th court or the 10th court well what theyre talking about is the 9th circuit court of appeals or the 10th circuit court of appeals you see the ninth circuit court of appeals that is a federal appellate court has

which would be in arizona or the 10th circuit court of which the jurisdiction is new mexico and the reason for that in my opinion those two courts have different reputations about enforcing the rule of law on the border and of course those that cross into the united states hope if they are caught the 9th circuit court of appeals would eventually have jurisdiction over their case when in their perception its a much more friendly court to folks who cross in illegally than the 10th circuit so i thought that was somewhat interesting they are also given when they come into the united states if captured their property some of them you will find a whole list of things and places they can go the churches that give them sanctuary places that they can go for medical help and they are given in a very organized way what they can do when they come into the united states that is provided in some cases by the coyotes that make money off those immigrants who come into the united states because immigrants have to pay the coyote money and sometimes the coyotes and the drug cartels all work together because you see drugs and people are going north and money and guns are going south because you see mexico doesnt protect its border any better than the united states does but in any event while i was down there in the corner of arizona i learned firsthand about the seriousness to the ranchers the people who live on the land their concerns about the fact that they believe that the border is not secure in reality they have to worry about their own safety on a daily basis after visiting a corner of the southeastern corner of arizona we moved and traveled across interstate 10 to interstate 8 over here to san luis arizona so that travels goes up to san luis across interstate 10 interstate 10 turns into interstate 8 comes all the way across arizona into california goes into yuma arizona and i went down here into the southwestern corner of the state of new mexico to also see what that border was like now coming across interstate 8 right here interstate 8 we pulled off the side of the road to the sonora national reserve and that is a national reserve that the federal government controls because i wanted to see the sonora national reserve interestingly enough you get about a quarter of a mile almost a halfmile off of interstate 8 right up here by the sonora desert and you come across this sign this sign is facing toward mexico so interstate 8 would be to this direction and mexico would be behind the sign how far behind the sign its 80 miles to the mexican border and here is a big sign that says traveling caution smuggling and illegal immigration may be encountered in this area so it seems to me that the federal governments answer to border security is to warn people that it is a smuggling and illegal immigration area once again this sign is not on the border this sign is 80 miles this side of the border so what is the government saying are they just ceding that entire portion of arizona to the drug cartels saying its a smuggling area and that you need to take care of yourself because we cant protect you i dont know but i was somewhat surprised to see that our federal governments answer to border security was to erect this sign and other signs that are similar to it i dont believe of course thats the answer to border security you wouldnt need these signs if the border were secure in reality not in just political statements that seem to be made by different individuals the texas department of public safety has issued some statistics regarding crossborder crime i have already mentioned about how the 34 5 percent of the people in local county jails on the border are foreign nationals but just since 2010 january 2010 the texas department of public safety has identified 22 murders 24 assaults 15 shootings and 5 kidnappings among other crimes directly related to spillover violence from mexico now sometimes we hear this comment well the violence in mexico isnt coming to the united states the question is is the crime from mexico coming into the united states we have already shown that that is occurring because 34 percent of the people in those local jails are committing crimes and theyre foreign nationals but also the violence is coming into the united states because of the statistics that i just gave you and now we learn of another phenomenon that is taking place you dont hear much about it because the victims of these crimes dont say much about it people who live in border towns the populous border towns in the united states periodically would get somebody who would come to their front door or they would get an email or a text from someone who says we know your cousin who lives in mexico and unless you pay us so much protection money your cousin in mexico is going to disappear something to that effect so we hear reports of that extortion on the american side of the border this is primarily among hispanic americans and what do they do well they may or may not report it what they i think generally do is pay the extortion because they want their relative in mexico on the other side of the border to be safe so we have that extortion racket taking place if the border were secure that certainly would not have occurred so it concerns me that we have that crime on the american side going back to the southern border of arizona i was asking the border patrol which was very gracious and explained a lot of their operations to me how do they bring drugs into the united states and they said every way they can bring them into the united states one of the ways that they are using now is the concept of ultralights an ultralight for lack of a better description is a kite that has a motor on it one person can fly that at very low altitude and they bring in 200 or 300 pounds of drugs into the united states they never land the ultralight into the unitedstates they just fly across from mexico into arizona and they drop their load 200 300 pounds of drugs and then they fly back to mexico then there is someone at a rendezvous point who picks up those drugs i say that because the drug cartels are using every means necessary to exploit the open borders and do everything they can to make sure that they bring in those drugs and they will continue to do so the border patrol is the agency that we have to protect the border of the united states like i said i think they are doing as good a job as we will let them do but primarily the border patrol patrols the border up to 2535 miles inside the united states that is their duty that is their jurisdiction the place that they are supposed to protect the unitedstates past that 35 miles or so they dont patrol that that is somebody elses responsibility now of course the bad guys know that is the duty of the border patrol to patrol that section of the border so when people are smuggled into the united states when drugs are smuggled into the united states the goal is to get past the border patrol demarcation line because once you do that you are pretty much in my opinion home free to get into the united states with people or drugs so that is the area of their primary concern and it is certainly the area of the jurisdiction that they are trying to patrol the best they can i have asked the border patrol tell me how you do this and i think they use as many different means as they can to patrol the border they will have vehicles go up and down the border they will have border patrol agents behind the border they will have some use of the national guard behind the border with the use of electronic equipment to view what takes place on the border so they use the equipment that they can but they obviously dont have enough border patrol agents to be directly on the border so they have some on the border and some behind the border monitoring the activity of the people coming into the united states and then they try to catch those that they can when i was visiting with one of the border patrol agents this is a photograph of one of their vehicles it is a typical border patrol vehicle that patrols near the border of the united states and mexico now you notice that this vehicle has steel mesh on the windshield and on the side windows it has steel mesh even above the lights the red lights on top so i asked the border patrol agent that drives this vehicle explain to me the steel enclosure you have on your vehicle he said here is what happens we will drive close to the border as we drive close to the border there are people on the other side of the border who when they see us start throwing rocks at us they throw them over the fence if we dont have this protectionand they are not little bitty pebbles these are rocksthey throw them over the fence and break the windshield the border patrol agents are injured they do that for various reasons one of those reasons is a diversion they will try to divert the attention of a border patrol agent at one location so that other folks illegally can sneak into the united states now we dont hear much about assaults on border patrol agents unless somebody is murdered which has occurred but in the last couple of years assaults on border patrol agents by people illegally coming into the united states is about 1 000 a year a thousand assaults on border patrol agents a year in the last couple of years and they are by every means necessary including the rock throwers who try to injure border patrol agents so you can see the relentlessness of some people who want to come into the united states they violate the law of course by coming here illegally and they will continue to violate the law and take on our border patrol agents even by assaulting them so they can sneak into the united states so it seems to me maybe we need to refocus on the primary mission of the federal government and its responsibility the federal government does have the responsibility under the constitution to protect the american people and the united states government should do that now the united states protects the borders of other nations we protect the border of afghanistan with pakistan we are protecting the korean border between the two koreas we protect the borders of other nations and we use our military to do it why dont we have the same resolve to protect the american border both borders the southern border and the northern border because in my opinion we dont have the moral will to do so we should make sure that we understand that people and other people should understand you dont come to the united states without permission it is the rule of law you dont come to the united states without permission now we have to solve that immigration issue that is a different issue but you cant solve that issue until you solve the issue of people illegally coming into the united states you know we are getting everybody we are getting the good the bad and the ugly and right now were getting a lot of bad and ugly crossing into the united states so the rule of law must be enforced by the federal government that is their duty now many of us do not believe the federal government has secured the border obviously people in arizona feel that way because they have passed legislation to try to protect their own state using state law enforcement of course the federal governments answer to that was rather than help arizona sue arizona take them to court you know its kind of like this sign their answer to border security is erect a few signs and sue states that try to protect themselves why dont we deal in reality and make sure that the border is secure and make sure that it is an area that is safe on both sides by securing our side we can protect the mexican side as well of course we need to work with the mexican government to do so they are our neighbors to the south while the united states now has decided to go into libya and spend 100 million or 200 million a week i dont know by bombing that country maybe we should come back home and focus on national security in the united states and spend that money on border security and securing the united states at the border because it is not secure in spite of what the secretary of homeland security has said border patrol it seems to me should have the mission to secure the border i will say again they are doing as good a job as we will let them do but they cannot stop people from coming into the united states although they are trying to when they had those vehicles going up and down in front of the border that keeps people from coming across we have fences in some appropriate areas we dont have fences everywhere but we have some fencing also the border patrol knows they cannot stop people from crossing so they try to catch them if you can that is the phrase that i think is our policy catch them if you can in other words they cross into the united states we see them we try to catch them but once we catch them they become our problem and then we have to send them through the entire legal process as we should but they are our problem they become our medical problem they become our prison problem if they go to prison if they have committed a felony then we have to deal with them and we have to try to get them back to the country they belong to in spite of those countries that refuse to take back criminal aliens so it is catch them if you can why dont we rethink that and prevent people from crossing into the united states if our policy was border security not behind the border security but have security on the border then people coming up to the border cant get across why because there are more boots on the ground and i think we should use whatever we have available we certainly should use the border patrol but also maybe we should use the national guard we have a few national guard troops that are down on the border although they are being relieved and their primary purpose is not to be on the border but behind the border looking at cameras watching folks cross now that is great to watch people cross but when they cross and they come into the united states once again they become our problem once they have crossed and we catch them if you can and send them back home if we can so it would seem to me to be a better use of the national guard to put them on the border i have introduced legislation to put 10 000 national guard troops on the 1 957mile border between the united states and mexico and put them on the border to not allow people to cross into the united states it is the federal governments responsibility of national security to protect the people so the federal government should pay for that and get the money out of the department of defense or somewhere reappropriate money to have the national guard paid for but put them under the supervision of the four state governors so that the governors can control their own border and protect them from entering the united states unlawfully no matter who it is i do not believe that we can say our border is secure when the government accountability office by their own statistics say that only 15 percent of the border is airtight that doesnt seem like a winning percentage to me and when they say under the best circumstances 44 percent partially secure what does that mean well it is sort of secure but sort of not but when you have 56 percent of the border is wide open spaces for anybody that wants to come back and forth that is not protecting the dignity and the sovereignty of the united states so it is long past time we quit talking about border security and actually secure the border from people coming into the united states without permission everyone and to say that the crime doesnt occur in the united states well it does not just to mention the border county jails that i mentioned the 27 percent that are in federal penitentiaries that are foreign nationals that are illegally in the united states but all of the drugs that are sold throughout the united states those are all criminal gangs primarily that are working with the drug cartels in mexico and colombia selling those drugs so the crime affects the united states the insecurity of the border is something that all of us pay for we pay for it in every way possible whether its with health care whether its with education we pay for it in the criminal justice system americans pay and legal immigrants pay the united states has the greatest the most liberal immigration policy in the world we let more people into our country legally every year than does any other country on its own so we have to fix that immigration issue but we have to secure the border first because when all is said and done so far more has been said and less has been done i urge my fellow members of the house of representatives that we come back home that we come back to the united states that we think about the security or insecurity of our borders and that we make sure that the federal government under the constitution fulfills its first obligationto protect americans

support of this effort to take action to help livestock producers who are being devastated by the drought livestock farmers in the sixth district of virginia have been hit hard by the heat and the derecho that swept through the shenandoah valley last month this disaster relief was included in the 2008 farm bill but unfortunately did not last the full length of the farm bill i am pleased that the congress has found a way to provide relief for these livestock farmers and not only do we provide the relief but we pay for it and not only do we pay for it but we also achieve additional savings that are applied to the deficit if every bill passed by the congress reduced spending overall we would be in much better fiscal condition in the federal government while the congress is taking an important first step in providing relief for droughtstricken livestock farmers the administration has at hand a tool that they should use right now to provide drought relief as well the obama administration has at its disposal an easy relief valve that would provide drought relief if only temporarilya reduction in the governmentmandated renewable fuel standard i have long been a critic of the rfs that has increased food and feed stocks being diverted into fuel leading to diminished supplies for livestock and food producers in fact last year 40 percent of the unitedstates corn crop was used for ethanol production there is no doubt that this policy has driven up the price of corn which today is hovering around 8 a bushel this in turn drives up the cost of food unfortunately because of the drought we no longer have the luxury of being just worried about the price this drought is so devastating that we have to be increasingly worried we do not have a large enough corn supply to meet all of our competing demands as we confront the reality of the tightening corn supplies there are real concerns about having enough to satisfy the rfs and the needs of our food producers we should not be in a position where we are choosing between fuel and food in fact the government has chosen theyve chosen fuel over food with a policy that mandates a certain amount of corn production going to ethanol production each year as the drought further shrinks the corn supply we are unfortunately also going to see livestock herds shrink this shrinking herd will affect consumers grocery bills resulting in consumers having to spend more in the grocery store rural communities that depend on livestock will be hit hard as producers affected by both the availability and high price of corn are being forced to limit their production or are being squeezed out of business the law allows the administrator of the epa to reduce the required volume of renewable fuels in any year based on severe harm to the economy or environment of a state a region or the united states or in the event of inadequate domestic supply of renewable fuel this drought and the shrinking corn crop are causing severe economic harm in the countryside and on grocery store shelves the administrator of the epa has already received a petition to waive the rfs for a year today over 150 bipartisan members from coast to coast joined in calling for administrator jackson to waive the rfs the congress is acting today to help drought stricken livestock farmers but now the obama administration must act to use their authority to help these same farmers this relief is not only desperately needed but i believe is required by the law i urge all members to join today in supporting this bill to help provide much needed drought relief and i urge the administration to join the congress in acting to provide drought relief by waiving the rfs i urge my colleagues to support this legislation it is a first start

lived with those experiences with all of those constituents there are a couple of things that must be said today the chairwoman of the ntsb the national transportation safety board said in their final report our investigation revealed that for years the operator exploited weaknesses in a lax system of oversight we also identified regulators that placed a blind trust in the companies that they were charged with overseeing to the detriment of public safety as a result of their report they made 30 safety recommendations many of them identified as urgent to address issues in recordkeeping information sharing and pipeline testing the ntsb report said it highlighted the fact that the problem has been underregulation not overregulation of the pipeline industry for too long the pipeline operators have essentially written the rules for their industry well this bill takes a very important step forward in improving pipeline safety regulation and i endorse it but there is more that must be done and ironically now in california because of this horrific accident the residents in california will have better safeguards than any other state in this country because of actions taken by the state legislature and the california public utilities commission that will require moving forward that automatic and remote shutoff valves be placed in highconsequence areas and in seismic areas not just on new pipeline and not just on new pipeline that they find economically feasible to place these automatic and remote shutoff valves this is a key component that was not included in the legislation and i must tell you when you saw that ball of fire raging for 90 minutes an hour and a half before they were able to turn off the gas that is something that has to be addressed on a
