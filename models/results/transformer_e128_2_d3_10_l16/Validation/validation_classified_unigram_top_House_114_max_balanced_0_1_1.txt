hollen is right i have served on the judiciary committee it is there that we deal with the problems particularly on the crime subcommittee at the end of someones detour in life do you know what mr chairman those detours in life that wind up with 75 000 persons in the federal prison system on mandatory minimums has been because people cannot read do not have opportunities and do not have jobs i want to invest in a budget that lifts the boats of all people if you work hard you get a home if you work hard you can send your kids to school if you work hard you can retire that is the budget i want to support not this nosuccess budget that is being proposed by our republican friends i ask my colleagues to support the alternative budget along with the cpc and the cbc budget mr chair i rise in strong opposition to h con res 27 the house republicans budget resolution for fiscal year 2016 because it continues the reckless and irresponsible approach to fiscal policy that the house majority has championed for years with disastrous results mr chair the budgeteers on the majority side have a very poor track record when it comes to economic forecasts and projections for years they have based their entire legislative agenda and strategy on their belief that the affordable care act or obamacare would be a failure the wish was father to the thought but they were wrong because of obamacare more than 16 4 million americans now know the peace of mind that comes from affordable quality health insurance that is there when you need it house republicans oppose increasing the minimum wage claiming that it costs jobs wrong again every increase in the minimum wage has been accompanied by an expanding economy especially during the clinton administration house republicans opposing comprehensive immigration reform claim that it will lead to lower incomes and lost jobs wrong again studies conducted by groups as far apart as the chamber of commerce and the aflcio consistently show that comprehensive immigration reform will grow the gross domestic product by 1 5 trillion over 10 years given this sorry track record of economic forecasting i strongly oppose the republican budget because it favors the wealthy over middle class families and those struggling to enter or remain in the middle class i oppose this republican budget because it asks major sacrifices of seniors who can barely make ends meet and fundamentally alters the social contract by turning medicaid and snap programs into a block grant and medicare into a voucher i cannot and will not support a resolution that attempts to balance the budget on the backs of working families seniors children the poor or mortgages the future by failing to make the investments needed to sustain economic growth and opportunity for all americans mr chair the gop work harder get less budget squeezes hardworking americans by making it 1 harder to buy a home by keeping their paychecks stagnant 2 harder to send your kids to college by cutting student loans and 3 harder to enjoy a secure retirement by privatizing medicare if the house republicans work harder to get less budget were adopted here is a sample of the pain and misery that will be visited on middleclass and working families 1 an end to higher education tax credits 2 an end to needed increases in the child tax credit 3 the loss of access to tax credits for affordable health care for millions of americans and 4 a reduction in tax rates for the wealthy yielding an average tax cut of 200 000 for millionaires financed by a 2 000 tax increase on the typical middle class family mr chair this price is not right budget will make it harder to middle and working class parents to send their kids to college by 1 ending higher education tax credits and 2 cutting student loan programs and pell grants making college less affordable and adding to the already huge levels of student debt the damage caused by the republican budget is not limited to working families and students there are also lumps of coal for seniors who have earned and deserve a secure retirement 1 the medicare guarantee is turned into a voucher program with increased costs for seniors 2 seniors who have worked hard for a financially secure retirement will immediately have to pay new copays for preventive care and much higher costs for prescription drugs the republican budget also disinvests in americas future 1 slashes the part of the budget we use to invest in our childrens education and 2 devastates our investments in scientific research and innovation mr chair the republican budget exacerbates the drag on the economy resulting from a crumbling infrastructure by cutting 187 billion or more than 19 percent from transportation funding over the coming decade and provides no solution to address the current shortfall in the federal transportation fund which means we can expect construction slowdowns beginning this summer mr chair compared to the presidents budget the republican budget would result this fiscal year in 35 000 fewer children in head start and up to 6 000 fewer special education teachers paraprofessionals and other related staff the republican budget also shortchanges americas future by cutting investments in scientific research and innovation in real terms by failing to lift the draconian sequester on domestic priorities as a result under the republican budget there would be 1 300 fewer medical research grants at national institutes h and 950 fewer competitive science research awards at the nsf affecting 11 600 researchers technicians and students finally mr chair the republican budget mistreats the poorest and most vulnerable persons in our country the republican work harder get less budget takes aim at millions of families with children struggling to make ends meet and put food on the table by converting the supplemental nutrition assistance program snap into a block grant beginning in 2021 and cutting funding steeplyby 125 billion 34 percent between 2021 and by 2025 these dramatic cuts could mean in 2021 through 2025 either cutting off assistance to 11 to 12 million eligible people each year or cutting benefits by almost 55 per person per month in contrast the democratic budget works for american families by giving them the tools to buy a home send their kids to college and enjoy a secure retirement mr chair the democratic budget represents a better way we democrats understand that we are all in this together and that our current economic situation calls for a balanced approach between increased revenues and responsible reduction in expenditures our plan will protect and strengthen our recovering economy reduce the deficit in a responsible way while continuing to invest in the things that make our country strong like education health care innovation and clean energy mr chair this republican budget is bad for america but it is disastrous for the people from my home state of texas who sent me here to advocate for their interests let me highlight a few examples 1 if the republican budget resolution were to become the basis of federal fiscal policy 3 435 336 texas seniors would be forced out of traditional medicare and into a voucher program under the republican plan to end medicare as we know it texas seniors will receive a voucher instead of guaranteed benefits under traditional medicare 2 for the 3 435 336 texans aged 4554 the value of their vouchers would be capped at growth levels that are lower than the projected increases in health care costs previous analyses showed that this type of plan would cut future spending by 5 900 per senior forcing them to spend more out of pocket and diminishing their access to quality care 3 additionally private insurance plans will aggressively pursue the healthiest least expensive enrollees thereby allowing medicarecurrently the lifeline for 3 187 332 texas seniorsto wither on the vine 4 if the republican budget resolution were to be adopted by congress 206 304 texas seniors would pay more for prescription drugs next year"], [0.0006391406059265137, 0.9993608593940735, 1, "the city of flint michigan has been hit by a crisis of massive proportion its impact on the longterm health and future success of its residents remains unclear the fact i find most disturbing is that it is a completely manmade crisis it grew out of the same kind of stubborn faith in austerity measures that has handicapped our ability to govern for years it grew out of a failure to protect the flint river from environmental damage it grew out of both a failure to invest in flints crumbling infrastructure and in the willful disregard for the people of that city a city in which more than 40 percent of the residents live below the poverty line and in which the majority of families are african american my colleagues and i are here on the floor this evening to urge every member of this body to understand one thing if we fail to acknowledge the issues that led to the flint water crisis we will see similar and equally devastating events in more and more cities across the country we need to recognize that tunnel vision for deficit reduction creates more problems than it solves the emergency manager appointed by governor snyder instituted a plan to run flint like a business in order to bring it back from the brink of death in the process he sought out the least expensive options for basic needs like water in doing so he decided to pull from the corrosive and contaminated flint river without ensuring the treatment protocol necessary to ensure the water was clean we now know that although the flint river is in poor shape a little additional spending could have prevented this crisis instead flint went the bare bones route leaving a generation of residents to suffer the permanent consequences congress has once more been so focused on reducing the deficit that we have lost sight of our responsibility to govern only a few months ago did we finally abandon the absurd policy of sequestration which has hampered the functioning of countless programs over the past several years the benefits of austerity and small government are questionable at best flint has proven that and we would all be wise to remember it unfortunately that is not the only lesson that we can take away from this crisis this congress has made undermining environmental and energy regulations one of its core missions in the first 100 days of the 114th congress it voted on more environmental and energy issues than on any other topic and not a single one was aimed at protecting resources like the flint river from the kind of contamination that allowed its water to corrode lead pipes if reducing the deficit has been the first priority for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle allowing corporations and big businesses to take whatever liberties with our environment they choose has to be a close second under the majority of this house our babies would choke on smog before we limit the amount of pollution a single smokestack can spew out our streams and rivers would poison even the fish swimming in them before we would set restrictions on where these companies can dump their chemical byproducts our forests and farmlands would turn barren before we would question the longterm impact of fracking it took years to turn the flint river into the downright dangerous water source that has caused so many problems but for other rivers lakes or streams there may still be time to repair or prevent the damage that we have done flint should move us to strengthen not weaken our environmental protections there is one more lesson to learn here and it is perhaps the most important the infrastructure in flint like in so many other cities is outdated and no one at the local state or federal level seems willing or capable of making the necessary investments today in our oversight and government reform committee hearing one of the topics of concern was that even if individual homes had replaced their old lead pipes the citys pipes would still have caused a major problem that is a matter of infrastructure at the most basic level in my home state of new jersey we spent more than a decade leading the way in the battle against lead poisoning but with the onset of governor christies administration all these advances have also come to an abrupt halt there there are now 11 cities with levels of lead higher than what has been reported in flint right in my state of new jersey this contamination from lead comes from paint instead of water nonetheless it is a reflection of the reduction and diminution of services and resources to make our environment safe for our communities two of these cities are right in my district still governor christies administration has ignored the problem and thoroughly failed our children by choosing not to fund our states lead abatement fund here at the federal level we can take this even further our failure to invest in transportation and energy infrastructure is building up to a crisis of a different kind a time when our roads our bridges and our power grids begin to fail there are so many lessons we need to learn from flint i have a number of colleagues who are here with me this evening who have raised their voices in support of the people of flint and who i know agree with me that this must be a watershed moment we need to change course to prevent this from happening again and ensure the future of our nation before i turn this over i want to take a moment to add that there are a number of organizations coalitions and other associations that consistently are dedicated to protecting our natural resources they defend the clean water act and they fight for the clean air act i hope to see more of them fighting for flint in the near future i yield to the gentleman from michigan who not only represents the district in which there is flint but he is a

thank you and congresswoman beatty for organizing this very important special order and for your tremendous leadership congressman jeffries and congresswoman beatty on ensuring public safety your leadership both congresswoman beatty and congressman jeffries has been bold it has been visionary not just as the result of the very recent tragedies but for many many years even before both of you came to congress so it is an honor serving with both of you in this body thank you very much for the opportunity to speak this evening also i want to just thank congresswoman robin kelly who is the vice chair on the gun violence task force she also chairs the cbcs health braintrust i thank you for your tireless work to ensure that gun violence is treated as a public health problem which it is i rise this evening with my colleagues in the congressional black caucus to call on congress to do somethingto do somethingabout the epidemic of gun violence that is harming our communities since the start of the yearjust 11 days agonine of my constituents have already become victims of gun violence including an elementary school teacher and an innocent mother pushing her child in a stroller just this weekend alone my community suffered three gun homicides my thoughts are with the victims family at this very terribly difficult time we have to do something enough is enough congress can and must do more to stop this senseless violence whether it is charleston oak creek sandy hook the streets of oakland or wherever too many people have already lost their lives too many families have buried loved ones and too many lives have been changed forever because of catastrophic injuries as a result of gun violence now is the time for action our constituents are demanding action the country is demanding action i have received hundreds of calls and emails from my constituents and i know other members are also hearing from their constituents they are calling for action as well earlier today in my own district oakland city council president lynette gibson mcelehany buried her grandson 17yearold torian hughes who was shot and killed during a robbery just days before christmas this has been a very difficult period for council member mcelehany and her family so in addition to our prayers not only for my council members family but for all of those in our country who have been victims of gun violence we must do something we must do something in all of their memory let me be clear congress can no longer ignore the massive toll that this epidemic is having on our constituents their families and communities last week we joined with our colleagues and millions of americans in applauding president obamas actions to reduce gun violence in our nation thanks to the presidents leadership there will be more background checks better enforcement of existing gun laws improved mental health services and new research on how to end this epidemic of gun violence but more action is needed to stop the more than 30 000 gun deaths that occur in our nation each and every year congress must pass commonsense gun reform like closing the gun show loophole bipartisan measures that are supported by the vast majority of americans and gun owners congress must also fund the expansion of mental health services but this should not be an excuse of course to do nothing on gun safety we have got to provide the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives the resources it needs to enforce our nations gun laws as a member of the appropriations committee i have fought along with my colleagues to get these vital public safety resources in the appropriations bills which keep our communities safe we must also end the extreme data restrictions that restrict law enforcements ability to protect public safety and prevent policymakers from addressing gun violence as a public health issue that is why i introduced last year h r 1449 the tiahrt restrictions repeal act which would repeal the data restrictions on gun sales and background checks these data restrictions are commonly called the tiahrt restrictions they prevent data on gun background checks from being released to the public these provisions currently impede public safety by requiring the national criminal background check system records to be destroyedmind you destroyedwithin 24 hours prohibiting the atf from requiring licensed dealers to conduct annual inventory checks to detect lost or stolen firearms and restricting local and state law enforcement from using trace data to fully investigate corrupt dealers and traffickers this is outrageous we have got to restrict and repeal these tiahrt amendments right away it will help tackle the bad apple gun dealers who provide dangerous weapons to criminals it is estimated that just 5 percent of sellers supply the weapons used in nearly 90 percent of gun crimes the tiahrt restrictions block access to vital data that lawmakers law enforcement and federal agencies need to tackle gun violence in our community of course many of us are proud to support congresswoman kellys bill which would allow the surgeon general to study gun violence as a public health issue and the consumer product safety commission to regulate firearms the time for action is now lets start listening to the american people and insist that congress do something it is really disingenuous to criticize the president for issuing commonsense gun safety measures when we have been trying for years in this bodyfor yearsto get these sensible bills passed the speaker should allow these and many other bills to come to the floor so that congress can act no more excuses we should support congressman thompsons proposal to establish the select committee on gun violence the speaker should do this now so we cant continue to really allow the misinformation to get out about congress we need to do our job we have been trying many of us the congressional black caucus and others especially democrats for many years to try to get the speaker to bring these bills to the floor so what did the president do he had to do something but no more excuses congress needs to act so

about puerto ricos debt crisis and how there must be a sense of urgency because without action bondholders will be paid but teachers cops and nurses wont i want to continue today and make two points number one lets not let bondholders bleed puerto rico at a discount number two lets work together on what unites us not what divides us because the only way we will make any progress is if the people of puerto rico come together to make a plan and demand that the congress of the united states work with puerto rico on puerto ricos plan without consistent and persistent pressure from puerto rico washington will do nothing as both the administration and the congress are content to let the bondholders on wall street call the tune we all know washington should start with h r 870 the bankruptcy bill it is simply a bill that will allow puerto rico to declare bankruptcy and restructure its debt within the unitedstates legal system this would allow an orderly and fair restructuring of the debt in a court of law it is an important step but will not solve all of puerto ricos problems what puerto rico should do right now is demand to know what wall street vulture capitalists are paying for the bonds we hear a report that the bonds are selling for 15 and 20 cents on the dollar yet the bond owners want a full dollars worth of interest i say puerto rico should pay interest based on the price the billionaires actually paid and that they should disclose this amount just as a congressman does in this congress every time we make an investment then puerto rico can service its debt based on what was paid to buy the debt i came here to protect people not the profits of billionaires on wall street secondly and most importantly for the time being we must set aside politics and get away from the smokescreen of the status issue in puerto rico whether puerto rico should be a state an independent nation or remain a commonwealth cannot be the priority right now before this congress if everyone leaves puerto ricoand they are leaving by 5 000 a monthit will not matter what kind of government is left behind nobody should use the current debt crisis as an opportunity to score political points for their party at a time when the people of puerto rico must be clear precise and unified the status issue divides puerto ricans i read in the new york times the argument of the resident commissioner of the statehood party that the only solution to puerto ricos problems is to make it a state really that is going to solve the debt crisis the power crisis the public employees pension gap crisis the medicare advantage budget crisis we should be working together to figure out how puerto rico is going to pay teachers and honor their pensions how we will make sure health care is delivered to all and bridges do not collapse a statehood bill is not going to provide housing create a job or heal a sick child when members of congress ask me about puerto rico they ask me which is it is it statehood do you want a bankruptcy bill do you want more medicaid we have to prioritize we have to be clear and put aside the status issue please we need to work together i would like to use my remaining minute to restate my call to action in spanish english translation of the statement made in spanish is as follows politics and divisions could destroy the chances of forcing washington to help resolve puerto ricos debt crisis puerto rico must have a common plan that has support across all of the parties and most importantly across the island the governor must find a way to work with the resident commissioner and the resident commissioner cannot view this crisis as a campaign tool for higher office puerto rico will only be helped by this congress if and when there is a consistent and persistent call on congress by puerto ricans to act and puerto ricans need to specify what they expect congress to do the bankruptcy bill is only part of it if we still have the jones act and the same economy and economic prospects as we have now we will not advance the people must tell wall street that puerto rico is not some store to be looted and that the puerto rican people will not sit and starve as wall street counts its profits if wall street is buying bonds at a discount they should be paid at a discount but most importantly we have to work together for the betterment of puerto rico and we cannot let political divisions over statehood divide us i commit to putting aside my own passionate feelings about puerto ricos status and working with other puerto ricans in the congress and other leaders in both parties who will help us but we must first come together begin helping ourselves and have a clear plan la politica y las divisiones podrian destruir las posibilidades de obligar a washington a ayudar a resolver la crisis de la deuda de puerto rico puerto rico debe de tener un plan comdin que cuente con el apoyo de todos los partidos y sobre todo a traves de la isla el gobernador debe encontrar una manera de trabajar con el comisionado residente y el comisionado residente no puede ver esta crisis como una herramienta en sus campanias para un puesto mis alto el congreso s6lo ayudari a puerto rico siempre y cuando haya un llamado constante y persistente de los puertorriquehos exigiendo que el congreso cumpla y los puertorriquehlos tienen que indicar lo que esperan de parte del congreso la legislaci6n de bancarrota es s6lo una parte pero si todavia tenemos la ley jones y la misma economia y perspectivas econ6micas que tenemos ahora no avanzaremos el pueblo debe decirle a wall street que puerto rico no es una tienda para ser pirateada y que el pueblo de puerto rico no esperari a morir de hambre mientras wall street cuenta sus ganancias si wall street esti comprando bonos con descuentos deben ser pagados con descuentos pero sobre todo tenemos que trabajar juntos por el bien de puerto rico y no podemos dejar que las divisiones politicas sobre la estadidad nos dividan me comprometo como siempre lo he hecho a poner a un lado mis propios sentimientos sobre el estatus de puerto rico y a trabajar con otros puertorriquefios en el congreso y

able to give life to why we are here representing all of america we have those special people that without our voices would not be able to be heard i simply want to add these words of the pope again to be able to remind everyone why these icons that we are speaking of tonight in the congressional black caucus46 of us along with senator bookerhave a vital role in this place as the pope indicated i would encourage you to keep in mind all those people around us who are trapped in the cycle of poverty they too need to be given hope the fight against poverty and hunger must be fought constantly on many fronts especially in its causes i know that americans today as in the past are working to deal with this problem that is the essence of julian bond who never stopped giving that is the essence of amelia boynton robinson who continued to fight for civil rights up until her death at the age of 104 on august 6 2015 that is the essence of congressman lou stokes a legislative giant the chairman of an appropriations subcommittee a person who went to public housing and places where children were and told america that your children are dying because they are living in substandard housing lead poisoning was killing them which gave me the opportunity as i said before to give a grant to my public housing just this past week on helping with lead poisoning i worked for lou stokes and i am very glad to note that working for him i can say truly a gentleman truly a leader to this congress i beg of you let us look at these icons and celebrate not only their lives but commit to the passion and justice of their lives and as well the words of pope francis that tell us to do unto others as we would like them to do unto us it is my privilege to again thank the members of the congressional black caucus it is with a heavy heart that i rise to speak in praise of louis stokes one of the greatest and most respected members ever to serve in this body who died on tuesday august 18 2015 at his home near cleveland ohio at the age of 90 it is not unusual in these days for commentators and politicians to talk of something called american exceptionalism but what is meant by the term one way to understand the term america is exceptional because it produces and finds persons like louis stokes and affords them the opportunity to utilize their talents to the fullest in the service of their community and their country think about it in what other nation does a little african american boy born in 1925 on the east side of cleveland and raised in the outhwaite homes housing project by a mother who worked as a domestic go on to become a lawyer who argues and wins a landmark criminal justice reform case terry v ohio 392 unitedstates 1 1968 in the united states supreme court become the first african american elected to congress is selected to chair the powerful permanent select committee on intelligence the committee on standards of official conduct the select committee on assassinations and an appropriations subcommittee responsible for more than 90 billion annually in federal outlays yes america is an exceptional nation and louis stokes was an exceptional human being louis stokes was born on february 23 1925 in cleveland ohio to charles and louise cinthy nee stone stokes when he was three years old his father who worked in a laundromat died leaving young louis and his younger brother carl to be raised by their mother who worked as a domestic for affluent families in the wealthy cleveland suburbs louis stokes maternal grandmother played a critical role in his life because she took care of the stokes boys while their mother was at work and instilled in them the idea that work with your hands is the hard way of doing things and encouraged them over and over to learn to use their heads louis stokes took the advice to heart so after attending clevelands central high school and serving in the unitedstates army during world war ii he returned home to attend what is now case western reserve university on the g i bill at night while working during the day for the veterans administration and the department of the treasury after graduating from college in two years where he excelled as a student louis stokes was accepted for admission to cleveland marshall school of law from which he graduated in 1953 three years later his brother carl would also graduate from cleveland marshall school of law and the two of them would go on to form the law firm of stokes stokes specializing in the areas of civil rights and criminal law in 1964 the supreme court decided the landmark case of reynolds v sims 377 unitedstates 533 1964 which established the principle of one person one vote governing the reapportionment of legislative boundaries the following year working on behalf of the local branch of the naacp louis stokes led the legal challenge to the ohio legislatures congressional redistricting which had the effect of diluting african american voting strength in cleveland the challenge was unsuccessful in the federal district court but undeterred louis stokes joined by charles lucas an african american republican successfully appealed the decision to the unitedstates supreme court which in an order handed down in 1967 ruled the redistricting plan unconstitutional and ordered it redrawn resulting in the creation of ohios first majorityblack district the 21st congressional district of ohio ironically louis stokes would defeat his onetime ally charles lucas to win that seat in november 1968 capturing 75 of the vote the closest of his 15 successful elections to the unitedstates house of representatives for the next 30 years from 1969 to 1999 congressman stokes tirelessly fought for his constituents in cleveland and for the best interests of the people of ohio and the united states louis stokes a founding member and chair of the congressional black caucus from 197274 was the epitome of a public servant in his second term in congress he won appointment to the powerful house appropriations committee where he served for 28 years later becoming the second african american cardinal in history when he was selected to chair the va hud and related agencies subcommittee because of the esteem in which he was held by his colleagues and the leadership louis stokes would also later be selected to chair the house permanent select committee on intelligence and the select committee charged with investigating the assassinations of president kennedy and the rev dr martin luther king jr as chairman of the house ethics committee and a person of unquestioned integrity louis stokes oversaw the committees investigation of the corruption scandal known as abscam in 197980 which eventually led to convictions of a senator and six house members louis stokes perhaps is best known for the national attention he attracted in 1987 as a member of the house select committee to investigate covert arms transactions with iran lrancontra the scandal involving the illegal sale of military weapons to the ayatollah khomeinis iran to generate money to fund the illegal contra war in nicarag ua in response to the claim by colonel oliver north that he acted out of patriotism in engineering the illegal weapons sales and diverting the proceeds to fund the contras a stern louis stokes lectured the misguided colonel north on the rule of law the true meaning of patriotism and in the process american exceptionalism i suppose that what has been most disturbing to me about your testimony is the ugly part in fact it has been more than ugly it has been chilling and in fact frightening im not just talking about your part in this but the entire scenario about government officials who plotted and conspired who set up a straw man a fall guy officials who lied misrepresented and deceived officials who planned to superimpose upon our government a layer outside of our government shrouded in secrecy and only accountable to the conspirators colonel as i sit here this morning looking at you in your uniform i cannot help but remember that i wore the uniform of this country in world war ii in a segregated army i wore it as proudly as you do even though our government required black and white soldiers in the same army to live sleep eat and travel separate and apart while fighting and dying for our country but because of the rule of law todays servicemen in america suffer no such indignity my mother a widow raised two boys she had an eighthgrade education she was a domestic worker who scrubbed floors one son became the first black mayor of a major american city the other sits today as chairman of a house intelligence committee only in america col north only in america and while i admire your love for america i hope that you will never forget that others too love america just as much as you do and that others will die for america just as quick as you will louis stokes never wavered in his belief that america could fulfill the promise of its founders or his dedication to the principles of the declaration of independence and the constitution stating im going to keep on denouncing the inequities of this system but im going to work within it to go outside the system would be to deny myselfto deny my own existence ive beaten the system ive proved it can be doneso have a lot of others but the problem is that a black man has to be extra special to win in this system why should you have to be a super black to get someplace thats whats wrong in the society the ordinary black man doesnt have the same chance as the ordinary white man does louis stokes commitment to fairness and equal treatment started long before he was elected to congress as a lawyer for the naacp he brought antidiscrimination lawsuits represented demonstrators arrested in antidiscrimination marches and sitins and took the cases of poor persons charged with crimes one of those criminal cases he took is known to every lawyer in america and appreciated by every person who cherishes the protections guaranteed by the 4th amendment to the unitedstates constitution i am speaking of the famous case of terry v ohio 392 unitedstates 1 1968 won by louis stokes in which the supreme court held that a police officer could stop and frisk an individual only where he could articulate a reasonable basis that the person was or was about to be engaged in criminal activity as a result of terry v ohio a police officer has the right to stop frisk and question an individual he reasonably suspects to be engaged in criminal activity but cannot seize items from that person if the pat down of the suspects outer clothing does not reveal any weapons posing a threat to the officers safety because of louis stokes exceptional advocacy in terry v ohio the right of every individual to secure from unreasonable searches and seizures was preserved while at the same not impeding the ability of law enforcement officers to perform their duties safely every citizen benefits from this ruling and communities that have a history of being harassed by law enforcement protected by the constitution from arbitrary and abusive treatment by law enforcement but the fight for a criminal justice system that respects the rights of all persons is not over that is why i am proud to be the ranking member of the house judiciary subcommittee on crime terrorism homeland security and investigations and a leader in the effort to reform the criminal justice system so that all persons receive fair and equal treatment regardless of their race gender religion or national origin louis stokes fought tirelessly to fulfill the promise of the 14th amendment that no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the united states nor shall any state deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws it is a fight i am proud to continue today louis stokes will be mourned by friends and colleagues on both sides of the aisle who had the privilege to serve alongside him he was a mentor to me and i will always remember his commanding presence and cherish the assistance he provided me and the example he set for new members to follow my thoughts and prayers are with his jay louis beloved wife of 55 years to his children shelly louis angela and lorene his grandchildren and the untold thousands of persons who touched and whose lives were touched by one of clevelands greatest sons i ask the house to observe a moment of silence in memory of louis stokes an exceptional american and the gentleman from ohio who served in this chamber for three decades with honor integrity and distinction"], [0.0006948709487915039, 0.9993051290512085, 1, "the gentleman from ohio has been such a leader on this issue he was a leader in the sitin that happened a few weeks ago on the floor of the house i can attest personally i bore witness to his staying here all night for 25 hours straight he organized us on the steps of the capitol on tuesday evening the 1month anniversarybad sad observance of the 1 month since orlando where a hate crime was committed against young people gathered for a night of enjoyment instead to have the end of their life occur and why because of a hate crime and why because we dont have commonsense gun laws in our country he also organized us all day in scores of 1minutes on behalf of house democrats but i want to also thank him for putting this special order together in preparation for the event that we will have on the steps of the capitol later this evening i associate myself with the remarks of our distinguished whip mr hoyer when we say to the republicans why have you left here congresswoman beatty has the same message what more important thing do our republican colleagues have to do than to be in session to do their job for us all to do our job for the american people we should be here to do our job on zika which the president over 4 months ago requested funding to fight zika and now it is spreading in our country we should be here for funding for opioids we passed a wonderful billgood policy but no funding therefore not effective we should be here to pass the funding for opioids and flint michigan what more important thing do you have to do my colleagues on the republican side of the aisle than to meet the needs of the children of flint michigan here we are continuing to have our conversation about commonsense gun violence protection i want to quote from president lyndon johnson in the aftermath of the assassination of robert f kennedy just weeks after the fatal shooting of martin luther king jr and only a few years after president john f kennedy was shot president johnson pressed congress to enact gun control legislation that he sent to capitol hill years earlier he had sent it after the kennedy assassination lbj ordered all of his staff and urged allies in congress to act swiftly here is what he said that was as relevant now as it was then president lyndon johnson following the deaths of martin luther king and robert kennedy said we only have 2 weeks maybe only 10 days before the gun lobby gets organized weve got to beat the nra into the offices of members of congress decades this has been going on for decades when a president of the united states after the assassination of a president an icon reverend martin luther king jr senator robert kennedywell actually he was a candidate for president at the time senator kennedy was weve got to beat the nra into the offices of members of congress well obviously we havent because they sort of live there they sort of live there and when he signed the watereddown version of the bill he proposed he said the voices that blocked these safeguards were not the voices of an aroused nation they were the voices of a powerful gun lobby a gun lobby that has prevailed for the moment in an election year sound familiar lbj went on to say we have been through a great deal of anguish these last few months and these last few yearstoo much anguish to forget so quickly so now we must complete the task which this longneeded legislation begins here we are decades later still recognizing the fact that the national rifle association the gun lobby has so much power over members of congress it has so much power over their political survival some of our colleagues think i ask you mr speaker what is more important the political survival of members of congress beholden to the gun lobby or the survival of little kindergarten students in newtown connecticut what is more important the political survival of members of congress or the personal survival of members gathered in church in south carolina or young people gathered for an evening of fun in orlandothe list goes on and onor our dear police officers killed in dallas what is it how do you explain it to people except to say there is a large element of cowardice there is a large element of putting peoples own political survival over the oath of office that we take to protect the american people excuse me this is so emotional i salute my colleague congresswoman beatty for her very passionate and intellectual statement that she made in recognizing the role of athletes i am very proud of the golden state warriors they have long been involved in this as has the nba and the players that she mentioned this was another venue for them to speak out they have been eloquent on the subject for a while i salute my colleague mr cicilline not only for his work on gun issues but on hate crimes as well because that was a hate crime in orlando mr clyburn is going to be outside on the steps of the capitol with a large crowd of people so we can listen to the stories of those affected if only our colleagues would open their hearts and their minds and not have a tin ear to the voices of the families listen to the families one of our own colleagues congressman bobby rush of illinois he and his family are survivors of the death of their son when he tells the story of how he learned of his son being shot but then of his son passing it is so eloquent and so compelling and he talks about the shriek the cry the scream of a mother who has just found out that her child is dead from a gunshot how much of this can we take it is always impressive i have to say to witness the degree of tolerance that our colleagues have for the pain of others how much pain do people have to suffer for people to hear to learn to judge was it george bernard shaw who said the sign of a truly intelligent person is that he is informed by statistics the statistics are overwhelming 91 a day over 1 000 mass murders which is defined as 4 or more people being slaughtered in 1 incidentall of that since newtown i know my time is drawing short but i will just say this these are statistics more important than that they are human lives how many more human lives how many shrieks of mothers learningand dads as well he spoke of hearing his wifes shriek the piercing sound of a mothers scream i heard one of the mothers from orlando when she was suspicious that her son might have been killed she said i dont know we dont have any evidence but nobody has seen him he isnt at the hospital i am afraid i have become a member of the club the club of women moms who have lost their children it is a terrible club to be a member of and i want to speak out against gun violence so that there arent more moms added to the club but that doesnt seem to resonate with our colleagues they dont even give the courtesy of attendance to hear the concerns that people have is it indifference do they not know or do they not care or is it some combination whatever it is it is a disgrace to our oath of office to protect the american people be assured of this be assured of this we are not going away you will see us you will see the faces of those moms all the organizations that have come together the millions of people the high percentages 85 90 percent of the american people of all parties and no parties who support the legislation that we are asking for we are not going away until we have commonsense gun violence prevention laws passed in our country to save lives

as we begin the second session of the 114th congress there is a long list of important issues that we could be talking about today we could be talking about ways to support job creation to grow the economy to improve gun safety to strengthen national security to pass an immigration reform bill and many other important priorities instead we are talking about h r 3762 the latest attempt by house republicans to defund planned parenthood and to repeal the affordable care act as our economy continues to recover we should be focused on expanding opportunity and helping more americans get ahead instead we are starting the new year by debating a bill that if it ever became law would put the health care of 22 million americans in jeopardy and would further restrict womens access to vital healthcare services this is yet another blatant political move by republicans to appeal to and to appease their rightwing base republican leaders have said it themselves senate republican whip john cornyn called this a political exercise he said i think we all recognize the president isnt likely to sign this bill so its not going to become a law then why on earth are we wasting the american peoples time with this terrible bill this month we have heard that speaker ryan will push to turn the house into a platform for ambitious republican policy ideas the 62nd vote to repeal or to undermine the affordable care act the llth vote to attack womens health really that is the platform for ambitious republican policy ideas i think the american people should sue republicans for malpractice when speaker ryan took the gavel last fall there was so much talk about a new chapter and fresh ideas instead we are starting 2016 with more of the stale and politically motivated bills we have become accustomed to in this republicancontrolled congress we are constantly being told by republicans that they have better ideas and that they have a better approach to health care really where is it i would remind my republican friends that in 2011 you passed a bill that actually tasked you to come up with an alternative to the affordable care act you came up with nothing just last year you passed another bill to come up with an alternative and once again you came up with nothing now here we are again with a bill that repeals the affordable care act and that tasks the republicans to come up with an alternative i am curious where is your alternative maybe it is in your notes is it hidden in some secret room in the capitol maybe donald trump has it perhaps we should alert the capitol police better yet maybe we could call the fbi to locate the republican plan on health care i remind my friends that you are in charge you run this place you can bring whatever you want to this house floor maybe you should bring a bloodhound to the house floor to try to find your alternative healthcare plan governing is something that my friends on the republican side are not very good at they are very good about saying no to everything but they cant say yes to anything the republican plan on health care is essentially a sound bite their prescription is take two tax breaks and call me in the morning not only have the republicans done nothing to expand health care for the american peopleand again they are in chargebut they have actually consistently tried to undermine health access for millions of americans to take health care away from people in this country 1400 if the republicans had it their way and actually repealed the affordable care act millions of young people under the age of 26 would be thrown off their parents health plans being a woman would once again be a preexisting condition and much more of the progress made by the aca would be rolled back contrary to what we often hear from republicans the affordable care act is not killing the economy i know facts get in the way of their arguments but the fact is that america has seen a record 69 straight months of job growth and all signs point to this historic growth continuing in september 2012 when unemployment was at 8 1 percent the republican presidential nominee mitt romney claimed that the unemployment rate would stay at 8 percent if president obama were reelected president well president obama was reelected president and mitt romney was wrong what actually happened the unemployment rate has steadily dropped each year and is now at a 7year low of 5 percent with employers adding about 210 000 jobs a month through last november as more americans get back to work one of the frequent republican claims that we have heard is that businesses would shift to parttime workers to avoid the affordable care acts requirement to provide healthcare coverage to fulltime employees a new study released this week shows that the aca resulted in little change in the number of hours worked including the first 6 months of 2015 when the employer mandate first took effect for larger companies as politico noted this study pokes a major hole in a beloved conservative talking pointthat obamacare will force employers to cut employees hours the truth is that researchers found no major changes in the probability of people working fewer hours in 2013 2014 or 2015 we have also heard republicans claim that the acas expansion of medicaid would decrease employment among lowincome workers but another study released this week showed no major changes in the way lowincome workers fit into the labor market during the first 15 months of medicaid expansion under aca contrary to conservative talking points the new coverage didnt push lowincome adults to switch jobs move from fulltime to parttime work or rush to find new jobs in fact the expansion of medicaid under the affordable care act has made a tremendous difference in increasing access to health care for americas most vulnerable families since october of 2013 more than 12 3 million americans have been able to get coverage thanks to the expansion of medicaid as a result of marketplace coverage and medicaid expansion hospital uncompensated care costs were reduced by an estimated 7 4 billion in 2014 resulting in huge savings for consumers across this country that is the difference between us democrats believe health care is a right and my republican friends believe it is a privilege to make matters worse the bill before us today would also defund planned parenthood which would put millions of lowincome womenand men i would addat risk of losing access to critical health services the fact is that one in five women has relied on a planned parenthood health center for care in her lifetime and planned parenthood serves 2 7 million patients each year additionally planned parenthood clinics often serve as one of the few affordable care options available for many women and men cutting off access to the critical health services planned parenthood provides to some of our most vulnerable citizens is simply wrong it is unconscionable sixtythree percent of voters including 72 percent of independents agree this whole effort to defund planned parenthood fits the republican pattern of targeting poor people and quite frankly it is outrageous while our nations community health centers do incredible work the republican claim that community health centers by themselves could suddenly pick up all the slack if planned parenthood is defunded is just not true and my republican friends know that the idea that our community health centers could overnight suddenly step up and step in and cover millions of new patients is absurd in fact in 21 percent of the counties with a planned parenthood health center planned parenthood is the only safety net family planning provider finally let me just also voice my strong objection to the provision in this rule which extends for another year the unrestricted authority for four house committees to conduct staff depositions at any time on any subject for any reason some committees have barely used this authority in the past year and when they have it has often been abused with the threat of subpoena held over peoples heads the power to compel american citizens to provide testimony under oath should be rarely used and specifically authorized quite frankly i think the american people are tired of the partisan witch hunts that we have grown accustomed to under this republican leadership in this house we are starting the new year not by working in a bipartisan way to do the peoples business unfortunately we are starting the new year debating the same old same old bills that put politics ahead of people that is truly sad i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.0007034540176391602, 0.9992965459823608, 1, "i will read the opening paragraph it is plainly illegal for foreigners to contribute to american political campaigns but reform groups are warning that the ban would be gravely undermined by a littlenoticed bill which is this bill advanced thursday by republicans on the house ways and means committee this is basically saying that this opens up a loophole that quite frankly can be very very dangerous so i urge my colleagues that if this rule gets passed that they would vote against this bill again as i mentioned on the defense appropriations bill it is a bill that is based on budget gimmicks and it is also a bill that continues to fund endless wars without having any authorization from this congress we have not voted on an aumf for the most recent war in iraq and in syria i find it unconscionable that we have no problem just putting these wars on automatic pilot and having our brave men and women in uniform in harms way and we dont even have the guts to debate it we have tried and tried and tried and tried on various billson authorization bills and on appropriations billsto be able to have that debate there is always an excuseoh it is a different committee jurisdiction oh we have to give it more than 10 minutes oh we have to do this we have to do thatbut this is our constitutional responsibility we have time to vote on all these other bills that quite frankly are going nowhere that are political messaging pieces written at the national republican congressional committee but we cant find the time to debate these wars to clarify what our mission isthese wars that our brave men and women in uniform have been put in harms way to deal with come on at some point we have to find the courage to debate this if people think these wars are the right way to go or they want to expand presidential authority then that is how you do it if people like me think our military footprint is too big in the middle east and that we need to have a more clearly defined mission about what we are doing then that is the forum in which we restrain these wars but to do nothingto do nothingis cowardly it is just wrong i am hoping in the amendment process that we will have the opportunity to debate some of these issues but if history is any indication the answer is probably not finally i am urging my colleagues to defeat the previous question quite frankly instead of these flawed bills we should be debating how to prevent more tragedies like the one that took place in orlando if we defeat the previous question we will bring up a bill that is a bipartisan bill that would simply say that if you are on an fbi watch list so you are unable to fly then you should be unable to buy a gun at a gun store it is that simple i dont quite understand why that is such a big deal if the fbi believes that you are potentially dangerous so that they will not allow you to fly on an airplane then how in the world can we allow that person to go into a gun store and buy a gun and not just any gun they can buy an assault weapon it is crazy we have tried on numerous occasions to bring this issue to the floor and house republicans have voted 11 times11 timesto block the bipartisan no fly no buy legislation that was originally authored by my republican colleague congressman peter king since taking control of the house in 2011 my republican friends have drastically cut the resources available for law enforcement slashing the cops program which includes cops hiring cops technology interoperability et cetera by 64 percent we need to respond to these terrible tragedies and make sure that our communities have what they need to keep people safe according to the government accountability office as my colleague from california pointed out more than 2 000 suspects on the fbis terrorist watch list have successfully purchased weapons in the united statesmore than 2 000 these are people who cant fly on airplanes because they are suspected of being terrorists but they can go in and buy a firearm more than 90 percent of all suspected terrorists who attempted to purchase guns in the last 11 years walked away with the weapon they wanted with just 190 rejected despite their ominous history this legislation that we want to bring to the floorjust so there is no misunderstanding herewas originally crafted in 2007 and endorsed by president bushs justice department it has bipartisan support in the house and is supported by prominent republicans and counterterrorism and law enforcement experts yet we cant find the time to bring it to the floor all we can do in the aftermath of terrible massacres like the one in orlando is come to the floor and have a moment of silence for 10 seconds and that is it that is our obligation it is awful that we cant deal in a responsible way with legislation like the bills that i have mentioned here i think the american peopleand this goes beyond political affiliationare getting sick of our inaction on this stuff i should just say if my friends are afraid of the nra according to a 2012 poll 71 percent of current or former nra members and 80 percent of other gun owners support preventing people on a terrorist watch list from purchasing guns i dont know what it is going to take but i will tell you this the outrage is already beyond description here on the house floor of people who are simply tired of our inaction so i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to defeat the previous question so we can actually have a debate and vote on something that might save some lives and also vote against the rule i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0007306933403015137, 0.9992693066596985, 1, "i want to thank my good friend the gentlewoman from new york for yielding me time to talk about my colleagues the republicans budget which is something i oppose i oppose it for a number of policy reasons but i thought i would spend my time today talking about what i view is a more fundamental analytical flaw in the budget and that relates to the overall goal of the budget because if you have the wrong goal you often make a series of bad decisions to support that goal so i think it is important that we talk about what the goal of the budget is and what the goal of the budget should be the goal of the republican budget is to have zero deficits within 10 years in my opinion that is the goal because it sounds good we have all heard the line that we should not spend more money than we take in that sounds really good but it ignores to many extents the basic math of budgets it is also an unrealistic goal and it is also an unnecessary goal and as a result of pursuing an unrealistic and unnecessary goal a series of very bad decisions are embedded in the budget which is why i want to talk about the goal it is an unrealistic goal when you look at the condition of the federal budget at this moment in time after several decades of this congress and several administrations ignoring in many ways the fiscal responsibility of this great country and allowing our debt to become such a high percentage of our economy we put ourselves in a position where we have had very significant deficits and the debt levels are such that we have very limited financial flexibility as a country and if interest rates were to go up it would increasingly consume a very large percentage of our budget that is the problem and that is the situation we find ourselves in in addition mr chair we are entering a phase where the demographic trends in the country and the aging on a relative basis of the population are putting tremendous pressure on the resources of the federal government so this is a very very challenging time to take a budget that has had very significant deficits and try to bring them to zero within 10 years that is why it is unrealistic it is also unnecessary because the most important metric in the financial health of the united states of america is our debt as a percentage of our economy if we want to lower our debt as a percentage of our economy what we have to do is have a budget where our deficits expressed as a percentage of our economy are consistently lower than economic growth so we should be targeting deficits of 1 to 2 percent with a view that the minimum baseline economic growth of this country will be 2 to 3 percent and definitionally over time that will take the debt of the country as a percentage of the country down it will give us more financial flexibility in the future and position us so that when interest rates rise which they will it will consume a much smaller percentage of our budget that should be the goal but because we have this unrealistic and unnecessary goal of getting deficits to zero within 10 years my republican colleagues are forced to overcorrect in the budget to achieve that goal there are two fundamental ways to overcorrect in a budget you either raise taxes very high to get revenues to get it to zero or you cut investments very significantly now my republican colleagues dont choose to raise taxes in fact what they choose to do is to cut taxes which makes an already unrealistic goal more unrealistic so the only thing that is left the only thing that is left to bring this budget to zero within 10 years is massive massive reductions in the investments we are making in our future and in our nation which to me is a very odd decision in light of the facts that are in front of us and the facts that are in front of us are very clear we are in a global and very competitive economy and we havent made the investments particularly in things like infrastructure to position this country to compete as successfully as it should in a world that is increasingly interconnected also we have to make investments in our children mr chair we are in a knowledgebased economy and to make sure that our kids are capable of being employed and having a rising standard of living across their lives we have to invest in their future so to achieve this unrealistic goal my republican colleagues make very significant very very significant cuts to these critical investments which you could argue it has never been more important to do that in fact they bring many of these levels down to half of what they have been historicallyagain and importantly expressed as a percentage of our economy because it is irrelevant to talk about absolute numbers the only numbers that should be talked about is the budget in terms of a percentage of our economy that is why i view this budget as so troubling and misguided mr chair i spent my whole career prior to coming to congress running publicly traded companies that i started i used to observe other managers who are running publicly traded companies from time to time make really bad decisions about what to do with their business those bad decisions were often based on a fundamental premise that they would pander to the market and put forth unrealistic expectations they would make bad decisions to achieve those expectations and the story would end badly the acting chair the time of the gentleman has expired"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.9990730285644531, 0.9990730285644531, 0, "mr chair i thank the gentleman for his amendment in the nature of a substitute but at this time i have to oppose it i appreciate that mr takano does believe that we need to provide real accountability at the department of veterans affairs but as i said at our committee markup when he offered an almost identical amendment this substitute fails to achieve true accountability i am supportive of section 3 of his amendment which would limit administrative leave for all employees to 14 days and i agree with this commonsense policy but i would note that this limitation language is already included in my bill h r 1994 my main concern with the substitute lies within section 2 which would dramatically change the standard and the process set up in my bill of removing va employees the substitute would only give the secretary the authority to remove an employee if they represent a clear and direct threat to public health or safety which is almost an unobtainable if not immeasurable bar to reach this undefined standard would make it almost impossible for the secretary to remove any employee under this new authority thereby ensuring that the current stalemate that exists with the civil service rules would continue unfortunately as i said moments ago maintaining the status quo is not acceptable i would submit that the standard of a clear and direct threat to public health and safety would not apply to those employees involved with many of todays ongoing scandals at the va including the cost overruns of the denver hospital the budget shortfall that we are going to vote to fix later today a 3 billion budget fix the manipulation of data at the philadelphia regional office the allegations of inappropriate use of government purchase cards to the tune of 6 billion the allegations of employees at the los angeles regional office once again inappropriately shredding veterans claim information and the many other egregious actions that continue to come to light at va almost every single day members these are the very type of employees that our constituents and our veterans expect to be held accountable but the standard proposed in this substitute would not give the secretary the authority to provide the accountability we all know that va desperately needs i also have some concerns with the procedures that are laid out in the substitute to actually remove these employees i believe that unlike the procedures that i have laid out in my bill which set definitive timelines to remove someone while maintaining the due process and maintaining appeal rights the procedures laid out in this substitute could allow an employee to be on indefinite suspension for months if not years awaiting a hearing for the secretarys final decision it has been mentioned several times by my colleagues on the other side that passage of h r 1994 would return to a spoils or an atwill employment system nothing could be further from the truth let me compare a spoils or an atwill system to the protections offered in first a spoils system would allow the party in power to hire anyone usually partisan supporters that they want to reward for their political support with a federal job in contrast h r 1994 has no effect on the current hiring process second a spoils or a patronage system makes all employees at will and subject to firing for any or even no reason again that is hardly the case in my bill h r 1994 requires proof in the form of poor performance or misconduct additionally my bill requires the secretary to report the reasons for any such removals to congress within 30 days third in a spoils system a fired employee has no right of appeal in contrast under h r 1994 fired employees still have due process rights including 45 days to appeal their firing to the merit systems protection board fourth in a spoils system there is no such thing as paid administrative leave you are fired gone with no pay under civil service rules a poorperforming employee can be placed on administrative leave for essentially an unlimited time as we have seen with several miscreants identified during our investigations h r 1994 on the other hand would limit the secretarys authority to put someone on paid administrative leave to 14 days at which time the secretary must bring that person back to active duty fifth in a spoils system there are no protections for whistleblowers in an atwill system employees may or may not be covered by whistleblower protection employee discrimination et cetera type laws depending on the type of employer however under h r 1994 employees are protected by both of these types of laws plus the procedures and additional protections created under section 4 of my bill employees cannot be removed without osc approval if an open case exists and employees cannot be removed or demoted if they have an open case under the new process that is laid out in section 4 until the office of accountability review makes a final determination so ultimately not only does this amendment set a standard for removal that is not relevant to a majority of the issues that we see at the department it keeps intact the long and arduous timeline before a final approval is complete this is not fair to veterans to the department or to the employee in question to reemphasize i also have issues with the whistleblower protections that are laid out in this substitute or the lack of protections in this substitute the only mention of whistleblower protections made in this amendment says that a whistleblower may receive backpay if the merit systems protection board ultimately

that is simply false you can go to any store today and see shelves of modern energyefficient incandescent light bulbs that meet the standard i have bought them myself they are the same as the old bulbs except that they last longer they use less electricity and they save consumers money we have heard for years that the energy efficiency standards restrict consumer choice but if you have shopped for light bulbs lately you know that simply isnt true modern incandescent bulbs compact fluorescent light bulbs and leds of every shape size and color are now available consumers have never had more choice the efficiency standards spurred innovation that dramatically expanded options for consumers critics of the efficiency standards claimed that they would cost consumers money in fact the opposite is true when the standards are in full effect the average american family will save about 100 every year that comes to 13 billion in savings nationwide every year but this rider threatens those savings and that is why consumer groups have consistently opposed this rider here is the reality the 2007 consensus energy efficiency standards for light bulbs were enacted with bipartisan support and continue to receive overwhelming industry support unitedstates manufacturers are already meeting the efficiency standards the effect of the rider is to allow foreign manufacturers to sell old inefficient light bulbs in the united states that violate the efficiency standards that is unfair to domestic manufacturers who have invested millions of dollars in the united states in those plants to make efficient bulbs here that meet the standards why on earth would we want to pass a rider that favors foreign manufacturers who ignore our laws and penalizes unitedstates manufacturers who are following our laws but it even gets worse the rider now poses an additional threat to unitedstates manufacturing the bipartisan 2007 energy bill requires the department of energy to establish updated light bulb efficiency standards by january 1 of next year it also provided that if final updated standards are not issued by then a more stringent standard of 45 lumens per watt automatically takes effect incandescent light bulbs currently cannot meet this backstop standard this rider blocks doe from issuing the required efficiency standards and ensures that the backstop will kick in ironically it is this rider that could effectively ban the incandescent light bulb the burgess rider directly threatens existing light bulb manufacturing jobs in pennsylvania ohio illinois across our region it would stifle innovation and punish companies that have invested in domestic manufacturing this rider aims to reverse years of technological progress only to kill jobs increase electricity

mitigate the risk of market confusion or rejection by countries that have no interest in purchasing the hybrid organism consumer confusion about what types of salmon or seafood are genetically engineered may deter shoppers from purchasing these products altogether if ge salmon is approved despite opposition from congress and nearly two million people who wrote in to the fda it should be clearly labeled to avoid the potential market rejection of all salmon in an effort to ensure that alaskan consumers have this essential information alaska enacted legislation in 2005 that requires the labeling of all products containing ge fish and shellfish however the socalled safe and accurate food labeling act recently referred out of the house agriculture committee would block states like alaska from requiring mandatory labeling of ge fish while also curtailing fdas ability to craft a true national ge labeling system rather its proponents would suggest that alaskan fishermen should go

from florida and our friend from georgia brother hice we heard great comments from dr gosar and our friend steve king from iowa these are deeply troubling times and the supreme court taking up united states v texas really accentuates that issue sometimes it is nice to just pause and pay tribute to folks for example a beautiful couple here it is a pastor his name is pastor jesse estrada sabillon and his wife maria sabillon they are with their granddaughter in this picture they are a beautiful couple you can feel the love emanating from the picture pastor jesse estrada sabillon was a baptist minister at nuevo amanecer baptist church of houston in the cloverleaf area he was an excellent carpenter he owned a home remodeling business j j sons remodeling his wife maria you can tell she loves her granddaughterwas a retired home caregiver for children with special needs they were a beautiful couple mr sabillon never accepted a salary from the church and instead relied upon his job as a carpenter to feed his family so it appears that pastor sabillon was working and acting in the vein of the apostles peter and paul particularly paul didnt want to be a burden to others so he made tents sewed and did whatever he needed to so that he wasnt a burden to others instead of being a burden to others pastor sabillon and his wife maria were a blessing to texas they were a blessing to the houston area and to so many whom they helped the special needs kids that maria helped with it appears that jesse pastor sabillon was doing what jesus said to do to be a light to others to be salt to the world to administer to others needs or as jesus told peter if you love me you will tend my flock well pastor sabillon did that and apparently did that very well this story april 15 alexis de

jesse estrada sabillon and his wife maria sabillon were killed the couple was driving home tuesday night after visiting their niece who had just given birth to a baby when they were struck by the truck the suspect is reported to have fled the scene following the crash and did not turn himself in until friday morning about 10 local time he was allegedly driving a 2006 chevy pickup truck and was said to be racing with a darkcolored dodge challenger or charger the houston chronicle reported on wednesday the two vehicles were said to be racing along the sam houston tollway feeder road when de larosa sosa is reported to have run a red light striking the 2004 bmw 330 driven by sabillon the couple were both pronounced dead at the scene of the crash de larosa sosa is said to have fled the scene on foot the driver of the dodge fled the scene in his vehicle officials with the harris county sheriffs office quickly notified the family of the pastor who expressed relief at the news talking about the apprehension of the suspect de larosa sosa is currently processing into the harris county jail and has not yet made a court appearance he is expected to be charged in connection with the two homicides and fleeing the scene of the fatal accident we know there are some wonderful people who have come into this country illegally there have been but there is no question that criminals have taken advantage of the situation to cross our border since it has been porous and to inflict crime on people of the united states there should be little doubt about that and then we have this story from the washington free beacon number of children illegally crossing border up 1 200 percent between 2011 and 2014 ironically it just happens to be as people were finding out south of our border and in other parts of the world that if you make it into the united states illegally then you are probably going to stay odds are 97 percent you will stay as border patrolmen have told me drug cartels across our southern border call our border patrol our homeland security the logistics and they laughingly say if they get people illegally into the country then homeland security is the logistics that ships them wherever they want them to go in the country as i have seen a number of times in the middle of the night as people are being processed and like for example the one older lady who was asked how much she paid some would say 6 000 some would say 7 000 5 000 or 8 000 on a number of occasions a border patrolman has challenged them where did you get that kind of money you dont have that kind of money it normally took repeated questioning to elicit an answer well i paid 1 800 from family in this place some people sent 2 000 from the united states and i am going to pay the rest by working it off in the united states they tell them where they want to go amazingly homeland security has shipped people that have come into the country illegally all over the country we have reports about mexican drug distribution in all of our major cities when you know that homeland security is shipping people that still owe the drug cartels money into different cities it is not hard to figure out how they are getting some of their less than happy workers helping them with their drug distribution this article from adam kredo says in this washington free beacon the number of children apprehended on the unitedstates border attempting to immigrate illegally has surged more than 1 200 percent since 2011 and the number of these children crossing the border during 2016 could be another record according to a newly released government report the number of unaccompanied alien children uacs illegally crossing the unitedstates border has increased sharply since 2011 with a surge of more than 1 200 percent just between 2011 and 2014 according to the congressional research service the agency also disclosed that the flow is increasing significantly in the first 5 months of fiscal the illegal immigration of these children hit recordbreaking numbers in 2014 with unitedstates officials apprehending more than 52 000 alien children nearly 20 000 have been apprehended within the first 5 months of 2016 setting the stage for another potentially recordbreaking year this unexpected surge of children strained unitedstates government resources and created a complex crisis of humanitarian implications the report said they increased in the first 5 months of fy 2016 however and experts warn that significant migration flows will continue until policymakers in the countries of origin and the international community address the poor socioeconomic and security conditions driving central americans to leave their homes that is interesting but i would submit that actually they will continue to surge as long as they are led to believe by the administration and the evidence continues to indicate that they will be allowed to stay in america we will send them where they may claim to have relatives or where the drug cartels tell them to request to be sent just in the last few weeks spending some days and nights on our border our southern border it is heartbreaking what you see because there are people that clearly want a better way of life they are leaving the country of origin because their countries do not enforce the rule of law there is graft there is corruption and the rule of law the law is not evenly and fairly supported and enforced across the board therefore the jobs arent there there are more opportunities here in the united states although we have breakdowns we do try to enforce the law more evenly than i would submit anywhere in the world at least until more recently when this administration makes exceptions of millions of people who are assured that they can violate the law with impunity and will be awarded for it people come from countries where there is no equality under the law and they come to this country as soon as they get here for those of us that were out in front of the supreme court today being shouted down by people who are angry many of them shouting in spanishfinebut we were told that people in their positions were all in the shadows now i did see some people lounging around under a few trees but most of them were not in the shadows they were in fact on the steps of the supreme court right there in front yelling and screaming and showing disrespect for the unitedstates national anthem and yelling trying to prevent freedom of speech it is just really interesting seeing posters like jesus was an immigrant well sort of but he never violated the law he never encouraged anyone else to violate the law in fact he urged people to go forth and do wrong no more but that is not the case the great and really tragic irony of what is taking place is people coming to america illegally demanding that the laws not be properly enforced not be fairly enforced sure there have been millions and millions and millions and millions of americans who have come through our system legally but we are the millions that did not come legally and we demand to have the same treatment as if we did come legally if we do that it will not be long before we will be in the same shape as the countries these people fled from because there is not adequate opportunities since there is not adequate room for the billion or so that we have been told may want to come to america around the world it would be far better to encourage their nations to end graft and corruption to treat people fairly across the board here is an article from the center for immigration studies it says the criminal aliens released by ice in these years who had already been convicted of thousands of crimes are responsible for a significant crime spree in american communities including 124 aliens charged with 135 new homicides inexplicably ice is choosing to release some criminal aliens multiple times these are people that not only came into the country illegally but have committed crimes multiple times many of them while they are here at least they have certainly been charged with them a total of 121 criminal aliens who were freed by ice over the 5year period between 2010 and 2014 were subsequently charged with homiciderelated crimes within that time frame three more were charged in 2015 these 121 accused murderers were associated with 250 different communities in the united states with the most clustered in california new york and texas these aliens were charged with a total of 135 homiciderelated crimes after release two of them had homiciderelated convictions even before they were released these aliens had 464 criminal convictions prior to release by ice another three aliens who were released by ice during that time were charged with homicides during the first 10 months of fy 2015 this tally does not include aliens who were released by sanctuary jurisdictions nor those aliens that were released by local law enforcement agencies after ice declined to take them into custody due to obama administration prioritization policies this list includes only those aliens that ice arrested and then released the names of the criminal aliens were redacted by the judiciary committee but the list presumably includes murderers like apolinar altamirano an illegal alien who was arrested by ice in 2013 following his conviction on local charges involving a burglary and abduction but who was released on a 10 000 bond and permitted to remain free and elect to have deportation proceedings that would take years to complete in january 2015 altamirano shot and killed 21yearold grant ronnebeck while he was working at a convenience store where altamirano had come to buy cigarettes ice has previously disclosed that 75 percent of the homicidal criminal aliens were released due to court orders including the socalled zadvydas cases in which the aliens home countries would not take them back the rest were released by ices choice the article also points out in 2014 ice released a total of 30 558 criminal aliens from its custody these aliens had already been convicted of 92 347 crimes before they were released by ice as of july 25 2015 a total of 1 895 aliens have been charged with a crime after being freed by ice in a separate communication ice provided a list of countries that currently are uncooperative in accepting their deported citizens afghanistan algeria burundi cape verde china cuba eritrea gambia ghana guinea india iran iraq ivory coast liberia libya mali mauritania morocco sierra leone somalia south sudan and zimbabwe we have the power to force these countries to either take back their citizens who have come illegally into this country or who are illegally in this countryparticularly if they have committed crimes in this countryor have consequences instead this administration chooses to provide benefits to countries like iran and afghanistan for goodness sake make sure they are running christians and jews out of afghanistan but shouldnt they at least take back their own people i was told by one of the leaders in afghanistanthis is a few years agothat their budget was around 12 billion a year they only provided about 1 5 billion all the rest came from other countries and most of that was from the united states if they wont take their people back then shut the government down they will take their people back this is ridiculous also an important point was made in this article as of july 25 2015 only about 3 percent of the 30 558 criminal aliens freed by ice in 2014 have been removed ice reports that 28 017 still had a pending immigration case as of july 25 2015 but some of them dont show up for their hearings many dont the largest percentage do not they are just given notices to appear recent national gang unitled operations include and this is from a different article from the article ice arrests more than 1 100 in operation targeting gangs it talks about all of the efforts to capture gangs lets see of the 1 133 arrests 915 were gang members and associates 1 001 were charged with criminal offenses and 132 were arrested it is just more and more numbers of drugs firearms currency again about 3 percent apparently is all they are removing of those who are committing crimes in the country jessica vaughan from a year ago had an article from may 28 the nondeported ice still releasing criminal aliens at a rapid pace she documents according to this article the majority of convicted criminal releases occurred because of obama administration policies that require ice officers to let the offenders go in some cases judges will allow aliens to be released after a bond hearing but the conditions are usually set by ice and ice attorneys say that they have been instructed not to vigorously contest an aliens request for release which brings us back to the sabillons my christian brother and my christian sister are gone and we dont enforce our immigration laws as the oath taken by those in this administration require i want to finish up by mentioning again about my being on the border i was so struck texas has utilized and provided massive amounts of money to try to help us defend our border the number one area through which people are coming into the united states moved some years back from arizona to the mcallen corridor into texas i had occasion to be on a dps boat with fantastic dps officers they had fantastic equipment that they were able to utilize to spot people who were clearly getting readybehind bushes and whatnotto cross the rio grande from the mexico side into the unitedstates it appeared clearly that some of them were just people who were going to be brought across and some were carrying things maybe they were drugs we dont really know after we had spotted these folks when we were cruising down the river on the dps boatand there were a couple of border patrol boats that were much smaller and there were other assets that allowed them to focus once we identified where these people were so that the federal border patrol would knowand after we stayed silent for a while we finally got a radio message from the border patrol that asked us to go ahead and return back to the dock way on down the river so that they could try to intercept these folks fine because i know if the department of public safety sees a raft coming across they will stop them they do destroy the raft which as i understand gets the coyote in trouble with the drug lord who sent him with the raft with people who had paid money to get them across so the dps would do that they said why dont you go ahead they are waiting for you to leave the area then we can interdict we can catch them redhanded it turns out that is exactly what they did we spent massive amounts of money and effort in spotting people before they came across the river illegally whether it was bringing drugs whether it was people coming across we knew where they were we spotted them and we directed the border patrol to them i say we it is our department of public safety people in texas we got word that is exactly what they were waiting for they came across after you left the area and now we are inprocessing them into the united states we have the power to secure our border but this administration has no will and that is why unaccompanied children are up 1 200 percent i have seen tiny little girls who couldnt have been more than 3 or 4 just in the last trip down in the days i spent down there girls like them say oh i am unaccompanied i guarantee you they did not cross that river unaccompanied they did not come 1 000 miles unaccompanied across mexico they were accompanied thank god they were not sold into sex trafficking as so many have been when we in the united states as i have been told by african friendssome of whom i have seen in the last monthsay we are the hope of the world and when we dont follow the law when we dont enforce the law

bill economic freedom and personal freedom run hand in hand in order to enjoy our personal freedom americans need access to credit as individuals on behalf of their families and in their businesses that is why i am so proud to have introduced this bill h r 3791 is a very simple bill to help small banks and savings and loan companies get access to the capital they need so as to make credit available in their communities these small banking institutions are critical to the people and the communities in which they reside they support the credit needs of families of small businesses of farmers and of entrepreneurs a community bank is often the principal lending source for many people whether they are purchasing a home starting a new business or purchasing a vehicle in many counties around the nation a community bank is the only banking presence that residents have when these community banking institutions are overwhelmed with regulations and mandates many of which are meant for larger institutions it is the hardworking middleincome and lowincome families in those communities who suffer the most it is about people community banks give people the credit they need to pursue their dreamsto buy a home to start a business in fact proximity to a community bank increases the chances that new small businesses will be approved for loans and will have the chance to succeed by raising the consolidated asset threshold under the federal reserves small bank holding company policy statement from 1 billion to 5 billion in assets over 400 additional small bank and thrift holding companies will qualify for coverage under the policy statement and therefore will be exempt from certain regulatory and capital guidelines these capital standards were originally established for larger institutions and disproportionately harm small holding companies many holding companies that are above the current threshold face challenges with regard to capital formation just when regulators are demanding higher capital levels these exemptions provided in the policy statement make it easier for small holding companies to raise capital and issue debt this bill is about making sure regulations fit the size of the institution a similar effort was passed into law during the last congress under suspension in the house and by unanimous consent in the senate that bill raised the threshold from 500 million where it has been since 1996 to 1 billion that legislation also extended the exemption to savings and loan holding companies while we are glad that we were able to achieve that increase which helped roughly 500 small bank and thrift holding companies we would like to extend those benefits further h r 3791 would bring more than 400 additional small institutions within the scope of the policy statement one success story that we have already seen from the previous increase was an instance in which 35 bank holding companies pooled their resources to issue debt under the policy statement that debt was then downstreamed to the respective banks where the capital was then used to make loans in the communities they serve illustrating the great multiplier effect that the policy statement can produce h r 3791 seeks to extend that flexibility and success to a greater number of small institutions and the communities they serve opponents of this increase have alleged that changing the regulatory threshold would put communities and the deposit insurance fund at higher risk but the policy statement contains several safeguards that are designed to ensure that small bank holding companies that operate with the higher levels of debt permitted by the policy statement do not present an undue risk to the safety and soundness of their subsidiary banks to sum this up this bill is not about supporting banks it is about supporting families communities and small businesses it is about making sure that a smallbusiness owner like my constituent jennifer jones has access to the credit she needs to expand her early childhood academy where she teaches children to read before they reach kindergarten it is about families who are sitting around their kitchen tables and are imagining the possibilities of renovating or of improving their homes it is about that entrepreneur who is starting a restaurant and being her own boss it is about the thousands of new jobs that will be created in those communities as a result the raising of the threshold received widespread bipartisan support in the last congress and i hope that the people will receive equal support

unfortunately racism was no stranger to isaac despite holding a business degree she was denied jobs because employers chose to judge her skin color rather than her impressive credentials isaac did not give up she started a catering business in redding and she eventually became the first black woman to be hired by the county of shasta working in social services for 17 years and helping others however isaacs most noble work was through her plight to advance racial equality in her own neighborhood upon first moving to redding all but one of the black families lived on the same street and were segregated from the community this was a status quo that she didnt accept isaac joined her husband in founding the redding chapter of the naacp and began her 65year journey of advocating for civil rights and worked very hard in order to hold onto that charter of the naacp when times got a little leaner back in the seventies she lobbied city and county lawmakers for safe and affordable housing for black families she worked with local school officials for the equal treatment of black children in the communitys mainly white schools she fought for fairness and justice under the law for all citizens in the judicial system she raised funds and successfully sought approval from city hall for the construction of the only martin luther king jr community center between sacramento and oregon at that time it was her compassionate advocacy and her resiliency that helped change shasta county for the better some of her most notable accomplishments included being the first black woman to serve on shasta countys grand jury where she served as a founding member of the shasta county citizens against racism and was awarded the redding citizen of the year in 1992 her proudest moment was in getting the redding city council members to recognize martin luther king day as a holiday her legacy speaks volumes of the person she was and of the impact she had on so many lives one of the anecdotes i know about her informally is that she was fairly commonly referred to as the rosa parks of redding california she was a deeply caring friend a loving wife and mother and a selfless advocate i had the chance to meet isaac personally on different occasionssome positive and one actually a very negative occasion but it was made positive by how the community responded to a very ugly racial incident that took place against a black family in their home many of us in the community joined together in a march in solidarity protesting that we were not going to tolerate this in our community in northern california isaac was there being strong but also being that smiling positive voice you could see her strength you could also see the light shining from within her as she advocated for what was right for everybody really at the end of the day if we had more people like her and if we had more harmony instead of the divisiveness that we see so badly affecting this country today we would be much better off northern california has lost a gem but her legacy will live on and we all recognize that i am honored to be able to note that here today on the unitedstates house floor and to properly show that her legacy even lives on in the papers she published and that are right over here in the library of congress which note some of her work in the past for the naacp indeed it is a rich legacy that reaches all the way to washington d c i appreciate my colleague from texas"]], "top_unsure": [[0.00015974044799804688, 0.500159740447998, 1, "i thank the gentleman from

who just spoke onthejob injuries i dont know what would support that whether or not there is a davisbacon wage scale on that that has to do with your safety policy on the job it has to do with the culture of the company and it has to do to a degree with the culture of the projects that you are on the fewer benefits side of this thing i think it goes the other way because davisbacon requires that you add dollars into this federalmandated union scale to pay benefits and when that happens you are paying a benefit figure on a dollar figure to the employees rather than say a health insurance package that is going to take care of them far better and in the long term i point out also today that we had testimony from the secretary of transportation from the state of oklahoma secretary gary ridley who said that they run into the inefficiencies driven by davisbacon where you have as many as three or more different pay scales on a single project that might stretch out over 6 8 or 10 miles they end up in different wage scales so the contractors have to keep track of who crosses that line in what machine the confusion of all that adds to the inefficiencies as well the most important thing is this the taxpayers are paying an unnecessary premium for projects that we could be far ahead of where we are right now if we hadnt had all these years of this davisbacon wage scale i would reiterate it is ironic that it is the democrats who are always on the floor defending the last jim crow law on the books it is time to get rid of the last jim crow law on the books let free enterprise

good friend from new york for yielding the time i thank my friend from mississippi who talked a little bit before about the bill that we are working on together that being the faster act which i do believe is a step in the right direction i represent a district just north of chicago so the airport that i go in and out of right now is chicagos oharethe busiest airport in the country in fact we believe about 77 million passengers are going to go through ohare this year77 million it is not uncommon obviously for me to go there and have extremely long wait times at the tsa unfortunately what we have seen more recently is these wait times continuing to buildto build so much that actually the wait time is longer than the flight itself which to me is completely unacceptable frankly the american public deserves a little bit more accountability over the past few weeks these long wait times obviously have been exacerbated so we have put on a bandaida patchto try to make sure that we have a little bit more staffing at some of these busiest of airports around the country and we have seen those wait times come down yet what we do know is that people are missing their flights people who have missed their flights at least in the last couple of weeks have been able to be put on flights without too much inconvenience if this were to happen this summer the chances are at least from the airlines they wouldnt be able to get on their flights for a week or more which could completely disrupt family vacations and the like the current screening procedures need to be updated to ensure that we protect passengers from terrorist threats and to make sure that passengers are screened in the most efficient manner possible this is really a twopronged approach in one my friend from mississippi talked about the faster act which is again trying to make sure that the resources that passengers pay are actually going toward the tsa to make sure that it has the manpower necessary to do the screening todays bill the checkpoint optimization and efficiency act will go a long way towards ensuring that the tsa updates the screening procedures to improve customer service at the nations busiest airports this bill will ensure that tsa position screeners are where they are needed most which i think is absolutely critical the bill will allow the tsa to reallocate k9 teams to the nations busiest airports or where they are needed k9 detecting teams are a vital tool in ensuring the quick and effective screening of passengers just this last week i was at ohare i went down and had an opportunity to talk with some of the k9 screeners in chicago one actually came from fairbanks alaska and the other one came in from cincinnati there is no question that there was a huge issue at ohare that needed to be rectified and what this legislation doesand the gentleman from new york proposeswill allow that flexibility to happen finally i want to just talk about the tsas federal security directors and making sure that they are placed at the busiest airports and have some of the flexibility that they need to make the staffing decisions that are best for the people the bill today i believe will go a long way toward alleviating the crisis at our busiest airports around the country and will help make sure that our hourslong wait times will be reduced and diminished i certainly
