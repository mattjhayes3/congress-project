budget act of 1974 as amended i am submitting for official letter to the speaker advising him of the current level of spending credit and revenues for fiscal year 1989 this is the first comprehensive report for fiscal year 1989 in the second session of the 100th congress the term current level refers to the estimated amount of budget authority outlays credit authority and revenues that are availableor will be usedfor the full fiscal year in question based only on enacted law current level reports are intended to provide members information to compare enacted spending and revenues with the aggregate ceilings on budget authority oullays and revenues established in a budget resolution and also to compare enacted legislation with the allocations of new discretionary budget authorily entitlement authority and credit authority made to a committee pursuant to subsection 302 a of the budget act this report compares the spending credit and revenue levels in current level with those assumed in the budget resolution for fiscal year 1989 house concurrent resolution 268 adopted on june 6 1988 current level reports provide information that is necessary for enforcing section 311 of the budget act subsection 311 a prohibits the consideration of a spending or revenue measure if the adoption of that measure would cause the ceiling on total now budget authority or total outlays set in the budget resolution for a fiscal year to be exceeded or would cause revenues to be less than the apii 7380 propriate level of revenues set in the budget resolution subsection 311 b provides an exception to the 311 a point of order for measures that would breach the ceilings on total spending set in the budget resolution but would not cause a committee to exceed its appropriate allocation of discretionary spending authority made pursuant to section 302 a of the budget act such an exception was first provided by the budget resolution for fiscal year 1985 house concurrent resolution 280 98th congress the exception was made pormanent by the amendments to the budget act included in the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 public law 99177 grammrudmanhollings this exception is intended to protect a committee that has stayed within its allocation of discretionary budget authority and new entitlement authority from points of order if the total spending ceilings have been breached for reasons outside of its control for fiscal year 1989 the 320 a allocations to house committees made pursuant to the conference report on house concurrent resolution 268 were printed in house report 100662 june 1 1988 section 311 c of the budget act provides that for purposes of enforcing section 311 the levels of new budget authority entitlement authority outlays and revenues shall be determined on the basis of estimates made by the committee on the budget current level reports represent partial fulfillment of this enforcement responsibility of the budget committee by providing both estimates of enacted aggregate spending and revenues and for purposes of determining the applicability of the section 311 b exception estimates of the relationship between the budgetary effect of enacted legislation within a committees jurisdiction and the allocation of spending authority made to that committee the estimates in this report are based on economic and technical assumptions in place at the time of the adoption of the budget resolution house concurrent resolution 268 on june 6 1988 this is intended to protect committees which acted on the basis of the assumptions of the budget resolution from changes in economic and technical factors over which they have no control unless the congress adopts a subsequent budget resolution for a fiscal year that alters the assumptions about legislative actions committees should be able to expect that measures that conform with the budget resolution will not be subject to points of order for violation of the budget act to do otherwise and base enforcement on constantly changing economic and technical estimates would seriously disrupt the legislative process penalize committees that are unable to complete work on legislation within a short period after adoption of a budget resolution and undermine respect for budget enforcement procedures in addition to section 311 the budget act contains another point of order that requires budget committee estimates for enforcement section 302 0 1 of the budget act prohibits the consideration of a measure providing new budget authority new entitlement authority or new credit authority if the adoption of that measure would cause a committee to exceed its allocation of new spending or credit authority made pursuant to subsection 302 b of the budget act the 302 b allocation is a subdivision of the new spending new entitlement and new credit authority allocated to a committee pursuant to section 302 a among either the subcommittees of that committee or among programs over which the committee has jurisdiction this point of order was added to the budget act by the amendments included in the balanced budget and emorgoncy deficit control act of 1985 section 302 g provides that the enforcement of section 302 shall be based on estimates of spending and credit authority made by the committee on the budget the budget committee fulfills this responsibility by providing as necessary a separate section 302 status report to the speaker for information purposes only current level reports will continue to include a comparison of the budget and credit authority divided among the appropriations subcommittees by that committeas 302 b division with the actual enacted spending and credit legislation within each subcommittees jurisdiction as chairman of the

support of h r 1777 the foreign relations authorization act fiscal years 1988 and 1989 this bill authorizes appropriations of 3 903 603 000 for 1988 and 4 596 109 000 for 1989 for the department of state the unitedstates information agency the board for international broadcasting and the asia foundation as chairman of the select committee on narcotics abuse and control i particularly want to offer my support for part d of title 1 of the bill relating to international narcotics control section 161 would require a minimum of two drug enforcement administration agents to be assigned to any unitedstates mission abroad where the secretary of state has determined that a dea office is needed the foreign affairs committee report on h r 1777 notes that this provision is intended to apply to existing dea posts abroad as well as to those opened after enactment of the bill the committee is concerned that the dea office in cairo where one agent is now responsible not only for egypt but also almost 30 other african countries be increased to at least two agents i agree wholeheartedly with this provision for reasons of safety and efficiency the assignment of no less than two dea agents to our dea offices abroad makes good sense section 162 broadens the existing requirement for quarterly state department reports to congress on the progress of the camarena case to include information on the case involving dea agent victor cortez jr too in february 1985 dea agent enrique camarena salazar and his pilot alfredo zavala avelar were kidnapped and murdered in mexico the foreign relations authorization act for fiscal years 1986 and 1987 included a requirement for quarterly reports to congress on the progress of the camarena investigation subsequently in august 1986 victor cortez was detained and tortured for several hours by mexican officials section 162 will require the quarterly reports on the camarena case to include information as well on the progress made in investigating and prosecuting those responsible for the cortez incident in testimony presented to the select committee on narcotics on march 25 of this year the state department said that a major suspect in the camarena killing was arrested in mexico recently nonetheless in the more than 2 years since the camarena and zavala murders there have been no prosecutions or convictions the lack of any real progress in this case justifies the continuing requirement for regular reports to congress on the camarena investigation and the intervening arrest and torture of victor cortez warrants the inclusion in this bill of the added requirement for periodic information on the progress of the cortez case section 163 of the bill requires that unitedstates missions in major illicit drug producing and trafficking nations give greater priority to the negotiation and implementation of effective extradition treaties to ensure that drug traffickers can be extradited to the united states for prosecution as the report by the foreign affairs committee points out extradition of a countrys citizens to stand trial in the united states on drug charges is a difficult bilateral issue to pursue ideally a country should have the means to investigate arrest prosecute and incarcerate its own nationals who are involved in illicit drug trafficking a major goal of unitedstates international narcotics control assistance should be to help major drug producing and transit nations develop this capacity extradition however can be an important tool the gentleman from new york who serves as the select committees ranking minority member and i recently returned from colombia where we represented the speaker at the meeting of the andean parliament we found that the government of colombia is virtually paralyzed in its narcotics enforcement efforts the drug trafficking organizations have declared war on colombia and are engaged in a campaign of fear violence and intimidation to prevent he government from moving against them arrests of major traffickers are rarely made because of fear and intimidation the civilian courts in colombia are unable to prosecute major drug traffickers the colombian supreme court has invalidated the authority for the military courts to prosecute drug cases extradition to the united states was the threat traffickers feared most but the colombian supreme court recently struck down the resolution implementing the extradition treaty with the united states colombia is but one example of a country that is unable to effectively prosecute drug dealers on its own similar problems exist in bolivia peru and other nations as well under these circumstances the negotiation and implementation of effective extradition treaties should be a high priority of our missions in major drug producing and trafficking countries as we try to help them develop their own investigative and prosecutional capacity i support the inclusion of section 163 in the bill finally section 164 requires the secretary of state to report to congress within 90 days on the status of a comprehensive information sharing system on drug arrests of foreign nationals this system is intended to ensure that foreign drug traffickers are denied visas to enter the united states the system was required to be set up under the foreign relations authorizations act for fiscal years 1986 and 1987 i supported the original establishment of this system and concur in the foreign affairs committees determination to require a full accounting from the executive branch as to the implementation of this system in closing i must take this opportunity to express my deep concern for a problem that is not being addressed by this legislation i am shamefully aware of the discriminatory hiring practices at the department of state the agency for international development and the unitedstates information agency despite the fact that in 1980 congress enacted legislation requiring the foreign service agencies to aggressively seek an increase in the numbers of blacks hispanics asianamericans and women hired in these agencies there has been an appalling decline in minority representation in our principal foreign affairs agencies while i will support this legislation because of my commitment to eradicating the international drug problem i must admit that i am not completely supportive of the measure i am dismayed by the committees lack of action on this particular issue and demand that immediate congressional attention be given to securing enforcement of the foreign service act of 1980"],

first passed the senate on july 23 1987 by unanimous consent that bill had three titles title i reauthorized the national center for health services research and health care technology assessment the national center for health statistics and several preventive health programs within the public health service act title ii created a national health service corps loan repayment program title iii revised and extended provisions dealing with the national health service corps the companion provisions to the three titles of s 1158 were dealt with in separate bills in the house of representatives on september 9 1987 the house passed by a vote of 397 to 9 the national health service corps legislation h r 1327 this bill contained provisions paralleling those in titles ii and iii of s 1158 the house then substituted the text of h r 1327 1 9480 as amended for the companion senate bill s 1158 on october 13 1987 the house passed by voice vote h r 3189 the health services research extension act of 1987 this bill contained provisions paralled to ones in title i of s because the two bills were not controversial the house energy and commerce committee and the senate labor and human resources committee decided to resolve the differences and incorporate the agreement into a senate amendment to s 1158 in lieu of holding a conference last tuesday october 27 1987 the senate passed by unanimous consent s 1158 after amending the house amendment with an amendment which represents the agreement between our two committees i urge the house to concur in the senate amendment and pass s 1158 as amended while this bill is not controversial its provisions are essential to public health in this country s 1158 would extend the authorizations for the national health service cdrps field program for 3 fiscal yearsfiscal years 198890at 65 million a year in addition the bill would extend the authorizations for the corps scholarship program and c reate a loan repayment program the authorizations for both programs is such sums as necessary the loan repayment program would pay off the loans that a doctor takes out to go to medical school in return the doctor would serve in a health manpower shortage area the national health service corps has always enjoyed bipartisan support in the congress it has an outstanding track record of placing doctors and other health professionals in medically underserved communities this fiscal year there are approximately 3 000 corps providers serving in rural and urban sites all over the country n the continuation of the corps is essential because the corps is the only federal program which attempts to provide needed health care professionals to underserved areas the corps is needed now and it will always be needed the areas served by the corps arc either so sparsely populated or have such a high incidence of poor people that the private practice of medicine is not economically viable the corps might appear to be on sound footing because there are approximately 3 000 corps providers now serving in health manpower shortage areas in fact the program is in a desperate situation without s 1158 the corps will decline to approximately 1 000 providers in 1990 and to 200 providers in 1993 as the members will recall it is because of this rapid decline in the size of the corps that the house bill contained a provision to attract those corps obligors who have breached their agreement to serve in the corps a special onetime provision was ineluded to relieve defaulters of thier current liability if they reenter the corps in fiscal year 1988 or fiscal year while the secretary is given a good deal of discretion in administering the provision the goal for the secretary is to maximize the number of corps defaulters who can be made available to provide much needed health care services in underserved areas for example the secretary is authorized to remove sitesfrom the supplemental health manpower shortage area placement opportunity list if those sites may reasonably be expected to recruit a health care professional the secretary should be sure that the sites have definite reliable sources for the needed professionals before striking them from the list if the supplemental list is compiled this way it will have the maximum number of sites from which defaulters can choose in addition the secretary should quickly establish a placement process for these defaulters that to the extent possible resembles the current placement process for corps scholarship obligors the congress should not turn its back on the millions of americans living in areas that are not attractive to private doctors s 1158 will provide the necessary authority to maintain this essential program s 1158 also reauthorizes for 3 years the programs of the national center for health services research and health care technology assessment the authorization of appropriations for the health services research center for fiscal year 1988 is 30 million and for fiscal years 1989 and 1990 is such sums as may be necessary the authorization of appropriations for the health statistics center is 55 million for fiscal year 1988 and such sums as may be necessary for fiscal years 1989 and 1990 the legislation continues the authority for the council on healthcare technology operated by the national academy of sciences it requires that at least the same amount of money from nonfederal as from federal sources be spent in fiscal year 1988 and fiscal year 1989 and at least twice the amount in fiscal year 1990 and subsequent years the duties of the national advisory council on health care technology assessment operated within the department ofhealth and human services are defined and the composition of the council is consolidated several periodic reports required under existing law are consolidated and research on rural health care is required the s 1158 also requires peer review of research proposals to the national center for health services research and health care technology assessment that parallels the peer review of the national institutes of health language in current law regarding the administrative location of the center is clarified by specifying that the center must retain its direct relationship with the office of the assistant secretary for health s 1158 further extends the authority of the federal childhood immunizations program for an additional 3 fiscal years the authorization of appropriations would be 94 million for fiscal year 1988 and such sums as may be necessary for both fiscal years 1989 and 1990 these funds would be available for grants to states to purchase vaccines that currently are approved and recommended for routine use by children including those to prevent polio measles mumps rubella diphtheria pertussis tetanus and childhood meningitis as well as to purchase those vaccines that may be approved and recommended for routine use after the date of enactment such as those to prevent chicken pox and an improved meningitis vaccine which are expected to be approved and recommended for routine use for children within the next 3 years with respect to these authorities s 1158 includes a provision that specifically prohibits states which receive grant funds for free vaccine from charging for that vaccine this provision has been included to ensure that no child be turned away from immunizations or be forced to postpone vaccination because of his or her ability to pay for a shot the imposition of charges for vaccine can only serve as a disincentive to parents for getting their children immunized a result that would prove detrimental to the great public health advances that have been made since the establishment of the federal immunization program it should be noted that this prohibition against charges for vaccine is not intended to prevent grantees from accepting voluntary donations from individuals who have received an immunization through a publicly supported vaccine program however donations may only be accepted if given completely freely and not as a condition of receipt of an immunization in addition to providing for these grant authorities the bill authorizes appropriations of such sums as may be necessary for the next 3 fiscal years for grant funds for states to assist them in paying for the expected increase in vaccine costs that would result from the imposition of an excise tax on childhood vaccines this tax would be used to support the childhood vaccine compensation trust fund established through the national vaccine injury compensation program title 21 of the public health service act the secretary of the department of health and human services is required to acquire and maintain a 6month supply of vaccines the authorization levels to carry out this activity would be 5 million in fiscal year 1988 and such sums as may be necessary for pension of the rules by a vote of 387 to both fiscal years 1989 and 1990 9

provision for the critical foreign languages program in the secretarys discretionary fund of the department of education while the second would establish presidential awards of excellence in the teaching of foreign languages i am very pleased to be joined by representative sawyer in introducing the first amendment and equally pleased to have your support and that of the ranking minority member for both measures the critical foreign languages program of the secretarys discretionary fund is a small but important component of the federal governments involvement in foreign language education at the elementary and secondary levels for the past 3 years this program has been allocated 2 million each year mostly for grants to fund a total of 70 foreign language programs at the elementary and secondary levels the types of programs funded are those that are superior in and of themselves or are good models mostly in the areas of teacher training and curriculum development for critical foreign languages this category officially includes a total of over 100 languages though there is a narrower category of the 11 most critical and a large portion of the programs are actually in just 3 languages chinese japanese and arabic there is a concentration on these three because among those languages critical to our national security and economic prosperity there is a special need for programs in these three most of the programs to date have been cooperative ventures between local schools and institutions of higher education in addition some money has gone directly to state education associations to aid in the development of statewide plans for foreign language curriculums the critical languages program has become one of the most effective among those funded by the secretarys discretionary fund and as i mentioned one of the best foreign language programs at the federal level nonetheless it was deleted from the school improvement act by the committee largely as i understand because the discretionary fund is mostly intended to fund math and science programs and because an option to spend money on foreign language programs would still be retained however historically nearly all the money in the discretionary fund not specifically earmarked for foreign languages has been used to meet pressing math and science needs while i applaud the increased attention to foreign languages recently demonstrated by congress in h r 3 the critical foreign languages program of the secretarys discretionary fund is much more valuable than its small funding level of approximately 2 million would suggest it is the only part of title iii specifically earmarked for foreign languages and departmental staff have ensured that these funds are used for innovative and solid programs eliminating critical foreign languages from the discretionary fund would mean that little or no title ii money would go toward foreign languages and a small but important portion of the federal governments foreign language program would be lost my amendment would add foreign languages to math and science as an eligible area for funding under section 2130 national programs of title iicritical skills improvement of the school improvement act it would in addition set aside 25 percent of the funds in national programs specifically for the improvement and expansion of instruction in critical foreign languages this amendment restores the status quo for this program before the drafting of h r 5 and would not increase the cost of h r 5 because funds would be taken out of those authorized for the entire program this amendment would guarantee the continuation of a small but important program focusing on languages essential to our security and economic wellbeing and therefore constitute a contribution to our country far in excess of the resources devoted to it my second measure would establish a system of presidential awards for teaching excellence in foreign languages in order to focus national attention on the critical need for foreign language teachers few people would i believe deny that such a pressing need exists in a recent survey by the national association of state supervisors of foreign language teachers 57 percent of the states responding reported a current shortage and almost 65 percent expect to experience such a shortage in the near future while considerable attention has been devoted to decreasing the shortage of teachers in other areas notably math and science important to our security and economic prosperity relatively little effort has been made to remediate a comparably great shortage of foreign language teachers my amendment which would add a new section 2135 to title iicritical skills improvement would take a small but significant step toward correcting this major deficiency in oureducational system a total of 104 awards would be made by the president to elementary and secondary teachers who have demonstrated outstanding teaching qualifications in the field of foreign languages at least one elementary and one secondary school teacher from each state as well as the district of columbia and puerto rico would be selected thereby ensuring attention across the nation to foreign language teachers the cost of this program would be 1 million for fiscal year 1988 with the necessary sums being allocated in subsequent years while this amendment would not actually create a new federal foreign language program these presidential awards would significantly add to the prestige of good foreign language teachers and thereby motivate a greater number of more highly qualified persons to become and remain foreign language teachers this would have significant value beyond the relatively small cost of the program as it is now difficult for many school districts across the country to attract and retain highly qualified foreign language instructors in general as i noted foreign language instruction has been neglected in favor of other critical skills given that the ease of learning a second language is inversely proportional to age it is discouraging to find that only 1 percent of students in our elementary schools receive any kind of foreign language training moreover a 198283 survey showed that only 21 3 percent of all high school students were enrolled in foreign language courses 88 percent of which were in spanish and french these distressing facts attest to the need to devote much more and higher quality attention to foreign languages especially at the elementary and secondary levels this measure would dramatically increase the prestige of teaching foreign languages and therefore help improve instruction in and attention to foreign languages in the crucial years to come global interdependency is a fact of life and america can no longer exist in this world wearing linguistic blinders the investment in our future national security and prosperity represented by these two measures is very minimal yet the stakes are high we must act now to put our foreign language and international education system back on track and these amendments represent small but significant steps

significant increase in drug abuse in the united states during this same time congress has responded with increased levels of spending to help combat the drug problem spending has risen from 82 million in 1969 to approximately 3 9 billion and 3 5 billion in 1987 and 1988 respectively i want to commend congressman ciharlie ranoe chairman of the select committee on narcotics abuse and control for his valuable and outspoken leadership in our war on drugs and in the formulation of this legislation today i also commend the different house committees of jurisdiction and their members for their hard work in putting together this legislation we can all be proud of the measure being considered here today it represents a strong step forward in our war on drugs and a renewed commitment to eliminate drugs from our streets and classrooms i am particularly proud of their provisions designed to reduce drug abuse among our young people and to make more readily available drug treatment facilities to all those in need in my district in the south bronx the incidence of youth participation in drug use and trafficking is alarming i therefore support the provisions in this bill that attempt to prevent drug abuse among our young people and attempt to reach out to members of youth gangs and juvenile delinquents to bring them into a more productive and meaningful life after world war ii there was a sharp increase in the use of heroin in our inner cities and more recently there has been an alarming increase in the use of cocaine and cocaine derivatives such as crack and rock in new york city alone there are an estimated 250 000 to 300 000 heroin addicts deaths due to cocaine abuse in the city have risen from 7 in 1983 to 92 in 1984 196 in 1985 and 287 in 1986 deaths due to aids among iv drug users has risen from 88 in 1983 to 293 in 1984 488 in 1985 and 1 000 in 1986 dug arrests in new york city are equally telling rising from 60 000 in 1985 and 69 500 in 1986 to over 80 000 in 1987 equally alarming is the fact that the increased use of drugs and especially the use of crack has involved population groups previously not associated with the problem this of course includes the tragic use of drugs and involvement in drug running by schoolage youth and adolescents today the problem has reached such crisis proportions that it comes as no surprise when we hear of youngsters in grammer school involved in drugs or when we hear of youth gang violence and law enforcement fatalities this simply cannot be allowed to continue we must make the full commitment necessary to eliminate drugs from our society the federal strategy in the war against drugs is multifaceted it includes initiatives to reduce the supply of drugs through drug and narcotics regulations and international control of drug production and trafficking it also includes initiatives to reduce the demand for drugs through education prevention treatment and rehab programs as well as programs funding research into drug dependency treatment and prevention the first major drug initiative the antidrug abuse act of 1986 increased spending by 1 7 billion for fiscal year 1987 this included new authorizations for state and local law enforcement and federal drug enforcement activities it also authorized new international narcotics control and drug interdiction activities as well as domestic drug abuse education treatment and research programs today and tomorrow congress will consider an omnibus drug bill which authorizes a total of 6 1 billion for new and existing programs this figure represents a 2 1 billion increase over amounts presently provided in fiscal year 1989 appropriation measures this new bill provides much needed funding for antidrug abuse education treatment and prevention programs it authorizes 30 million for drug abuse prevention targeting youth gangs and 15 million targeting runaway and homeless youth the legislation also authorizes 15 million for a national youth sports program and 10 million for drug abuse education in wic programs the drug bill will also provide funding for increased law enforcement and drug interdiction activities it authorizes 2 5 billion for a variety of enforcement and correctional programs in the department of justice and provides 346 million to the coast guard and 1 2 billion to the customs service for interdiction efforts it is essential that we do all that we can to stop the flow of drugs into our country and to address the problems associated with drug abuse and narcotics trafficking as chairman of the subcommittee on international finance trade and monetary policy i have carved out a role for the eximbank to make loans to democratic governments to reduce the production of drugs within their borders and the shipment of drugs into this country i also recommended the inclusion of a discretionary grant program for the expansion of existing drug treatment facilities and a special research and treatment program to address the growing problem of infant addiction this war against drugs is ongoing we are not nearly done and therefore we must not let up our effort we must work towards positively influencng young people in their attitudes towards illegal drugs and providing them with alternatives that will lead them into productive lives no level of funding or amount of commitment is too great in this war on drugsthis fight for our youth and our future it requires a participation by all of us today as we begin the debate on the omnibus drug initiatives act of 1988 we move

atlantic striped bass conservation act and emergency striped bass study for fiscal years 1989 through 1991 and for other purposes the house previously has passed h r 4124 as amended the other body has now approved the measure in a somewhat different version and all of the changes are acceptable to the committee on merchant marine and fisheries when we previously considered this measure in july i referred to the serious decline of important stocks of striped bass that led congress to authorize the emergency striped bass study in 1979 this continuing study investigates the causes of the decline and monitors the abundance and distribution of striped bass i also referred to the importance of the atlantic striped bass conservation act this act promotes the restoration and management of depleted populations of striped bass by encouraging the states to implement consistent and effective management programs within their respective jurisdictions the measure before us today will allow these important programs to continue thus benefiting all of the coastal states testimony before by committee now suggests that the act is beginning to reverse the decadelong decline in stripped bass populations not all states have noted striped bass recoveries however north carolina for instance is still experiencing a serious decline of this important species in response to this continued decline i previously had offered an amendment of special interest to north carolina to h r 4124 which directed that a study be conducted of the status of striped bass in the albemarleroanoke river area of north carolina and the causes of their decline in that region it is of particular satisfaction to me that while the north carolina striped bass study had been slightly modified by the other body the study remains essentiallythe same as first proposed by the house the fishing industry has always been a critical economic mainstay of the first district of north carolina and striped bass has always been one of the most important species in that industry it is of utmost importance to my district and to the nation to seek a better understanding of the threats to the striped bass resources of the albemarle soundroanoke river area of the state and to eliminate those threats the reasons for the decline of striped bass in this area are unclear but probably include the cumulative effect of reduced and altered waterflows water pillution fishing and changed land use activities there is therefore an urgent need to centralize and review existing data and generate new biolgical information on the reasons for the decline to make recommendations to arrest the decline and to begin to restore our striped bass stocks we must look not only to the past but we must also anticipate reasonably foreseeable future land and water uses and evaluate their likely impact on our goal of restoring stripped bass stocks we must act quickly as i stated in july of particular concern are plans for additional diversions of water from the roanoke river and the continued deterioration of water quality in albemarle sound because of the fragile condition of the stripped bass populations in the area even shall changes in the condition of the roanoke river could have major consequences for the survival of such populations for the duration of the north carolina striped bass study authorized by this section it is our intent that state and federal agencies should exercise caution so that actions are not taken or authorized which may contribute further to the decline of striped bass whenever possible additional conservation actions should be taken to enhance the recovery of striped bass resources including to the maximum extent possible maintaining adequate instream flows in the roanoke river the other bodys version of h r 4124 that we are considering today differs somewhat from the housepassed bill but the intent remains the same the study will be under the primary direction of the unitedstates fish and wildlife service in consultation with the national marine fisheries service with invited state agency participation particularly the north carolina division of marine fisheries and the north carolina wildlife resources commission moreover interested citizen and industry groups are to be consulted throughout the course of the study the study will include a biological description of the study area and will focus on current and reasonably foreseeable land and water uses that may have an effect on the striped bass population of the area of particular importance is the examination of adverse impacts during the most vulnerable stages of the striped bass life cycle including spawning that might be caused cumulatively by factors such as water withdrawals discharges and flows fishing and the combined effects of pollution and other alterations of the physical environment the study will also examine changes in management regimes and regulations that might be necessary to improve the status of the striped bass stocks the measure before us today would require completion of the study as soon as practicable but no later than 36 months after the date of enactment this is twice as long as the 18 months provided by the original house bill i would like to note that the longer period may be necessary only for certain aspects of the study i believe that as soon as practicable certainly means less than 36 months the committee on merchant marine and fisheries expects to receive periodic reports to enable careful monitoring of the progress of the study and to assure that the final report is received truly as soon as practicable although i agree with some of the observations made by senator warner in his statement on s 2384 on tuesday october 4 i must disagree with him with respect to the intent of this legislation and its impact on the lake gaston project first neither this legislation nor my original bill had any retroactive effect on the project there was and is no retrospective effect because the matter has been remanded to the corps of engineers to comply with the nation al environmental policy act second nothing in this legislation nor in my original bill was or is intended to alter the provisions of nepa the clean water act or their implementing regulations third neither this legislation nor my original bill determined whether the lake gaston project ultimately should or should not go forward fourth both my original bill and the bill before us today strongly state that it is national policy to preserve and enhance the rapidly diminishing stock of striped bass in the roanokealbemade area prior to this legislation no such national policy existed i do not know whether the eis and study will ultimately support building the pipeline until the results of the study are available however i do know that the corps of engineers should not issue the required section 404 permit the purpose of this legislation is to require the federal agencies to conduct an adequate study first and not act precipitously in the absence of the required results of the study finally it is important to note that this striped bass study is not to be viewed as a substitute for any environmental impact statement which i believe is required under the national environmental policy act for the lake gaston water division project rather the study is intended to supplement the environmental impact statement process indeed it seems to me no analysis of the impacts on striped bass by the proposed lake gaston water withdrawal can be complete or adequate without the results of the study authorized in this bill i also want to note that ongoing activities by the east coast states and the two federal fishery agencies under the emergency striped bass study section 7 d of the anadromous fish conservation act continue to serve a very necessary role in coastwide striped bass conservation and restoration programs i do not intend that the north carolina striped bass study detract in any way from or use any funds appropriated for the emergency striped bass study in closing i urge my colleagues to support h r 4124 as passed by the other body"], [0.41176700592041016, 0.5882329940795898, 1, "i am pleased to speak in favor of the motion for a compromise bill responding to the senates legislation to renew the priceanderson act i must begin by thanking chairman udall the gentleman from south carolina mr butler derrick and chairman dingeil for their tireless efforts to enact this important legislation i also would like to thank chairman roe and the minority for their cooperation and contributions the effort to renew priceanderson has been lengthy and sometimes difficult in fact it was over a year ago that the priceanderson act expired for the first time since its enactment in 1957 fortunately both the nuclear utility industry and the department of energy contractors who rely on priceanderson have been able to make do without the acts protections on an interim basis pending the conclusion of this legislation effort however as the session draws to a close the need to renew the priceanderson act has become pressing first and foremost this legislation is important to the public there are 110 nuclear reactors in operation today many of them run by utilities which do a good job of producing essential power supplies at reasonable cost safety is the constant goal in these operations and i hope that we never see an accident of the magnitude the priceanderson act was designed to respond to august 2 1 988 however should there be an accident it is essential that the priceanderson acts protections be available to the public in the case of a relatively small utility accident such as three mile island the acts public compensation scheme provides a ready proven system for responding to the immediate needs of families forced to evacuate their homes in the case of a larger accident this legislation makes up to 7 billion available to compensate the public for personal and property damage and improves the procedures for compensating damages in excess of that amount the new 7 billion compensation fund represents a tenfold increase over the amount under the old act and is far more in line with current economic realities than the existing 700 million limit moreover the priceanderson act and this renewal legislation provides the public with a significantly easier road to recovery in court under normal tort law procedures accident victims often must prove negligence against large corporations few ordinary citizens have the resources or the ability to await compensation that would be required in order to bring suit against a major utility this bill retains the priceanderson acts unique nofault system which enables victims to bypass the more onerous aspects of tort litigation i am aware that some of my colleagues are disappointed that the 7 billion compensation responsibility imposed on the utility industry is not greater or indeed that any liability limit was retained i too supported a higher figure and fought in the interior committee for a higher amount while i understand this sentiment i strongly believe that it should not prevent members concerned about the publics welfare from supporting this bill there simply is no substitute for the combined advantages of the large assured compensation fund and the ease of recovery afforded under the traditional priceanderson act and improved upon in this bill in addition this bill clarifies the priceanderson acts application to accidents involving highlevel nuclear waste and guarantees 7 billion in compensation for the public the department of energy currently oversees the storage of vast amounts of defense waste and over the course of this renewal of the act may begin disposing of waste from commercial generators in the repository now under development similarly the bill increases from 500 million to 7 billion the amount of compensation provided fur victims of an accident involving doe defense production facilities great strides have been made toward improving the oversight and safety of these essential components of our defense system but the recognition of problems at these facilities only underscores the need for adequate compensation in the event of an accident with respect to the department of energys defense operations is it absolutely essential that we enact this renewal legislation as soon as possible private companies now negotiating with doe have warned that they will not sign contracts without priceandersons indemnification authority these contracts concern facilities which are of critical importance to our weapons program such as the pinellas plant in florida the savannah river plant in south carolina and brookhayen national laboratory in the new york finally i would like to speak briefly to three amendments we are proposing to the senate under this bill and to the procedure we are using today it has been nearly a year since the house reported its bill and 4 months since the senate reported a bill the two bills are substantially similar and many of the differences have not been difficult to resolve however three of the amendments the senate attached to the house bill are noteworthy and have been modified somewhat in the substitute we are voting on today first the substitute proposes an even split between the house and senate provision on the length of the acts renewal the house favored the traditional 10year renewal while the senate proposed to extend the act for 20 years the substitute would renew the act for 15 years and i am satisfied this is a fair result the second amendment i would like to address is the senates civil penalties provision as my colleagues may recall i supported an amendment which the house did not adopt to permit doe to impose civil penalties on contractors that violate safety regulations the senates inclusion of a similar provision has required the house to consider the matter for a second time and the substitute bill would largely recede to the senate on this point while the provision is less stringent than i would prefer i believe the compromise the substitute is valuable and worthy of our support the third senate provision i would like to address the question of indemnifying nuclear pharmacies has proven particularly controversal i am pleased that in developing the substitute we reached informal agreement with our colleagues in the senate who are most concerned with this topic i have not supported extending a federal indemnity to this industry and have grave reservations about committee government funds in this manner however in the interest of moving the legislation i am willing to support the compromise which directs the nuclear regulatory commission to conduct a negotiated rulemaking on the issue i note that the compromise does no more than require the commisison to consider the matter and that it clearly reserves the final decision to the commissions sole discretion finally while the procedure set forth in the rule is somewhat unusual i feel it is the best avenue at this late date in the session to ensuring that a priceanderson bill is enacted this year this approach has been coordinated with and is supported by both the majority and the minority on the interior and commerce committees i recognize that this bill may not be ideal from anyones point of view however i think we should take satisfaction from the fact that it is very good solid renewal of a much needed law the priceanderson act has served both the public and private industry involved in our energy and defense sectors well this bill introduces many important improvements to the priceanderson act and we can ill afford to risk letting it lapse any longer i thank my colleagues for their attention and urge them to support this important legislation"], [0.4119555354118347,

house passed on june 29 1988 it makes minor changes with the bill most of them technical and all of the major provisions remain of the bill we passed the fair housing act title viii of the civil rights act of 1968 was the final chapter in the great series of civil rights laws enacted in the 1960s the fair housing act states categorically that it is the policy of the united states to provide for fair housing throughout the country but despite this proclamation fair housing remained just a dream for too many ameritns because the law lacked an effective enforcement mechanism today 20 years later the fair housing amendments act marks a turning point in our nations commitment to eradicating discrimination in housing it is the most important civil rights advancement since the mid1960s h r 1158 marks a historic change in three important areas it goes beyond the mere statement of principles on fair housing and creates an effective and meaningful enforcement system it also extends protections to individuals with handicaps and families with children the senatepassed bill differs only slightly from the housepassed bill all of the changes are outlined below the provisi3 regarding restoring modifications to rental property made by handicapped persons is clarified language is added to the section on adaptability and accessibility requirements for covered new multifamily dwellings to encourage state and local governments to review for compliance with these requirements when they review and approve building plans and construction a technical amendment is made to the bills language providing for a transition period for state and local fair housing agencies to make it clear that agencies given interim certifications of hud are covered by the provision the authority to litigate fair housing cases is consolidated in the justice department while it is made clear that the department is required to bring cases authorized by the secretary under the bills provisions regarding prompt judicial action and regarding federal court enforcement of cases in which a party to an administrative proceeding elects to have the charge heard in federal court technical amendments are made to the bills provisions giving parties to administrative proceedings the right to have charges arising out of those proceedings heard in federal court the exemption for housing for older persons from the bills provisions banning discrimination on the basis of familial status are modified a provision is added to the housing for older persons exemption to make it clear that occupants of housing that currently excludes children will not be taken into account in applying the requirements for the exemptions so long as futare occupants meet the requirements the bills provision regarding familial status is clarified to confirm that pregnant women and per ms adopting minor children are covere by the provision the provision not prohibiting conduct against a person convicted of the illegal manufacture or distribution of a controlled substance is changed the bill clarifies that the handicap provisions shall not apply to an individual solely because that individual is a transvestite these changes made by the senate do not significantly alter the house passed bill the important improvements to the enforcement system remainadministrative enforcement with a right to a trail by jury protections for individuals with handicaps and families with children continue to be included i would however like to address two of the most notable differences litigation authority and families with children the senate passed version of h r 1158 moves litigation authority from the department of housing and urban development to the department of justice a similar amendment was offered but not adopted during house consideration of the bill by my friend from pennsylvala mr gekas in the house bill the amendment offered by mr fish and adopted 4010 restructured the enforcement provisions to provide both an administrative process or access to a federal jury trail for any party to a housing discrimination complaint in either instance the case would be brought and maintained by hud attorneys the fish amendment reflected month of negotiation and compromise the fis package put litigation authority in hud transferring litigation authority to the justice department may create distinctions in federal agency responsibilities between hud and the justice department in fair housing cases the senate bill transfers litigation authority to the justice department in cases where an election is made to go to federal court this divides the responsibility for handling these often routine cases between the two departments depending on wich type of formal adjudication the parties elected the substantive law discovery and evidentiary standards will be the same in either forum transferring the authority to litigate the housing discrimination cases in midstream may defeat consistency and hamper the development of an effective body of expertise within hud instead of having hud bring the case from start to finish investigating the complaint drafting the discrimination charge and litigating the case the justice department now a ugutst 8 1988 64197 picks up the case if an election for judicial enforcement is made i trust that the department of justice will develop sufficient emphasis in litigation of fair housing cases to be effective in handling individual claims of discrimination the civil rights division of the justice department has a broad mandate to address problems of discrimination in many different contexts because fair housing cases will constitute only a fraction of the discrimination cases handled by the justice department the possibility exists that individual cases of housing discrimination may not receive the focus needed to address the national problem of housing discrimination i expect the justice department to vigorously pursue these cases the other change made is to the families with children provision and the exemption for housing for older persons from the time we introduced the bill we recognized the special needs of senior citizens and exempted certain senior citizen communities from the families with children requirement during the life of this bill this exemption has undergone refinements we went from exempting bona fide retirement communities to creating a detailed exemption of either where all the residents of the community are 62 or older or where at least 90 percent of the units have at least one person 55 or older and the community provides significant facilities and services to meet their physical or social needs the senate passed bill further refines and clarifies the second part of this standard by requiring at least one person 55 or older per unit in determining whether a community qualifies for this exemption the secretary of hud is required to develop regulations including at least the following factors first that at least 80 percent of the units are occupied by persons 55 or older second the publication of and adherence to policies and procedures which demonstrate an intent to provide housing for persons 55 or older and third the existence of sig nificant facilities and services specifically designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons if the provision of facilities and services is not practicable then the community must provide important housing opportunities for older persons development of regulations by the secretary of hud will be an important step in implementing this exemption this section is not intended to provide a broad exemption for the provision of facilities and services in order to show that the provision of significant facilities and services is not practicable owners managers and developers of housing for older persons have a heavy burden to satisfy in order to meet the showing of impracticability a demonstration must be made that providing significant facilities and services would result in depriving low and moderate income older persons of needed and desired housing the fact that the facilities and service are expensive to provide is not alone sufficient to meet the standard of impracticability this standard cannot be satisfied only by estimates of increased costs business inefficiency or loss of profit independent and objective evidence must be provided to establish impracticability mere opinion that the provision of such facilities and services is impracticable is not sufficient in addition the housing must be shown to provide important housing opportunities for older persons affordable housing for older persons of low or moderate incomes must not be otherwise available in the community hud should use its expertise in dealing with affordable housing to develop standards to carry out the intent of this section the senate bill also adds a transition provision for existing residents of communities providing housing for older persons thus no person currently living in such a community will be forced to move out of their homes and the exemption for the community will not be jeopardized air speaker i support both of these additional modifications to the housing for older persons exemption the senate bills refinements of the exemption are constructive additions to the bill the 80 percent requirement provides flexibility for communities to maintain its exempt status when qualified older residents leave a unit due to death or disability for example and persons living with the older person such as a spouse or companilon remain these persons will be able to continue to live in the unit i am pleased that following the house passage of this bill by an overwhelming vote of 378 to 23 the administration finally bowed to the inevitable and decided that it too hard should find a way to support the bill its been a long long trail for them beginning with the opposition of the justice department in 1981 and continuing until just after the house vote all during the judiciary committees consideration of this bill the justice department opposed the bill of fering no positive alternative of its own during house consideration of the bill negative signals were sent up to us via messages from the white house and very damaging amend ments were given to senior republicans placing the bill in peril until the very end however in the last few days compromises were made the changes that were subsequently negotiated in the senate do not do substantial harm to the bill and led to a 94 to 3 victory in the senate i am pleased that at the end of this long 10year battle we were able to gain the administrations support i want to thank the many players in the long campaign to make the fair housing amendments act a reality not surprisingly the many civil rights and fair housing organizations have worked diligently and in the trenches for over 10 years to get this bill enacted but just as notable has been the support of the housing and real estate industry these organizations realize that fair housing is good for america and their efforts showed that fair housing is not just rhetoric but good policy the national association of realtors in 1980 our opponents in 1988 became our allies their leadership both nationally and in the washington office should be saluted for their efforts to work out a fair and just solution to the issue of fair housing enforcement and the national association of horne builders provided unvaluable support and counsel especially related to the provisions regarding the handicapped i want to thank my committee colleagues for their strong and bipartisan support and want to salute two key members of the committee the support and vision of key sponsor and coauthor of the bill my good friend and colleague iiamilton fishi jr made enactment of h r 1158 a reality and the chairman of committee pmer w rodirio jr now in his last term in the congress who was here and led us through all the great civil rights struf gles in the congress always provided us with the support necessary to enact this bill we will miss his leadership in this body i also want to thank my staff catherine leroy and stuart ishlimaru for their hard work and many hours working on this bill and as always i deeply appreciate the cooperation and assistance

act it has been 4 years since the supreme court ruled in grove city college versus bell that federal antidiscrimination laws apply only narrowly to particular federally supported programs and not to recipient institutions as a whole while the grove city case specifically applied to title ix of the education amendments of 1972 the ruling has been interpreted to include section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 the age discrimination act of 1975 and title vi of the civil rights act of 1964 as the result women minorities the disabled and the elderly have been denied the protection which congress specifically intended them to receive clearly the court misinterpreted the intent of congress and we have been working ever since to clarify the coverage of those laws in june 1984 the house voted overwhelmingly in favor of legislation overturning the grove city decision unfortunately the reagan administration launched a fullscale attack against the bill and it was never brought up in the senate the real turning point occurred in 1985 when the unitedstates catholic conference issued a memo suggesting that the new proposal could force catholic teaching hospitals receiving federa assistance to perform abortions since then the civil rights restoration act has been tangled up as so many bills have been in the last few years over the abortion question when the senate considered the restoration act last month antiabortion senators were prepared to defeat the bill if restrictive language was not included and when the bill was finally adopted by that body that victory was tempered by the approved abortion language the danforth amendment specifies that institutions receiving federal aid are not required to provide or pay for abortions this language effectively supersedes existing regulations dating from 1972 that require educational institutions receiving federal aid to treat pregnancy childbirth and termination of pregnancy and recovery therefrom in the same manner and under the same policies as any other temporary disability where leave health services or insurance are concerned i am very disappointed that this congress in its effort to clarify and extend antidiscrimination laws must allow restricted access to legally protected medical care in permitting hospitals receiving federal funds to deny provision of abortion services the congress is actually sanctioning other form of discrimination this is a very regretful act but one it seems that is unavoidable at this time while i feel very strongly that a womans right to abortion includes the pilot of access to abortion services it is imperative that passage of the civil rights restoration act not be delayed any longer in these last few years during which congress has been divided over the scope of coverage under the law the rights of women minorities and disabled and elderly americans have been put on hold in the grove city case the supreme court unanimously held that financial aid dollars reaching a college through its students constituted federal financial assistance to the school the scope of duty not to discriminate however was defined narrowly by the court the court determined that student financial aid money only reached the schools financial aid office therefore only that office had to comply with federal antidiscrimination law as the result hundreds of discrimination cases have been dropped because the offending office or activity was deemed not in direct receipt of federal funds tho office for civil rights in the department of education one of the primary agencies responsible for enforcement of these basic civil rights laws has closed title ix title vi section 504 and age discrimination cases of lack of jurisdiction in all the office of civil rights has closed or scaled back the investigation of 674 sex discrimination cases since the grove city ruling court mandated desegregation efforts have also come to a halt the subcommittee on human resources and intergovernmental relations which i chair recently held hearings on illegal racial discrimination at a number of southern universities and colleges as a result of that investigation the government operations committee issued a report entitled failure and fraud in civil rights enforcement by the department of education the committee concluded that 10 southern and border states are in violation of title vi of the civil rights act because they have not completely eliminated the remnants of previously illegal systems of higher education that separated students by race unfortunately under grove city the victims of racial discrimination have little form of redress late last year a title vi discrimination suit brought by the justice department against the university of alabama was blocked by a federal court of appeals which applied grove city versus bell to it as the result of this and similar rulings the effort to desegregate our nationss schools which began in 1954 has come to a screeching halt enforcement efforts have also been gutted at other federal agencies the office of civil rights at the department of health and human services and the department of housing and urban developments office for fair housing and equal opportunity report that they too have severely cut liack investigation of compliants by returning for four financial assistance civil rights statutes to their pregrove city status the congress will be renewing its commitment to fairness and equality at the same time we will be making certain that the next administration does not have an excuse to ignore its responsibility to enforce vital antidiscrimination laws i was very pleased that with the exception of the danforth amendment all of the weakening amendments proposed in the senate were defeated by large margins i am hopeful that the house will follow with passage of an equally strong bill and that it will be received favorably by the president at this time i would like to address specifically an amendment added by the senate regarding coverage of individuals with contagious diseases and infections under section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 it is important to note that this amendment was added to clarifyand not modifythe current section 504 requirements applicable to such individuals the need for a clarification arises from a misplaced response by some employers to the recent supreme court decision in school board of nassau county versus arline although often misunderstood the supreme courts recent decision interpreting and applying section 504 does not require that entities covered under the section take unwarranted risks in hiring and retaining individuals with contagious diseases who pose a direct threat to the health and safety of others or who cannot perform the essential functions of a job the supreme court made that point very clearly in the arline decision see school board of nassau county v arline 107 s ct 1123 n 16 1987 a person who poses a significant risk of communicating an infectiou3 disease to others in the workplace will not be otherwise qualified if reasonable accommodation will not eliminate that risk nevertheless some employers have reacted to the supreme court decision by expressing the unfounded concern that they could be required to hire or retain an individual who has a contagious disease or infection and for whom no reasonable accommodation could eliminate the significant risk of such an individual transmitting the disease to others in response the senate amendment clearly sets forth the basic standardof section 504 that effectively precludes imposing such a requirement on employers the language of the amendment is purposely patterned after a similar amendment adopted by congress in 1978 at that time many employers had similar unjustified concerns that they could be forced to hire or retain individuals who were alcohol or drug users and who could not perform the essential functions of a job or who posed a threat to others the 1978 amendment provided that the term handicapped individual did not include any individual who is an alcoholic or drug abuser whose current use of alcohol or drugs prevents such individual from performing the duties of the job in question or whose employment by reason of such current alcohol or drug abuse would constitute a direct threat to property or the safety of others during the legislativ debate on the 1978 amendment many m mbers of congress pointed out that the therwise qualified standard of section 504 slready ensured that no such requirement could be placed on employers nevertheless congress enacted the amendment to reassure employers regarding the existing section 504 protections thereby avoiding a categorical exclusion of alcohol and drug users from the protections of the statute the senate amendment included in the civil rights restortation act which is patterned after the 1978 amendment thus specifies that for purposes of sections 503 and 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 as such sections relate to employment the term individual with handicaps does not include an individual who has a currently contagious disease or infection and who by reason of such disease or infection would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals or who by reason of the currently contagious disease or infection is unable to perform the duties of the job the basic manner in which individuals with contagious diseases and infections can present a direct threat to the health or safety of others in the workplace is if there is a significant risk that the individual could transmit the contagious disease or infection to other individuals in such circumstances the individual is not otherwise qualified to remain in that particular position the supreme court in arline explicitly recognized this necessary limitation in the protections of section 504 the senate amendment places that standard in statutory languagethereby hopefully allaying any misplaced concerns on the part of employers it is important to note the aspects that this amendment does not change first the amendment does nothing to change the requirements in the regulations and caselaw regarding providing reasonable accommodations for persons with contagious diseases or infections thus if a reasonable accommodation would eliminate the existence of a direct threat or an individuals inability to perform the essential duties of a job the individual is qualified to remain in his or her position second the twostep process of section 504 should continue to apply in cases involving individuals with contagious diseases and infections that is a court must first determine whether a plaintiff is protected under the statute under the traditional threepart definition of individual with handicaps under the statute the court mi st then determine whether the individual is otherwise qualified to hold the particular position at issue in the case before it in his dissent in the arline case justice rehnquist stated that congress should have stated explicitly that individuals with contagious diseases were intended to be covered under section 504 congress has done so now with this amendment stating clearly that individuals with contagious diseases or infections are protected under the statute as long as they meet the otherwise qualified standard this clarity is particularly important with regard to infections because individuals who are suffering from a contagious infectionsuch as carriers of the aids virus or carriers of the hepatitis b viruscan also be discriminated against on the basis of their infection and are also individuals with handicaps under the statute see e g local 1812 american federation of govomment employees v unitedstates department of state 662 f supp 50 d d c 1987 hivinfection ray v school district of desoto county 666 f supp 1524 m d fla 1987 hivinfection new york state association for retarded children v carey 612 f 2d 644 ca2 1979 hepatitis b carrier as the senate amendment now restates in statutory terms such individuals are also not otherwise qualified if without reasonable accommodation they would pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others or could not perform the essential functions of a job because of the importance of these protections public health leaders have called for vigorous enforcement of section 504 with regard to cases involving aids and infection with the aids virus the national academy of sciences in its authoritative report confronting aids specifically pointed out the importance of section 504 as a means to fight medically unjustified discrimination the committee believes that discrimina tlion against persons who have aids or who are infected by hiv is not justified and it encourages and supports laws prohibiting discrimination in employment and housing as formal expressions of public policy the committee also supports a federal policy to include aids as a handicapping condition under the federal law prohibiting improper discrimination against the handicapped the congress noted in 1978 with regard to alcohol and drug users that the addition of an amendment was unnecessary in light of current law nevertheless rather than exclude categorically a group of individuals we added a provision to reassure employers regarding the requirements that currently existed in law to protect public health and safety that same purpose motivates the inclusion of this amendment i support the civil rights restoration act with this amendment because it continues to maintain the proper balance that currently exists between protecting the public health and private rights i urge adoption of the bill march

the house education and labor committee i am proud to be a cosponsor of what is clearly the most significant measure affecting elementary and secondary education to be considered this decade this conference agreement reauthorizes through fiscal year 1993 nearly all major federal elementary secondary and adult education programs these programs include chapter 1the largest federal aid program to elementary and secondary schools chapter 2 education block grants adult education bilingual education and impact aid i am particularly pleased that the agreement authorizes a major new federal grant program for gifted and talented children i was proud to have authored the provisions establishing this grant program which is a critical component of our overall effort to raise the level of americas competitiveness in the world marketplace clearly if our nation is to regain its competitive edge we must work to better fulfill the vast potential of our schoolchildren the greatest potential of all lies with our nations gifted and talented students unfortunately though these same students are also some of our most neglected gifted children are intellectually advanced creative people who possess great curiosity often however these children are bored or unresponsive have poor grades or may become disciplinary problems as schools fail to provide the attention and resources gifted and talented children need to fulfill their potential this conference agreement would respond effectively to this very serious deficiency in our educational system by authorizing 20 million in fiscal year 1989 and such sums as may be necessary in fiscal years 1990 through 1993 for a new program of grants to states school districts institutions of higher education and other private and public agencies to support programs that identify and meet the needs of gifted and talented students this is in stark contrast to the fact that we are presently spending less than 5 per child in federal funds to support the approximately 2 million brightest and most promising of our nations students the results of this serious neglect were reported by the national commission on excellence in education in a study entitled a nation at risk the report noted that over half of the gifted students do not match their tested ability with comparable achievement in school and that both the number and proportion of students demonstrating superior achievement in the scholastic aptitude test have also dramatically declined their recommendation the federal government in cooperation with states and localities should help meet the needs of key groups of students such as the gifted and talented is now being acted upon and its about time another key provision in the conference agreement which i was also proud to author creates workplace literacy partnership grants designed to improve employees productivity by improving their literacy skills this grant program is authorized at 30 million in fiscal 1988 31 5 million in 1989 and such sums as necessary thereaftrer these funds will support adult education programs which teach literacy skills needed in the workplace activities will be supported that assist in the completion of a high school diploma or its equivalent help meet the literacy needs of adults with limited english proficiency improve the competency of adult workers in speaking listening reasoning or problem solving and provide education counseling the need for such a program is overwhelming quite simply this nation is facing perhaps the most severe trade crisis in our history yet i believe we have been losing sight of the most important factor in influencing americas competitive posture in world tradethe education of our citizens we must provide services to our workers so they can function effectively within a rapidly changing economy and who can adapt to the everchanging environment of the workplace simply consider this very telling fact according to a recent study by the national assessment of educational progress 43 percent of persons ages 21 through 25 are unable to perform at a level sufficient to master multistep directions communicate ideas and directions to other workers or calculate at a level needed for high technology occupations the workplace literacy grant program contained in this conference agreement will help to correct this very serious problem there are many other important provisions in this agreement most notably the reauthorization of the chapter 1 compensatory education program which seeks to meet the special educational needs of lowincome and disadvantaged children central to the chapter 1 reauthorization is the concentration grant provision which will focus additional resources and services on those areas most in need special efforts were made to ensure that these concentration grants are distributed equitably among the states other provisions that i believe merit special attention are those providing for impact aid and bilingual education both of which are vitally important to my home state of new york i am also very pleased ith the new dropout prevention and reentry program authorized under this agreement the agreement specifically provides for 50 million to fund demonstration projects on ways to prevent students from dropping out of school and to encourage those who have dropped out to return and finish school the dropout problem has long plagued new york city schools and this has been a special concern to me i am pleased to note that this grant program places a special emphasis on areas with a high dropout rate i want to commend my good friend from illinois for his exemplary leadership in this matter there is perhaps no greater threat to the future of our great nation that drug abuse and this legislation recognizes that fact the agreement extends the authorization for the drug abuse education programs of the drugfree schools and communities act of 1986 it authorizes 250 million in fiscal year 1989 and such sums as may be necessary in fiscal years 1990 through 1993 for drug and alcohol education prevention and early intervention programs we can all be very proud of the legislative product before us today we are making a very substantial investment in the future of our countryan investment that should yield a very high rate of return i wish to close by commending the

surface transportation and uniform relocation assistance act of 1987 on january 21 the house passed h r 2 by the overwhelming vote of 401 to 20 at that time we were concerned that if the congress was unable to enact highway and transit legislation quickly the 1987 construction season would be in jeopardy and 813 000 jobs would hang in the balance with that sense of urgency we proceeded to conference with the other body to work out a compromise piece of legislation after less than a month of complex negotiations we are pleased to bring back a conference report that puts americas highway and transit programs back in business i believe the house conferees have done a good job of representing the interests of the members of this body the conference report provides a 5year 68 billion extension of the nations mass transit programs it also extends highway safety programs and provides uniform standards for the relocation assistance of those displaced by federally assisted construction projects the conference agreement provides sufficient funding to complete the interstate 4r primary secondary urban and bridge programs in current law creates an interstate 4r discretionary account to fund high cost rehabilitation projects on the interstate continues the current mass transit formula and discretionary programs and extends the highway trust fund and highway user fees for 5 years to fund the highway and discretionary mass transit programs during the course of our negotiations with the other body several contentious issues evolved among these issues were buy america highway beautification toll financing of federalaid highway projects the funding of demostration projects and the speed limit while prolonged discussion and debate of any one of these issues could have resulted in serious delays in reaching a conference agreement the conferees recognized the urgent need for the bill and quickly worked out their differences it was in this spirit of negotiation and compromise that the chairman of our committee mr howard removed a major obstacle for consideration of this conference report as you are undoubtedly aware the speed limit became perhaps the most controversial issue ofthe conference chairman howard has very strong personal views in favor of maintaining the current speed limit he could have tried to use the current highway transit funding crisis as a leverage on the senate to drop its provision which would allow states to raise their speed limit to 65 miles per hour on rural interstates however he has chosen a better course of action one that allows us to pass this urgently needed highway transit legislation without further delay and one which will allow the house to consider separately and work its will on the extremely emotional and controversial issue of the national speed limit i would like to publicly commend the chairman for his personal efforts to resolve this controversial issue these programs are vital to the nations economy i am pleased that our expeditious action will enable these programs to get back on track i only hope the administration will also recognize the need to reauthorize these programs quickly and quickly sign this conference report into law these programs are vital to the nations economy i am pleased that our expenditious action will enable these programs to get back on track i only hope the administration will also recognize the need to reauthorize these programs quickly and quickly sign this conference report into law in closing i would like to highlight some of the benefits this bill provides to my home state of arkansas this bill will provide arkansas over 108 million in fiscal year 1987 for highway formula programs which include the interstate construction interstate resurfacing restoration rehabilitation and reconstruction primary secondary urban bridge hazard elimination and railroad highway crossing programs the conference report continues the minimum onehalf percent interstate construction apportionment to states that have completed their interstate program these funds may be used in interstate rehabilitation projects or transferred for use on primary highways the continuation of this provision provides over 13 million per fiscal year to arkansas the conference report also continues and expands the minimum allocation program which provides states with at least 85 percent of the amounts they contribute to the highway trust fund this program provides an additional 14 9 million to arkansas for fiscal year 1987 and will be calculated annually in the future in sum this means that arkansas will receive a total of over 123 million under the basic federalaid program in fiscal year 1987 exclusive of demonstration projects and any discretionary grants the state may receive funding in each of fiscal years 198891 would be roughly the same for the highway formula programs the conference report also contains a provision authorizing a 45 million project over the next 5 years to accelerate construction of unitedstates highway 71 as a fourlane highway with another 45 million project authorized for unitedstates highway 71 in missouri arkansas will receive 36 million or 80 percent of their projects cost in new federal funding arkansas will be required to match the grant with 9 million or 20 percent of the project cost the conference report also contains a provision which allows arkansas to march 18 1 987 it11424 use interstate construction funds for the planning design and construction of highway 71 although the state has completed all its interstate segments and its interstate funds must normally be spent on i4r work the conference report gives arkansas the option of using its interstate funds on highway 71 the conference report further designates highway 71 as a priority project this means that arkansas may use any combination of its normally apportioned funds including interstate 4r primary urban secondary and bridge funds for the construction of highway 71 this will provide arkansas with maximum flexibility to expedite construction of this route also included in the conference report is an authorization of a 8 5 million project at fort smith which involves widening a segment of the highway connecting westark community college and the new central mall and improving signalization on the segment the conference report provides 6 8 million or 80 percent of the project cost in new federal funds to be matched by 1 7 million or 20 percent of the project cost in state funds the conference report also contains an authorization for four grade separations on a fourlane bypass at jonesboro the report provides 9 84 million which is 80 percent of the project cost in new federal funds to be matched by 2 46 million or 20 percent in state funds the report also provides an authorization for preliminary engineering on a bridge project at lock and dam no 4 near pine bluff the report provides 1 6 million which is 80 percent of the estimated cost in new federal funds to be matched by 400 000 or 20 percent in state funds it should be noted that all of these funds come out of the highway trust fund and therefore do not add to the federal deficit the conference report also directs the secretary of transportation in cooperation with louisiana arkansas and missouri to study the feasibility of constructing a highway from shreveport la to texarkana fort smith fayetteville ar and carthage and kansas city mo a report on the studys results is to be submitted to congress within 1 year after the reports enactment another provision of interest to arkansas is one that will allow the states to use bridge replacement and rehabilitation funds to construct bridges to replace ferry boat service low water crossings bridges destroyed before 1965 and bridges rendered obsolete by army corps of engineer projects in summary this conference report represents a fair compromise of the positions contained in the house and senate passed bills it provides for the construcition of the final links and forms the closing chapter of the nations greatest public works projectthe interstate highway system the conference report also sets the stage for the postinterstate highway program of the 1990s i strongly urge my colleagues to support passage of this conference report"],

construction appropriations subcommittee the gentleman from north carolina for his diligence in bringing this bill to the floor the committee staff majority minority deserve our thanks for their professionalism in assisting with drafting this bill as always chairman hefner has made very effort to ensure that this bill has been crafted in a bipartisan manner he has made sure that each member of the subcommittee without regard to what side of the aisle they are on was able to participate in crafting this bill the outcome of his efforts represent a balanced bill ih r 4586 provides an 8 8 billion appropriation for military construction and family housing during fiscal year 1989 not included in this bill but scored against it is a 214 million advance appropriation mandated in fiscal year 1987 bringing the total to 9 01 billion this represents approximately a 2 5percent real increase over last year and is in line with the spending limits of the economic summit the chairman of our subcommittee has done an excellent job in outlining the contents of h r 4586 in his statement he spoke of savings realized in this bill i would like to elaborate on a few specific projects which provide savings the blb avionics facility at tinker air force base ok costing 11 4 million will result in a contract savings of 50 million per year reconfiguration of the airframes support facility at corpus christi army depot tx at a cost of 4 9 million is estimated to produce an annual offset of 4 4 million each year over the 25year economic life of the project the net present value of these savings discounted at 10 percent is 39 4 million construction of the target maintenance facility at naval air station north island ca at a cost of 2 8 million will result in avoiding an investment of 19 5 million to purchase new targets and an annual transportation cost of 216 000 the sum of 1 6 million to purchase the walter reed inn eliminating an annual 700 000 lease cost construction of 1 000 units of family housing is estimated to result in the reduction of between 5 5 and 6 million in annual housing allowances this bill includes 284 million for construction of 3 200 units resulting in an annual savings of approximately 19 2 million several intangible benefits of this bill are obvious but cannot be quantified the commitment demonstrated by the construction of new barracks or a facility that enhances the appearance and the efficiency of the workplace may convince a soldier to reenlist avoiding the expense of training his replacement and improvements to health safety and environmental aspects of our installations help to prevent the loss of life lost time injuries and longterm health problems of our service members and civilian employees i would also take to outline some of the major components of ii r 4586 the sum of 173 million of the 191 million requested for strategic homeporting at 9 of the 10 proposed sites although personally i oppose the homeporting conceptmy role is not to be obstructionist when the committee and the congress have supported this initiative the sum of 214 million in advance appropriations for the light infantry division at fort drum ny and 35 9 million for fort wainwright ak the sum of 77 5 million for the continuation of the beddown of the b2 stealth bomber at whiteman air force base mo the sum of 3 05 million for troop support facilities at palmerola honduras the sum of 26 million for 16 child care centers to meet the increased demand due to todays allvolunteer force the sum of 99 million for the foreign currency fluctuation accountoffset by a 113 million reduction in overseas projectsto help ease the construction backlog experienced by the services due to the instability of exchange rates for chemical demilitarization the committee has deferred the requested 49 6 million for an ammunition demilitarization facility at tooele army depot ut in addition to this construction request the facility requires 107 million in process equipment were funding is under the jurisdiction of the defense appropriations subcommittee the committee recognizes th t there are contractual advantages to combining all costs for construction equipment and operations into a single procurement and has deferred this project without prejudice pending a decision by the defense subcommittee on the equipment portion of this project the committee has provided 8 4 million for a training facility at aberdeen proving ground md however we have fenced this money until the congress approves initial construction and procurement for the first ammunition demilitarization facility the sum of 502 million for the unitedstates contribution to the nato infrastructure fund while this represents an increase of 129 million above last years appropriation the increase is attributed mainly to the foreign currency shortfall the committee supports the unitedstates commitment to nato and is pleased that the administration and dod are giving burdensharing the attention it deserves we have required the department to submit a progress report by february 15 1989 on further actions taken by nato allies and japan to assume a greater share of the common defense burden to promote further burdensharing the committee denied 25 million for programs we believe should be pursued either by natoinfrastructure or hostnation support the bill carries a provision initiated last year prohibiting the use of any military construction and family housing funds for the relocation of the 401st tactical wing from torrejon spain the sum of 3 3 billion or 37 percent of the total bill for construction and operation and maintenance of family housing the committee strongly believes that ownership of family housing units is preferable to leasing for economic as well as managerial reasons leasing expenses included in this bill for 1 year amount to 378 million therefore a general provision has betn included in the bill which directs the department to submit a legislative proposal for an installment purchase program for family housing and to implement a pilot program for 3 000 units in its 1990 budget request these major components are necessary but i would like to remind my colleagues what this bill really provides while there are many projects important to our national defensethe majority are important to the men and women of our armed forces while we invest billions of dollars for weapons systemsmany of which are more glamourous than a hardstanda concrete slab to relieve our soldiers from working in the mud snow and icewe tend to forget the most important factor to our defensethose men and women who put our systems to use that is what the military construction appropriation bill is about we dont have the constituency of support those glamourous weapons systems havethe men and women of our armed forces and their families are our constituencywe provide for their working environment their housing their hospitals and clinics their chapels and their childcare centers in conclusion h r 4586 represents a balanced wellcrafted billit provides the necessary military construction and family housing projects to protect and enhance our

of h r 85 the new zealand military preference suspension act i particularly wish to thank the members of the foreign affairs committeeespecially chairman fascell and the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee on asian and pacific affairs mr solarz and mr leachfor their efforts in support of this legislation i introduced h r 85 on january 6 because of my concern over the direction of new zealand policy with respect to the security relationship between new zealand and the united states on june 4 1987 the new zealand parliament enacted into law the policy the new zealand government adopted 2 years earlier that prevents unitedstates navy ships from entering new zealand ports the decision of the government of new zealand to enact this policy into law casts a further shadow over the future security relationship of the united states and new zealand ever since new zealand refused to accept the visit of the unitedstatess buchanan in february 1985 new zealand has blocked access by united states navy ships to enter new zealand ports because they might carry nuclear weapons the new zealand government has demanded that the united states identify which of its ships carries nuclear weapons and has indicated that only those ships that do not carry such weapons may enter new zealand ports the united states has a unitary navy not separate nuclear and nonnuclear navies moreover in order to safeguard the security of the united states and its allies as well as to protect naval personnel at sea the united states must maintain a firm policy of declining to confirm or to deny whether particular unitedstates navy ships carry nuclear weapons thus the new zealand policy has effectively banned unitedstates navy ships from new zealand ports since february 1985 the australianew zealandunited states defense treatycommonly referred to as anzus is a critical element in the western alliance system whose global defense strategy has successfully deterred major warfare in the four decades since the second world war under the anzus treaty united states forces constitute an important deterrent to hostile action by the soviet union and other countries that might threaten united states and allied security endanger regional stability or block vital sealanes of communication in the pacific the united states has exercised considerable patience in responding to new zealands breach of its anzus treaty obligations with the hope that new zealand might abandon its shipban policy and resume its security obligations the united states initially chose to leave the treaty regime and its mutual military support arrangements intact by august 1986 however new zealands intransigence became clear and the united states with the concurrence of australia the other treaty partnersuspended its security obligations to new zealand new zealand remained committed to its policy banning united states navy ships from its ports for this reason in february 1987 the united states informed new zealand that it would not renew or renegotiate the expiring united statesnew zealand memorandum of understanding which provided for mutual military support arrangements on june 4 the new zealand parliament enacted the new zealand nuclear free zone disarmament and arms control act that act makes all new zealand territory waters and airspace a nuclearfree zone prohibits the entry of nuclearpowered ships and prohibits the entry of foreign military aircraft and ships unless the prime minister is satisfied that they willnot be carrying any nuclear explosive device beyond this prime minister david lange of new zealand has explained his governments policy by stating that new zealand wishes to disengage its defense from all nuclear activities the effect of the new zealand disarmament act is to place in law the ban on united states navy ships entering new zealand ports it is not likely that this important legal development will be reversed in the near future the decision of the government of new zealand to enact the ship ban into law therefore constitutes a major turning point in the united statesnew zealand security relationship i have received letters from secretary of defense weinberger national security adviser frank carlucci former secretary of the navy john lehman and a representative of the state department indicating to me that the enactment of h r 85 would be an appropriate response after the passage of antinuclear legislation by new zealand i ask that copies of their letters be entered into the record at the conclusion of my remarks new zealand has every sovereign right to exclude united states navy ships from its ports but that decision has necessary consequences new zealand cannot expect to enjoy the benefits of a close defense alliance with the united states without accepting the burdens that go with it new zealand has made the decision to shift its security relationship with the united states from alliance to simple friendship after waiting with patience and hope for new zealand to change its mind the united states must now accept new zealands sovereign decision about its future course the time has come to adjust unitedstates law to reflect this new reality accordingly i encourage the house of representatives to act favorably on h r 85 the new zealand military preference suspension act this bill would suspend new zealand from the list of alliesnato countries japan australia and new zealandentitled to preferential treatment under various provisions of the foreign assistance act of 1961 and the arms export control act the bill would shift new zealands status under those statutes from that of an allied country to that of a friendly country reflecting the new security relationship with the united states that new zealand has chosen for itself the bill is a measured and proportionate response to new zealands decision to enact into law its united states ship ban under the bill as reported by the committee the president could reinstate the military preferences if he determined that new zealand bad once again taken up its security obligations under anzus this bill does not impose any economic or other sanctions on new zealand the united states and new zealand enjoy and should continue to enjoy close economic political and cultural ties even though close security cooperation has ended by new zealands choice the united states greatly regrets the choice new zealand has made to leave the group of americas military allies nevertheless it was new zealand that banned visits by united states naval vessels and has made this action permanent through legislation congress should adjust united states law to reflect this new diminished relationship by enacting the new zealand military

also requires multiple disbursement of sls loans in line with gsl disbursements additionally the bill makes technical changes in title iv gsl eligibility for students who are studying to meet state teacher certification requirements treats income taxes paid to the governments of unitedstates territories as federal income taxes for purposes of needs anal ysis for federal title iv programs and

at 12 percent borrowers begin repayment within 60 days of the loans disbursement but nay defer repayment during the inschool period however interest is capitalized increasing the borrowers total debt the sls program has grown explosively during recent months in the first quarter of this fiscal year alone the sls loan volume of 515 million exceeds that of the entire preceding fiscal year during the fiscal year 1088 october to march period 345 058 students borrowed sls loans a 378percent increase over the 72 122 students who borrowed during the same period in fiscal 1987 at the 6month mark of this fiscal year loan volume has increased 395 percent to almost 1 billion and the department of education projects a 1 8 billion loan volume for the entire four quarters the preponderance of this new loan volume is occurring in the proprietary sector the higher education assistance foundation heaf a national guarantor which is a good indicator of proprietary school loan volume guaranteed 23 837 sls loans in may 20 301 or 85 percent of these sls loans wont to borrowers attending proprietary schools reports also indicate that financial aid officers are frontending student financial assistance with sls loans rather than having students apply for needbased pell grants and more subsidized needstested guaranteed student loans first because both palls and gsls require such a determination of need the application process for grants and lowinterest loans is more complex and lengthy additionally gsls provide a smaller loan amount of 2 625 for first year borrowers and poll grants require additional administrative record keeping and reporting by school financial aid officials my concern is that such frontending of financial assistance witi sls loans will increase both the number of defaulters given the repayment schedule and the amount of dollars in default given that borrowers may receive up to 4 000 in a single payment early in their educational programs connecting sls loans with other needbased financial assistance will remove any possibility of frontending financial aid with supplemental loans for independent undergraduate students h r 4639 requires both an eligibility determination and application for both pell grants and gsls before applying for an sls loan graduate and professional students must apply for the gsl before making application for an sls loan additionally for the purpose of calculating the sls loan limit the amount of the gsl eligibility will be subtracted with other financial aid certified by the institution from the students estimated cost of attendance such requirements are not intended to limit legitimate access to sls loans particularly because many students including graduate and professional students use both gsl and sls loans to meet the cost of attendance our intent is that students borrow a guaranteed student loan for which they are eligible before making use of the more expensive sls loan h r 4639 also requires multiple disbursement of sls loans in two cash payments which is in line with disbursements made in the gsl program providing as much as 4 000 in a single payment early in the educational or training program rfreans that dropouts who account for a great proportion of defaulters in the gsl program will be droppingout with significantly higher debt burdensdebt burdens which qill in most cases become defaulted loans cbo projects a 9 5percent default rate for this program which given the exponential growth in loan volume means that we may be facing the addition of another 180 million in defaults to the projected 1 6 billion in defaults in the gsl program both for students and for the integrity of the federal loan programs the explosive growth in supplemental loans as the primary sources of aid is a potential disaster because of the high volume of supplemental loans in the fourth quarter of the fiscal yearjuly through septemberthis legislation must be enacted prior to july 1 1988 if we are

lithuanian descent today celebrate the 70th anniversary of the declaration of independence of their homeland with similar ceremonies to be held february 24 to mark the 70th anniversary of estonias independence unfortunately for the people of these countries and all the baltic states these will be muted celebrations because for the past 48 years the soviet union has denied freedom and independence to these brave people during its occupation of the baltic states the soviets have overtaken a continuous campaign to virtually eliminate the cultural heritage traditions languages and religion of the lithuanian estonian and latvian people in recognition of the denial of human rights to the baltic people i am reintroducing today two resolutions calling for full freedom and independence of the baltic states and expressing the sense of the congress that our nation should do everything possible through diplomatic channels to see that soviet personnel are removed from these occupied lands these resolutions reaffirm the policy of the united states to refuse to recognize the unlawful soviet occupation of the baltic states and to continue to maintain diplomatic relations with the independent republics of lithuanla estonia and latvia as independent states soviet leaders have widely publicized their new policy of glasnost with the announced intendion of expanding the freedoms and rights of the soviet people if the soviet union is sincere in this regard it should immediately grant the long denied independence to the peaceful and freedom loving people of the baltic states who pose no security risk to the soviet union the resolutions i introduce today the text of which follow my remarks encourage the president to enter into discussions with soviet leaders to end soviet occupation of these lands release baltic political prisoners and restore the selfdetermination of the baltic people through our efforts to recognize the independence of lithuania estonia and latvia we call world attention to the soviet denial of human rights and freedom to the people of these nations for almost half of this century the baltic people are proud and strong and will never relinquish their quest to regain the independence that has been stropped of them by the soviet union and they are deserving of our moral and diplomatic support to help them achieve their dream of the reestablishment of thre truly independent states of lithuania estonia and latvia 1t con res whereas the united states since its inception has been committed to the principle of selfdetermination whereas this essential moral principle is also affirmed in the charter of the united nations whereas the union of soviet socialist republics is according to its constitution a volunary federation of autonomous republics whereas the three baltic republics the republic of lithuania the republic of latvia and the repubic of estonia did not become member republics of the union of soviet socialist republics voluntarily but rather were occupied militarily by russian armed forces in the early days of world war ii and subsequently incorporated by force in to the union of soviet socialist republics and have since been governed by governments approved by and subservient to the government of the union of soviet socialist republics whereas the ethnic makeup of the baltic peoples the lithuanians latvians and estonians is distinctly foreign in language culture common traditions and religion from that of the russian people whereas by deportation and dispenslon of the native populations of the baltic states to siberia and by a massive colonization effort in which russian colonists replace the displaced native peoples the soviet union threatens complete elimination of the baltic peoples as a culturally geographically and politically distinct and ethnically homogeneous population whereat despite such treatment the spirit of the citizens of the baltic states is not broken and the desire of the citizens of the baltic states for national independence remains unabated whereas the united states has consistently refused to recognize the unlawful soviet occupation of the baltic states and has continued to maintain diplomatic relations with representatives of the independent republics of lithuania latvia and estonia and whereas the united nations and the united statcs delegation to the united nations have consistently upheld the right of selfdetermination of the people of those countries in asia and africa that are or have been under foreign imperialist rule now therefore be it resolved by the house of representatives the senate concurring that it is the sense of the congress that 1 the president and the secretary of state should take all necessary steps to bring the baltic states question before the united nations and to urge that the united nations request the soviet union a to withdraw all russian and other nonnative troops agents colonists and controls from the republics of lithuania latvia and estonia and b to return all baltic exiles from siberia and from prisons and labor camps in the soviet union 2 until the baltic states become independent the secretary of state should through such channels as the united states information agency and other information agencies of the united states government do his utmost to bring the matter of the baltic states to the attention of all nations by means of special radio programs and pubilcations 3 the united states should not agree to the recognition by any international conference of the soviet unions unlawful annexation of lithuania latvia and estonia and it should remain the policy of the united states not to recognize in any way the annexation of the baltic states by the soviet union 4 the president should require that all government map publishers and should request that all private map publishers show on all maps of europe the republics of lithuania latvia and estonia as independent states with a footnote explaining that the military occupation and forced incorporation into the soviet union of lithuania latvia and estonia has never been recognized by the united states 5 the right of selfdetermination should be returned to the peoples of lithuania latvia and estonia through free elections conducted under the auspices of the united nations after soviet withdrawal from the baltic states and 6 the right of selfdetermination should be made a prime political objective of the united nations and should be accorded through free elections under the auspices of the united nations to all peoples now involuntarily subjugated to soviet communism h con rzs whereas the united states does not recognize the illegal annexation by the soviet union of the baltic nations of estonia latvia and lithuania whereas the united states as a member of the united nations has pledged to uphold the ideals of the united nations charter and to take joint and separate action to promote universal respect for and obserance of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race sex language or religion whereas during the 83rd congress the select committee to investigate communist aggression of the house of representatives thoroughly investigated the seizure of the baltic nations by the soviet union and in its third interim report concluded that the evidence is overwhelming and conclusive that estonia latvia and lithuania were forcibly occupied and illegally annexed by the union of soviet socialist republics whereas the united states as a signatory to the final act of the conference on security and cooperation in europe endorsed principle viii concerning equal rights and selfdetermination of peoples which states all peoples always have the right if

than it does with the nation of japan the implementation of the via can only enhance this already mutually beneficial economic relationship under the terms of the free trade agreement all ad valorem

united states and canada under the gatt it covers substantially all trade and is therefore acceptable under the provisions of article xxiv of the gatt the fta is already being viewed internationally as creating a positive climate for further gatt negotiations the pta legislation before this house reflects months of negotiations between representatives of tile executive branch members of congress and relevant committee staff under the fasttrack provisions 19 unitedstatesc 21912194 the congress has at the outside 90 legislative days within which to approve this language if approved by the house of representatives the united states senate and the canadian parliament the pta will take effect on or after january 1 1989 h r 5090 was referred to the committee on the judiciary principally because of the modifications of judicial review contained in the free trade agreement and because of certain constitutional questions raised in connection with the binational review panels established by the free trade agreement specifically under the free trade agreement administrative decisions in antidumping and countervailing duty cases are made subject to review by fiveperson panels consisting of individuals appointed by the two countries these binational panelsthat essentially replace judicial review in the court of international trade and any subsequent appellate reviewwill be implementing international law as reflected in the text of the agreement they will however be applying the laws of the country whose agency decision is being reviewed including the existing standard of judicial review in such cases there are also some immigration provisions of note contained in the free trade agreement chapter 15 of the pta and section 307 of h r 5090 provides for the temporary entry of business persons traders and investors professionals and intracompany transfers on a reciprocal basis while maintaining necessary provisions to ensure border security and protect domestic labor concerns most of chapter 15 is consistent with existing provisions of the immigration and nationality act however legislative action is needed to allow tie admission of treaty traders and investors as nonimmigrants since to date canada and the united states have never entered into a formal treaty trader relationship the agreement lists the specific occupations to be covered the united states and canada are to establish a procedure for the annual review of the implementation of these provisions by immigration officials of both countries the subcommittee on courts civil liberties and the administration of justice of the judiciaxy committee held a hearing on april 21 of this year principally focusing on the binational review mechanism i am satisfied based upon the testimony from that hearing and from subsequent staff analyses that the constitutional questions raised by the creation of the binational panels have been satisfactorlly resolved first of all because of the broad power that congress has with respect to commerce and international trade an article iiijudcialforum is not required to resolve commercial disputes arising out of dumping and countervailing duty cases second the procedural due process rights of the interested persons are fully protected by the manner of appointment of the panels and the opportunity to fully participate in these proceedings third the department of justice raised concerns during the course of the negotiations as to whether or not the implementation of decisions by the binational panels might be inconsistent with the appointments clause of the constitution the language contained in h r 5090 reflects a compromise responding to those concerns the language contained in the implementing legislation provides for the direct implementation of the decisions of the panels by the international trade commission or the international trade administration however in the unlikely event that a constitutional challenge is successfully brought against this approach the president is authorized to accept panel decisions as a whole and to assure that the ruling will be implemented before closing i want to commend the gentleman from wisconsin the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee on courts bob kastenmmier for his leadership role in resolv ing these problems in addition i would like to express my thanks to

unitedstates vessels this provision represents the efforts of many groups including the maritime law association the american bar association the national marine bankers association and the administration this system will primarily benefit law enforcement officials but others including state boating officials and commercial and recreational vessel owners insurers national boating organizations and financiers will benefit from the system the vessel identification system in this provision will for the first time provide a way to identify the owners of all commercial and recreational vessels in this country since the late 1970s the merchant marine and fisheries committee of which i am the ranking minority member has received testimony on the need to clearly and easily establish the owners and identities of vessels thousands of vessels are stolen annually in this country and law enforcemernt officials have no way to identify the true owners of those vessels and to effectively track the interstate movements of those vessels the federal aviation administration currently maintains a system to identify the owners of aircraft and title viii of h r 5210 contains provisions reported by the public works and transportation committee to strengthen that system i understand that many of the problems assqelated with identifying the ownership of aircraft also exist with regard to vessels and should be alleviated by the vessel identification system earlier this congress introduced a bill h r 3298 to address many of these problems rhis vessel identification system is required to be established by the secretary of transportation the secretary may require that the coast guard carry out this program but this is not required by the provision this system should be established in the most costefficient manner and combined if possible with other information systems the secretary currently maintains the system of information the secretary maintains on documented vessels would be an appropriate information system to combine with the vessel information system because the identification information maintained by the secretary on documented vessels is part of the overall system of identification information for all vessels of the united states another reason to combine these systems is that the fees charged by the secretary under the ship mortgage act 1920 as amended by this provision may be sufficient to modernize the vessel information system maintained by the socretary under that act and also to offset the costs of establishing the vessel information system under this provision states are encouraged to participate in the system by making ownership information available on vessels in their states to the secretary of transportation participation is voluntary on the part of states but as a benefit to vessel owners and financiers vessel mortgages filed in participating states with approved titling systems will be given preferred status currently available to federally recorded vessel mortgages in addition if a state is employed by the secretary to collect the 1 per vessel fee authorized by this provision the state may retain half of the amounts collected to provide vessel identification information to the secretary this purpose would include making updates and improvements to state vessel titling and numbering schemes to more effectively provide information to the secretary total fees paid by boaters may stay the same or actually decrease because states will reap the efficiency of making certain improvements to their numbering systems with these funds i believe that these inducements will encourage a broad participation in the vessel identification system by the states this provision includes a codification of the ship mortgage act recently reported by the merchant marine and fisheries committee h rept 100918 with certain changes explained in the sectionbysection analysis attached to this statement it contains procedures to support the preferred status for state filed or recorded financing instruments and many others to complement the new vessel identification system for these reasons it is an important part of the vessel identification system the codification recognizes the prevalence of revolving credit loans in modern financing and allows their use in vessel financing it eliminates a number of useless formalities such as requiring that a mortgage be endorsed on a vessels document or the needless requirement that the coast guard be notified when a partial payment is made on a mortgage with respect to encouraging the financing of vessels the codification establishes a nationwide indexing system which will allow a preferred ship mortgage to be valid from the date of filing this will eliminate the current 8month wait before a mortgage actually grants the security interest important to consumers and banks while it will take some time to get this program operating i am convinced that the new system will be a vast improvement over current labor inten sive and time consuming procedures in use today again modern computer technology can easily handle these tasks septem ber 22

several amendments considered by the house authorizing committees and passed by the senate two of these amendments are of particular importance in my state section 207 of this bill is simllar to h r 4834 legislation which i introduced to authorize alaska native villages and certain oklahoma indian tribes to be eligible for waste treatment grants under the clean water act enactment of this section will allow the necessary waste treatment planning to be done in rural alaska for years to come the amendment would correct a technical error made in the last reauthorization of the clean water act in which alaska native villages were inadvertently omitted from authorization for grants under the act previously both alaska villages and former reservations in oklahoma were eligible for treatment as indian tribes passage of this legislation will correct the error and help to meet the waste treatment needs of these remote communities further section 217 of this bill will provide for a clarification of federal escrow laws pertaining to funds received while lands were being transferred to alaska native corporations pursuant to the alaska native claims settlement act the amendment provides that receipt of proceeds from the sale of wildlife resources is included within the resource categories intended to be deposited into the alaska native escrow fund in july the senate added language to the interior departments appropriations bill that was intended to resolve ambiguity over the longstanding pribilof island alaska native escrow account claim conferees on that measure chose to substitute detailed report language resolving that ambiguity despite their efforts the claim remains unresolved as originally enacted on january 2 1976 the alaska native escrow law provided authority for the government to divert to an escrow account its receipts derived from resources of lands that would pass to natives under the alaska native claims settlement act during the protracted period between the ancsa withdrawals in 1971 and conveyance the government had authority to continue its various revenue generating activities on lands that had been withdrawn for native selection the government was not trespassing at that pointit still owned the land which was in the process of being conveyed to the relevant native corporation the government had authority to collect these receipts under such programs as the mineral leasing act the fur seal act and the laws regarding timber sales in the national forests congress determined that keeping the proceeds was unfair to alaska natives since the government had received its part of the ancsa settlement bargain effective december 18 1971 in fact if the government could have kept the proceeds from withdrawn lands prior to conveyance it would have had a considerable economic incentive to further slow the conveyance process so the escrow account statutes were enacted to direct the proceeds to the native corporation that ultimately received the withdrawn lands much of the land withdrawn for native solection and conveyance had been withdrawn previously for mineral entry wildlife protection forests et cetera congress directed the government to retain in federal ownership within ancsa withdrawals only the smallest practicable tracts necessary for its various purposes the native escrow statutes provide that revenues from lands not so retained would be escrowed various federal agencies over the years have opposed this section 3 e limitation on their interests but in a variety of contexts over the years the department and congress have consistently refused to permit the agencies to limit native property rights arising outside the section 3 e boundaries true in native conveyances federal agencies often retained easements or other access rights over nonsection 3 o lands conveyed but that is irrelevant to the operation of the escrow laws which deal with the period prior to conveyances moreover in cases such as the pribilofs timber sales or the kenai gas field resources were taken extracted or severed a wholly different activity than an access right or easement the escrow fund amendment contained in this legislation definitively states that regardless of any residual access or management rights it may have held reserved or retained pursuant to the fur seal act of 1966 as amended prior to or subsequent to conveyance of lands to the two pribilof village corporations the government did not have authority prior to or subsequent to conveyance to take seals from lands conveyed to the pribilof native village corporation pursuant to ancsa without escrowing the proceeds derived from the harvested seals as enunciated in the statement of managers for the fiscal year 1989 interior appropriations bill the proceeds received by the federal government from its sale of pelts taken from native corporation lands shall be the measure of the principal amount placed in escrow and then distributed h r rep no 100862 100th ong 2d sess 80 1988 it is not just trespass damages which are covered by the escrow statutes the escrow statutes supersede any rights held by the government under the fur seal act to wildlife proceeds from harvests on lands conveyed pursuant to the act in this case of course the act refers to the alaska native claims settlement act the amendment statutorily resolves in the affirmative any possible question as to whether wildlife proceeds are included under the escrow statutes at a minimum for the purposes of the escrow statutes wildlife harvested on lands later conveyed to native corporations pursuant to ancsa is quite simply a resource of land whether it spends time in its life cycle in the air water or ground finally the amendment clarifies any possible ambiguity with regard to the time period within which proceeds received are to be escrowed and distributed to the native corporations the escrow statutes in general provide that the appropriate recipients are to be distributed proceeds derived by the government between the date of withdrawaldecember 18 1971 in most casesand the date of conveyance of ancsa lands decause there might be a time lag between the dale a resource was taken and the date the government received the proceeds from the sale thereof an ambiguity may exist the applicable rules of statutory construction and interpretation as set forth in the statement of managers doi escrow account precedent and the plain meaning of the statutes are all consistent proceeds received during the withdrawaltoconveyance period are to be escrowed and distributed the language in the amendment attached to h r 2677 confirms that position and mandates payments of proceeds received in that period therefore some of the escrow fund proceeds properly due to the pribilof village corporations were derived from seals harvested immediately prior to the passage of ancsa on lands later conveyed to the corporations pursuant to the act at the same time proceeds received after conveyance from seals harvested immediately before conveyance are not subject to escrow i am informed by the secretary of the interior that the governments maximum liability in

critical questions which must be addressed by congress and the higher education community in the coming months the secretry has announced immediate program reviews of 500 schools with default rates above 50 percent based on current data an additional 2 000 of the 7 300 institutions participating in the qsl program have default rates greater than 20 percent and face administrative action barring them from all federal aid programs clearly the program is in serious difficulty when almost onehalf of current costs are due to defaults which are likely to exceed 2 billion annually by the end of the decade defaults now representing the third largest expenditure by the department of education undermine public confidence and take away limited federal resources from education programs in the short term immediate steps must be taken to restore the integrity of the program we must also reexamine the social policies which have shaped the evolution of the program since 1965 the gsl program originally provided minimally subsidized loans for middleincome students during the 1960s and 1970s a period of rapidly rising college costs such loans help to provide middleincome families a choice between a state institution and generally more expensive private colleges and universities during the 1980s however the gsl program has served growing numbers of lowincome and minority students as federal assistance to financially needy students shifted from grants to repayable loans during the last 10 years as loans have increased from 17 percent to almost 50 percent of the student aid package the program in effect shifted from one which provided choices to middleincome students to one which increasingly provides educational access to lower income students when congress under pressure to reduce spending mandated a needs test the trend toward eliminating many middleincome students from eligibility was accelerated since their inception in 1965 gsls have evolved into a 3 5 billion program with an annual new loan volume of 9 billion these gsls provide education opportunity to some 4 million studentborrowers at 7 300 institutions thirteen thousands private lenders participate and are insured by guaranty agencies operating in all 50 states fortyseven secondary loan markets provide additional capital for loans and collection services congress is not equipped to micromanage a complex program with a cumulative loan volume in excess of 82 billion however congress can and must distinguish between the various responsibilities of all of the major participantsschools which certify the students status and need guarantors which approve the loan lenders who make the loan and students who can borrow up to 17 250 for undergraduate study and 54 750 for graduate and professional programs of the importanl players schools are now coming under increased scrutiny in congress and by the secretary of education because along with students themselves schools are the programs chief direct beneficiaries indeed the correlation between a schools dropout rate and placement record and the rate of gsl loan defaults is virtually undisputed it is axiomatic that the quality of a schools educational program its counseling and its administrative practices can have a direct impact on the default rate of its students recent studies have given us increased insight into the general characteristics of student defaulters these high risk students are frequently lowincome borrowers attending trade and technical schools or community colleges likely defaulters tend to be firstyear students who drop out before completing their education or training program they tend to borrow small amounts usually a single loan and consequently do not account for a disproportionate percentage of the default loan volume finally the overwhelming majority of defaulters fail to make the first payment on their loan to decrease the number of loans going into default and to minimize defaults due to poor administrative practices the following changes in the program should be made schools institutions particularly those producing a disproportionate number of gsl defaults should be required to disclose accurate placement rates to prospective students and show a greater commitment to retaining those students who do enroll this is common sense but presently schools have few incentives to prevent gsl borrowers from beginning study and then dropping out aneedotally it seems that many defaulters are either unwilling to repay loans for education they did not receive or they are unable to pay due to low wages or unemployment in either case defaults are an index of lost educational opportunity schools with high rates of default should be required to counsel the borrower before the first disbursement of the loan outlining the conditions of the loan and emphasizing the borrowers responsibilities as incredible as it may seem some defaulters never fully understand that gsl assistance is a loan that must at the conclusion of study or training be repaid the currently mandatory exit interview should be supplemented by written communication during the 6month grace period after completion of the educational program reinforcing borrower information and outlining the loan repayment schedule and provisions for deferring payment under certain circumstances finally schools should also be required to certify and update four references for lenders and guaranty agencies to assist in locating borrowers whose loans are either delinquent or in default to provide incentives for lowering gsl defaults schools with excessive default rates should be required to pay a 5percent supplemental insurance premium on loans they certify for students borrowers twenty percent of these funds would support enhanced collection efforts by guaranty agencies the remaining 80 percent would offset federal reinsurance costs further schools undergoing limitation suspension and termination proceedings due to high defaults should be required to pay a user fee offsetting the administrative and oversight costs to the department of education finally highdefault institutions should be encouraged to purchase defaulted loans of former students before reinsurance by the federal government of that loan lenders loans are paid out by the lender in two or more installments or disbursements because the overwhelming majority of dropouts occur during the early weeks of an educational program the first disbursement of a loan to students attending highdefault schools should be delayed until the student successfully completes at least the first month of the program such a delayed disbursement would reduce in effect the actual risk of making loans to highrisk students to improve communication and enable schools to assist in preventing defaults from occurring in the first place lenders should be required to send a copy of the first delinquency notice and final demand letter to the institution lenders should notify the school within 30 days of the sale of a loan to a secondary market or other purchaser to enable schools to share relevant information with the actual
