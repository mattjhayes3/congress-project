and i come to you tonight with some doturbing news the threat is even more serious than many americans know tucson arizona is 65 miles from mexico i have it here on the map it is shown by the red dot it is the route to two interstates one going north and south and one going east and west just southeast of tucson arizona is the university of arizona technology park on that park which is surrounded by an oldfashioned chain link fence is a technology firm called raytheon raytheon is a defense contractor that makes tomahawk cruise missiles well neighbors in tucson arizona have sent me some pictures of what appears to be illegal entry into the perimeter of this plant here we have the chain link fence this photograph is taken inside the perimeter on these premises 400 acres is the raytheon plant it is true there is another fence around raytheon that is a fence that is a cable type fence that keeps trucks from coming through but someone of course could crawl underneath or over that particular fence and you see there is all types of litter inside the fence and the question occurs where does this come from these are trails that are similar to what you see along the texas border where i am from but border towns down in southeast texas dont have a plant that makes tomahawk cruise missiles tucson neighbors say these trails are filled with trash backpacks water bottles and clothes and why is that well it seems that the illegals that come from mexico sneak under this fence and hide on these 400 acres until the human smugglers come back later and pick them up and transport them throughout the united states raytheon public relations officials have said well they hadnt heard anything about it from the security and they have strict security procedures to enter that facility but a supervisor at raytheon security said yes illegals have been known to come through the grounds but they were just passing through and some illegals have been found working at the raytheon plant by subcontractors but they were ordered off the premises i would like to show you some more disturbing photographs that the tucson neighbors have sent me this is a photograph taken inside the perimeter of the chain link fence and you see numerous backpacks where illegals have come in to the perimeter have hidden on the premises when the human smugglers come to pick them up and take them into the heartland of america they bring with them the backpacks that allow them to change clothes it is somewhat disturbing to me that we have this contractor that makes tomahawk missiles that allows this to occur on their premises because you see lawlessness on the border breeds more lawlessness in the united states and you would think that a company that has submitted a border security plan for the department of homeland security just 2 weeks ago would be concerned about their bordertoo after all it is a national security issue i have one more photograph to show you taken on the same premises but on the other end of the perimeter a similar photograph of backpacks water bottles left by the people that illegally entered the united states how ironic that it is that they hide on the premises of a place and an institution that is trying to protect the national security of the united states the raytheon problems are our problems because the unitedstates mexico border is not secure we have to stop the illegal entry at the border between the united states and mexico otherwise we will continue to see these backpacks throughout the united states and some may have clothes but some may also bring in to the united states property and explosives that could damage the united states it is a national security issue it is a border security issue we have an obligation to the american people and have to have the moral will to protect the borders and the dignity of the united states and thats just the way it is"], [0.002714061178267002, 0.002714061178267002, 0, "ida i rise

that will allow for a pay raise for our military we are grateful for that and for the actions of this body i am so pleased to join you tonight as we turn our thoughts to iraq and what is happening in afghanistan because those are centers and they are battles in the war on terror the war on terror is a global war when we talk about the war on terror we are not talking about one specific place or one specific battle the global war on terror is something that is localized right now in iraq but we do know that while this is the battleground of today while afghanistan is the battleground while the middle east is the breeding ground for much of the terrorism that has been disbursed all across the globe we know that we have to look at this as a global war we have to know that this is going to be a long war we have been told that by our leaders we have been attacked we know that we were attacked for two full decades before we stopped looking at terrorism as an act of civil disobedience and we started responding to terrorism as an act of war that seemed to all come to a head when we looked at iraq when we had a very evil dictator who continued to defy u n resolutions who continued to just repeatedly snub the u n and snub the free world and say i can be the bully of the region if i want to aild that came to an end after september we commend our men and women in uniform that have gone there to set free to set free a people to begin stamping out terrorism and to be certain that we are standing up democracy and partners in democracy that will yield a peace dividend for our children and our grandchildren i appreciate that the gentleman from iowa took a few moments to talk about some of the women in iraq and some of the women that have fought so valiantly for freedom and for democracy and for liberty i have had the opportunity to work with our iraqi womens caucus and work with our department of state and stepped forward and helped to mentor some of these women as they take those baby steps and then as they lead in putting democracy in place you know it is so amazing to talk to them and to read the emails that they send to us as we seek to encourage them and their work and their efforts some of the stories that they have told about atrocities that they have lived through how they watched the vicious nature of saddams henchmen and how they would brutalize people brutalize families and how these women have lived through that and have moved forward to take that leadership role and to step forward and say do not leave us now do not leave us now we are on the right track and we know it looks messy and we know it is going to be a long process and we know this is not easy but do not leave us i cannot help but think when i have these conversations with these women and when i see some of them maybe they are missing a finger maybe there is something that is wrong maybe they have suffered pain and torture and agony and you can see it in their faces and you can see it in their bodies but in their spirit what you hear is the desire to be certain that they have their shot at freedom that is what they want they want the opportunity to live freely to enjoy the benefits of freedom and i thnink that we have to keep that in mind as we move forward one of the things we repeatedly hear and of course i know the gentleman from iowa is like me we all want to see our troops come home come home victorious and we would like to have them all come home but i think we have to keep in mind that there is not going to be one specific event or one announced time where we say all right the work is done because this is a work in progress it is a work in progress and we have seen tremendous progress we have seen some tremendous stepping back we have seen some failures but we are seeing progress and we are going to continue to see progress take place we have seen the elections in january of 2005 all the way to the election in december of 2005 we have watched the formation of a new government and now we can look forward as they are putting in place a permanent government this is not a provisional government there is a government that will rule in that country they will govern they will be making the laws setting the laws and at the same time we are watching the iraqi security forces train develop the competencies that they need in order to secure their nation and begin to stand up and take charge it is exciting to see that type of progress take place it is exciting to see progress in afghanistan it is exciting to see that there is that hope there and it raises our concerns we have about the rest of the middle east about iran about the areas that surround there and you know i think we have to keep in mind why we do this why we are there why we are rooting out terrorism why we have rooted out a brutal dictator why we do this is because if we are fighting there we are not going to have to be fighting that over here how very important for us to keep that in mind taking this battle to them right there in the middle east in that breeding ground of terrorism taking the battle there helps us to do our best to keep this nation secure to allow us to continue to be a trustee of this great and wonderful legacy that we call freedom i want to thank the gentleman from iowa for yielding i want to thank him for his excellent work

must bring to the members attention because i think members do not realize what is happening or if they do realize what is happening i want to make sure that it is in the record that they know we talk about debt a lot in our 30 something working group and talking about debt and doing something about debt are two different things the republican majority continues to spend in a recordbreaking way that is bankrupting this country and changing the philosophy of this country which is payasyougo democrats we are the only party in this house that can say that we balanced the budget we have actually done it we have actually had surpluses as far as the eye can see republicans can only talk about well we would like to cut it in half and we would like to cut it back a quarter or what have you but i just want to make sure that folks understand that there was an article written on tuesday of this week entitled another possible bump to the debt ceiling 2 7 trillion budget plan pending before the house would raise the federal debt ceiling by nearly 10 trillion less than 2 months after the congress last raised the federal debt borrowing limit the provision is buried on page 121 of a 151page blueprint it serves as the backdrop for congressional action this week i think it is important and i usually have my letters here from the secretary of the treasury but i think it is important that the american people and the members of this house understand that what they are doing to this country recordbreaking debt i just want to make sure before we start off and then i am going to be kind of quiet here tonight because i know that we have a lot to share it is almost too much to share but i just want to share this with the members one more time we are talking about who are we borrowing from we are borrowing from japan at 682 8 billion china 249 8 billion the uk 223 2 billion the caribbean 115 3 billion taiwan 71 3 billion opec nations including saudi arabia and a number of nations that we have issues with 67 8 billion germany 65 7 billion korea 66 5 billion canada 53 8 billion and climbing if we do not stop this republican majority from continuing to raise this debt ceiling and burying it within the federal budget on what they believe their members have to vote for and this budget vote has been postponed and postponed and postponed not because the republican majority did not have time to deal with it they just did not want to do to their constituents what the majority wants them to do as long as we are here and we have breath in our bodies we are going to share with the

ago the united states supreme court affirmed the statutory provision that requires institutions of higher education to provide access to students at least equal in quality and equal in scope to those that are provided to other employers in order to be eligible for receipt of federal funds the statutory provision commonly referred to as the solomon amendment was first enacted in 1994 and has subsequently been amended over the past several years however the basic underlying premise of the provision is that a college or university that denies military recruiters access equal to other recruiters would lose their federal funds the supreme court found that the solomon amendment does not violate the first amendment and that congress can require law schools to provide equal access to military recruiters without violating the schools freedom of speech or association as schools are free to not accept federal funding we are a nation at war and military recruiters need to be able to recruit individuals from all walks of life from the high school graduate to the person completing their doctorate and all of those in between whether they are undergraduates in liberal arts whether

bipartisan spirit at least some of the time and we are able to get a few things done and this is one of them the perkins act aims to prepare youth and adults for the future by building their academic and technical skills in preparation for postsecondary education and or employment the bill we are considering today enhances perkins by ensuring both secondary and postsecondary students participating in the program are acquiring rigorous academic and technical skills and will have the opportunity to transition into further education and or successful employment the perkins act governs widely supported programs of both the secondary and postsecondary level for example nearly all high school students complete at least one vocational education course and approximately 26 percent of students are considered vocational concentrators those students who focus on a single occupational area in my home state of delaware we have five career and technical high schools that enroll a total of 5 500 of the 29 500 total high school students at the postsecondary level the perkins act supports a broad array of options primarily at the community college level including delaware technical community college in the 19992000 school year over 50 percent of all students enrolled at the less than 4year postsecondary level reported that they were majoring in vocational areas todays conference report seeks to build upon reforms made in past reauthorizations and seeks to enhance this popular program to ensure its success in years to come the legislation before us today makes significant reforms to academic achievement and accountability to ensure students have the skills necessary to enter the workforce or continue to an institution of higher learning as i mentioned there are five career and technical high schools in delaware while all these schools met adequately yearly progress under the no child left behind act there is more to be done in academic achievement in these schools and schools across the country today we will improve vocational and technical education by increasing the focus on academics in conjunction with the skill attainment that is incumbent of the program one of the unique attributes of vocational and technical education programs is their ability to show students a path that could end in a certificate credential employment military or postsecondary education the techprep program within the perkins act is intended to focus on a welldefined link between high school and at least 2 years of postsecondary education research has shown however that funds are rarely if ever used to meet this goal rather funds are often used for purposes within the larger vocational and technical education program therefore the conference agreement revises requirements of the program in order to ensure articulation agreements between secondary and postsecondary institutions are in fact being implemented along this same track we include a new requirement for state development of career and technical programs of study for career and technical program areas these sequences of course will incorporate a nonduplicative progression of both secondary and postsecondary elements which will include both academic and vocational and technical content local recipients at both the secondary and postsecondary level would adopt at least one model sequence of courses as developed by the state i believe this will also help drive program improvements by ensuring that states clarify the progression of academic and vocational technical courses needed for the postsecondary education training or employment of a students choice it is clear that we are making some significant and positive changes for the schools and students impacted by this program one of the biggest changes that i think we are making is for congress to finally make the switch from vocational and technical education to career and technical education in my opinion this was an important statement for the congress to make while the president has proposed another avenue for high school reform in the perkins act i believe strongly that the reforms we consider today go a long way in driving program improvement and ultimate success for students across the country the dialogue surrounding high school reform is important and is happening in earnest i trust that the conference agreement will complement these efforts as a result of the changes in the bill i believe it will help states community colleges and other postsecondary education institutions and local educational

compromise bill arrived at after considerable effort of a bipartisan group involving both house and senate judiciary committee staff over several months from hearings in the house and from other reports we have learned that current federal law designed to protect animal enterprises have been proven to be reasonably effective in protecting animal enterprises however serious gaps and loopholes have been identified in current law with respect to protecting employees and associates of animal enterprises present law protects employees of an animal enterprise but we have found that employees board members and family members of businesses and nonprofits affiliated with or doing business with such enterprises are complaining that they are now being stalked harassed intimidated or threatened with some individuals even being physically assaulted and had their homes businesses or cars vandalized since the animal enterprise terrorism law was enacted in 1992 there have been some1 100 complaints of such incidents with property losses reported of being more than 120 million those complaining include farmers scientists biomedical and biotechnology industries research universities teaching hospitals financial institutions magazines newspapers and other advertising groups and others who are viewed as assisting or enabling targeted animal enterprises the evidence is that in many instances extremist elements among the animal rights groups are taking advantage of the fact that the animal enterprise laws do not cover affiliates and associates by using threats harassment intimidation and fear and other extreme tactics to pressure them into severing their activities with such enterprises s 3880 is designed to cover these gaps or loopholes by providing to employees businesses and associates of animal enterprises similar protections to those already covered in other words the bill prevents a person from doing indirectly to an animal enterprise what they are prohibited to do directly now citizens engaging in legitimate animal enterprise activities and anyone associated with them are entitled to be protected from criminal acts and to be able to go about their daily a tivities free from threats to their person or property and that of their family and associates state laws are generally good at providing those protections however the interstate nature of the planning and execution of the criminal harassment tactics used by some individuals or groups skilled at exploiting gaps or weaknesses in the laws have made it difficult for states to get at problems effectively that is why this bill is deemed necessary while we must protect those engaged in animal enterprises we must also protect the right of those engaged in first amendment freedoms of expres sion regarding such enterprises it goes without saying that first amendment freedoms of expression cannot be defeated by statute however to reassure anyone concerned with the intent of this legislation we have added in the bill assurances that it is not intended as a restraint on freedoms of expression such as lawful boycotting picketing or otherwise engaging in lawful advocacy for animals in addition we also wanted to recognize that there are some who conscientiously believe that it is their duty to peacefully protest the operation of animal enterprises to the extent of engaging in civil disobedience if a groups intention were to stage a sitin or liedown or to block traffic to a targeted facility they certainly run the risk of arrest for whatever traffic trespass or other laws they may be breaking but they should not be held more accountable for business losses due to causes such as delivery trucks being delayed any more than a boycott or protest against any other business to violate the provision of the bill one must travel or otherwise engage in interstate activity with the intent to cause damage or loss to an animal enterprise while the losses of profits lab experiments or other intangible losses are included it must be proved that such losses were specifically intended for the law to be applied if there is no damage or economic loss or damage

more specifically because the bill amends the definition of a counterfeit trademark to include packaging and labeling formats which can be used lawfully by a variety of businesses the new language clarifies that the repackaging of goods that were made under the authority of the united states trademark owner is not prohibited 1545 such repackaging can include combining single products into gift sets separating combination sets of goods into individual items for resale inserting coupons into original packaging or repackaged items affixing labels to track or otherwise identify products removing goods from original packaging for customized retail displays and moving products from large end caps or display modules into smaller cases in deciding whether to bring a cause of action under the new law in situations involving the repackaging of genuine goods it is expected that the government will consider evidence that clearly shows an intent to deceive or confuse such evidence could come in the form of altering concealing or obliterating expiration dates or information important to the consumer use of the product for example safety and health information about the quality performance or use of the product or service statements or other markings that a used discarded or refurbished product is new or statenments or other markings that the product meets testing and certification requirements also relevant to a decision to bring a criminal action would be a meaningful variance from product testing and certification requirements placing seals on product containers that have been opened or otherwise adulterating the genuine product finally the bill was modified to clarify thht it was not intended to allow criminal actions against persons who with no intent to deceive or confuse traffic in goods or services that were originally manufactured under the authority of the united states trademark owner in this regard the phrase the use of which is likely to cause confusion to cause mistake or to deceive is not intended to create a new element for this cause of action but instead reiterates what is already reflected in the definition of counterfeit mark so i
