neglect at the hands of the administration during the 1980s leveraged buyouts saddled carriers with huge debts congressional efforts to level the playing field among airlines met with administration opposition and subsidies to airbus were not taken as serlously as they should have been partly as a result of this the unitedstates airline industry has suffered 8 billion in losses in 3 years once

openly carrying handguns to impress their friends and to protect their turf and they are using them to kill other young people juveniles and gang members in a majority of states can openly carry guns

unlawful for youths under the age of 18 to possess a handgun except for hunting a gun safety course or target practice under the supervision of an adult i as much as others wholeheartedly respect

following air raids on oil installations and communications in romania three waves of c47s lifted the men to safety from a makeshift airfield only 90 miles from belgrade yugoslavia in subsequent missions the total of rescued airmen reached 800 during the first part of 1944 hundreds of allied sorties were flown from italian bases against the ploesti oil complex in romania hitlers most important source of oil during world war ii the losses were heavy since the route home led across yugoslavia and because the serbian area was under the control of general draja mihailovich royal yugoslav resistance leader hundreds of american airmen who had to bailout over yugoslavia were picked up by mihailovichs fighters the rescued airmen were thus saved from capture and imprisonment by german troops who occupied yugoslavia under cover of darkness c47s flew the men from the airfield within a radius of 20 to 30 miles from there were half a dozen german garrisons ranging in size from several hundred to several thousand men a luftwaffe unit was stationed at an airfield just 30 miles away it is believed the rescue code named operation halyard was the largest and most daring operation of its kind conducted anywhere in axisoccupied europe during world war h it is only fitting that we recall the rescued and the rescuers on this day the 50th anniversary of operation

after a while the nazis brought in waffen ss troops to take over and continue the slaughter today the slaughter is in gorazde i was going to speak about 79 years ago this coming sunday the date on which we remember the armenian genocide which was at that time the unparalleled slaughter of all time setting the standard for hitler and stalin to kill tens of millions but today we have gorazde the leftist columnist mary mcgroryhave you ever heard me quote mary mcgrory says this they wished the president had not picked that particular sunday to ride his mustang around the track while the serbian tanks ground into the streets of gorazde the symbolism was abysmal leader of the western world or playboy i will submit this article for the record this president had better focus on this as mcgrory says it is history that will be merciless to this president not the republicans now let me say a few words about the armenian genocide between the years 1915 to 1923 over 12 million armenians perished as a result of the brutal policies of the ottoman empire april 24 1915 symbolically marks the beginning of the systematic policy of deportation and murder which characterizes the armenian genocide this sunday marks the 79th year since the then unequalled slaughter began it was on the night of april 24 1915 that over 200 armenian intellectual leaders were arrested in constantinople and in other cities throughout the ottoman empire in the months to follow armenian political intellectual and religious leaders were rounded up arrested exiled or murdered thus suppressing the most vocal voices of the armenian people armenian men of military age were conscripted into the service of the ottoman army these men were separated into labor battalions disarmed and then worked to death or massacred the remaining armenian divilians senior citizens women and children that were left behind were deported from their cities and towns the men and older boys were separated from the groups never to be seen again any others that remained were forced on death marches across asia minor into the syrian desert approximately 500 000 armenians were able to escape to russia europe or the united states as a result of the killings and deportations the armenian population in the ottoman empire was reduced from s22 million to fewer than 100 000 it is in the spirit of remembrance that we recognize the 79th anniversary of the armenian genocide and keep alive the memories of those who were murdered and honor those who survived likewise we commend the enduring strength and fortitude of the armenian people who heroically continue to preserve their heritage and culture despite suffering overwhelming losses as a result of an infamous period in world history that even mass murderers like adolph hitler and joseph stalin took note of as they began their own genocidal rampages"]]}
