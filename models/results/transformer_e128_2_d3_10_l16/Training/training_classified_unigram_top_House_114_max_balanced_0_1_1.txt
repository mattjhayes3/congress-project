of black health a congressional black caucus assessment during national minority health month it is no surprise that we are here today because certainly we have had many firsthand experiences to know the disparities that exist across all americans but more specifically across african american communities to you mr payne thank you for having the foresight to come tonight and to you congresswoman kelly thank you for taking a leadership position in helping us share with the nation the value and the importance of protecting all lives but giving information to the nation about the state of black health it is imperative that we continue to address health disparities that affect racial minorities and work together on the efforts to advance health equity since july 1971 the congressional black caucus has sponsored national conferences and held brain trusts on black health it is so timely that we have this discussion as we observe national minority health month tonight is a call to action a charge for all of us to unite towards a common goal of improving the health of our communities everyone in america should be able to live a healthy life regardless of the color of their skin the good news is the overall health of an american has improved over the past few decades this is in part due to the increased focus on preventive medicine and dynamic new advances in medical technology however not all americans have benefited equally from healthcare improvements since the enactment of the affordable care act millions of americans now have access to quality affordable coverage according to the american medical association recent studies have shown that despite the steady improvement in overall health of the united states racial and ethnic minorities experience a lower quality of health services and are less likely to receive routine medical procedures and have higher rates of morbidity and mortality than nonminorities disparities in health care exist even when controlling for gender condition age and socioeconomic status for example cardiovascular diseases account for the largest proportion of inequality in life expectancy between african americans and nonhispanic whites according to the american cancer society african american women have a 44 percent higher death rate from breast cancer despite having a mammography screening rate that is nearly the same rate for white women according to the centers for disease control the cdc the infant death rate among african americans is still more than double that of whites tonight you are going to hear my colleagues and i discuss much data and statistics because i am from the great state of ohio and ohio ranks 47th in the nation in infant mortality with black infants dying at twice the rate of white infants according to a 2015 study conducted by the kaiser family foundation in ohio on average 14 5 black infants die per every 1 000 live births while 6 3 white infants die ohio community leaders and the greater columbus infant mortality task force are working hard to lower franklin countys infant mortality rate and the infant mortality rate in all of ohio tonight i salute them for their research for their education and for their consistency to save lives the statistics are staggering and we can and must do more to lower and eliminate them the societal burden of healthcare disparities in america manifest in multiple and major ways for example a 2014 study by the joint center for political and economic studies concluded that the combined costs of health inequalities and premature death in the united states were 1 24 trillion that 1 24 trillion is the cost between 2003 and 2006 that is why on march 23 2010 when president barack obama signed the affordable care act it was a monumental step that has helped us address the overwhelming statistics and health disparities within our community i proudly supported the affordable care act because lives matter all lives matter black lives matter now we have comprehensive healthcare reform that improves access to affordable health coverage and guarantees that the most vulnerable in our communities have access to care by improving access to quality health care for all americans the affordable care act helps reduce health disparities how does the affordable care act do this this law invests in prevention and wellness gives individuals more control over their care and expands initiatives to increase racial and ethnic diversity in healthcare professions by strengthening cultural competency training for all healthcare providers and improving communications between providers and patients the affordable care act represents the most significant federal effort to reduce disparities in this countrys history congressman payne and congresswoman kelly again i salute you i am going to repeat that because it is so important for us to let the nation know that the affordable care act represents the most significant federal effort to reduce disparities in this countrys history the affordable care act also increases funding for community health centers which serve an estimated one in three lowincome people and one in four lowincome minority residents there are over 43 community health centers in ohio including many in my district columbus neighborhood health centers heart of ohio family health centers and lower lights christian health centers these community health centers provide outstanding primary care dental behavioral health and pharmacy services in our most underserved areas in 2013 community health centers provided care to over 550 000 ohioans and recorded over 2 million patient visits we have come a long way but there is still much more for us to do all people should have the opportunity to reach their fullest potential for health we must continue to move forward to combat health disparities build healthier communities and create a stronger country in order to have a successful nation i believe we must have a healthy nation let me leave you with something a national figure once said if you neglect to recharge a battery it dies if you run full speed ahead without stopping for water you lose momentum to finish the race let us make sure that all americans can finish the race"], [0.0006059408187866211, 0.9993940591812134, 1, "thank you congressman payne i did want to say to i appreciate you participating in the diversity dinners last week i cant have congressman payne have a oneup on me so thank you so much i really appreciate it as we continue our conversation on accountability equality and diversity i would like to offer some statistics on our economy 50 years ago and today with respect to the african american community and women in 1965 african american jobseekers could be denied employment based on the color of their skin and when they could find jobs they were disproportionately paid less than white males in the same position in fact in 1965 the black unemployment rate was 8 1 percent almost twice the national unemployment rate which stood at 4 5 percent fifty years later we have made great strides and our nations workforce is more diverse than ever but we have much more work to do today at 10 4 percent the black unemployment rate is still almost double the national unemployment rate of 5 6 percent while it is significantly smaller there is still a racial wage gap the median african american household has less than twothirds the income of the average white median household in the past year we have seen the greatest economic growth in decades more and more women have been able to enter the workforce reducing the employment rate among women to a 6year low unfortunately black women have yet to reap the benefits of the economic rebound in fact while the overall unemployment rate for women declined the black female unemployment rate has increased over the past 2 months according to a recent analysis by the national womens law center the black womens unemployment rate is more than twice the unemployment rate of white women despite having comparable levels of education black women have had the highest unemployment rate of any other group a possible factor in the stubborn unemployment rate for black women is that we are disproportionately employed in the public sector which is experiencing a much slower recovery than the private sector nwlc said the stagnant job situation for black women is a red flag in the employment landscape and urged lawmakers to act to promote a stronger more widely shared recovery i couldnt agree more we need to invest more in job training and retraining programs that help black women adapt to the changing workforce and prepare for the careers of tomorrow we must work to promote diversity in hiring and encourage employers to model their workforces on the communities in which they operate as we look for ways to help increase diversity in the workplace and help women succeed we must be mindful of the unique challenges black women face and develop targeted policies that help level the playing field for all women these facts i have just covered point to the systemic problems we need to address them today it should be our mission today to see to it that in 50 years when lawmakers stand here they will proudly be touting the progress our nation has made because all americans are paid equally and no is discriminated against in the workplace as chair of the congressional black caucus health braintrust i am working to address our nations health equity gap by exploring legislative and policy initiatives to reduce minority health disparities and promote better health outcomes for all americans with respect to the african american community the health disparity gap is particularly wide as blacks have high rates of many adverse health conditions across the medical spectrumfrom cancer to diabetes from hypertension to strokeblacks are overrepresented and often undertreated a major barrier to african americans getting the medical care they need is the lack of african american doctors in their communities studies show that african americans are more comfortable seeking treatment from doctors who look like them and are much more likely to adhere to courses of treatment prescribed by black doctors yet while african americans comprise 13 percent of the unitedstates population we represent only 4 percent of the physician workforce according to the association of american medical colleges 2014 diversity in the physician workforce report the infamous tuskegee study fostered an enduring legacy of mistrust of the medical establishment in the african american community that makes diversity in medicine vital to closing the health disparities gap in order to achieve health equity we must work to create a physician workforce that reflects our nation one key way to do that is to encourage more african americans to pursue education and training in science technology engineering and math congress must do more to support investments in stem education and to create avenues of access for african american students to enter the stem fields in my district i launched the second congressional district stem academy to expose students to stem fields in hopes of encouraging them to pursue stemrelated careers also a stem workforce made up of diverse ranks is crucial to future innovation to help in that mission folks across the country and in silicon valley have taken note i know facebook has sought to change the face of innovation through efforts like their facebook academy and facebook university which target high school and college students from underrepresented groups similar to my stem academy it is good to see them making an effort to build a pipeline and introduce women and people of color to jobs in stemwhich of course could be it engineeringand hopefully more young people decide to become doctors and they can work in african american communities or underserved communities a medical student population that reflects our countrys population will create a pipeline of diverse doctors to our communities which will in turn put all americans on track to live a healthier life i turn back to my colleague from new jersey congressman donald payne"], [0.0006061792373657227, 0.9993938207626343, 1, "i first want to start by thanking congresswoman beatty for that very kind and generous introduction we in our class are very proud of our colleagues and we support each other in times of need i just would like to also congratulate and acknowledge congressman hakeem jeffries the gentleman from new york who is also host of this special order i appreciate the opportunity to discuss an issue that is very personal to me before i begin i just want to say that my heart goes out to the families and friends of the victims of the horrible tragedy in orlando and i can only imagine what they are going through the other thing that is illuminating to me is that as we came here and stood up for a moment of silence after that moment of silence i believe members were given a 1minute opportunity to speak on any topic that they would like to on the floor as is customary and not one person from the other side of the aisle mentioned what happened in orlando so not only was it a moment of silence for the leadership in this house but it appears that it is going to be a moment that remains silent or a topic that remains silent from the other side of the aisle eliminating racialbased health disparities depends on our ability to advance access to affordable health care for all even in the 21st century health disparities are stark especially in the african american communities where life expectancies are lower and infant mortality rates are higher than among whites today despite improvement in overall health in the united states african americans and other minority populations lag behind in numerous health areas including access to quality care timelines of care and health outcomes for years the congressional black caucus has called on republicans to join us and other house democrats in developing a plan to eliminate racial health disparities a plan that addresses the causes of health disparities such as inequities in environmental social and economic conditions in our communities instead we get from them proposals like their socalled a better way poverty proposal a stale repackaging of failed policies presented under the guise of concern about americans trapped in poverty cutting job training programs food assistance and head start will push lowincome americans further into poverty making it even more difficult for them to access the affordable and quality health care needed to secure their wellbeing and the wellbeing of their families we need to instead use the government as a source of good every american deserves to live in a safe and healthy environment yet lowincome and minority communities are much more exposed to high levels of pollution resulting in serious health problems such as asthma heart problems and cancer this is a very real problem across america a very real problem in my district thirteen million people including 3 5 million children are concentrated in the vicinity of transportation facilities and are exposed to unhealthy levels of air pollution my district is home to the port newarkelizabeth marine terminal part of the port of new york and new jersey the third largest port in the country according to the epa 25 percent of children in newark suffer from asthmathree times the state average what we need are additional federal actions to reduce harmful air pollution from ports and congested components of the national freight transportation system the issue is critical to the lowincome and minority community who suffer the disproportionately adverse health effects of these environmental hazards now since i am on the topic of environmental justice i just want to remind everyone that the republicans continue to block any action to help the thousands of children facing lifelong damage from drinking poisoned water in flint including a vote to block the families of flint act emergency supplemental their radical refusal to address this health issue will have tragic consequences for american families and i think it is representative of their overall inadequate approach to health disparities in minority communities the way to eliminate racial health disparities is neither to downplay them nor to cut programs that will assist the most vulnerable it is to address the environmental social and economic conditions that exacerbate those disparities it is to expand access to quality health care that could eliminate or reduce the onset of many of these chronic illnesses and disproportionate health outcomes it is to maintain and strengthen our investments in healthcare access and resources for disadvantaged populations in closing i also want to stress that health education must also be a focus in any efforts to eliminate racialbased health disparities african americans and other communities are disproportionately affected by poor providerpatient communication and health literacy issues consequently they often do not have access to information that enables them to make the appropriate health decisions we have a responsibility to work with our healthcare institutions and community health centers to make it easier for people to find understand and use the information and services as cochair of the congressional mens health caucus i have hosted and participated in a number of outreach events in my district to engage directly with constituents about the importance of making positive health decisions and staying proactive about their health and wellbeing so i encourage everyone watching at home to get the information you need to make smart health decisions to get the security you and your family deserve and to get the health care that we all need"], [0.000611424446105957, 0.999388575553894, 1, "one additional concern for me and for many others is an awful provisionand i stress the word awful in this bill which constitutes a big giveaway to big oil and could lead to an increase in gas prices big oil gives big money to campaigns and sadly big oil is getting a very big return on its investment with this bill this provision could intensify climate change have devastating environmental impacts and does nothing to save consumers money on energy costs i will be asking my colleagues to defeat the previous question if the previous question is defeated i will offer an amendment to strike this outrageous provision my colleagues will have to decide whether the good outweighs the bad before casting their vote on the omnibus bill compromise is never easy but in a divided government it is essential if we are to move forward one of my biggest critiques of this republicancontrolled congress has been the total disregard for americans who strugglethose stuck in poverty time and time again in this chamber poor people have been demonized and disparaged while those who are well off and well connected get one tax break after another after another i am pleased that in the tax extenders package there are provisions to protect millions of struggling americans from a tax increase and boost family incomes by permanently extending essential improvements to the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit for lowincome working families as well as the american opportunity tax credit to help low and middleincome families pay for college all of these improvements to these tax credits were originally passed as part of the 2009 recovery act and each has played a critical role in fueling americas economic recovery after the financial crisis making these improvements permanent would be among the biggest steps congress can take to reduce poverty and without action these credits would expire at the end of 2017 every year these improvements are expected to lift about 16 million people including about 8 million children out of poverty or closer to rising above the poverty line simply put making these improvements to the eitc and the ctc permanent will keep more children out of poverty than any other federal program the real world impact cannot be overstated for example a single mother with two children who works full time at the federal minimum wage of 7 25 an hour and makes 14 500 a year would lose her entire 1 725 child tax credit without congressional action for a family on a fixed income this would be a terrible setback additionally making the american opportunity tax credit permanent would ensure this program continues to help millions of low and middleincome families pay for college every year in addition to the millions of families these provisions would help this legislation before us takes important steps to bolster investments in education job training advanced manufacturing infrastructure and research while also strengthening national security i am especially pleased that this deal includes a provision that would make permanent tax parity for commuters who take mass transitsomething that has long been a major priority of mine for far too long the tax code has allowed employers to offer their workers more in pretax parking benefits than in mass transit benefits parity between parking and mass transit benefits was first established in the recovery act and has been extended on a shortterm basis since then the bill before us would establish permanent parity for mass transit commuters it is an attractive fringe benefit that employers can offer their workers it offers significant savings to employees who rely on mass transit it is especially important to my constituents in central and western massachusetts who take the train every day into downtown boston by averting a government shutdown and passing this deal we will be able to bring certainty to small businesses as well as companies investing in the united states while extending important incentives that support hiring and investing in lowincome communities following the historic international climate agreement reached in paris this past weekend i am also pleased that this deal would extend tax incentives for investments in wind and solar energy helping to drive significant reductions in carbon pollution and other dangerous air pollutants and provide certainty for investments in clean energy investments like these would not be possible without the recent budget deal which reversed about 90 percent of the cuts that sequestration would have made to nondefense discretionary programs in fiscal year 2016 with parity between defense and nondefense spending while there are many positive provisions in this deal one major concern is that the house republican tax extender bill would provide hundreds of billions of dollars in special interest tax breaks that are permanent and unpaid for such massive giveaways to special interests like big oil are a step in the wrong direction as our economy continues to recover we have a responsibility to the american people to pass legislation that helps to grow the paychecks of hardworking families and make the investments that will build the bright future that our children deserve i am especially troubled by the fact that the tax extenders bill continues the misguided double standard of financing tax cuts with budget deficits while insisting on offsets for any increases in domestic spending quite frankly this is dishonest coming from my republican colleagues who so often claim to be focused on reducing the deficit so many american families are working hard to get back on their feet and give their children opportunities that they deserve continuing this double standard of holding back on investments that we could be making now to help even more of our fellow citizens is inexcusable extending hundreds of billions in tax breaks to the most powerful interests when our country needs much stronger investment in jobs and economic growth for all is a troubling and sober reminder that we must do more to put hardworking families first quite frankly i think it highlights the difference between the two parties democrats have long championed the importance of investing in our infrastructure investing in our people and investing in our economy the omnibus spending bill and the tax extenders package before us today is not perfect members on both sides of the aisle are going to have to decide for themselves whether the good outweighs the bad clearly there are some good things and there are some bad things hopefully in the future we will return to regular order and do our business in a more thoughtful and effective way i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.0006210803985595703, 0.9993789196014404, 1, "i thank the gentlewoman for yielding no one more than congresswoman barbara lee in this house has been focused on how we lift those in poverty out of poverty and into the middle class 1800 of course as she so well says it will be good for those in poverty but it will also be good for all the rest of us they will help build a better economy they will help grow jobs and they will help america be stronger i am honored to join my friend chairwoman barbara lee of the democratic whips task force on poverty income inequality and opportunity for this special order i also want to thank chairman cleaver of the cbcs poverty and economy task force for the work that it has done in this area poverty is bad for your health poverty is bad for your mental health poverty is bad for children poverty is bad for families more than 50 years after president johnson declared unconditional war on poverty 46 million americans are still struggling in poverty that is not to say we havent made some progress there are programs we have adopted frankly medicare is a tremendous poverty program our seniors are better off and far less of them are in poverty because of medicare medicaid is a critical program to make sure that those who cannot afford it are nevertheless given health care which is important for all of us to have healthy citizens with whom we deal on a daily basis ours may be the wealthiest nation on earth but we can best measure americas economic success not by how many are at the very top but how few are stuck at the bottom of the economic ladder by that measure we have a long way to go to fulfill americas promise as a land of equal opportunity and of success even in 2015 the lines between rich and poor trace the old divides of race and background with 29 percent of native americans 26 percent of african americans and 23 percent of latinos living in poverty poverty also strikes of course our rural communities in fact in many respects there is more poverty in our rural communities than in our cities and urban communities it is more visible in our cities because they are aggregated although we ought not to forget that literallyas i just mentioned about minoritiesmillions and millions of nonminorities struggle in poverty every day poverty strikes children at a higher rate unfortunately one in five children in america as our leader says the task force we launched and which barbara lee chairs has been working hard to raise awareness in congress of these very real and very difficult challenges of poverty in america and to provoke policies that help alleviate suffering in the short term while working to eradicate poverty over the long term speaker ryan has raised poverty as an issue on which he is focused and he has visited areas of poverty in our country we could recognize poverty we can visit those in poverty but what it is important to do and what barbara lee is leading us to do is to adopt policies that almost eliminate reduce and empower those in poverty the number one rule on the war on poverty of course ought to be first do no harm this means making sure that we refrain from disinvesting in the critical programs that serve the poor and help millions stave off hunger homelessness and disease we ought to have those criteria in mind when we consider the appropriations bills tax bills and other policies that affect our people thankfully the recent bipartisan budget deal prevented the return of sequestrations severe and painful automatic cuts which would have disproportionately harmed the most vulnerable in our economy now congress has a responsibility to follow that up by passing an omnibus and avert a shutdown however not doing further harm is not enough congress has a responsibility first and foremost to help create jobs that put americans back to work and enable them to rise out of poverty and as congressman coleman watson indicated to make sure that when we ask people and give people the opportunity to work we value that work and pay them a living wage we cannot enable people to rise out of poverty if it keeps lurching from one manufactured crisiswhen i say it our policies here in congress on budgets on debt on investment and on taxesto the next if we lurch from one crisis to another we will not be able to succeed in enabling and empowering those currently in poverty we need to work together to invest in education workforce training and innovation to make our workforce more competitive and open doors of opportunity for those looking to get hired we also need to expand assistance for housing and nutrition as well as access to health care especially for children poverty need not be a cycle and should not be a cycle from generation to generation that is debilitating certainly for them but we ought to all recognize it is debilitating for us our communities and our country the promise of america has always been that this cycle can be broken that is what we think about america even if you are born in circumstances that are tough if you work hard and play by the rules you can rise above it we need to make sure that we give them that opportunity we need to take steps to make sure that hard work pays off that those who have jobs can earn enough not only to get by but to get ahead this means making child care more affordable for working parents enacting paid leave to care for sick loved ones and raising the minimum wage the new speaker mr ryan has indicated he takes very seriously the issue of poverty as i said i hope we can work together to address that problem in a serious responsible and effective manner not to do so would be a grave disservice to the future of our country and its people one area he has suggested we might find agreement is in expanding the earned income tax credit to childless adults which could lift an additional half a million americans out of poverty in addition to that we ought to index the itc we ought to index the child tax credit and we ought to index the opportunity tax credit so that we can empower and enable those who are working those who have children that we want wellcared for and safe to be more productive citizens i thank again chairwoman barbara lee and all of the members on the democratic

propose to bring a very important issue before the house and before the american people today we had our first opportunity to really move to protect americans presently if you are on the nofly list which is not easy to get onthere has to be some very specific reason why you could be a threat to american citizens to the airplane on which you might be traveling or you might be entering this country for some nefarious reason like terrorism but if you are on the nofly list and you do happen to be in america you can go to a gun store or to perhaps any fairground where there is a gun show and you can buy a weapon virtually any gun an assault weapon a handgun a shotgun and the question arises if you are too dangerous to fly are you not too dangerous to buy a gun but under american law today you can indeed be too dangerous to fly you could be a threat to the other passengers or to a tower to an airplane but apparently you are not a threat to buy a gun in fact there are some 16 000 people a very small portion of the american citizenry that are on the nofly list since 9111 in 2001 more than 2 000 men probably women who are too dangerous to fly on the nofly list have been able to purchase guns here in the united states so lets see if we get this straight you have been designated by the department of homeland security and the various federal government agenciestsa fbi quite possibly the cia and othersas being a threat to the security and safety of america and americans and you are put on a nofly list meaning you cant get on an airplane you are not able to buy a ticket you are not able to travel and yet you find some way to go down to the local gun store in those states that do not have background checks or maybe a gun show where there are no background checks you present yourself and say oh that is a pretty goodlooking ar14 id like to have it sure you got the money i got the money here is the gun this makes no sense whatsoever somehow i think the american public gets this if you are too dangerous to fly then you are too dangerous to be able to buy a gun in america it is that simple there ought to be a law but there is no law here in the house of representatives many of us have been trying for actually several years to deal with this crazy loophole in our gun safety laws yet we have been unable to have a bill come to the house floor where 435 of us that represent all of the american citizens will have an opportunity to vote on whether we believe that if you are too dangerous to fly you are too dangerous to buy a gun so today my fellow democratic representatives and iabout 135 of us thus farhave signed what is known as a discharge petition so that a bipartisan piece of legislation introduced by representative king of new york who is a republican could be brought to the floor and all of us face the responsibility of selecting whose side do we stand on do we stand for the safety of americans and prevent people that are too dangerous to fly from being able to buy a gun or do we stand with those on the nofly list that are presumably dangerous and say oh yeah you ought to be able to buy a gun even though you are too dangerous to fly now for my american friends out there all of you voters and nonvoters dont you think it is time for your representatives 435 of us to stand before you in this house and say we agree that if you are too dangerous to fly then you are too dangerous to buy a gun and you cannot buy a gun or stand here before all the american public and say no no no if you are too dangerous to fly go ahead and buy a gun so that is what a discharge petition will do it will take our republican friends bill mr king of new york bring it to the floor and put the issue before your representatives before the representatives of the american people and cause us to make a choice for your safety or for the presumed right of a person who is too dangerous to fly to be able to buy a gun it is pretty simple stuff we will see what happens that issue is now bubbling around here on the floor today there were four motions to adjourn which is a way of disrupting the normal procedures of the housewhich are terribly abnormal to begin withand causing the attention of the membership of the house and the press from the press box or wherever they happen to be to focus on this oneoneissue whether those 16 000 or so people that are on the nofly list can also go out and buy a gun two thousand already have by the way we ought to quickly discuss this issue of well there is a constitutional issue here an issue in which these people are on a list but they have no ability to get offno not so not so when the nofly list was first put together following 9111 the issue was raised of the constitutionality of it by the american civil liberties organization it went to a federal court and the federal court said no we disagree with you we believe this is a constitutionally authorized protection of the american public and there is a procedure for an individual to petition to get off the list so this issue of constitutionality was decided some years ago by a federal court so the arguments that you will undoubtedly hear here about this being oh an infringement of the constitutional right for an individual to buy a gun no this issue has already been resolved if you are on the nofly list and you think you shouldnt be there you have got a procedure a program underway and available to you to remove yourself from the nofly list and the court said it meets constitutional muster so taking it a step further we know a lot of americans of certain classes that cannot buy a gun criminals convicted felons people that in some states have been involved in domestic violence and people that have exhibited mental health issues those people are barred in many cases from not being able to buy a gun so we would add to that category people that our law enforcement agencies have deemed to be dangerous quite possibly terrorists or abiding and assisting terrorist organizations if you cant fly we just simply say that you cant buy a gun alsopretty simple my republican colleague mr king is correct the issue is not resolved the issue will be back before us tomorrow the 9th day of december for those of us that believe that if you are too dangerous to fly you are too dangerous to buy a gun those of us that believe this to be the right policy will continue to push this issue for the safety of americans 16 000 people may not be able to buy a gun if this becomes law and that is a good thing because we know already 2 000 people that are on that nofly listactually more than 2 000have been able to buy a gun what did they do with it well maybe they went out and shot quail or maybewe pray not but we dont know do we so the issue is before us as are many many important issues but i dont think there is any issue more important than the safety of the american people we know that if somebody is thought to be dangerous then they ought not have a gun i hope that this house will see the wisdom of taking a small step and denying some 16 000 people many of whom are probably not even american citizens the opportunity to buy a gun i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0006334185600280762, 0.9993665814399719, 1, "there is no doubt how much i appreciate the congressional black caucus and congresswoman

which and to whom we speak so i am thankful for that i want to pay tribute overall to the congressional black caucus because we are actually here speaking of health disparities because it was the caucus that triggered this debate through the years that we have been trying to get universal access to health care and was the moving force in the 2009 2008 and 2010 passage ultimately of the affordable care act where the work that we did joining congresswoman donna christianchristiansen at that time and frank pallone on the congressional health caucus but on the cbc we had the health disparities task to ensure that the language in the affordable care act addressed the issue of health disparities there was a large section on that that built on some of the work that some of us had already done creating the office of minority health that i had worked on in years past so it was the lightning bolt of the caucus and then working with the congressional asian pacific american caucus and then the congressional hispanic caucus that we raised the issue that no one was talking about i remember debating on the floor of the house on the issues of dealing with senior citizen african american men and how they access health care how do women access health care and how do women impacted by diabetes access health care these are some of the diseases that have a proclivity to the african american population we were finding out that we even had an issue where medical professionals didnt know how to ask the questions how do you address someone who needs to be diagnosed for prostate cancer or may be diagnosed for prostate cancer and is an african american male a senior citizen my father ultimately died from cancer that metastasized from the prostate to the lungs and the brain so we knew we had a serious issue so today i want to mention four points but i am going to focus on the last one obesitya question of access to health care and physical fitness many times we live in areas where there is no access to a pool or a tennis court mental healthif you lived your life in a segregated america if you were called boy and girl it is a different mental health situation than maybe others may have faced if you live in a situation of poverty of a single household maybethis is not across the boardthese issues will be impacted if you lived around gun violence if you saw your 15yearold friend being shot dead in the street there is a question of mental health that we need access to that care for us to be able to reach out or maybe counselors to be able to provide for children hiv aids is something that we have lived through i remember going to funerals of friends in the 1980s and into the 1990s particularly with hiv aids so we have worked in the congressional black caucus to massively talk about testing let me get to this point that i want to dwell just for a moment on and that is gun violence i was here on the floor earlier with my head held down and my heart heavy as my district today had a memorial they had one yesterday we will have one tomorrow and have one on wednesday i mourn with congresswoman corinne brown of florida we are offering legislation dealing with the assault weapons and to complement legislation already passed or already in place but it is important to note that this is a health issue because the centers for disease control can assess and study every health issue that faces america today but they are legislatively by law prohibited by my friends on other side of the aisle by republicans disallowed every year to give them permission to study gun violence gun violence is killing our children and killing our families in orlando it killed latinos who happened to be the attendees at the pulse club the lgbtq community was the dominant community and a hateful terroristic act using ar15s and glock guns killed them the incident was the deadliest mass shooting the next deadliest incidents in recent history were april 16 2007 virginia tech 32 killed 17 injured december 14 2012 sandy hook 26 killed 1 injured october 16 1991 killeen texas 23 killed 27 injured according to everytown index of mass shootings where four or more people are shot and killed the incident was the ninth mass shooting in the united states in 2016 and the 150th mass shooting in united states since january 1 2009 the mass shooting with guns impacts both the mental health the sanctity and the minority community it is shameful that we are not allowed to engage in the kind of research that a harvard professor talked about and that is the assessing of violence and the assessing of violence with guns the materials i have before me make it very clear that most of these violent acts are done with gunsdone with guns san bernardino chattanooga charleston garland oak creek and fort hood were all done with guns so i stand here today to challenge this issue of health disparities to say that the heavy brunt of killings singular killings are impacted by poverty lack of access to health care the proliferation of guns in our inner city communities and the failure of the united states congress to put real gun safety legislation closing the loophole the jim clyburn rule that says that if you dont get the review and approval by atf you do not get the gun you have to wait until you get the approval from atf which may be trying to determine whether this person with multiple problems mental health or background issues doesnt need to get a gun and then ultimately go kill their spouse their children their neighbors their family members or strangers so it is my belief today that this health disparities debate is crucial and we should come away from here recognizing that obesity the issues of mental health and hiv aids can be with great investment researched for cures or cancer that proliferates in our community triple negative breast cancer legislation that i have put forward and have gotten passed about that impact but it is the gun violence that we are doing absolutely nothing about the disparities and the impact on minority communities is atrocious i want to close simply by saying the word or the acronym lgbtq community i want to say it over and over again because i think it is shameful that in our debate in our recognition of the tragedy of orlando that we dont acknowledge the horrific hate crime and the hatefulness against that community as i stand here that community is diverse and there are african americans who are lgbtq so i would ask that as we move forward this week we will be reminded of this hatefulness and we will have a cure we will be reminded of this violence and we will have a cure that cure first of all will be to restrain the use of assault weapons and these weapons of wartype bullets that men and women in the united states military say have no business on the streets of america i believe congresswoman that health disparities are an important wall and division to overcome i thank the gentlewoman for having this special order to ensure that we will confront these issues and try to save lives racial disparities refer to the variation in rates of disease occurrence and disabilities between socioeconomic and or geographically defined population groups i want to focus on four areas of racial disparities in health that impact african americans that we can do something about 1 obesity 2 mental health 3 hiv aids and 4 gun violence african americans based on 2015 census data comprise 13 2 percent of the unitedstates population or about 42 million people socioeconomic status in turn is linked to mental health people who are impoverished homeless incarcerated or have substance abuse problems are at higher risk for poor mental health as the founder and chair of the congressional childrens caucus i am especially concerned about the childhood obesity epidemic among africanamerican youth more than 40 percent of african american teenagers are overweight and nearly 25 percent are obese the percentage of children aged 611 years in the united states who were obese increased from 7 percent in 1980 to nearly 18 percent in 2012 african american youth are consuming less nutritious foods such as fruits and vegetables and are not getting enough physical exercise this combination has led to an epidemic of obesity which directly contributes to numerous deadly or lifethreatening diseases or conditions including the following hypertension dyslipidemia high cholesterol or high triglyceride levels type 2 diabetes coronary heart disease stroke gallbladder disease osteoarthritis asthma bronchitis sleep apnea and other respiratory problems cancer breast colon and endometrial when ethnicity and income are considered the picture is even more troubling african american youngsters from lowincome families have a higher risk for obesity than those from higherincome families efforts such as the lets move campaign by the first lady are pivotal to ensuring that communities are able to provide healthy snacks and food and encourage healthier decisions since the mid1970s the prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased sharply for both adults and children nonhispanic blacks have the highest ageadjusted rates of obesity at 47 8 percent according to the cdc 37 6 percent of men and 56 9 percent of women twenty years and over are obese every year more than 40 million americans struggle with mental illness african american men are as likely as anyone else to have mental illness but they are less likely to get help racism continues to have an impact on the mental health of african americans negative stereotypes and attitudes of rejection have decreased but continue to occur with measurable adverse consequences historical and contemporary instances of negative treatment have led to a mistrust of authorities many of whom are not seen as having the best interests of african americans in mind according to the department of health and human services office of minority health adult blacks are 20 percent more likely to report serious psychological distress than adult whites adult blacks living below poverty are two to three times more likely to report serious psychological distress than those living above poverty adult blacks are more likely to have feelings of sadness hopelessness and worthlessness than are adult whites how african americans view mental health over generations is a major barrier to accessing mental health services and treatment in 1996 mha commissioned a national survey on clinical depression the survey explored the barriers preventing americans seeking treatment and gauged overall knowledge of and attitudes toward depression this survey revealed that 63 percent of african americans believe that depression is a personal weakness this is significantly higher than the overall survey average of 54 percent only 31 percent of african americans believed that depression was a health problem african americans were more likely to believe that depression was normal than the overall survey average 56 percent believed that depression was a normal part of aging 45 percent believed it was normal for a mother to feel depressed for at least two weeks after giving birth 40 percent believed it was normal for a husband or wife to feel depressed for more than a year after the death of a spouse many of these problems persist to this day as doctor william lawson of howard university and mhas district of columbia affiliate pointed out in an npr interview in 2012 many africanamericans have a lot of negative feelings about or not even aware of mental health services the mental health culture race and ethnicity supplement to the 1999 unitedstates surgeon generals report on mental health states the following africanamerican physicians are five times more likely than white physicians to treat africanamerican patients africanamerican patients who see africanamerican physicians rate their physicians styles of interaction as more participatory african americans seeking help for a mental health problem would have trouble finding african american mental health professionals in 1998 only 2 percent of psychiatrists 2 percent of psychologists and 4 percent of social workers said they were african americans the public mental health safety net of hospitals community health centers and local health departments are vital to many african americans especially to those in highneed populations african americans of all ages are underrepresented in outpatient treatment but overrepresented in inpatient treatment few africanamerican children receive treatment in privately funded psychiatric hospitals but many receive treatment in publicly funded residential treatment centers for emotionally disturbed youth in 2012 there were an estimated 356 268 inmates with severe mental illnesses in unitedstates prisons and jails there were only 35 000 mentally ill individuals in state psychiatric hospitals the report the treatment of persons with mental illness in prisons and jails jails in 44 of the 50 states and the district of columbia a prison or jail in that state holds more individuals with serious mental illness than the largest remaining state psychiatric hospital the report said african americans today are overrepresented in our jails and prisons people of color account for 60 percent of the prison population the stanford law school three strikes projects report stated that over the past 15 years the number of mentally ill people in prison in california has almost doubled in california 45 percent of state prison inmates have been treated for severe mental illness within the past year african americans also account for 14 percent of regular drug users but for 37 percent of drug arrests illicit drug use is frequently associated with selfmedication among people with mental illnesses in january 2014 the texas observer reported that of the 9 000 inmates in harris county jail more than 25 percent take medication for mental illness which means that the jail treats more psychiatric patients than all 10 of texas staterun public mental hospitals combined the passage of the affordable care act created access to health care for those who purchase health insurance and for the poor living in states that are participating in the medicaid component of the aca disparities can occur if physicians do not refer patients with signs of mental illness for proper treatment or if referred patients do not seek out treatment disparities in access to care and treatment for mental illnesses have also persisted over time as noted by the office of minority health only 8 7 percent of adult blacks versus 16 percent of adult whites received treatment for mental health concerns in 20072008 only 6 2 percent of adult blacks versus 13 9 percent of adult whites received medications for mental health concerns during 2008 while 68 7 percent of adult whites with a major depressive episode in 2009 received treatment only 53 2 percent of adult blacks did the affordable care act will have an impact on this gap by 2016 depression and other mental illness can be deadly if left untreated suicide is the third leading cause of death among african americans 15 to 24 years old untreated mental illness can also make african american men more vulnerable to substance abuse homelessness incarceration and homicide african americas are the racial ethnic group most affected by hiv in the united states according to the cdc 44 percent 19 540 of estimated new hiv diagnoses in the united states were among african americans who comprise 12 percent of the us population hiv aids are now the leading cause of death among african americans ages 25 to 44ahead of heart disease accidents cancer and homicide at the end of 2012 an estimated 496 500 african americans were living with hiv representing 41 percent of all americans living with the virus of african americans living with hiv around 14 percent do not know they are infected african americans accounted for an estimated 44 percent of all new hiv infections among adults and adolescents aged 13 years or older in 2010 despite representing only 12 percent of the unitedstates population hiv is a sexually transmitted disease or std it is also spread through intravenous drug use hiv infections spread through sharing of needles has declined with needle programs while the std rates of infection among african americans has increased at rate higher than any other ethnic group have their hiv status checkednot once but annually know the hiv status of sexual partner if hiv positive know how to get on antiviral medication 2 small pills taken each day and stay on them where to go for information if you or your partner is hiv positive in 2010 men accounted for 70 percent 14 700 of the estimated 20 900 new hiv infections among all adult and adolescent african americans the estimated rate of new hiv infections for african american men 103 6 100 000 population was 7 times that of white men twice that of latino men and nearly 3 times that of african american women in 2010 african american gay bisexual and other men who have sex with men represented an estimated 72 percent 10 600 of new infections among all african american men and 36 percent of an estimated 29 800 new hiv infections among all gay and bisexual men of those gay and bisexual men 39 percent 4 321 were young men aged 13 to 24 according to the cdc the numbers of new hiv diagnoses among african american women fell 42 percent between 2005 to 2014 but it is still high compared to women of other races ethnicities most new hiv infections among african american women 87 percent 5 300 are attributed to heterosexual contact in 2012 there were 72 010 texans living with hiv aids texas has the 10th highest number of hiv diagnoses in 2013 and ranks 18th for deaths from hiv currently 14 percent of the people living with hiv are undiagnosed and only 30 percent of the people with hiv are virally suppressed which means that 70 percent of the people who are ill are not on medication that can help limit their ability to infect others hiv is an unnecessarily disproportionate burden on the african american and latino community there is a wall of misinformation about the illness and an uncomfortable silence regarding the need to speak about the illness not only to the young but also the older persons when treatments were first developed in the 1990s they had lots of side effects that made patients very ill few talk about the advances in hiv treatment that now involve taking 2 small pills a day with the result leaving patients feeling healthy and able to engage in lifes normal activities the virus count for those who take their medication is so low that it often does not register in tests this does not mean that people are cured but it does mean that there is no reason not to get tested so that you know if you are in need of treatment anyone can become infectedso it is up to all of us to educate our families neighbors coworkers and friends about getting tested there are some insurance company practices that have a detrimental impact on the ability of people with hiv to enroll in qualified health insurance plans in states like texas that are not fully participating in the affordable care acts medicaid expansion this is especially problematic for hiv patients who are poor some states allow insurance carriers to post misleading or intentionally vague formularies on market place websites or excluding essential hiv medications from drug formularies and impressing high cost sharing out of pocket medication cost each month should be capped"], [0.000633537769317627, 0.9993664622306824, 1, "i thank my classmate and colleagues for hosting us this evening for the congressional black caucus special order hour during the past month we honored the great achievements and rich history of african americans and the african american community we reflected on an unfortunate journey through slavery and segregation prejudices and discrimination though we bring black history month to a close the congressional black caucus will continue to fight for justice tonight our special order hour is bridging the divide observations on race and justice in america our attention to the divides in our society however does not end because we entered a new month we must remain focused on how we can bridge the divides in our society and how we can bring our nation closer together the divides are striking and we know them all too well the school to prison pipeline education disparities health disparities the injustices in our justice system it is well established in fact that students of color face harsher punishments in schools than their white peers leading to a higher number of youth of color in detention suspension and yes expelled african american students are arrested far more often than their white classmates black and hispanic students represent more than 70 percent of those involved in schoolrelated arrests or referrals to law enforcement currently african americans make up twofifths and hispanics onefifth of confined youth today disparities are found not only in how we punish behavior in schools but also how we fund education this is true in k12 it is also true in higher education and we know that a college degree is a path to a middle class life as african american students graduate with more debt than their white classmates the cuts to pell grants are threatening african american access to a better education without the pell grant program hundreds of thousands of young african americans would not be able to afford college the disparities in access to health coverage are startling the infant mortality rate among african americans is 2 3 times that of nonhispanic whites and african american infants are four times more likely than nonhispanic white infants to die mostly due to complications related to birth weight we must confront these prejudices and these injustices in our nation headon the congressional black caucus is committed to resolving these challenges the congressional black caucus has fought to ensure funding the pell grant pell grants are contained in each years appropriations bills we have worked hard to make sure that the maternity and newborn care are part of health care plans under the affordable care act over 390 000 african american women in the individual market alone are projected to gain maternity coverage thanksyes thanksto the affordable care act our task force on the elimination of sentencing disparities is moving the ball on how black men and women are treated in the judicial system as we have been working here in congress our partners the deltas my sorority delta sigma theta sorority held their annual delta days in the nations capital today with thousands of women from across this nation gathering and advocating for these same disparities and injustices as deltas were uniting in their efforts today in our nations capital my sorors and i were also uniting for one of our very ownnominee loretta lynch last week the senate judiciary committee voted 128 to approve the confirmation of loretta lynch as the next united states attorney general bringing her confirmation to the full senate for consideration i remember it all too well a couple weeks before that when we were in that hearing room it looked like a sea of red as deltas marched in and lined up one after another wearing our colors crimson and cream deltas lined the outside of the hearing room we did that because prior to entering that room media and some of my colleagues on the other side had tried to make it a bad thing that she organized and was a founder of her college chapter of delta sigma theta sorority what we were able to do was to show them when we work together whether that is democrats and republicans or sorority members or nonsorority members when it is the right thing to do we can make a difference i was so proud last week to sit there on the front row with my other colleagueswith our chairman of the congressional black caucus congressman g k butterfield with the 100th woman sworn into the united states congress congresswoman alma adams to be there with the 21st national president of delta sigma theta sorority congresswoman marcia fudge we sat there next to loretta lynchs father reverend lorenzo lynch of north carolina while the judiciary committee favorably reported the nomination on a vote that was closer than it needed to be ms lynchs nomination is well deserved and historic ms lynch testified before the senate judiciary committee for nearly 8 hours and she responded to nearly 900 written questions which is unprecedented many of the written questions were from senators who had already declared their opposition to her nomination ms lynchs nomination has now been pending far longer than any recent attorney generals nomination which in my opinion is shameful she deserves to be voted our next attorney general if senators have a reason to vote against her nomination they should make their case public yes hiding behind procedural tactics does not help our nation as the senate has an opportunity to unite behind a wellqualified nominee for a critical position congress members will have an opportunity to be united this weekend when democrats and republicans will travel to alabama to march to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the selma marches fifty years ago people marched for equal voting rights out of those marches we got the voting rights act however disparities remain and the voting rights act has been eroded we can end this divide of who votes if my republican colleagues would bring up the voting rights amendment act h r 885 let me say that again we can end the divide of who can vote if my republican colleagues would bring up the voting rights amendment act h r 885 how long will it take how long must we wait to have equal rights and justice it is well past time that we deliver to all americans what they deserve like we did 50 years ago in selma we must do so again today and stand united arm in arm as my congressional black caucus colleagues and i did recently in ferguson and as we will do tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow together

congress sadly this has become the standard operating procedure in the republican house in 2011 when republicans took the majority speaker boehner promised the right to a robust debate in open process he promised many open rules instead we have just ended the most closed congress in history and if these past 6 weeks are any indication of where we are headed this leadership seems intent on breaking its own record for denying open debate on the house floor i also want to point out that the department of homeland security runs out of money february 28 16 days from now press reports indicate that the republican leadership is scrambling to gather the votes necessary to pass a bill well i have some advice for my friends in the majority instead of yelling instead of pouting and swearing bring to the floor a clean department of homeland security appropriations bill the bipartisan negotiated compromise that has been ready to go since last november this is a bill that could and should be sent to the president as quickly as possible especially considering the international and national homeland security situation facing the unitedstates and the world at this very very moment so i have to say that i am a little perplexed as to why the majority has chosen this week to bring to the floor a package of tax breaks that are not paid for that are going nowhere 5 legislative days before the department of homeland security is going to be forced to shut down because of republican dithering and i say going nowhere because senate republicans have said quite clearly that these bills will not likely be considered in committee or by the full senate let me repeat that these bills are going nowhere because of the republicans in the senate they have made it pretty clear so the clock is ticking on funding our homeland security programs are the republican leaders planning to let the clock run out planning to create another crisis we should be debating a clean department of homeland security bill right now we ought to vote in a bipartisan way to pass it have the senate do the same thing send it right to the president and actually accomplish something i am also concerned with the partisan approach taken by the republicans on the ways and means committee in advancing these particular tax measures we went through this same exercise last year with a similar set of bills only to pass in the final weeks of the 113th congress a 1year comprehensive tax extenders package the republican leadership in the house is setting the stage for a similar confrontation this year instead of working in a productive and bipartisan manner on comprehensive tax reform that is something that the american people democrats and republicans all want they want us to be working on it and they want us to pass a bipartisan comprehensive tax reform bill the seven tax provisions before us today packaged into two bills will add more than 93 billion to the deficit there was a time when my republican friends actually cared about the deficit i guess those days are gone while i support the goals of many of the provisions contained in these bills i cannot vote for legislation that targets only a handful of tax provisions chooses to elevate them and make them permanent at the expense of other tax priorities and then refuses to pay for themabsolutely refuses to pay for them this republican package does nothing absolutely nothing to address key priorities like the work opportunity tax credit and the new markets tax credit it fails to address the longterm status of the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit that work to reduce poverty if these tax provisions are allowed to expire in 2017 as currently scheduled many working poor families would lose their child tax credit and many lowincome married couples and larger families would see a cut in their eitc the center on budget and policy priorities estimates that if the eitc and the ctc provisions were to expire more than 16 million people in lowincome working families including 8 million children would fall intoor deeper intopoverty the piecemeal deficitspending approach taken by this majority puts these working family tax provisions at risk i was pleased to see members of the republican leadership at d c central kitchen the other day talking about hunger d c central kitchen does incredible work to feed the hungry and help people get back on their feet but count me as a little skeptical because time after time after time after time republicans have targeted poor people and the programs that help them if my friends on the other side of the aisle are serious about ending hunger they need to do much more than encourage donations to food banks first and foremost they should stop targeting snap the nations premier antihunger program they should stop treating snap as an atm machine for other programs instead they should work with us to increase the minimum wage or at least give us a vote on increasing the minimum wage they should work with us to expand job training programs and make child care more affordable they should work with us to fix the major flaw in our social safety net namely that when someone gets a job that doesnt pay very much they tend to lose all their benefits and end up struggling once again to put food on the table find day care for their kids keep their house warm and pay the rent we need desperately to have a serious and thoughtful discussion about the longterm sustainability of our safety net programs the fighting hunger incentive act makes permanent the enhanced deduction for contributions of food inventory i strongly support our food banks and charitable organizations that work each and every day to feed the hungry in this country i support efforts that provide incentives to donate food to these organizations but one tax break does not constitute a plan to address hunger and it certainly does not make up for the cuts to snap and other safety net programs that have been proposed and enacted by this republican majority so in closing again i would urge my colleagues to pay attention to todays national journal daily the headline so far a congress about nothing that is what this congress is becoming known as a congress about nothing well work with us in a bipartisan way to change this headline and you could do that by allowing a clean department of homeland security appropriations bill to come before us we can pass it in a bipartisan way and we can meet the national security needs of our country and actually do something before we go home on another break with that i urge my colleagues to reject this rule and the underlying legislation i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.0006398558616638184, 0.9993601441383362, 1, "first let me thank you congresswoman kelly and congress man payne for hosting this special order your leadership is so important for these critical discussions we are trying in many ways under your leadership to really tell the truth and let the entire country know exactly what the economic status is what the job opportunities and educational opportunities are in the african american community and how those disparities continue to grow and really how we need to really do everything we can here to begin to close those gaps and disparities so thank you very much once again we stand here tonight to discuss economic opportunityof course i have to say the lack of opportunity in the black community in recent months we have seen communities across this countryincluding baltimore and my hometown of oakland california in my congressional districtdemand an end to the systemic and institutional racial biases that plague our society people especially young people are calling for an end to centuries of oppression they are fighting for equality of opportunity the opportunity for every american to live the american dream too many places in our nation are tales of two cities one city is bright shiny and new it is home to new condominiums and fancy restaurants the other city is left with boarded up stores abandoned homes and too many people without a job and without hope i know congresswoman kelly congressman payne congressman jeffries myself all of us represent these cities these two cities within one context one environment one framework one boundary we all know that the inequality of opportunity really is not a new phenomenon we have lived with these structural injustices for centuries but it wasnt until the race riots erupted in watts chicago and detroit in 1968 that our government began to take some notice after the riots president johnson convened the kerner commission to investigate the root causes of the unrest the kerner report clearly showed a nation moving towards two societies one black one whiteseparate and unequal while the kerner report identified the problem our nation failed to truly address it there still is not liberty and justice for all the kerner report also called for better training for police new investments in jobs and in housing and the end of de facto segregation now this report really could have been written last month sadly nearly 50 years later we still live in a country where the color of your skin and the zip code in which you were born determines your future but i am proud to be working with members of the congressional black caucus to continue to address these persistent inequalities in our nation by working on policies and programs to create economic growth educational opportunities and job opportunities for example we know that black children are disadvantaged from day one more than one in three black children are born in poverty that is one in three in the worlds richest and most powerful nation a third of all african american children are forced to grow up with the harsh reality of poverty day in and day out this is outrageous it is unacceptable the cycle of poverty continues in the school systems that institutionalize this discrimination while black students represent just 18 percent of preschool enrollment they account for 42 percent of preschool student expulsions can you believe that preschool student expulsionsthat is really a disgrace we are talking about kids ages 2 to 5 years old these kids dont even get a start let alone a head start what in the world are children that young doing being expelled from preschool then in high school the graduation rate for black students is 16 points lower than the rate for their white peers black students are far less likely than their white counterparts to obtain a 4year college degree and the crisis and inequality extends from education to the economy itself over the past four decades the unemployment rate for blacks has remained nearly double the rate for whites today the unemployment rate in the black community stands at 10 1 percent that is reported now to put that into context the current african american unemployment rate is higher than the national average was at the height of the great recession in addition to higher unemployment rates african americans are also nearly completely locked out of some key economic sectors especially the tech sector only 1 in 14 technical workers in silicon valley is african american or latino that is 1 in 14 that is why the cbc has launched the tech 2020 initiative to work with the tech sector to increase workforce diversity and investments in stem education and to expand market opportunities for businesses to ensure that the jobs of today and tomorrow are open to all for african americans in the workforce our nations inequalities are also evident in their paychecks congressman payne just laid out the statistics for women while women earn 77 cents on the dollar that a man earns it is just 64 cents for african american women the median income for blacks is a mere 34 000 that is nearly 24 000 less than the median income for whites most black families hold their wealth in home equity so the great recession hit the black community particularly hard too many families lost everything and many more black families are struggling as home prices fail to keep pace with the stock market of course the net worth now of african american families is now 6 cents to the dollar for white families the time for action is now these communities our communities cannot wait any longer we must come together like never before to address the inequalities in our nation that leave black families behind in my role as cochair of the cbcs task force on poverty and the economy and chair of the democratic whips task force on poverty income inequality and opportunity we are working very hard to give black families a fair shot we are talking about all families not leaving any family behind i am proud to be working with more than 100 of my colleagues to advance policies that build pathways out of poverty into the middle class for everyone for all americans yes black lives like all lives do count we have introduced the half in ten act to develop a national strategy to cut poverty in half in the next decade this bill would lift more than 22 million americans out of poverty into the middle class in just the next 10 years by doubling down and coordinating proven antipoverty programs the congressional black caucus also took a stand on poverty in its alternative budget proposal we called for robust investments in education infrastructure and affordable housing programs that would ensure opportunities for all we must keep up this fight until congress makes these long overdue investments we need to strengthen the social safety net and invest in proven antipoverty programs such as the earned income tax credit and the supplemental nutritional assistance program these were initiatives begun 50 years ago under president lyndon johnsons great society program and they are working we also need to raise the minimum wage and fight for a living wage that is why we are cosponsors and we are very proud to be cosponsors of h r 122 the original living wage act sponsored by congressman al green which starts by raising the minimum wage for federal workers and building up to a living wage and congressman bobby scotts raise the wage act h r 2150 would increase the minimum wage to 12 by 2020 thirtyfive million americans would benefit from this also we wrote a letter signed by 72 colleagues urging the president to adopt a fair chance hiring policy at the federal level for individuals who have been previously incarcerated a fair chance hiring policy would level the playing field and help stop the cycle of recidivism that is plaguing our communities this is simply the right thing to do the federal government should not put up barriers to work for those trying to rebuild their lives after making a mistake and having paid their dues to society finally i am saying tonight and i think all of us are saying that we need to give families the opportunity to build wealth and live the american dream we can end poverty not just in the african american community but in the entire united states as a whole so we have got to keep calling for action as dr king said in his two americas speech that he gave on april 14 1968 at stanford university 1968 he said we must come to see that social progress never rolls in on the wheels of inevitability it comes through the tireless efforts and persistent work of dedicated individuals we must be those dedicated individuals working for the social progress that is so desperately needed when you look at the analysis of the economy job opportunities and educational opportunities in the african american community we must win this fight because the gaps and the disparities are too great only then will america be strong because we have to remember that we are a country where everyone is equal under the law in fact when you have communities with such horrible statistics as we are laying out tonight such horrible economic and educational gaps our country is not as strong as it could be and so we are saying that we want liberty and justice for

that speaks to criminal justice system reform not to voting rights i think we can reach consensus on the criminal justice reform i think both parties believe that there are substantial areas that need to be addressed in criminal justice reform senator cornyn has certainly indicated that republicans and democrats in this house have indicated that my question to you is with respect to the issues that i think we have all discussed and that the speaker has discussed such as jobs and economic growth health care poverty and opportunity which we believe is a very important issue criminal justice reform

your side has indicated that mental health is very much a component of that and you want to address that and addressing our national security challenges which i agree with the speaker that is a

retired and this means veterans are often forced to spend their own money to transport them back to the united states for adoption that is why i have introduced bipartisan legislation with my

they had worked hard for this day we know from the nonpartisan director of the congressional budget office that apparently what our republican colleagues worked so hard to do was to take affordable health care away from 22 million americans at the same time we have heard all sorts of misinformation and distortions on this floor about planned parenthood which is an organization that provides women and their families with health care that provides cancer screenings and that provides family planning on national television when asked whether there was any evidence that planned parenthood had broken any law even republican chairman chaffetz of the committee on oversight and government reform who investigated planned parenthood said no im not suggesting that they broke the law in fact that was the finding of other committees here yet our republican colleagues have now set up a witch hunt special committee to go after planned parenthood ironically they claim to be doing an investigation but here on the floor they have obviously already reached a conclusion and have decided to defund an organization that helps provide health care to american women and families so rolled into one bill you have something that would deny access to health care to 22 million americans and at the same time deny important health services to millions of american women and their families when our republican colleagues pose this question and say that the president is going to be faced with a tough choice i can assure them it is not a tough choice for the president because it is not a tough choice when it comes to whether or not we take affordable health care away from 22 million americans that should be an easy choice for all of us we are not going to do it it also shouldnt be a tough choice as to whether or not we defund planned parenthood and the services they provide to american women and families that is not going to be a tough choice for the president the republican leader was absolutely right when he talked about the consequences of the 2016 elections because we are fortunate that today we have a president who will not sign that bill but who will instead veto that bill our colleagues are absolutely right if you had a different president including as far as i know all of them on the republican side they would be signing this bill so this is an important statement of what our republican colleagues think is the top priority on the first day of 2016 which is to get rid of affordable health care for 22 million americans lets talk about that with the american public

speaker race you made two representations about immigration that stood out they are 1 it is unwise or unproductive to bring up any immigration legislation so long as barack obama is president 2 as speaker you will not allow any immigration bill to reach the house floor for a vote unless the immigration bill is supported by a majority of the majority of republican house members although you talk faster than i can write your words down i believe the above statements properly reflect what you said i send this letter to confirm that i accurately portray your remarks and that i may rely on them when the house floor vote for speaker occurs next week if my portrayal of your words errs in any respect please deliver to me before the gop conference meeting next week in which we are to conduct speaker elections a written communication correcting my errors if i do not receive such a communication from you then i will infer that you concur that my portrayal of your remarks is accurate and that i and the rest of the gop conference and the american people may rely on your words as i have written them i need your assurance that you will not use the speakers position to advance your
