just for each of us individually but for our nation and way of lifeit is imperative that we begin our discussionat the beginning and that beginning wasnt on 911 weve been under attack for at least 30 years we did not want this fightwe did not invite this fightwe did not wish to engage in this battle however once our enemy crossed over the line confirmed for us and the worldthat they were unwilling to respect international law respect individual liberty respect sovereignty of nationsand that they were willing and desirous of engaging in mortal battleno other option was left to us or the civilized world abu musab alzarqawi on january 23 2005 said we have declared a fierce war on this evil principle of democracy and those who follow this wrong ideology so this discussion today comes down to a fundamental questionwhat is the appropriate strategy and tactic to adopt to win the war on terror will we withdraw and simply defenda policy of isolation and containment or will we aggressively combat terrorismand take the battle to our enemy this war is unlike any other in historywithout a doubt our enemy has no single home it recruits and trains its army from nations around the world the only unifying element is hatehate for the westhate for democracyhate for freedom of religionhate for liberty the only message our enemy understands is force period terrorists dont negotiateterrorists dont compromiseterrorists are not interested in peace to them thats weakness thankfully weve stayed the course thankfully weve persevered in both iraq and afghanistan the greatest threat to terrorism is freedom liberty and democracy in the middle east and beyond today the terrorists are truly on the run last week unitedstates and iraqi forces eliminated a qaeda in iraqs top terroristabu musab al zarqawi this was accomplished with excellent intelligenceknowing where the bad guys were and when and this information came from iraqi civiliansthat is a very positive sign this important step demonstrates many things we will hunt down terrorists and eliminate them wherever they are hiding the shackles of decades long terrorism are being removed from the middle east iraqi security forces are stepping up to the challenge iraqi citizens want to be free of terrorists and they are not going to sit idly by success breeds success never has that been more evident than this past week while zarqawi was eliminatedfinding him brought a treasure trove of information allowing unitedstates and iraqi forces to dismantle many more pieces of al qaedas puzzle success breeds success iraq just this past week selected 3 more officialscabinet ministersto serve in its standing government success breeds success it is also important for us to recall and reiterate why we are engaged in this war it is imperative during this debate that we reexamine the conditions that required the united states to take military action in afghan istan and iraq in the aftermath of the

consequence was 911 the attacks we witnessed that day serve as a reminder of the dangers we face as a nation in a post9 11 world we can no longer expect oceans between us and our enemies to keep us safe policy of containment has been proven to be a dismal failure just as the battle in afghanistan was not simply to remove the taliban the battle in iraq was not simply to remove saddam hussein and his murderous regime one has to look no further than the action of our enemy to see that we are fighting those who want to bring their brand of terror and fear to our shores we must not forget those threats that have been disrupted here at home and on our allies the west coast airliner plot the heathrow airport plot and the jose padilla plot the campaign against the united states and its allies

unitedstates customs service that were created by an act of congress in 1972 to patrol the unitedstates mexican land border within the tohono oodham indian nation in southern arizona if you kind of visualize the southwest border california arizona new mexico and texas and then think of phoenix and tucson coming straight down nogales and then go towards california going west that area would be the tohono oodham reservation it is an artificially definedborder with mexico there because in fact the tohono oodham are on both sides of that and congressman hayworth here in congress has a bill to try to address how they can move inside their reservation particularly as we tighten our border but it is a different challenge because quite frankly they were there before mexico and the united states were there so it is a different type of a challenge on the southwest border as to how we are going to provide security from terrorism security from narcotics from other types of items moving through as well as illegal immigration now many people dont necessarily know tohono oodham as a name right off the bat it is the papago indian tribe is what we historically called them both in the north up more towards phoenix and down in the southwest but the tohono oodham view themselves as that name and now the federal government has recognized them by that it is a relatively recent change just like on our north border up by where the mohawk reservation was now they are called the akwesasne indian reservation but we have a similar challenge on that side of the border now the reason the shadow wolves were created is when you have a separate nation inside your nation one of the hardest things for our drug agents for our historic ins agents and others to penetrate is inside an indian nation they are very closed societies they know who is going to be where inside that nation it is not easy to penetrate and here we had one of the most successful tracking organizations the shadow wolves have been featured in people magazine on television all sorts of newspapers around the country for years because they combine modern technology with ancient tracking techniques combined with being members inside that nation to provide law and order inside that nation they arrested and pursued and identified narcotics smugglers along their 76 miles of border and 2 8 million acres and they would seize roughly i4928 100 000 pounds of illegal narcotics every year but when we created the department of homeland security we did something very unwise we decided by splitting the cbp the customs and border protection from the ice agents we left several agencies in the lurch one is the air and marine division that didnt either picket fence on the border or do investigations inside so we are trying to work that out which has been easier to do over in the water border on the gulf of mexico in the caribbean sea but has been much tougher on the mexican land border with the united states but the other is what do you do with a group like the shadow wolves they dont fit in an ice box they have a border which is where we try to protect the border but they also do investigations inside andthe department of homeland security in trying to figure out how to deal with things that dont quite fit square pegs in a round hole jammed them in under cbp and that meant several things one is the shadow wolves a distinct entity disappeared because they scattered them along with cbp agents all over the country because it did not fit the organization structure to say oh this is a unique thing on the southwest border lets create a unique thing so now inside the tohono oodham reservation we have cbp agents that do not belong to that nation we have ice agents that are not part of that nation and we have got tohono oodham native americans scattered all over the united states it makes no sense needless to say it is not working that great as we look at nogales and the traffic pouring through in arizona and as it moves over to douglas as we build more fences as we put more agents on the border guess what happens they move over to the open areas the barry goldwater air force range tohono oodham indian reservation and the fish and wildlife area to the western part of arizona they are overrun now just in one hearing we had several years ago during the time of the hearing they had had 1 500 pounds of drugs moved through in the previous 3 months then 1 500 pounds the previous month during our hearing with all of the different agents around they snared something like 1 800 pounds five different carloads another group with seven suvs going through they put a blackhawk on them this has become a nomans zone you cannot break organizations if you do not have investigations within rather than breaking up the shadow wolves we should have been doing a similar thing up in new york state we need to be looking at similar things in montana where the black feet are not quite on the reservation but how to work with the tribal groups to create tracking organizations that can do both border and investigations now this bill is an imperfect solution it puts them over in ice they basically need to do both things but since the government continues to stick with they have got to be either a or b better be b than a because making them scattered along like a picket fence and working with cbp wherever they assign them makes no sense we need them back together we need them as a tracking unit more like a historic customs ice organization what this bill does is transfers them in fact back to ice it moves their pay scale to be like ice special agents it grants the chief officer of the shadow wolves a rank equivalent to the resident agent in charge of the ice investigations and authorizes similar units in areas sach in the akwesasne reservation in upstate new york that is the basic thrust of the bill we know we need to work with the appropriations committee we addressed this in the homeland security appropriations bill but we just moved the dollars over in fact we will have to work out some kind of transition because ice agents make more than cbp these people were trained trackers then all of a sudden we put them back on the border it makes no sense and we in congress who created this need to make sure that we stand behind this great ide before all of them retire many already took early retirement or quit because they saw no commitment to ke6ping them together as a native american organization i rise in strong support of h r 5589 which directs the secretary of homeland security to transfer to united states immigration and customs enforcement all functions of the customs patrol officers unit operating on the tohono oodham indian reservation this legislation responds to an urgent national priority regaining control of our borders and stopping the crossborder smuggling of people narcotics and other contraband id like to thank majority leader boehner mr shadegg and mr king of iowa for their leadership in bringing this joint legislation to the floor the shadow wolves are one of the last remaining customs patrol officer cpo units in the country created by congress in 1972 the shadow wolves operate on the tohono oodham indian reservation in southern arizona which has 76 miles of the unitedstates mexican border running through it that reservation has historically been a major conduit for drug smuggling and the shadow wolvesall of them native americans who combine modem technology with traditional indian tracking techniquesare responsible for stopping the smuggling of drugs illegal aliens and other contraband between the ports of entry within the 2 8 million acres of the tohono oodham nation just since january of this year the shadow wolves have interdicted over 15 000 pounds of illegal drugs that otherwise would have been sold on the streets the shadow wolves have also assisted numerous federal law enforcement agencies with enforcement issues on the reservation despite being one of our most successful antismuggling investigative units however the shadow wolves are about to disappear altogether after the formation of the department of homeland security the shadow wolves were taken out of their historic location at the customs office of investigations and arbitrarily assigned to the tucson sector of the border patrol this arrangement has been unworkable because the mission and tactics of the shadow wolves who are more like investigators than patrolmen simply do not fit the organizational model of the border patrol the shadow wolves have already lost nearly a quarter of their personnel due to attrition and to date there have been no qualified replacements h r 5589 fixes this problem by transferring the shadow wolves back to the office of investigations now located within ice once again the shadow wolves will be able to do what they do best find follow and bust major drug and alien smuggling rings in cooperation with their fellow immigration and customs investigators i urge my colleagues to support h r 5589 and help the nation take yet another major step in regaining control of our borders i

positions that our party holds on so many issues that are important to the american people i am going to be heading to my district for the weekend as most members are spending some time there having the opportunity to talk with them but as the gentleman from georgia was saying we wanted the opportunity to just address and maybe do a little bit of correcting on some of the points that our colleagues from across the aisle have been saying and stating sometimes i think that they are just sadly misinformed on some of these issues they saidthat republicans are not looking to cut spending i just find that extraordinary they said that democrats are the ones that are wanting to cut spending the level of hypocrisy in that statement is absolutely astounding we have a democratic party in this house whose message and i honestly believe many days is the only message that they have that message is spend more whatever it is spend more whatever they are wanting to do if they do not think the outcome is right go spend more and for years they have held this thought that if you just put more money in the pot then the outcome is going to be what they want spend more spend more and what holds them together i think that is something that is a curiosity to many people because they are not united on foreign policy they are not united on winning in iraq they are not united on border control issues they are not united behind working families who tell us repeatedly that what they want is lower taxes lighter regulation preserving individual freedom and having their shot at hope and opportunity our colleagues across the aisle are not united on that the one thing that they repeatedly seem to be united on is spending more of the taxpayers money spending more of your hardearned money and it is amazing to me government never gets enough of the taxpayer money government has this huge voracious appetite for the taxpayers money they just cannot get enough of it there is always another program many of them are great programs but one of the truths that we all see here in this body if government moves in to solve a problem generally neither the private nor notforprofit sector will move in and address that problem 1415 so you have additional costs that come about every time we talk about winning in iraq our friends across the aisle seem to say let us get out regardless of the sacrifices that are made every time we talk about controlling the border they are over there saying no way yesterday i was on a cnbc program and a democrat member of the house said that their party had never been invited to offer spending cuts there are 435 members of this body and they are waiting for an invitation to come in and participate in how to reduce the size of government this morning i was on the floor and i said please consider this the invitation come on everybody needs to work on this it should be a bipartisan effort it should involve every single member of this house how we go about reducing what the federal government spends i have three bills that would enact acrosstheboard cuts 1 percent 2 percent and 5 percent cuts and for all of their talk today about how they want to cut spending not one single democrat is on those bills not one we have got 14 republicans who are on those bills and not one democrat has signed on to commit to finding 1 2 or 5 percent of waste fraud and abuse in government spending i ask my colleagues who is really leading on this issue i hear plenty of accusations from the left i hear plenty of complaining and i see zero action a lot of talk no action they controlled this body for 40 years and in that 40 years they built layer after layer after layer after layer of government they cooked them a big old government cake layer upon layer we have got programs out there that do nothing but waste our money we have got 342 different economic development programs there is a lot of work that we can do everyone is invited to come in and work on these issues and anytime we even try to restrain spending look at the rhetoric that we hear it is our party in this house it is our leader the gentleman from illinois speaker hastert who truly is leading on this issue not the minority leader it is our leaders who are pushing this it is our party who would like to reduce government spending by billions of ddllars billions more in next years budget it is our party that would like to see acrosstheboard spending reductions their solution that they offer is repealingtax relief that is well deserved by hardworking american families

myself such time as i may consume during consideration of this resolution all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only today we are considering a very important reform that is a bipartisan reform it is bipartisan because it is an issue that i am happy to say as we have moved down the road towards reform has enjoyed strong bipartisan support in fact it was a key provision in the housepassed lobbying accountability and transparency act which did enjoy bipartisan support not as strong as i would have liked but it did enjoy bipartisan support specifically with this new rule memberdirected spending to projects in their district or earmarks will no longer be anonymous it is very simple we all know as it stands now there are no disclosure requirements in appropriations tax bills or authorizing legislation earmarks can be buried in the text of bills that often number into the thousands of pages there is no easy way to account for how many earmarks are in a bill or who is sponsoring them this new rule requires sponsors of earmarks to be listed in committee reports conference reports must also have a list of earmarks that are airdropped or brought into an agreement in the conference report itself it is just that simple we are blowing away the fog of anonymity so the public can have a clear picture of what the projects are how much they cost and who is sponsoring them it is just a very simple case of transparency this is a victory for fiscal responsibility and a victory for spending taxpayer dollars more wisely as an enforcement mechanism this new rule also provides for a question of consideration when a bill or conference report does not contain a list of earmarks the question of consideration is debatable for 30 minutes 15 minutes equally divided if a member feels strongly enough about a proposed earmark they will have to attach their name to it that is all we are asking and they need to be prepared to make their case in full view of their colleagues their constituents and the american people as a whole the earmark reform bill will build on the reforms that have already been implemented by the appropriations committee and i take my hat off to the appropriations committee for the very bold and dynamic reforms that they have made they have reduced the number of earmarks already by 37 percent overall spending on member projects was reduced by 7 8 billion below last years level over the last 2 years member project spending has decreased by over 10 million and i want to especially express my appreciation to my very dear friend jerry lewis who has so ably chaired the appropriations committee and has stepped up to the plate and taken on this issue of reform and done it with great success because of the fact that he has been able to rein in federal spending it doesnt get a lot of attention but he has been very successful in doing that i also want to make very clear that our focus is not solely on appropriations this was one of the requests that chairman lewis made of us as we were proceeding with this work for this reform to be effective itmust be comprehensive and that was the commitment that the speaker of the house and our leadership team made to our members so let me point out that this earmark reform applies across the board it doesnt just apply to some committees it covers kll committees allappropriations all tax all authorizing legislation anything that moves through this house through regular order we have taken great care to clearly and precisely state what constitutes a tax an appropriation or an authorizing earmark and the good news is that there is more agreement than disagreement on those definitions yet clearly there is no magic bullet there is not going to be one definition that will be perfect and please everybody but at the end of the day we have to come together we have to come together and move this process forward if there is an earmark in a bill it belongs on a list it is just that simple if there is an earmark we need to see it now is this new disclosure going to completely end the practice of earmarking i certainly hope not i dont want it to because i believe that earmarking is part of our constitutional responsibility but it will shine a spotlight on earmarks without grinding the legislative process to a halt let me make very clear that the larger goal of this new rule is to make a profound and lasting change in how this institution handles earmarks and spends taxpayer dollars the goal is to increase transparency disclosure and accountability and the goal is to pull back the curtain on earmarks for the public because i believe that they have a right to know for this earmark reform to be both meaningful and lasting everyone from committee chairmen on down must make a goodfaith effort to comply with the spirit of the new rule our leadership and certainly the rules committee has made such a commitment and we are determined to make this work i would also like to point out that while this is an important milestone in the path toward reform we have not reached the gohl line in fact i dont believe that we will ever reach the absolute goal line because reform is a continuous process it gains momentum from members who never let up and never settle for the status quo i urge my colleagues to vote yes for reforming earmarks and yes to setting the stage for more reforms that we will face down the road i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.0024039538111537695, 0.0024039538111537695, 0, "i thank the gentleman for

on this important issue while most of the illegal immigrants who enter the united states do so for the purposes of finding work and making a better life there are also those that may take advantage of our porous borders to enter the country and take part in terrorist activities in fact recent reports have projected that as many as 4 000 immigrants from countries identified as high risk will be arrested trying to enter the country illegally this year as we speak terrorists are using alien smugglers and document forgers to help move people through iran and pakistan and it is only a matter of time until terrorist organizations attempt to use these techniques to enter the united states in 2004 the border patrol estimated that over 55 000 illegal immigrants from countries other than mexico crossed our borders during a 10month period of the illegal aliens from countries identified by the secretary of state as sponsors of terrorism who have been ordered deported only about 6 percent have actually been removed and these are only the ones we know about this legislation takes steps to enhance our border security procedures and improve our ability to identify and remove potential

seen ovier there on different occasions when the temperature cooled off down to 106 i have seen the marines go out at three oclock in the afternoon and play basketball in 106 temperature because it has cooled off i got an email from a lieutenant colonel that we met over there at camp arifjan lieutenant colonel gary ace and he happens to be an individual that helped set up a trip a year ago last 4th of july for my staff and their families to take a bus and go up to gettysburg for the 4th of july with the army historian to travel throughout all gettysburg and review that on the historical day with the army historian lieutenant colonel gary ace who was deployed to the middle east and met us there at camp arifjan at really our first stop it was quite ironic he sent me an email a couple of days ago that said it has cooled off down to about 110 or 112 and it seems ironic to say so but it is a relief from the heat i would just like to go through a number of the things that i reflected upon as i listened to the gentleman from pennsylvania and the gentleman from texas speak on this issue and refer back to a colloquy if i might 9t4 igress0nai recor m hot ydu u iaiiht nmiber o4 things to mind tiit i wooi ifke to einbebllish a little bit one of them has to do with the heat andthe water and the gentleman from pennsylvanias remarks in particular when he said bonedry ditches certainly they are there and the fighting positions that have been dug for the tanks and armor we see that from the air especially in the north around the kirkuk region where we were yet in the south there are irrigation ditches down there that have been hand dug and have been maintained for centuries the water stands near the top of the ditch because it is the water that comes down the tigress and euphrates and it fans out in that delta it is not sand it is soil it should be productive soil and i looked at that from the air i do not know how many times we finally got down on the ground and got a chance to look and i could never understand why you could not see anything growing next to those ditches full of water in the summertime from the air nothing green to be seen from the air that is because nothing grows there in those particular regions so my old farm boys unlocked the key to that inadvertently when they stuck a thermometer in the soil we plant corn in the spring in iowa after the frost goes out and soil temperature gets up to 54 degrees the soil temperature there about that far down in the soil was 154 degrees and i am sure the broccoli i had a couple of days ago had not reached that temperature when they served it to me in the restaurant so that is some sense of what kind of heat there is that relentless sun and how that builds up in the soil it would sterilize most sees so they have to have a different kind of agriculture than i am used to but maybe inlaredo they could figure that out the americaniraqi chamber of commerce and the gentleman from pennsylvania referenced that and i think both of my colleagues did it was an interesting surprise to me it never occurred to me that there was a chamber of commerce in iraq and yet to find out that the americans that were there teamed up with the iraqis that are there and they are seeking to build a free enterprise retail organiza tion that can help develop the kind of commerce that they need to grow that city and grow every city inthat country to walk in there and have them ask well we would like to have you give a speech to the baghdad chkmber of commerce now there is an ironic twist of fate in this life that this fellow from the cornfield never anticipated i looked around and went well where is my interpreter i guess i will be willing to do that they said you do not need an interpreter sir they speak english here in baghdad so they set the microphone up and gave an introduction and we all came and sat at the table and my colleagues actually ss eptember 21 2005 mixedaround with them at their tables and gathered together afterwards i gave a little speech there in english i could tell they understood me they responded smiled and laughed and clapped and frowned all at the right times it occurred to me that if they could pull that off in baghdad we can pull that off in the united states of america that english speech to the chamber of commerce in many of our major cities but just a little bit of lifes irony there they were open they were welcome and curious when that was over all of us had a cluster of iraqi chamber of commerce members around us with their business cards they want to do business and trade cards and do commerce and they are eager in fact we were in the al rasheed hotel that was in the green zone but that is the hotel that deputy security wolfowitz was in when it was rocketed a year or more or so ago that is one of those little ironies the other one that the gentleman from texas mentioned the odd request and i was very curious about the judicial branch of the iraqi government i had i will say a friend and colleague from iowa the unitedstates attorney charles larson senior who served over there for more than a year and i believe it was 15 to 16 months trying to get the iraqi judicial branch up to speed and trying to teach them what we know from our rule of law in the united states he served over there intently and in a verydedicated way along with his son major chuck larson junior who served as a army reservist in the same area i have seen pictures of them together and chuck larson senior the unitedstates attorney brought me back an iraqi flag that flew over baghdad the day of their first election they had when we saw those fingers dipped in purple these gentlemen convinced me that we should take a look at the judi cial branch of government in iraq that is what precipitated the request we wanted to go over to the courtroom i wanted to sit in the courtroom where saddam would be tried for his crimes i sat in two of his thrones and that was kind of good kind of fitting but i really wanted to go sit in the chair where he was going to be really sit in the witness chair where people would testify against him because of security reasons we could not go out of the zone across the street and into that building so they brought the three judges to us we sat down and talked with them and these people they risk their lives they are dedicated to the rule of law they want the politicians out of that decisionmaking process they do not want them leveraging the rule of law decision i am going to shift into my interpretation of what i

what you need is a 12step program on spending it is called intestinal fortitude it is called having a spine it is called having some guts to do what is necessary but the first thing you did was get rid of the discipline and payasyougo so now you are stuck but more importantly the nation is stuck and so we see this little plea on the morning that we are going to give away almost 1 trillion to the richest people in the nation you have a plea here that maybe the president will stop the bridge to nowhere how about congress stopping the bridge to nowhere how about doing what you were elected to do you dont need a line item veto this isnt about statutes this isnt about vetoes this is about what the congress is to do you walked in here fresh newly elected and you got handed 5 trillion and now you cant stop yourself you cant stop yourself you can stop yourself from giving the people an increase in the minimum wage that hasnt increased since 1997 you cant give those people 70 cents more an hour but you give it away to the richest estates and then you can plead that but for the line item veto we would somehow get to a balanced budget every dollar you are going to spend today tomorrow and every dollar you spent yesterday and the day before came out of the social security trust fund i am sure that america while you are putting away a rainy day fund on borrowed money i am sure america is delighted that you are putting away the estate tax on their social security earnings on their trust fund you are taking their trust fund that belongs to all americans called the social security trust fund and you are raiding it for the trust fund of the heirs of the richest estates in america what a wonderful example today what a wonderful example for young people to learn about our obligations to future generations this is a theater of the absurd you have run the country into the ditch financially you got a 1 trillion war going that you cant figure out how to stop you have stolen most of the money from social security trust fund every year we have a deficit we have a 8 trillion debt and you want to talk about the line item veto you know the government is spending money like a drunken sailor andronald reagan said well at least the sailor was spending his own money you are spending the publics money at a rapid illegal unconscionable immoral rate and you ought to stop but the line item veto wont do it lots of things have changed since 1997 but the value of the minimum wage isnt one of them because of congress failure to act on behalf of the lowest paid workers in america the minimum wage is still just 5 15 per hour 5 15 per hour think about that at 5 15 per hour you would have to work 11 day just to fill a tank of gas at todays gas prices at 5 15 per hour you would have to work for at least 30 minutes just to afford a single gallon of milk democrats have a simple and reasonable proposal we want to raise the minimum wage to 7 25 per hour over the next two years doing so would directly benefit 6 6 million american workers the vast majority of those workers are adults hundreds of thousands of them are parents with children under the age of 18 we have all heard the wellworn economic arguments against raising the minimum wage and we all know they simply arent true the truth is that raising the minimum wage wont hurt the economy and can even help it but forget about economics thats not what this issue is about this issue is about doing whats right and it is just wrong that in the wealthiest and most advanced country in the history of the world millions of adults work fulltime all year and yet still earn an income that leaves them deep in poverty it is just wrong for the republican leaders of this congress to refuse to allow even a vote on raising the minimum wage but what makes all of this far worse is that today once again as it has done so many times during the past several years the leaders of this house are going to push tax breaks for the wealthiest people in this country you know starting in 2009 only the largest and wealthiest 7 500 estates nationwide will pay the estate tax the republican plan to gut the tax on these 7 500 estates will add three quarters of a trillion dollars to the federal budget deficit over the next decade thats trillion with a t lee raymond the former ceo of exxon mobil stands to save as much as 160 million if this estate tax repeal goes through this is the same lee raymond who left his job with a 400 million retirement package why is the republican leadership so worred about people like lee raymond why is the republican leadership constantly looking for new ways to help the absolute richest people in the country when is the leadership of this house going to do something for the lowestpaid families in america if you are born with a silver spoon in your mouth and you stand to inherit millions or even billions of dollars that you did not work to earn then this congress wants to serve you but if you get up every day and go to work to earn a living then dont expect any help from this congress the message all of this sends could not be clearer the republicans value wealth not work if you hold up your end of the bargain and contribute to your community and our econ omy by working hard every day then you should not have to live in poverty it is well past time for this congress to treat
