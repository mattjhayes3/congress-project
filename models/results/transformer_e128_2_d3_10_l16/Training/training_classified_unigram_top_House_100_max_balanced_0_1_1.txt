amendment the provided amount will be available to the committee on the judiciary only for investigations and studies respecting judicial impeachment the provided amount should not be used for other purposes on march 29 1988 the subcommittee on accounts held a meeting on this resolution and reviewed in detail the justification provided by chairman rodino the resolution as submitted by chairman rodino would have authorized additional funds for investigations and studies with respect to judicial impeachment in the amount of 461 320 the pending amendment reduces the requested amount by 86 320 the subcommittees determination is both reasonable and fair under the best of circumstances it might have been possible to approve the total amount requested by the distinguished chairman of the judiciary committee however the subcommittee must determine authorization from very limited available fiscal resources the subcommittee respects chairman rodinos request and it recognizes his difficult responsibilities regarding the two serious judicial impeachment investigations presently before his committee after a very thorough review of the total budget for both judicial impeachment investigations the additional amount of 375 000 as contained in the pending amemdment when added to the 350 000 already authorized by section 5 of house resolution 388 for investigations and studies relating to judicial impeachment should be sufficient to allow that committee to discharge all of its judicial impeachment responsibilities in an effective and satisfactory manner in particular the additional amount should enable the judiciary committee to hire temporary staff and to meet necessary travel witness telephone supply and equipment expenses arising out of a new impeachment investigation involving judge walter l nixon jr unitedstates district court judge for the southern district of mississippi when the subcommittee on accounts held its markup of the omnibus primary expense resolution the nixon impeachment matter was not before the judiciary committee subsequent to the markup on march 15 1988 the judicial conference of the united states certified to the speaker of the house that judge nixon had engaged in conduct which might constitute one or more grounds for impeachment under article i of the constitution on march 16 1988 the speaker referred the certification to the committee on the judiciary where it has referred to the subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights on march 17 1988 chairman rodino introduced house resolution 407 calling for the impeachment of judge nixon congressmen edwards fish and sensenbrenner cosponsored the resolution regarding the urgency of this investigation on february 9 1986 after a jury trial judge nixon was found not guilty on one count of perjury and one count of accepting an illegal gratuity in violation of 18 unitedstatesc 201 g but he was found guilty on two counts of perjury accordingly judge nixon was sentenced to 5 years in prison on each count with the sentences running concurrently judge nixon appealed this to the unitedstates court of appeals for the fifth circuit and that appellate court affirmed the trial courts judgment on april 30 1987 judge nixon attempted to further appeal his case to the unitedstates supreme court however his petition for a writ of certiorari was denied by the supreme court on january 19 1988 furthermore chairman rodino in his funding request indicated that on january 20 1988 judge nixon released a public statement in which he made clear that he would not resign his position the judge is presently in federal prison serving his sentences therefore an impeachment investigation is of the utmost urgency and importance in support of his request for supplemental funds chairman rodino stated that it will not be possible for the committee to detail regular committee staff to the inquiry for any appreciable amount of time without impairing the heavy agenda of legislative and oversight activities that was outlined in the committees budget submission furthermore the chairman has indicated the likelihood of hearings being held on this matter which would involve the testimony of outoftown witnesses which will include subpoenaed individuals it is important to note that impeachment investigations are often very complex detailed and time consuming such investigations by their very nature require the services of outside counsel particularly experiencd litigators the impeachment inquiry regarding judge alcee hastings a unitedstates district court judge for the southern district of florida which has been pending in the committee on the judiciary since march 1987 supports this observation in the hastings case the judge had been acquitted by a jury on criminal charges as a result the committee counsels had to review and analyze a voluminous record compiled in vaious prior proceedings this review included thousands of pages of transcripts of the hastings trial the trial of the codefendant in the indictment and the testimony of over 100 witnesses before the 11th circuit investigative committee review was also made of 2 900 exhibits compiled by the investigative committee thousands of pages of fbi files transcript and exhibits of the grand jury and the investigative committees 500 page report additionally the judiciary committee began its own inquiry independent of the judicial branch the staff interviewed and in several instances took sworn testimony from approximately 50 witnesses and as a result new allegations surfaced which required further investigation the committee also had to initiate two legal proceedings to obtain certain necessary records in both matters judge hastings opposed such efforts and appellate review ensued these examples of the work involved in the hastings investigation are reflective of the difficult and serious responsibilities associated with a fair and proper impeachment inquiry finally during the past 7 years the subcommittee on accounts has generally not approved requests for supplemental funds however it has made an exception for requests from the committee on the judiciary regarding impeachment inquiries and the committee on standards of official conduct in order that these committees may have sufficient funds to discharge the important institutional responsibilities which are assigned under the constitution the house rules and statutory law in an effective manner and on a timely basis these strong institutional concerns are present in the matter pending before the house today the constitution in article i section 2 provides that the house shall have the sole power of impeachment in the house impeachment of a sitting federal judge is a matter of high privilege accordingly special funds should be provided for impeachment inquiries in order that such inquiry may be conducted thoroughly responsibly and with reasonable diligence the proper

continuing commitment by congress to assist the homeless which now number in excess of 3 million persons in the united states this conference report represents the bipartisan efforts and hard work of members on both sides of the aisle in both the house and senate the house and senate each had programmatic and perfecting amendments included in their versions of h r 4352 to the existing mckinney act which was first enacted into public law 10077 july 22 1987 this conference report represents the congress continued efforts to make these existing mckinney act homeless programs more flexible in order to serve the needs of the homeless in our country i must emphasize that this bill is an emergency effort to assist the homeless we have developed this legislation in order to address the emergency and acute needs of the homeless this bill does not make the mckinney programs permanent rather it only reauthorizes the mckinney programs for 2 more years fiscal years 1989 and 1990 this bill does not focus on the causethe lack of affordable available housing to lower income americans the answer is clearly more permanent housing which is affordable and available to lower income persons the housing subcommittee will soon consider much broader approaches to provide permanent housing for the 1990s last year we were successful in authorizing the mckinney act programs and today we continue our efforts by reauthorizing and perfecting the homeless programs contained in the stewart b mckinney act this conference report provides emergency assistance to the homeless and is not the cureall for the homeless rather it expands upon and perfects the initial mckinney act which we enacted last year and which has been operating over the last 9 months today we are reauthorizing the vitally needed homeless programs contained in the mckinney act for fiscal years 1989 and 1990 this conference report represents a joint bipartisan effort by both the majority and minodty the funding levels authorized in the bill do not exceed the levels assumed in the fiscal year 1989 concurrent budget resolution the bill reauthodzes the mckinney programs and provides a number of programmatic changes which are based on the hearings conducted by the housing subcommittee on january 26 1988 and based on subsequent meetings with advocates for the homeless service providers and state and local officials i believe that the provisions contained in this conference report will make the program that we designed in the mckinney act more workable in many communities throughout our country the conference report contains 10 titles of which the banking committee has jurisdiction over five titles titles i through iv and title x titles i through iv deal with the hud and fema mckinney homeless programs and title x deals with technical and conforming amendments to the 1987 housing and community development actpublic law 100242 the conference report authorizes a total of 633 8 million for fiscal year 1989 and 682 8 for fiscal year 1990 of which 410 1 and 426 2 million is authorized in each respective fiscal year for the hud and fema homeless programs under the banking committees jurisdiction these authorizations for the hud fema programs for each respective fiscal year 1989 and 1990 are allocated as follows 120 and 125 million for the emergency shelter grants program 100 and 105 mllion for supportive housing demonstration programsincluding transitional housing and permanent housing for handicapped homeless programs 10 and 11 million for the supplemental assistance for facilities to assist the homeless program 50 million in each fiscal year for section 8 10year moderate rehabilltation for single room occupancy dwellings 129 and 134 million for the fema emergency food and shelter program and 1 1 and 1 2 million for the interagency homeless council this conference report contains a budget compliance provision and requires the general accounting office to submit an annual summary of all mckinney homeless programs to congress the conference report also extends the interagency council for 3 years and strengthens the communication and distribution of information about the federal resources available under the mckinney act through a bimonthly bulletin and by requiring that states designate a state homeless contact person the conference report also requires the national fema emergency food and shelter board to develop alternative formulas of distributing program assistance based on data on longterm unemployed workers in each state the conference report also contains technical and programmatic provisions which clarity and strengthen the hud homeless programs to better assist the homeless changes are made the comprenhensive homeless assistance plan which is submitted by local governments and states which strengthens communication and information about the mckinney homeless programs and includes a requirement that a good faith assurance that recipients will administer a policy to ensure that their homeless facility is free of illegal use possesslon or distribution of drugs or alcohol numerous provisions are included to october 19 1988 perfect the existing mckinney programs and allow greater participation in all hud mckinney programs in addition to the changes in the mckinney act we have added provision in this legislation that make a number of technical and conforming changes to the 1987 housing authorization bill that the president signed on february 5 1988 as well as correcting some erroneous interpretations that hud has taken with regard to certain provisions in the 1987 housing authorization bill these technical changes to the 1987 authorization bill reflect what the congress had in mind in developing last years housing and community development atithorization bill finally four issues raised by the conference report should be clarified first the lease and grievance rules issued by hud raised such serious issues about fair grievance procedures and the inequity of families including the elderly losing housing assistance because a family member is accusedmind you not even convictedof criminal activities far from their home that the chairman of the select committee on aging and others requested that hearings be held early next year those hearings will take place we expect hud meanwhile will review the regulations during the interim rule comment period to address the concerns expressed in the conference report second the conference report language indicating that section 262 and the other preservation provisions of the housing and community development act of 1987 were not intended to prevent hud from extending section 8 contracts for terms less than 5 years and directed hud to permit shorter than 5year extensions applies to all types of section 8 contracts including those which were originally entei d into on newly constructed and substantially rehabilitated projects and without regard to the source of the projects mortgage financing third with regard to the provision requiring hud to restore section 8 rents that were reduced between april 15 1987 and february 5 1988 and to reimburse owners for lost payments the conferees had to subject this requirement to approval in an appropriations act for fiscal year 1989 in order to avoid a point of order that could otherwise be made in the other body however on october 1 1989 owners would have a right to such restoration and payments it has come to the attention of the conferees that some meritworthy applicants for grants under the supportive housing demon stration program have been denied for technical reasons relating to certification of their status as nonprofit entities under section 501 c 3 of the internal revenue code some of those applicants will find the resources they need to fund projects that will help people through the cold winter months ahead but a technical reading of the conference report may lead officials at hud to deny funding in the next round of grant applications because these projects will no longer be in the startup stage one vry strong applicant from cambridge ma was denied funding as a result of a misunderst nding regarding non profit status atid it may lose its eligibility for the next round of applications if it proceeds with temporary funding from other sources the conferees would expect that any grant applicant refused for technical reasons on this years round of applications would not be precluded from receiving a grant in the next round nor should such an applicant be precluded from receiving approval if additional funds become available in the interim period before the next formal round of applications these grants are not intended to supplant state and local funding for ongoing services but the conferees feel strongly that a meritworthy applicant should not be denied eligibility for this type of grant simply because the applicant is able to find temporary funding to begin serving the needs of homeless people this winter finally during the course of the conference the issue of clarifying the department of housing and urban developments authority over mortgagebacked securities issued by the federal national mortgage association was discussed subsequently the department decided to grant permanent authority to fnma to issue real estate mortgage investment conduits while the conferees concur in that decision we wish to point out that fnmas competitors fhlmc is still subject to limited remic authority by its board of directors the federal home loan bank board we want to make clear that it is imperative that competitive parity be maintained between fnma and fhlmc and that we would expect no restrictions would be placed on the operations of fhlmc that would in any way limit the positive competitive role that exists between fnma and fhlmc as procedures of affordable mortgage credit to american homebuyers i urge the adoption of this

the board is composed of 22 wellintentioned and hard working members who are committed to the program but unfortunately they have not been able to achieve an acceptable level of success nationally since 1979 only 48 local congressional award councils have been established and in a survey conducted by the subcommittee on select education only 28 percent of congressional officers who responded participated in the program and 71 percent had never heard of the congressional award program when the program was established the congress intended that it be funded and operated through private sources however while local and state councils have been extremely successful in raising funds to operate the program at the local level the national board has not in 1987 the board had to request

of december 31 1987 the foundation had a net deficit of 322 995 the foundation has not raised any funds during the first 4 months of 1988 the foundation is operating solely on an appropriation of 189

to retire the remaining 22 995 however due to the financial instability of the national board the subcommittee on select education believed that the board must meet certain mandates in order for the program to continue in trying to continue this program for the benefit of our nations young people many alternatives were discussed including the possibility of an outside organization administering the program on the national level however representatives of the board local congressional award councils and the congressional award alumni association opposed this approach thus the subcommittee agreed to allow the congressional award board continue to administer this program with no federal funds and under certain conditions those conditions are included in this legislation they are first submission of quarterly reports to the committees of jurisdiction during 1989 which describe in detail all fundraising activities conducted by the board a description of the fiscal position of the board as of the date of each report including available cash outstanding debts and prospective operating expenses the number and location of congressional award councils established since the previous

signficantly reinforced prohibited transactions are listed in detail both with respect to unitedstates government activities and private transactions the president could waive the prohibitions for specific transactions but only with prior detailed reporting to congress on a classified basis if necessary also the president may rescind the secretary of states determination that the government of a state supports international terrorism but only in accordance with certain conditions the presidents rescission can become effective immediately if there has been a fundamental change in the leadership and character of a terrorist government and appropriate assurances have been delivered or 30 legislative working days after the president has given congress a report confirming that the terrorist government has not provided any support for internationlal terrorism during the preceding 6month period and that appropriate assurances have been delivered by that government the standard for identifying a government which supports international terrorism is clarified the requirements for a presidential rescission and for identifying a terrorist government are repeated in the amendments to the antiterrorism provisions of the export administration act section 6 j and the foreign assistance act of 1961 section 620a a clear line is drawn in amended section 40 to prohibit overt transfers to terrorist states unless the president exercises his waiver authority while regulating intelligence transfers which are subject to the reporting requirements of the national security act of 1947 the amended section 40 also imposes criminal penalties on public officials and private parties who violate the prohibition section 3 f of the arms export control act is repealed this is the original antiterroism provision of the arns export control act and it is superseded by the revised section 40 prohibition section 38 a 2 of the arms export control act is amended to further obligate the director of the arms control and disarmament agency in conncction with the issuance of export licenses to take into account whether the export of a munitions list item will support international terrorism section 36 b 1 d of the arms export control act is amended to further obligate the director of the arms control and disarmament agency in connection with a sale of munitions items by the government to evalaute how if at all the proposed sale would support international terrorism section 6 j of the export adininistration act which regualtes the export of goods and technology of significant military or of terrorist value to terrorist states is amended first to remove the current 1 000 000 annual threshold amount under which the executive currently does not have to report to congress exports of such goods and technology to terrorist states and second to require validated licenses for all such exports to terrorist states and 30day prior notification to congress of the proposed issuance of a validated license section 6 j also is amended to conform the rescission authority under that section with the may 2 4 1988 rescission authority available under new section 620a of the foreign assistance act of 1961 section 6 j 1 b of the export administration act of 1979 is amended to require that the secretary of states second determination be one regarding which the export of the goods and technology could malr e a significant contribution to the military potential of a terrorist country or could enhance the ability of such country to support acts of international terrorism i want to emphasize that the reference on page 13 of house report no 100623 to this determination applying to a wide range of goods and technology must be read in conjunction with the standard of reasonableness which is explained in the same sentence that standard typically should be applied to target certain types of goods and technology which the commerce department reasonably determines could make a significant contribution to the military potential of a terrorist country or could enhance the ability of such country to support acts of international terrorism i do not interpret it as meaning that a wide indiscriminate net should be thrown out to capture every conceivable good or technology section 620a of the foreign assistance act of 1961 the antiterrorism section of that act is amended to conform it with other changes in the law particularly the revision of section 40 of the arms export control act there is a clarification that the president cannot use humanitarian reasons to justify a waiver of the antiterrorism prohibition for the purpose of providing any security assistance under part ii of the foreign assistance act of 1961 or by the exportimport bank section 36 of the arms export control act which requires certain reports to congress about commercial and governmental military exports is amended to add first quarterly reports

ranking minority member of the committee on foreign affairs of the house of representatives rather than the speaker and to require prior notice of the use of the authority under that section the hostage act of 1868 is amended to clarify that the presidents authority to take action to release hostages cannot be carried out in a manner which would otherwise be prohibited by law the

committee members an opportunity to study the results of the criminal justice subcommittees comprehensive yearlong investigation and exhaustive hearings the criminal justice subcommittee followed hearing procedures designed to encourage judge hastings involvement we listened attentively to opening remarks from judge hastings welcomed the participation of judge hastings and his counsel in the questioning of witnesses and extended an invitation to judge hastingswhich he declinedto testify concerning the events of our inquiry the chairman of the subcommittee the gentleman from michigan and the ranking minority member the gentleman from pennsylvania committed themselves to a thorough fair and objective search for the truth the committees special counsel alan baron and assistant special counsels janice cooper patricia wynn lori fields and robert levin conducted themselves with diligence and professionalism designated counsel of both majority and minority committee staff have been of great assistance to subcommittee members in our deliberations the involvement of special counsel in litigation on behalf of the committee on the judiciary deserves particular mention the committee achieved important federal court victories in obtaining access to grand jury and electronic surveillance materials the significance of the judicial opinions extends beyond the investigation of judge hastings the decisions provide important precedents that should facilitate the investigative work of the house of representatives in future impeachment matters the task of examining the conduct of a sitting federal judge is our constitutional responsibility as members of this body when significant allegations of misconduct are brought to our attention article i section 2 clause 5 of the constitution vests the sole power of impeachment in the house of ripresentatives the constitutional design seeks to reconcile the need for judicial independence with the need to preserve the integrity of the federal judiciary the first article of the impeachment resolution charges that judge hastings and william borders engaged in a conspiracy to obtain a bribe in connection with a case pending before judge hastings william borders was convicted of the conspiracy but judge hastings in a separate trial was acquitted the two verdicts clearly are inconsistent the jury in the borders case had to be convinced of judge hastings complicity the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit in its affirmance of borders conviction concluded because only hastings and borders were named as conspirators in the indictment the government had to prove hastings involvement in order to convict borders for conspiracy 693 f 2d 1318 at 1324 11th cir 1982 the fact that the government failed in the hastings trial to prove conspiracythe same conspiracy it succeeded in providing in the borders casedoes not relieve the house of representatives of its obligation in an impeachment inquiry to look at the evidence of conspiracy the constitutional protection again double jeopardywhich bars successive criminal prosecutionshas no application to a process designed to protect the rule of law from unfit judges rather than to impose punishment these proceedings simply do not place judge hastings in jeopardy of life or limb within the meaning of the fifth amendment our constitutional forebears intended to establish an impeachment process separated from the judicial branch of government we cannot consistent with this scheme consider ourselves bound by the outcome of a criminal trial the jurys verdict in my view is entitled to a substantial measure of deferenceand i have accorded it substantial deferencebut that verdict cannot provide a substitute for the independent judgment the constitution requires the house of representatives to exercise our hearings in my view produced clear and convincing evidence that judge hastings participated in a conspiracy to receive a bribe and committed perjury during his trial in order to mislead the jury house resolution 499 describes many knowingly false statements made under oath judge hastings according to clear and convincing evidence engaged in criminal conduct by lying repeatedly during his triala course of conduct that led to his acquittal of conspiracy to commit bribery the fact that an individual succeds through crimes committed at trial in winning an acquittal in a criminal case does not release us from our responsibility to bring before the senate the issue of his removal from public office on the contrary our responsibility to act is heightened by flagrant disregard for the rule of law fourteen separate articles of house resolution 499 delineate lies told by judge hastings during trial testimony these articles document a pervasive pattern of deception that this body must not ignore a trial process that relies on the willingness of witnesses to testify honestly cannot be entrusted to a judge who demonstrates contempt for the truth the house of representatives as the repository of the sole power of impeachment possesses the responsibility to look at the evidence of false testimony in spite of the fact that lies may have been believed by a jury in a bribery conspiracy trialjust as we have the responsibility to look at the evidence of a bribery conspiracy in spite of an acquittal based on false testimony a judge who compounds his misconduct by both conspiring to accept a bribe and repeatedly lying under oath gains no immunity in an impeachment proceeding judge hastings according to clear and convincing evidence sought to sell his judicial office for private gainand later perverted the legal process by testifying falsely such conduct cannot be tolerated in a public official responsible for dispensing equal justice under law the committee on the judiciary also considered allegations that judge hasting improperly disclosed information he received as the supervising judge from a continuing electronic surveillance that he authorized the evidence is clear and convincing that judge hastings in fact made the improper disclosurewith the result that law enforcement undercover operations had to be aborted the lives of some individuals involved in law enforcement efforts may have been placed at risk as a result of judge hastings action this conduct by a federal judge cannot be tolerated and provides a sufficient independent basis for impeachment the federal judiciary is the guardian of our most precious liberties our responsibility is to vigilantly protect the judiciary i urge my

omnibus insular areas act of 1988 are for the most part noncontroversial and with minor exceptions are supported by the administration the island areas affected by this legislation are of three types the first are the territories of the united states which come under the territorial clause of the constitution article iv section 3 clause 2 american samoa guam the northern mariana islands puerto rico and the virgin islands the second type of island group covered by parts of this legislation is palau which the united states administers as the last part of the united nations trust territory of the pacific island the trusteeship agreement provides the united states with the authority and responsibility for the political economic and social development of the people of palau with the passage of the palau compact of free association in 1986 and soon the implementing legislation the united states will discharge its responsibility as administering authority and although palaus new relationship under the compact appears imminent the united states continues to be fully responsible for palau and third there are certain sovereign island states which are in free association with the united states they are the republic of the marshall islands and the federated states of micronesia while these two are currently the only states in free association with the united states palau will become the third freely association state when the compact of free association becomes effective which hopefully will be soon essential air service to the freely associated states is important to the relationship between the united states and the marshall islands and the freely associated states of micronesia section 3 of the bill does not require an outlay of any additional funds it does extend the current essential air service law which will expire this month if this provision does not become law in addition to the positive impact on our relationship with the island a continuation of essential air service will be very important to the unitedstates civilian and military personnel working at the kwajalein missile testing facility in the marshall islands an additional 2 000 people are expected to work on kwajalein in the coming years although the people there do rely on military transport for the movement of personnel and supplies regularly scheduled commercial service will be very helpful to the base people mail and goods need to flow in and out of kwajalein the guarantee of essential air service by commercial airlines may preclude an increase of military cargo and passenger flights and thereby produce a savings to the unitedstates government this provision will benefit the united states by improving our relations with the islands meeting a growing need of strategic interests and saving money on transportation requirements best met by the private sector i want to acknowledge the deep interest and involvement of supreme court justice anthony m kennedy in the development of the provisions regarding judicial matters in the pacific islands justice kennedy headed a pacific islands judicial conference in american samoa which dealt with specific judicial issues in the islands i am pleased that we have a supreme court justice that is intimately familiar with the islands and their special judicial needs the provision dealing with judicial matters is intended to enable judges of the ninth judicial circuit to serve as judges of the courts of the freely associated states this type of assistance has been provided to the courts of the merging freely associated state governments by judges from the courts of unitedstates jurisdictions in the region over the years and has proven valuable to these governments during the transition from trusteeship to selfgovernment however the process for making unitedstates judges available to the freely associated states in the posttrusteeship period may not be identical to the process for providing such assistance previously because of the new status of the freely associated states as sovereign and selfgoverning both the united states and freely associated state governments may have to adopt new procedures to ensure that in making arrangements for this type of judicial assistance their respective constitutional processes are observed this provision creates authority for judicial assistance but recognizes that appropriate procedures including treaty arrangements if determined to be necessary will have to be decided upon as this provision is implemented consultations between the judicial and foreign policy elements of our government should be undertaken to ensure that this provision is implemented with due regard for the political and legal distinctions between a freely associated state and a unitedstates territory or commonwealth another provision which poses no cost to the united states is the section regarding controlled substance in the freely associated states the general health needs of the people of the freely associated states could be improved by providing qualified medical olficers in the islands with the access to unitedstates medicinal drugs without the provision of law authorizing the export of controlled substances to a freely associated state the people there are potentially jeopardized due to the lack of the proper drugs or from the use of outdated or poorly tested substances manufactured without stringent u s requirements the northern marianas college has continued to develop over the years full accreditation by the western association

develop their skills through technical and postsecondary education in order for them to contribute to the expanding economy of the islands the college is already providing the opportunities for the

although i regret that the alcohol mental health and drug abuse block grant is not included in this appropriation due to the lack of authorizing legislation i look forward to supporting that program as well as other currently unauthorized initiatives initially created by the antidrug abuse act of 1986 however the spectre of aids has spurred the appropriations committee to allocate nearly 1 billion for aids research and related activities as ranking minority member of the select committee on narcotics abuse and control i am keenly aware of the increase in aids cases among iv drug abusers or their sexual partners it is therefore important to note how the committee has specifically designated the 945 4 billion almost half of the amount 472 4 millionhas been given to the national institutes of health for additional research into this deadly disease an additional 306 8 million has been appropriated to the centers for disease control of these funds 95 8 million is for counseling and testing 119 2 million is for the very important health education programs 30 4 million is to be spent on information dissemination and public affairs while 61 3 million is for surveillance and laboratory activities i am also pleased to note that the committee saw fit to allocate 2 5 million to develop strategies and effective models and coordinate services for pediatric aids cases the narcotics select committee held a hearing on pediatric aids at harlem hospital in new york city just last week those of us who participated in the hearing received some first hand information on the problems emanating from this new tragedy which unfortunately will get much worse before it gets better rounding out the appropriations for aids activities is a 101 3 million allocation for adamha and 38 5 million to the health resources and services administration as each of these fine agencies commits itself to finding an effective treatment or supportive environment for those who suffer from aids i find it heartening that the committees report states that information and education are the only currently available means of prevention accordingly i would also like to express my support of nidas research into the spread of hiv among drug abusers my support for their efforts to provide information and education services for professionals and the information campaign that they have initiated which attempts to educate intravenous drug abusers furthermore the committee is to be commended for urging the child health institute to support research to develop appropriate educational aids programs for children and youth acknowledged to be at high risk because of the possible adolescent experimentation with drugs and sex as our surgeon general dr c everett koop has stated children and teenagers believe they will live forever and that nothing can harm them while this belief is indeed naive it is a true statement as each of us recalls our own youthful enthusiasm i have also noted that 200 million has been appropriated to the department of education to carry out its program under the drug free schools and communities act this important component of our federal war on drugs will enter its second year as the committee has specified that 161 million be passed through to the states in the form of grants while the secretary of education is to retain 39 million for a variety of antidrug abuse education activities and the alcohol drug abuse and mental health administration has been appropriated 401 8 million for 1988 of which 265 5 million has been designated for mental health activities when the block grant is reauthorized i look forward to seeing the allocation for drug abuse treatment and rehabilitation programs which are so sorely needed throughout this country h

programs of the maritime administration and the federal maritime commission these federal programs are extremely important to the future of our american flag merchant marine this legislation was carefully prepared after a formal hearing of the merchant marine subcommittee of which i am the ranking republican memberand a thorough analysis of the presidents budget request for these maritime programs this bill enjoys the bipartisan support of the members of the merchant marine and fisheries committee h r 953 authorizes a total of 391 297 million this funding level is about 60 million more than the administration requested but the members should know that this is about 11 million less than what was authorized for these same programs for fiscal year 1987 the funding level for the federal maritime commission is 14 5 million this is identical to the request of the administration and will be adequate to meet the existing statutory obligations of the fmc the role of this small but important independent agency is critical in this year of national concern over our trade policies this agency regulates the waterborne foreign and domestic commerce of the united states assuring that unitedstates international trade is open to all nations on a fair and equitable basis with its statutory mandate the fmc guarantees equal treatment to shippers carriers and other persons subject to our federal shipping statutes the authorization for the maritime administration is 376 797 million which is approximately 60 million more than the presidents request this increase is reflected in approximately 50 million more for the operating differential subsidy program and 10 million for federal assistance to the six state maritime academies these two increases over the administrations request are important because the subsidy program must be revised and this additional funding will be essential to any reform of this program with regard to the funding for the state academies the 10 million represents approximately the level of federal funding for the last several years for these state schools our committee did not accept the administrations recommendation to eliminate all funding for these maritime schools since we are convinced that they are providing a critically important education service for the nation several government studies have shown that our nation is in a very tenuous position with regard to trained merchant seamen who would be available to operate our reserve ships in a time of military emergency these schools are one of the primary sources of trained individuals and we believe that they should be supported by the government i think it would be helpful to mention one particular provision of this bill that was adopted as an amendment during our committee markup earlier this year mr davis the ranking member of the full committee and i introduced a bill to amend the vessel loan guarantee program title xi of the merchant marine act 1936 to exclude from that program all offshore oil and gas vessels and all inland tugs and barges those types of vessels represent almost 70 percent of the defaults under these federally guaranteed loans over the last several years in the presidents budget submission the administration requested repeal of this law mr davis and i did not believe it was either necessary or desirable to repeal the entire law but we felt it would be appropriate to cut back on the numbers and types of vessels eligible for these guarantees the merchant marine and fisheries committee concurred in our assessment and approved an amendment to h r 953 which eliminates for 3 years the use of this guarantee program for these vessels as the members will recall last year when this same legislation authorizing funds for maritime programs for fiscal year 1987 was submitted to the white house after congressional approval the president vetoed the bill the stated reason for that veto was the fact that the congress did not repeal the title xi loan guarantee program and that we continued to provide funding for the six state maritime academies it is the hope of the members of our committee that the administration will acknowledge the provision of this bill eliminating those vessels that represent such a substantial portion of the defaults under the loan guarantee program even though the provision doesnt go as far as the administration requested it does address the budgetary problems that led to the defaults and ultimately to the veto furthermore we assume that in light of the government studies that have shown that the nation is in a dangerous condition with regard to trained seamen the administration will acknowledge the continuing need for the state schools to turn out trained individuals who will be available for any wartime emergencies consequently we believe that this bill will give the administration the opportunity to reassess its position and approve this bill when it is presented to them the unitedstates maritime industry is in dire straits this bill is just one piece of legislation that is very important for us to enact if this nation is to continue to have a viable merchant marine the programs authorized by this bill give these two federal agencies the necessary ability to carry out the federal effort to maintain and promote an american merchant marine the very fact that our nation is considering military assistance for the carriage of oil by kuwaiti tankers in the persian gulf is indicative of the fact that our own maritime capabilities are approaching a dangerously low level i think it would be enlightening to my colleagues to be aware of two recent quotes on the status of our american merchant marine i would like to read a brief except from the document signed by president reagan in january 1987 entitled national security strategy of the united states when this decade began we faced severe difficulties in moving large forces quickly enough to deter soviet aggression deploying forces to two or more theaters simultaneously or moving material effectively into lessdeveloped regions since 1981 with the support of congress we have made great progress in redressing these deficiencies adding substantially to our airlift and sealift capability and prepositioning additional large quantities of material abroad not all of our objectives have been accomplished however in particular the continuing decline of the unitedstates merchant marine and the unitedstates flag commerical shipping assets is a matter of concern this problem is compounded by the decline of the unitedstates flag fleet which results in a reduction of the seagoing workforce to man all our unitedstates flag vesselsas well as ships of the ready reserve force the national defense reserve fleet and any effective unitedstates controlled ships which might need recrewing the lack of merchant mariners in the near term could impede our ability adequately to project and sustain forces by strategic sealift the second quote that i would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues is from adm william j crowe chairman joint chiefs of staff in july 1986 admiral crowe stated the decline in size and capacity of the unitedstates merchant marine has been a major concern of dod national security planners however even in its presently diminished state it remains and integral element of our preparedness for war and a critical pillar of deterrence in this era of constrained resources if there were no unitedstates flag merchant marine it would have to be replaced by a governmentowned and operated sealift fleetat considerable additional expense to acquire and operate i urge my colleagues to join me and the other members of the merchant marine and fisheries committee in approving h r 953 this is a small but important bill that we must send forward to our colleagues in the senate for their consideration and then to the white house for approval our nation needs our merchant marine and enactment of this legislation will indicate to the world that we are serious about continuing our presence in the worlds oceans for our maritime industry and at the same

which would encourage nuclear powerplant standardization reform the process by which such plants are licensed and transform the nuclear regulatory commission into an agency headed by a single administrator i am sponsoring this legislation as a means to assure that the nuclear power option is preserved for the future the technology to peacefully use the capability of atoms to fission was invented in the united states and is employed successfully today to generate more than 15 percent of the worlds electricity approximately 20 percent of this nations electricity is generated by nuclear power that makes nuclear power the second largest generating source in our country nuclear power is a crucial component of the nations electrical power supply it permits utilities to generate electricity without burning imported oil thus playing an important role in mitigating strategic oil concerns nuclear power also prevents an undue reliance on natural gas for electricity generation this lessened reliance on natural gas is important because it is unclear that the current gas bubble will provide sufficient gas to satisfy growth in electricity demand by permitting diversification of generation nuclear power increases the reliability and flexibility of electrical power supply additionally nuclear energy has significant advantages over other major fuels in terms of environmental impacts nuclear power greatly contributes to the achievement of the national goal of clean air in france large scale use of the atom has helped that country make deep cuts in atmospheric releases of sulphur dioxide between 1980 and 1986 the release of sulphur dioxide was halved in france at the same time the production of electricity increased by 40 percent despite these significant benefits the option of building new nuclear powerplants in the future has been largely lost in this country how has this happened while the answer to this question is complex the unitedstates licensing and regulatory process is largely responsible for the result the unitedstates licensing and regulatory process lacks stability and predictability thus imposing huge financial risks on utilities who undertake to build and operate nuclear powerplants these financial risks are so large as to outweigh the benefits of operation of nuclear powerplants the utility industry has repeatedly testified at congressional hearings that no utility will build a nuclear plant in the future unless changes to current laws and regulations are made the loss of the nuclear power option is critical increasingly over the past several years the committee on energy and commerce has received testimony from electric utility executives public utility commissioners economists energy consultants and others that it is highly likely that there will be inadequate supplies of low cost electricity in the years ahead we are on a collision course between growing demand and our ability to meet that demand while 16 000 megawatts of new generating capacity was brought into service in 1986 10 000 megawatts in 1987 and 13 000 megawatts is scheduled for this year only 2 000 megawatts is scheduled to come on line in 19901 that is exactly when the experts predict we will need additional capacity this program of insufficient capacity is predicted to increase in the mid1990s to the point where some regions of the country are expected to experience brownouts perhaps even more disquieting is the fact that such shortages will most likely cause uneconomic generating units to be brought on line in order to satisfy demand residential utility customers and american industry will of course suffer from such a result revitalization of the nuclear power option is necessary to obtain reliable and economical electricity over the long term accordingly the bill i am introducing today provides for the use of standardized nuclear plant designs these designs would be preapproved by the nuclear safety agency preapproval of designs is a very important component of this bill under existing law which provides for nuclear plants to be licensed twicefirst at the construction permit stage and second at the operating license stagenuclear plant construction begins before the plant design is completed additionally key decisions on approval of plant designs are made after plant construction this process increases the cost of nuclear plant construction and raises the prospect that a nuclear plant may be abandoned after construction of the plant or of a signficant portion of it has been completed the nuclear standardization and safety and reform act would change this plant construction would not begin until after the plant design had been reviewed and found to be safe additionally there would not be the prior mlarch 10 1 988 flexibility to change plant designs during construction this will enhance safety and decrease the costs of nuclear plant construction in the past there have been questions as to what considered a standardized design in the last few years we have come a long way in defining this term in late 1985 the industry committed to providing to nrc all the design information necessary for the nrc to make its safety findings including 100 percent of the design information for the nuclear portion of the plant and 90 percent of the design information for the balance of the plant this is all of the design information that would be needed to determine if a particular plant design is safe by enacting the nuclear standardization and safety reform act congress would preserve the progress we have made on this issue another key component of this bill concerns changing the structure of the nuclear regulatory commission from a fivemember body to a single administrator the need for organizational restructuring of the commission has been addressed a number of times by a diverse group of parties with the first major attempt being made by the kennedy administration in 1960 following the three mile island accident in 1979 both the kennedy commission and the rogovin special inquiry group recommended that nrc be restructured into an agency headed by a single administrator today three of the five current commissioners support the single administrator concept for restructuring the agency the organizational structure of the nuclear regulatory commission appears to have come about as a historical accident concurrent with reassignment of federal responsibility from the atomic energy commission to the nuclear regulatory commission and the energy research and development agencynow the department of energy when nrc was created in 1975 little attention was directed at determining the proper organizational form to manage a comprehensive nuclear safety program there was no real examination of the appropriateness of collegial management of safety regulation nor consideration of the fact that all other major federal health and safety programs are managed by agencies headed by a single administrator collegial management of federal agenices is largely confined to ratemaking and other economic areas the single administrator form of regulatory management offers the significant advantages of improved management improved policy formulation and most importantly clear accountability the current nrc structure diffuses responsibility and by so doing it diffuses accountability as contrasted to the current situation where no one individual is in charge a single administrator would be fixed with unmistakable accountability for agency perform ance experience teaches that political accountability is a powerful safeguard of the public interest finally the nuclear standardization and safety reform act would provide for a combined construction permit operating license hearing for standardized nuclear plants the current twostep process is the result of the atomic energy act being modeled on the federal communications act and is not related to the requirements of nuclear powerplant technology the twostep process brings instability and unpredictability into powerplant construction resulting in increased costs a combined process which looks at all safety and environmental issues before any construction has taken place should have the effect of enhancing safety as well as decreasing costs in sum i believe this legislation will preserve the nuclear power option for the future and thus benefit all americans through the provision of more economic diverse supply of electricity for the benefit of my colleagues i am inserting in the record at this point a brief sectionbysection analysis of the bill"], [0.58759605884552, 0.58759605884552, 0, "i rise in support of s 2545 the omnibus new mexico parks bill this legislation was originally introduced as a companion bill to my legislation h r 3541 to redesignate the salinas national monument as the salinas pueblo missions national monument however during senate action on s 2545 it was amended to include provisions from several other bills which would increase public awareness of a number of unique historical and cultural sites in the state of new mexico title i of s 2545 contains the provisions revising the name of salinas national monument my companion bill passed the house in july 1988 as i mentioned during house consideration of the bill at that time although this change seems relatively minor it is very important to the people associated with the monument the monument includes three pueblo missions which were significant in the history of the southwest by changing the name to include the word pueblo it will more adequately describe the resources of the monument and hopefully increase visitation to this park service unit title ii includes the provisions of s 1693 providing for a study of the coronado trail for potential addition to the national trails system the trail follows the route taken by spanish explorer francisco vasquez do coronado between 1540 and 1542 in his search for the fabled seven cities of cibola the route included portions of the present states of arizona new mexico texas oklahoma and kansas appropriately the study is to be completed by 1992the year of the 500th anniversary of the discovery of the new world by columbus an event closely associated with the coronado expedition title iii contains provisions of s 1912 authorizing a 1year study of the mimbres culture to determine its significance in illustrating and commemorating the prehistory of the southwest the study would include recommendations concerning the preservation and display of pottery and other information and materials associated with the mimbres culture the mimbres inhabited new mexico from 200 to 1200 a d and have become known for their distinctive style of black and white pottery while i do not oppose such a study i might note for the record that some concern has been expressed that these provisions would encourage recognition of artifacts as a primary purpose for national park service involvemont rather than the customary involvement on the basis of the remains of settlements therefore i will look forward to the recommendations which will hopefully consider this important point title iv contains provisions from s 2157 the spanish colonization commemorative act it authorizes three 2year feasibility studies in the state of new mexico regarding the significance of the san gabriel historic landmark and the los luceros hacienda as well as the preservation and interpretation of resources associated with the spanish colonization of the southwest these studies will explore the culture and history of the spanish frontier area beginning with the establishment of the spanish empires most northern outpost in the new world new mexico nearly four centuries ago title v incorporates the provisions of s 2264 to resolve a conflict over the competing uses of a parcel of land known as a mountair in las cruces nm a mountain is currently owned by the bureau of land managemerit but has been withdrawn for use by new mexico state university and the national aeronautics and space administration to operate a satellite tracking observatory there are also several unpatented mining claims on this land of which two are being operated as commerical gravel pits because traffic at the pits has disturbed nasas readings section 1 of title v directs blm to transfer the mining claims within the land withdrawals on mountain a for other blm lands of equal value in the vicinity section 2 of this title permits blm and nmsu to enage in an exchange of lands within a mountain and blms existing aguirre springs recreation area this will alow blm to consolidate its lands in this area it will also permit nmsu to expand its campus in the future and prevent encroachment on its existing research facilities a reverter clause prohibits nmsu from selling the land and ensures its use for educational scientific and research activities or for the development of geothermal resources this exchange could normally be conducted administratively however such an exchange is currently blocked due to the ongoing lawsuit between blm and the national wildlife federation this bill will allow this important exchange to go forward while the lawsuit is pending 1110134 october 12 1 988 co title vi contains the provisions of s 2617 expanding the boundaries of aztec ruins national monument in the state of new mexico to include an additional 292 acres of adjacent private land the monument which preserves the ruins of the chacoan and mesa verde cultures was established in 1923 and is currently 27 acres in size unfortunate y irrigation activities have raised ground water levels and flooded the monument in recent years these provisions which are supported by the local landowners will protect the monument from future flooding through acquisition of the irrigated land title vi includes the rovisions of s 2750 authorizing a 1year study on methods to commemorate the cont ibutions of the late georgia okeefe ms vkeefe was a wellknown artist whose woks focused on the landscape of new mexit o the study would include evaluating the fe sibility of establishing a landscape museun of the scenes and features painted by ms okeefe while it is not clear what this would entail i would point out for the record that this would be a new type of national park designation and i would urge careful evaluation of such a proposal if it were recommended following completion of the study title viii contains the provisions of s 2767 authorizing a 1year study of the history and culture of warm springs nm this area has been the home of several cultures throughout history including the mimbres indians and the warm springs apaches the remains of fort harmony are also located at the site the study will determine the signficance of warm springs in illustrating and commemorating american frontier military history and the formulation of american indian policy s 2545 includes several provisions aimed at protecting the significant resources of new mexico and improving the recreational opportunities for its citizens and visitors to the state it enjoys broadbased support and has already been approved by the senate therefore i urge its adoption by this body today"], [0.5874531865119934, 0.5874531865119934, 0, "i rise in strong support of h r 4783 the fiscal yevr 1989 labor health and human services and education appropriations bill i also rise to pay tribute to my good friend the chairman of the subcommittee bill natcher of kentucky the bill we are presenting today to the house reflects his compassion his knowledge his dedication and his understanding of the needs of the american people it is a genuine pleasure for me to work side by side with the gentleman from kentucky in trying to provide for the human resource needs of the american people this year we sat side by side for 31 days of hearings over the 2yamonth period starting just after the president submitted his budget request in february and ending on may 5 twentyfour of those days were with administration witnesses testifying in behalf of the administration budget and explaining the operations of programs within the agencies for 7 days we heard from 437 outside witnesses who presented requests on behalf of 429 organizations seventyeight members of this body either presented or submitted testimony in support of certain programs we have developed a bill that goes as far as possible toward meeting the peoples needs while also meeting our responsibilities to the federal budget deficit situation it hasnt been easy to balance both of those interests but we have done our level best to try in addition the committee bill stays within the parameters set by both last years economic summit and this years budget resolutionand it is well within the 302 b allocation to our subcommittee h r 4783 provides 135 7 billion for the programs operated by the departments of labor health and human services and education and 15 related agencies nearly threequarters of that amount or 98 7 billion is for entitlement programs over which the committee has no say because the authorizing legislation sets the funding levels the entitlement spending contained in this bill is 7 6 billion more than was provided in fiscal year 1988 and 265 million below what the president requested for discretionary spending which makes up about 27 percent of the total amount in the bill we recommend 37 billion that reflects an increase of 2 billion over the fiscal year 1988 level and 1 3 billion more than the president requested this is the only area where we can exercise our discretion as a result of our hearings in addition we have deferred action on neveral program appropriations that lre unauthorized at this time inicluded among those unauthorized programs are job training and health care for the homeless health professions training family planning the disease prevention block grant sexually transmitted disease prevention activities alcohol drug abuse and mental health research refugee assistance the corporation for public broadcasting and the unitedstates institute of peace last year we provided 2 7 billion for these programs let me turn to what is in this bill h r 4783 provides for fairly hefty increases in four areasaids prevention and research other biomedical research compensatory education for disadvantaged children and college student aid it should come as no surprise that these are the same priority areas that we have presented for at least the past 2 years for aids research and prevention we provide 1 234 billion 308 million more than the fiscal year 1988 levela 38percent increase this is also the amount requested by the president for our efforts to combat this dreaded disease which has been our no 1 public health enemy for the past several years this level of funding would allow a significant expansion of all activities from prevention programs to testing treatments and vaccines to biomedical research we provide a 390 million increase for other biomedical research at the national institutes of health spread across the institutes the 6 275 billion contained in the bill for nih is our lifeline to finding the causes and cures for any number of diseases and other disabling conditions cancer arthritis glaucoma diabetes childhood diseases digestive diseases and all the others compensatory education will receive an increase of 336 million under the bill for a total appropriation of 4 673 billion this very successful program is the first and sometimes last chance many disadvanaged young people have i say last chance because if we dont reach these children with the reading mathematics and other instructional services that chapter 1 provides they will probably become the dropout and crime statistics of the future i am pleased that the total includes firsttime funding for some important initiatives contained in h r 5 the recent elementary and secondary education act reauthorization included are concentration grants even start and the capital expenses program to help districts provide chapter 1 to children attending private schools the billi alzo increases college student aid by 313 million to a total of 5 908 billion here too we are trying to implement the new policy congress set in 1986 of trying to reverse the trend whereby more lowincome students were finding themselves having to get deeper into debt because adequate grant funds were not available these programs provide access and opportunity for higher education to millions of young americans who would not be able to obtain postsecondary education without them how do these priority areas compare with what the administration requested i am pleased to say that the administration proposed major increases in all four areas for aids we provide the exact amount requested by the administration the president requested a 330 million increase for biomedical research at nih just 60 million less that what we have provided for compensatory education the administrationrequested a 230 rmi1lion increase compared to the 336 million increase we provided to accommodate some of the programs in h r 5 and in the student aid area h r 4783 is actually 192 million below the president principally because we used the cbo estimates for how to accomplish a policy goal we shared with the administrationincreasing the pell grant maximum by another 100 to 2 300 where we differ from the administration we do so because we exercised our judgment as to what these programs need the biggest difference between the administration and the committee bill appears in our recoinmendation for low income home energy assistance a program which until recently was funded at over 2 billion but was cut back to 1 532 billion in fiscal year 1988 h r 4783 provides a small but significant increase of 35 million to bring the total up to 1 567 billion the administration had proposed 1 187 billion which is 345 million below the fiscal year 1988 level and 380 million below the housepassed appropriation last year i believe that our increase is justified and i know you agree with memore than 200 members of the house wrote to our subcommittee urging us to try to reach 1 8 billion for liheap i wish we could have reached that level but at least this small increase should be a clear signal to the senate about our intentions regarding this program aside from that difference our differences are not significant in fact in the statement of administration policy on this bill i was pleased to note a new phrase rarely if every seen coming out of omb that reads as follows the administration is encouraged by the committee bill and commends the committee for presenting a bill that is generally consistent with the priorities contained in the presid nets request not only should the administration be encouraged about this bill but every member of this house should be the same we have brought you another really good bill in terms of how it stacks up against the policies and priorities set in last years economic summit and this years budget resolution and we have also brought you a very good bill in terms of providing the american people with the services and programs they need this is truly the peoples bill because ev ery last dime goes to help an american in need in this bill we provide hope for a job or for a cure for a disease affecting a loved one in th sill we provide opportunity in the lurm of a chance at college or an adult literacy program and in this bill we provide sustenance by helping a senior citizen afford heating fuel in the cold of winter or giving dietary help to a young disadvantaged mother to be this is a good bill that each of us can be proud of when we return to our districts for the rest of this year and into next year when the benefits will really be felt i urge each of my colleagues lo support this bill and reject any attempts to reduce these funding levels either by line item or across the board what are some of the other program areas that you would be supporting if you vote for this bill unchanged"], [0.5869303345680237, 0.5869303345680237, 0, "i thank my colleagues for their responses ijis e tody for the purpose of explaining ifiy amendment which is made in order by the rule for m r 1467 i first want to state that under no circumstances does my amendment delay or lessen the need for the epa to fulfill their responsibilities under the endangered species act specifically the amendment will not delay the implementation of the endangered species pesticides labeling program however following several meetings with this member and others epa has already committed publicly to providing farmers ranchers foresters and the states with the necessary time needed to smoothly implement the program and in order to make that program work we should assist in that commitment the intent of my amendment is to offer clarity formality and workability to the endangered species pesticides labeling program and ultimately to maximize the acceptance of the program by affected user groups and pesticide applicators first off the amendment provides that epa in cooperation with usda and the department of the interior will promptly engage in a program to inform and educate persons affected by the labeling program including a requirement that the essential elements of the program be published in the federal register second the amendment requires an economic assessment of the programs impact and expected benefits as well as the study and investigation of the development and implementation of the program finally the amendment requires two reports which will include recommendations for changes and improvements the problem with this program is not the desire and need to comply with the endangered species act it is the manner in which the program has been developed and is to be implemented without due consideration to alternative methods of compliance my amendment will encourage sensitivity to the needs of production agriculture and the development of acceptance alternatives for complying with the esa the first part of my amendment calls for a program to educate and to make available information for persons engaged in the production of food and fiber that are and may be affected by the environmental protection agencys endangered species pesticides labeling program this program to educate and inform will be conducted jointly by epas administrator the secretary of agriculture and the secretary of interior since the endangered species pesticides labeling program is the responsibility of epa the responsibility to dedicate resources and effort to the development of the education and information program should be on that agency however the unitedstates department of the interior and the unitedstates department of agriculture have unique resources and talents that can assist greatly in the development and implementation of the education effort i would expect in particular that the department of agriculture could contribute greatly due to its naturally extensive relationship to the agriculture community and other affected pesticide users for this program to work we must indicate in a timely way impending events related to the endangered species pesticides labeling program for this reason and to reduce the level of uncertainty among affected and potentially affected pesticide users commodity producers and landowners the provision requiring notice in the federal register was included epa should promptly publish in the federal register accurate detailed information regarding the affected pesticides under the endangered species pesticides labeling program as well the restrictions imposed on the user or applicator a geographical identification of the prohibition or restriction to include a listing of impacted counties and unless determined otherwise by the secretary of interior a subcounty description of the restrictions or prohibitions and identification of the relevant of endangered or threatened species obviously if these restrictions are to work they should be published prior to their implementation the amendment calls for the administrator of epa jointly with the secretary of agriculture and the secretary of interior to jointly conduct investigations and studies of the development and implementation of the endangered species pesticides labeling program of particular interest is the translation of biological data and jeopardy decisions rendered by the department of the interior into pesticide restrictions by epa and their ultimate implementation one of the most crucial aspects of the amendment is the requirement of a study of the economic impact and anticipated benefits the epa has provided no information regarding actual expected or potential economic impacts of the endangered species pesticides labeling program without this kind of information it is impossible for this congress or other federal agencies to lessen any economic blow this program may generate it is my hope that we may be able to modify or expand existing programs administered by the department of agriculture or the department of the interior or epa so that adversely affected pesticide users and landowners in particular can accommodate the impending necessary pesticide changes for example the conservation reserve program may be expanded to prioritize enrollment of affected landowners or perhaps affected lands could be prioritized for acquisition by federal land management agencies these and certainly many other ideas should be explored and evaluated for their merits specific items that the study on economic impacts should examine include the increase in affected industry and user costs production losses changes in valuation of affected range lands pasturelands timberlandsand timber or crop lands that may result due to increased risks costs and losses in production as a result of imposed pesticide restrictions furthermore the economic impact study should examine the costs states will incur or can expect to incur if they should customize epas endangered species pesticides labeling program to their own special needs also epa the department of agriculture and department of the interior should indicate the costs attendent to developing and implementing the program as well as the costs that epas program will impose upon their operations there is also a requirement to study and report on the benefits derived from the implementation of the endangered species pesticides labeling program the study of benefits should focus on those benefits expected to accrue to the recovery of endangered and threatened species we should not expect the department of the interior or any other agency to attempt to quantify the economic benefits or value of protecting endangered species but some attempt should be made to examine document and explain what benefits the endangered species pesticides labeling program will generate the epa has consistently indicated that the rationale for imposing the new pesticide restrictions are driven by legal vulnerabilities we should instead justify the program on the basis of advancing and protecting endangered or threatened species the epa the department of agriculture and the department of the interior shall conduct an investigation into the fundamental processes by which the endangered species pesticides labeling program was developed and implemented the accuracy and validity of the county bulletin maps which designate the geographical locations of the pesticide restrictions also need study and improvement special attention should be given to the extent that the maps which detail the locations of the restrictions fully conform to the habitat of the endangered and threatened species the maps should not include territory beyond the area of the habitat of the endangered or threatened species requiring explicit protection from exposure to pesticide applications simply for the purpose of administrative convenience the amendment also requires an investigation into alternative courses of action initiatives that epa has implemented or should consider a flaw in the development and implementation of the endangered species pesticides labeling program is the lack of attention and resources provided for the consideration and development of alternative methods of compliance many pesticide labels provide a range of application rates for a particular crop to treat a certain type of infestation the decisions rendered by the department of the interior regarding the level of risk posed by a pesticide do not attempt to find the threshold of exposure that poses an acceptable risk as the agency responsible for regulating pesticides epa should work with the department of the interior and the department of agriculture to investigate alternative methods of restricting pesticide applications such alternatives may include consideration of banded versus broadcast applications reduced rates of application temporal restrictions and also reconsideration of the assumptions used to render decisions regarding the level of risk posed by the relevant pesticides the epa the secretary of agriculture and the secretary of interior shall submit two reports regarding the results of their studies and recommendations congress will anticipate receipt of the first interim report on january 1 1989 and the final report will be due january 1 1990 these reports should address all elements of their investigations as well as the inclusion of recommendations to modify and improve programs to make more efficient the implementation of the endangered species pesticides labeling program my amendment is a fair amendment under no interpretation can the required reports be construed to mandate a delay in the implementation of the endangered species labeling program the intent of the studies investigations and subsequent reports is to strengthen the endangered species pesticides labeling program with input from outside of the epa and to encourage more flexibility and creativity under current law only the administrator of the epa has the authority to delay and or allow for flexibility in the implementation of the endangered species pesticides labeling program this amendment will provide the information and support needed to intelligently administer the pesticides labeling program i urge the adoption of this amendment"]], "top_unsure": [[0.006911158561706543, 0.5069111585617065, 0, "yes i do"], [0.006923377513885498,
