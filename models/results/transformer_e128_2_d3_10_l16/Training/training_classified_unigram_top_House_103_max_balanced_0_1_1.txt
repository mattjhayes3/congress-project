every billion dollars of american goods that are exported 16 000 to 17 000 new jobs will be created this agreement will be even better for the american people than the extremely successful nafta agreement was under nafta in the first quarter of 1994 texas exports to mexicoincreased from 5 billion to 5 6 billion this is an 11 percent increase in exports to mexico in a single quarter gatt is as

prices higher prices mean higher profits higher profits mean higher net income and that is good for the american worker faimess for the first time ever in a multilateral trade agreement all 123 member countries will have to play by the same rules in our previous trade agreements any member country could pick and choose what part of the agreement applied to them gatt is different gatt will require all member countries to agree to and abide by the same rules and this will benefit the american worker bipartisanship this agreement is neither a democratic nor a repubrican agreement but rather both parties agreement to level the playing field with other countries this agreement was launched by president reagan fostered by president bush and concluded by president clinton throughout the negotiation process and this years legislative process all three administrations have consulted with congress in an effort to make this agreement bipartisan and this effort has better served the american worker sovereignty under the gatt agreement despite whet the critics say unitedstates sovereigntywill not be compromised the argument that the united states will be beholden to the whims of third world countries or faceless bureaucrats is completely false nothing in gatt affects the sovereignty of this country or any state the only governing body that can now or ever will be able to make unitedstates law is the unitedstates government the wto will not be able to dictate law to either the unitedstates government or any state government nor wil the wto have the power to overturn state or federal law any decision to adopt repeal or amend unitedstates law will remain ours alone to make to ensure that the united states is never at the mercy of a runamok antiamerican international body dominated by developing countries and powerful bureaucrats a final amendment was added to require congress to vote on wto membership every 5 years this amendment will ensure that the united states retains its sovereignty and this is good for the american worker while this is a solid trade agreement that will provide an increase in hundreds of thousands of jobs for americans this agreement may cause some temporary worker displacement and a drop in some individual wages despite this gatt will benefit the majority of the american workers our country is in an global market and our economy must be responsive to this fact as a congressman who will vote for this agreement i believe that we should look for new and innovative ways to put those displaced by this agreement back to work we must not leave these workers behind neither should we bring the entire train to a screeching halt in the face of progress we must vote for this agreement for the long term good of all american workers if the american worker wants to remain competitive in the future we as a country will have to adopt to the world economy before we can thrive within it the passage of gatt is the first step to thriving in

a bill which is entitled the exclusion and asylum reform amendments of 1993 some of you may have watched the television program 60 minutes last sunday and were as aghast as i was at the ease with which we see aliens coming into this country at our airports and other ports of entry who have fraudulent documents or no documents at all and how they can come in and if this is the case simply say i claim political asylum i am in fear of persecution if i am returned to country x y or z and immediately the immigration officers release them into the public domain of the united states they give them a work permit they allow them to go get a social security card and a drivers license and 90 percent of them are never seen again not before a hearing officer or anywhere else it is absolutely absurd how this can happen and i am disappointed that we have not had hearings on this subject before i introduced a similar bill to the one i am talking about this time in the last congress but we have not yet addressed the matter what is happening in this country is that we have got a system abroad of people who are smuggling folks into our country taking advantage of a very big loophole in our law if somebody comes to this country and he or she has no documents at all we should not allow that to happen that they can just walk away into the society and have a work permit and so forth the reason why technically this is being done is because we are very liberal on giving someone the right to claim asylum when they first set foot in our nation either on the sandy shores of the beach or in an airport we say if you profess the right magic word and say that youre afraid that youre going to be persecuted back in your homeland because of some political beliefs or religious beliefs then were going to give you the opportunity to go before an immigration judge and have a full hearing on this matter well the problem is the immigration judges are not sitting at the airports of this nation waiting to hear these cases they have backlogs a hundred thousand cases sitting there in the nation today waiting to be heard it takes literally years to hear these cases and all of that time while people are waiting to be heard they are existing out in the countryside and oftentimes are not even showing up for these hearings when somebody goes to jfk as the 60 minutes report showed that they did do on sunday and they make this political asylum claim there is no room to hold them even overnight at jfk they are full at the house so to speak at the little bit of detention center immigration services has so they are immediately parolled into the country and given this temporary work permit and they are told they have a hearing in another couple of months they are supposed to come to just a preliminary hearing it does not resolve anything and then there may be 3 or 4 years or perhaps a few months if they are lucky for coming back for a fullfledged hearing if they show up what my bill does is very simple it says if you come in with a fraudulent document or no document at all any port of entry whether its an airport or a land port you are going to be assigned to a specially trained asylum officer there are already 150 of them in the immigration service today and that specially trained asylum officer is going to ask a series of questions to determine if they have a credible fear of persecution if they return to their homeland my bill says if you dont have a document at all if youve not made a political asylum claim or if you do not present a credible fear of persecution to this asylum officer youll be put on the very next return plane and shipped back to the country of origin you are not going to have a day in court here and an immigration judge type court youre not going to be given a temporary work permit youre not going to be allowed to get a social security card or a drivers license youre going to be shipped back where you came from and i think that is very important 35 000 came through our airports alone last year in this category 15 000 of them at kennedy in new york and most of those 90 percent of those we will never see again before an immigration judge they are here as a practical matter they are here permanently because we do not have a system to round them up as my colleagues heard the other night on 60 minutes one of those was the fellow who we believe was involved in the shooting at the cia in langley va a few weeks ago he came over here and was given this status because he did not have the right documents but he claimed political asylum i would submit that the bill that i am introducing with a number of cosponsors today is the only practical way to grant relief to this nation to our people and that we need to get on with the business of screening out those who do not have legitimate claims and i would hope that we will have hearings shortly on this subject and that this type of legislation will be put in place so that we do not have people coming into this country getting into our system buying their way in in many cases i understand they may pay as much as 30 000 for these fraudulent documents and for the advice that tells them the magic words to claim the political asylum if my proposal were to be adopted i believe that most of this would end and we could go back to a much more reasonable basis for operating in the last 2 years alone there has been a 300percent increase in the number of people coming in through this political asylum claim with fraudulent documents or a lack of documents at our airports a 300percent increase it could only be because the people out there in the other world know that this is a way to beat the system and i would submit to my colleagues that there may be many of those who come in who are not so innocent who may be terrorists or potential terrorists the threat to our security as well as the threat to our orderly immigration system is at risk i would urge my colleagues to look at the exclusion and asylum reform amendments of 1993 and consider cosponsoring them and urging hearings and a markup as expe ditiously as possible to put in place a system that will stop this

private groups in the hands of the federal government and not the federal government but one person who is going to decide whether or not they violated the law ahd the penalties for individuals is up

would like to ask anybody here when was the last time you heard of any member being penalized to the tune of 10 000 or s200 000 it just does not happen for to you say it happens is erroneous it simply is not going to happen you might chastise them or censure them here in this body but they are not going to be penalized like the average citizen who is going to get hit with a 10 000 or 200 000 fine

big mac yet if somebody takes a member of congress out and buys him a sandwich he is guilty of breaking the law and can be penalized 10 000 but he cannot be if he gives him 45 0 where is the logic in

the first term i think of is esprit de corps bob michel has been the spirit of the republican party for all these 38 years bob michel is a great man the living embodiment of all that is best about the republican party there is one other term that comes to mind when i think of bob michel that word that phrase is semper fidelis another marine corps term it means always faithful i think back to the first 2 years of the ronald reagan presidency when bob michel put his heart and soul into passing the reagan program through congress he made tough votes that were difficult to make cutting back on entitlement programs doing things that we should have been doing all along he almost lost the election because of it in 1982 but he was always faithful to his beliefs to the republican philosophy of

is being based i have the greatest respect for my distinguished colleague the gentleman from illinois but the courthouse in rhode island is in serious need of repair in fact yesterday during the rain the computer room flooded and was unusable if we are going to have a crime bill which is going to put billions of dollars to try and deal with crime in our nation we must have a facility which can administer justice in this particular courthouse which was built in 1908 this is not a new building this is merely an appropriation to repair an existing structure this building has 56 000 square feet of office space which house 107 federal employees who are involved in trying toadminister justice in rhode island it is one of the busiest courthouses in the country these renovation plans have been in the system for over 10 years for the last 4 years gsa has been working on them the alternatives to not funding this renovation are first to build a new courthouse which would be almost four times as expensive as these renovations the second alternative would be to vacate this courthouse and lease spaces which over a 30year present value figure would again be four times the expense of renovating this courthouse we have a situation where a jury which is trying to be empaneled whici would normally take 70 to 100 people can only sit in one individual room 40 people we have people in thecorridors waiting to hear jury instructions when our prisoners are brought into this courthouse they must ride in public elevators and stand with the public because there are no facilities yes there are times when i think we ought to look beyond rules which would limit our ability to deal with serious issues and i would suggest this is one of those times no one who is running a company would say that we should bind ourselves and not fix and protect our assets no one who is a legislator would say we should become so involved that we do not take appropriate action when we see necessary repairs needed yes if we are going to dispense justice in this country and we have i believe some of the finest jurists in the nation in rhode island we should give them the tools that they need to dispense that justice and that is a facility that has a courtroom a facility which could administer justice properly and one which is in repair we should not let this facility become

to formulate the approved interchange design at an estimated total cost of 90 million ompletion of the route 17 route 4 interchange project is heavily dependent upon federal funding full funding for the interchange should not be a problem since both route 17 and route 4 have been designated by the unitedstates department of transportation as components of the urbanized area portion of the nhs at the request of the nj department of transportation the north jersey transportation coordination council and other local planning organizations and in accordance with applicable provisions outlined in the intermodal surface transportton efficiency act of 1991 as a currently authorized project the route 17 route 4 interchange has already demonstrated its merit to the unitedstates congress
