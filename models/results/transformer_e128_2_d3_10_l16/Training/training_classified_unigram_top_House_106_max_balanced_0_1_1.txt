last several years have asked a very basic fundamental question that is is it right is it fair that under our tax code a married working couple where both a husband and wife are in the workforce that they pay higher taxes just because they are married is it right that 25 million married working couples 50 million taxpayers pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married we call that 1 400 the marriage tax penalty it affects married couples who because they have two incomes they are forced to file jointly they are pushed into a higher tax bracket and they pay higher taxes it is a marriage tax penalty and it is wrong let me introduce to the house some constituents of mine michelle and shad hallihan two public school teachers from a community of manhattan just south of joliet illinois shad is a teacher at joliet high school michelle at manhattan junior high their combined income is about 62 000 they are middleclass teachers they are homeowners of course since they were married they have since had a child little ben remember their family someone new in their lives and they are so proud of little ben here who is growing very quickly their marriage tax penalty is about 1 000 a year that they pay just because they are married i think it is a fair question is it right is it fair that shad and michelle hallihan two public school teachers who work very hard every day have a new little boy in their lives have to pay higher taxes send money to washington just because they are married i am proud to say this conference report before it eliminates the marriage tax penalty that good people hardworking middleclass people like shad and michelle hallihan pay every year because they are married under our conference report we help those who itemize their taxes as well as those who do not now my friends on the other side of the aisle say that if one is middle class and one itemizes ones taxes usually because one is a homeowner or one gives money to ones institutions of faith or church or synagogue or charity one is rich and one does not deserve marriage tax relief well republicans and fortunately 48 democrats believe we should help the middleclass homeowners who give money to charity they are not rich they work hard shad and michelle hallihan make 62 000 a year they itemize their taxes now we help those who do not itemize their taxes in this conference by doubling the standard deduction that is used by those who do not itemize their taxes we double that for joint filers to twice that as singles for those who are itemizers like michelle and shad hallihan and little ben who are homeowners so they are forced to itemize we widen the 15 percent bracket that is the basic tax bracket that affects everybody we widen that so joint filers married couples like shad and michelle with two incomes can earn twice as much as a single filer and be in the same tax bracket the same 15 percent tax bracket what i think is most exciting about this bill not only do we help middleclass families who are homeowners and give money to church and charity who itemize those taxes as well as those who do not is that it is effective this year when we pass this legislation and put it on the presidents desk today the president will have an opportunity if he signs it into law to help married couples 25 million married working couples this year because i would point out that doubling the standard deduction which helps those who do not itemize and widening the 15 percent tax bracket which helps those who do itemize such as homeowners and those that give money to church and charity that they will receive marriage tax relief this year because this legislation is effective january 1 of 2000 think about that when my friends on the other side of the aisle and bill clinton and al gore raised taxes in 1993 they made their tax increase retroactive which meant they went back in the tax year and took ones money well this year we have an opportunity to give marriage tax relief this year which means we go back to january 1 of this year if one is married one of 25 million married working couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty one is going to see marriage tax relief this year in tax year 2000 that is a great opportunity if one believes in fairness in the tax code as we do it is time to make the tax code more fair and more simple we want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty now my friends on the other side of the aisle have been making lots of excuses they really do not want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty because they would much rather spend shad and michelles money they believe it is better spent here in washington than shad and michelle hallihan can spend it back in joliet illinois think about it the average marriage tax penalty for good hardworking middleclass married couples like shad and michelle hallihan 1 400 1 400 is 1 years tuition at joliet community college our local community college it is 3 months of day care for little ben at a local child care center in joliet illinois it is a washer and dryer for their home it is 3 000 diapers for little ben the marriage tax penalty of 1 400 is really money for real people let us do the right thing let us pass this rule let us pass this legislation let us wipe out the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working

representing the south side of chicago and the south suburbs communities like joliet and lancing and morris and rural communities like tonica and elsewhere and they often ask me a pretty basic question that question is as we talk about taxes they say why why do married working couples a husband and wife who are both in the workforce why do they pay higher taxes when they get married they ask is it right is it fair that under our tax code married working couples pay higher taxes on average 25 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes than identical couples who choose not to get married but live together outside of marriage that is not right the folks back home tell me that it is time that those of us here in washington should do something about it that we should work to eliminate what has been called the marriage tax penalty 1 400 the average marriage tax penalty is a lot of money back home in illinois 1 400 is one years tuition for a nursing student at joliet junior college our local community college it is three months of day care for a working mom and dad with children it is almost 4 000 diapers for a family with a newborn child it is real money for real people and there are of course some here in washington who say they would much rather spend that money here in washington than bring about tax fairness by eliminating the marriage tax penalty well i am proud to say this house is doing something about the marriage tax penalty last year we passed and sent legislation to the president which would have wiped out the marriage tax penalty for over 25 million couples and unfortunately president clinton and vice president gore vetoed that bill they had a lot of excuses they wanted to spend that money but this year there is no excuse we have valentines day approaching and what better gift to give 25 million married working couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty than to pass legislation wiping out the marriage tax penalty this thursday we will be considering in the house legislation approved by the committee on ways and means h r 6 the marriage tax elimination act which i am proud to say now has 236 cosponsors including almost 30 democrats who have joined with us in our effort to eliminate the marriage tax penalty we help real people let me introduce a couple here this couple here shad and michelle hallihan of joliet illinois two public school teachers in joliet illinois they happen to make about 60 000 in combined income from their two teaching salaries and shad and michelle suffer almost the average marriage tax penalty well under the legislation that the house is going to be considering this week shad and michelle will benefit because two public school teachers who chose to get married who now suffer the marriage tax penalty will essentially have their marriage tax penalty wiped out michelle told me the other day she says congressman tell your friends in the congress particularly those who believe it is not a good idea to eliminate the marriage tax penalty what wiping out the marriage tax penalty would mean for them they say 1 000 which is essentially the marriage tax penalty would buy 3 000 diapers for their newborn baby that is money that is currently going to washington that they could use to take care of their child frankly if we want to be fair it is their money we should eliminate the marriage tax penalty this thursday h r 6 the marriage tax elimination act will help couples like shad and michele hallihan we do it in several ways we double the standard deduction onehalf of married couples do not itemize their taxes they use the standard deduction so we double it for joint filers the marriage penalty is created when a married couple of course get married they file their taxes jointly their combined income usually pushes them into a higher tax bracket that is what pushes shad and michelle into the 28 percent bracket what we want to do of course is for the nonitemizers which is about half of the married couples who suffer the marriage penalty to double the standard deduction for joint filers to make it twice that of singles for those who itemize who are the other half of married couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty those who itemize are homeowners the average middleclass family itemizes their taxes because they own a home we want to help them and provide marriage tax relief as well so we widen the 15 percent bracket the basic tax bracket that every one of us pays we are all in the 15 percent bracket regardless of our income for the lowest bottom bracket of our income by widening the bracket so that joint filers married couples can earn twice as much as a single filer and be in that same bracket we help those who itemize we also help the working poor there is a marriage penalty for the earned income credit and we provide tax relief for them this thursday let us have an overwhelming bipartisan majority let us

very very diverse district a series of communities on the south side of chicago and the south suburbs cook and will counties industrial communities like joliet and a lot of suburban towns as well as cornfields and grain elevators the folks back home have a pretty clear message even in such a diverse district they want us to meet our challenges and work together and come up with solutions that is why they are so proud of what this congress has accomplished in the last 4 years with balancing the budget for the first time in 28 years cutting taxes for the middle class for the first time in 16 years reforming welfare for the first time in a generation and taming the tax collector by reforming the irs for the first time ever those are real accomplishments and folks say well thats pretty good but thats history what are we going to do next well this congress and this republican house have several very very important goals we want to strengthen and make our schools not only better but safer we want to strengthen social security by locking away 100 percent social security revenues for social security we want to pay down the national debt and of course we want to continue working to lower taxes for the middle class and for working families this year as we work to lower taxes and to lower the tax burden for middleclass families i believe that the approach we should take is to adclress the unfairness in the tax code because when i listen to the folks back home whether in the union hall or the vfw a local chamber of commerce or at a coffee shop in my hometown down on liberty street people say that not only are their taxes too high they complain about the complexity and the unfairness of the tax code i believe this series of questions really illustrates a key area of unfairness that we should make a priority in this congress this year in getting the job done on eliminating this most unfair area of our tax code that is why i want to explain why enactment of the marriage tax elimination act is so important with the question of fairness do americans really feel that it is fair that under our tax code married working couples pay more in taxes just because they are married do americans feel that it is right that 21 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more under our tax code just because they are married 1 400 more than an identical couple with identical incomes who live together outside of marriage clearly i think the american people agree that the marriage tax penalty is wrong and we need to set it right the marriage tax is not only unfair it is wrong it is wrong that under our tax code you are punished for getting married as i noted earlier it affects 21 million married working couples on average 1 400 in higher taxes just because they are married let me give an example here of a couple in the south suburbs of chicago you have a case where a machinist and of course this particular machinist works at caterpillar in joliet he makes the heavy machinery that we use to mine and dig things and build things he makes 30 500 if he is single after the standard deductions and exemptions he is in the 15 percent tax bracket but under our tax code because two working people who choose to get married their incomes are combined and in fact you file your taxes jointly you are pushed into a higher tax bracket this example of this south suburban couple this machinist who meets and marries a schoolteacher in the joliet public schools with an identical income of 30 500 because under our tax code they combine their incomes and their combined income is 61 000 pushes them into the 28 percent tax bracket and because this machinist and this schoolteacher in joliet illinois in the south suburbs of chicago chose to get married they pay more in taxes that is just wrong of course i would like to point out that for this schoolteacher and this machinist in joliet 1 400 is real money 1 400 is one years tuition at joliet junior college our local community college and it is 3 months of day care at a local day care center we need to eliminate that marriage tax penalty it is wrong that under our tax code this machinist and schoolteacher end up paying higher taxes when they get married had they chose not to get married and just lived together their taxes would have been 1 400 less that is just wrong under the marriage tax elimination act we eliminate this marriage tax penalty for this machinist and this schoolteacher in fact we do it by doubling the standard deduction we also double the brackets so that joint filers can earn twice as much as a single filer and remain in each bracket had the marriage tax elimination act been law today this machinist and schoolteacher would have seen the marriage tax penalty eliminated what is the bottom line in just a couple of weeks this house of representatives will be working to pass the tax provisions for this years balanced budget the 3rd balanced budget in 30 years thanks to a republican congress i believe as we work to provide tax relief as part of this balanced budget our first priority should be making the tax code fairer for this schoolteacher and this machinist by working to eliminate the marriage tax penalty i am pretty proud of what we have accomplished in 1996 we created as part of the contract with america the 500 per child tax credit benefiting 3 million illinois children this year let us help married working couples let us help illinois families by eliminating the marriage tax penalty"], [0.003415387822315097,

americans i have often been asked whether i am at the steel workers hall in hegwish in the south side of chicago or the legion post in joliet or a chamber of commerce or the coffee shop called weits cafe in morris illinois my hometown or the local grain elevator a pretty fundamental question and that question is is it right is it fair that under our tax code 25 million married working couples on average pay 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married folks back home just do not understand why for almost 30 years we have had a marriage tax penalty which the average is 1 400 each for 25 million married working couples in the south suburbs in the south side of chicago 1 400 is real money it is a years tuition at a local community college for a nursing student it is 3 months of day care it is a washer and a dryer it is 4 000 diapers for a child we need to address the issue of fairness we need to address the issue to wipe out the marriage tax penalty suffered by 50 million married working people it is an issue of fairness here is how it works what causes the marriage tax penalty is when a couple decides to marry when they file their taxes they file jointly when they file their taxes jointly their combined income usually pushes them into a higher tax bracket let me introduce shad and michele hallihan two public school teachers from joliet illinois shad and michele have been married almost 2 years now they just had a baby a wonderful young couple but they suffer almost the average marriage tax penalty now shad and michele have a combined income of about 62 000 suppose that they have an equal income each making 31 000 michele here if she stayed single would be in the 15 percent tax bracket but because she and shad married their combined income of 62 000 pushes them into the 28 percent tax bracket creating well over almost the average marriage tax penalty of 1 400 we want to help couples like shad and michele michele pointed out to me that the average marriage tax penalty would buy almost 4 000 diapers for their newborn baby should not those couples like michele and shad be allowed to keep money keep their hardearned salary their hardearned income rather than paying a tax just because they are married we are working to address that and i was so pleased that this house of representatives overwhelmingly supported with a bipartisan vote 268 members of the house endorsed wiping out the marriage tax penalty in order to help couples such as michele and shad hallihan h r 6 the marriage tax elimination act passed this house as a standalone bill and addresses one issue the need to wipe out the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working couples if we look at who pays the marriage tax penalty one half of them itemize their taxes millions of middleclass families itemize because they own a home or give money to church or charity have education expenses well we wipe out the marriage tax penalty for those who itemize their taxes by widening the 15 percent tax bracket so that joint filers can earn twice as much as single filers and stay in the 15 percent tax bracket that will help shad and michele hallihan for those who do not itemize we double the standard deduction helping those who do not itemize by doubling the standard deduction to be twice that of single people we also help the working poor those who participate in the earned income credit by addressing the income eligibility eliminating the marriage penalty for the working poor as well it is a good bill it helps those who itemize it helps those who do not itemize the primary beneficiaries are those with incomes between 30 000 and 75 000 those who suffer the marriage tax penalty the most we do not raise taxes on anyone we wipe out the marriage tax penalty we help stayathome moms we help those who are homeowners eliminating the marriage tax penalty is a fundamental issue of fairness and that is what it is all about let us make our tax code more

the marriage tax penalty we have tremendous momentum and my hope is our friends in the senate will follow the lead of the house move quickly to move a standalone bill wiping out the marriage tax penalty not loaded up with amendments or extraneous riders or other poison pills my hope is that they will keep it a clean bill and that they will move expeditiously and as quickly as possible to wipe

again this week and that is is it right is it fair that under our tax code 25 million married working couples pay on average 1400 more in higher taxes just because they are married is it right is it fair that two people who joined together in holy matrimony who both happen to work are forced to pay higher taxes if they choose to get married today the only way to avoid the marriage tax penalty if both the husband and wife work in the workforce is either choose not to get married or to get divorced that is just wrong that 25 million married working couples 50 million americans pay higher taxes just because they are married it is wrong i believe and i know many in this house do believe that it is wrong that we punish societys most basic institution marriage with higher taxes that is just unfair let me introduce to my colleagues shad and michelle hallihan two public school teachers from joliet illinois shad and michelle chose to get married a couple of years ago they are both in the workforce they just had a child this past year a new baby they pay the average marriage tax penalty of 1400 they knew that going into getting married that they were going to pay more in taxes but they chose to still get married i believe it is wrong they pay 1400 more in higher taxes in joliet illinois which is a south suburban community southwest of chicago 1400 for shad and michelle hallihan the average marriage tax penalty is one years tuition at joliet junior college our local community college it is 3 months of day care for their child it is just wrong they have to pay more in taxes just because they are married now the marriage tax penalty comes into play when two people marry and they are both in the workforce and have two incomes because under our tax code they file jointly which means they combine their incomes so in the case of shad and michelle had they chose to stay single and just live together they would each file as singles and they would each pay in the 15 percent tax bracket but because they chose to get married their combined income pushes them into the 28 percent tax bracket so they get stuck with a higher tax bill just because they chose to get married now we believe in this house and it is clearly one of the top agenda items for house republicans that we should bring about some tax fairness by eliminating the marriage tax penalty i am proud that earlier this year every house republican and 48 democrats who broke with their leadership voted to wipe out the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working couples unfortunately senator daschle and the senate democrats used parliamentary procedures to block action on that legislation and we have now had to go through the budget process or socalled reconciliation which is a word few people know the meaning of but it allows us to bring up a bill with a simple majority vote with that ability this week both the house and senate are going to be voting on legislation which will wipe out the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working couples now some on the other side and al gore and a few others say well lets give just a little bit of marriage tax relief so we can say we are for it al gore says we should only give marriage tax relief to those who do not itemize their taxes those who use the standard deduction well we want to help those who do itemize as well as those who do not itemize if you think about it most middleclass families most middleclass couples itemize their taxes because they are homeowners think about that if you are a homeowner those who oppose the bill we are going to be passing this week because they do not want to help homeowners and they do not want to help those who itemize taxes because they say they are rich only rich people own homes today according to al gore and other people well the bottom line is the only way we can help shad and michelle hallihan is if we pass the legislation we are going to pass this week legislation that doubles the standard deduction for joint filers to twice that of singles so we wipe out the marriage tax penalty for those who do not itemize and then for those who do itemize such as homeowners or those who take the charitable deduction because they give to their institutions of faith or charity we also widen the 15 percent bracket to twice that for joint filers to twice that of singles that will eliminate essentially the marriage tax penalty for shad and michelle hallihan think about it if we eliminate the marriage tax penalty which we are going to vote this week to do for 25 million married working couples 50 million americans people like shad and michelle will have that extra 1 400 to take care of their child that is 3 months of daycare it is a years tuition at joliet junior college if

prescription drugs for our seniors we are paying off the national debt with a plan we have adopted by the year 2013 already paying down the debt by 350 billion and we are also working to make our tax code more fair particularly more fair for working and middle class families we have often asked in this house many of us a pretty basic fundamental question that is is it right is it fair that under our tax code married working couples pay higher taxes because they are married do we think it is right that 25 million married working couples on average pay 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married compared to identical couples with identical incomes who live together outside of marriage that is wrong we are fortunate that in february this house passed legislation with overwhelming bipartisan support legislation that was initiated by myself and the gentleman from indiana and the gentlewoman from missouri a democrat a bipartisan bill that had 233 cosponsors it passed this house in february with the support not only of every house republican but 48 democrats broke ranks with their leadership and voted to eliminate the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working couples unfortunately in the senate the democratic leadership has used every parliamentary procedure possible to block this legislation we are now forced to move through the reconciliation process so that the majority can rule in the senate the bottom line is we want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty it is wrong it is unfair let me introduce shad and michelle hallihan this is a photo of them when we introduced the bill a yearandahalf ago to wipe out the marriage tax penalty shad and michelle are two joliet township high school teachers they suffer the marriage tax penalty because they are both in the workforce and of course the marriage tax penalty of 1 400 that they suffer is a lot of money in joliet illinois the south suburbs of chicago 1 400 for michelle and shad hallihan that is a years tuition at our local community college joliet junior college which is our nations oldest it is also 3 months of day care for a child that is why i think it is important to introduce a new photo of shad and miohelle hallihan since they were married at the time that we introduced the legislation they have since had a baby and if al gore and my friends on the other side of the aisle had their way the child will probably be grown and out of college by the time we eliminate the marriage tax penalty shad and michelle have a little boy by the name of ben little ben has brought a lot of joy to their life but because of the marriage tax penalty there is 1 400 that goes out of the pocketbooks of shad and michelle and comes to washington money that they can use to take care of little ben and 1 400 that is about 3 000 diapers that is a lot of diapers for little ben over 18 years that 1 400 a year if they just set that full amount in a college fund that is over 25 000 that shad and michelle can invest in little ben and little bens future for college so the marriage tax penalty is real money for real people shad and michelle the way they suffer the marriage tax penalty is the marriage tax penalty occurs when you have a husband and wife who are both in the workforce they combine their income when they are married file jointly and when they combine their income that means they are pushed into a higher tax bracket if shad and michelle had chosen to stay single and just live together they each because of their income would file in the 15 percent tax bracket but they chose to participate in the most basic institution in our society which is marriage and shad and michelle because they are married now pay in the 28 percent tax bracket they suffer the marriage tax penalty we believe it is wrong we want to help michelle and shad hallihan as well as little ben to make sure he has a future and they have the resources for this under our bipartisan proposal we do several things we help those who do not itemize their taxes by doubling the standard deduction for joint filers at twice that of singles and that helps about 9 million couples of those who suffer the marriage tax penalty those are the nonitemizers well the rest subtracting 9 from 25 that leaves 18 million couples who itemize their taxes who suffer the marriage tax penalty and they are people who are average folks middle class but they probably own a house so if you own a home you probably itemize your taxes and the only way you can receive marriage tax relief is if we provide marriage tax relief as part of our proposal we do that by widening the most basic bracket the 15 percent bracket so you can earn twice as much in the 15 percent bracket if you are a joint filer as a single person and that is how we help michelle and shad hallihan as well as little ben prepare for his future by widening the 15 percent bracket i would also point out in our legislation that we provide marriage tax relief for those who participate in the earned income tax credit ensuring that they also participate and receive marriage tax relief we also protect those who use the child tax credit for the alternative minimum tax so we help both itemizers as well as nonitemizers poor working families and protect those from the amt i believe we need to eliminate the marriage tax penalty i want to thank my friends on the other side of the aisle particularly the 48 who joined with us and i invite more democrats to join with us in our effort to eliminate the marriage tax penalty i would point out that under the democratic proposal michelle and shad hallihan would not receive any relief if one itemizes their taxes they would receive no relief under the democratic proposal if one is a homeowner and middle class and itemize your taxes you receive no marriage tax relief under the democratic proposal democrats say they do not want to help special interests so i guess they say if you are middle class and you own a home and you itemize your taxes you are stuck and you are still going to suffer the marriage tax penalty we have a bipartisan proposal that helps those who itemize primarily homeowners we help those who do not itemize we help those on earned income tax credit and we help those who may suffer the alternative minimum tax it is a good bipartisan proposal i urge adoption of this rule and i invite strong bipartisan support of our effort to eliminate the marriage tax penalty"], [0.0035352830309420824, 0.0035352830309420824, 0, "i thought i would take a few minutes to kind of report on what the last couple weeks were like when i was back home spending time with my constituents during the district work period conducting 15 town meetings and i wanted to report today on really the response to the republican agenda of good schools and low taxes and a secure retirement for all americans i have the privilege of representing a very very diverse district the south side of chicago in the south suburbs of cook and will counties as well as a lot of rural and bedroom communities and one always listens for the common concerns when they represent a diverse district of cities suburbs and country during the last two weeks i got a pretty good response people were very supportive of the republican agenda of strengthening our local schools of lowering the tax burden for the middle class of making for a secure retirement for all americans by strengthening medicare and social security i would like to take a few minutes just to talk about some of those specifics of our republican agenda and of course let me begin with the republican efforts to strengthen social security and to strengthen medicare for the next three generations i am often asked a common question over the last several years that i have had the privilege of being in the congress and that question is when are you politicians in washington going to stop raiding the social security trust fund i was pleased to tell my constituents that this is the year we are going to do that this is the year we are going to wall off the social security trust fund and say hands off and my constituents frankly were pretty shocked when they learned that the clintongore budget actually raids the social security trust fund by 351 billion i think it is important to note that when we compare republican efforts to wall off the social security trust fund which means 100 percent of social security according to this chart for social security versus the clintongore proposal for 62 percent of the social security trust fund going to social security and the other 38 percent being spent on other things that is what this means the president wants to spend 38 percent of social security on new government programs republicans of course want to wall off the social security trust fund essentially putting trust back in the trust fund with 100 percent of social security for social security and that is a big victory i also want to note that the republican budget sets aside almost 400 billion more than the clintongore budget for medicare and social security now our second priority in our agenda of course is lower taxes for the middle class and i am one who believes that when the tax burden for the average family in illinois is about 40 percent of their income going to local state and federal government for taxes that that tax burden is too high and we need to lower the tax burden particularly for the middle class and when we talk about the tax burden i find that constituents whether it is at the union hall or the vfw or the local chamber of commerce they tell me that the tax code is too complicated requires too much paperwork and the majority of people have to hire someone else to fill out the tax forms and i also point out that the tax burden is really unfair as we work this year to lower the tax burden i believe that our top priority should be to simplify the tax code to address the unfairness in the tax code and of course we need to begin by eliminating the marriage tax penalty is it right is it fair that 21 million married working couples on average pay 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married 1 400 more than an identical couple living together outside a marriage that is wrong that our tax code punishes marriage the marriage tax elimination act has 230 cosponsors let us get it done this year let us simplify the tax code and eliminate the marriage tax penalty of course the republican agenda a secure retirement and lower taxes also includes strengthening our local schools and we want to strengthen our local schools by empowering our local school boards and our local teachers and our local parents to run their schools and giving them the flexibility of course to meet the needs of local communities and that is an important shift because previously for 30 to 40 years all the power was moving to washington and i talk with local school administrators and school board members they tell me maybe in illinois 6 percent of our public schools budget comes from washington but so does twothirds of the paperwork and almost 100 percent of the mandates micromanaging how our schools are run we want to let local schools run themselves and meet the needs of their local communities and that is why we want to pass the ed flex legislation my hope it will be on the presidents desk fairly soon the other concern that local school board members also share with me is they say as my colleagues know youve increased funding at the federal level by 10 percent even while youve been balancing the budget increasing funding for education but if you look at how those dollars have been spent only 70 cents of every dollar actually reaches the classroom thirty cents is lost in the washington bureaucracy our goal is to ensure that more dollars get to the classroom with a goal of 95 cents on the dollar reaching the classroom and if we compare that to the current cost of delivering those funds to our looal schools that is a 25 percent funding increase above and beyond what they are currently receiving we are providing 22 billion in federal funding for our local schools it is just wrong that 30 cents on the dollar currently is lost in washington let us help our local schools let us lower the tax burden for the middle class let us secure retirement by strengthening medicare and social security"], [0.003646181197836995, 0.003646181197836995, 0, "i have the privilege of representing the south side of chicago and the

million married working couples on average pay 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married my colleagues the folks back home whether they live in the city the suburbs or the country have all told me that they think it is just wrong that under our tax code 25 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more just because they are married they think it is wrong and they want congress and the president to do something about it let me introduce shad and michelle hallihan two public school teachers from joliet illinois shad and michelle chose to get married a couple of years ago they just had a little baby just a couple of months ago but shad and michelle are a typical example of the 1 1 million illinois married couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty now if shad and michelle stayed single and decided just to live together they would avoid the marriage tax penalty because the marriage tax penalty results when two people get married and they file jointly so for example shad and michelle have identical incomes of 31 000 michelle is making 31 000 a year under our tax code if she is single she pays at a 15 percent tax bracket but when she and shad chose to get married and suppose that shad has an identical income of 31 000 remember he is in the 15 percent tax bracket as well but when they get married they file jointly and their combined income pushes them into the 28 percent tax bracket so they are now paying a 28 percent tax rate on that same income is that right of course not it is time that we do something about the marriage tax penalty i am proud that this house this past week last thursday voted to wipe out the marriage tax penalty with the passage of h r 6 legislation that wipes out essentially the marriage tax penalty suffered by shad and michelle hallihan as well as 25 million other married working couples who are punished just for getting married under our tax code h r 6 passed this house with an overwhelming bipartisan vote every house republican and 48 democrats bucked their leadership and voted to wipe out the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working couples that is a big momentum of course our hope is the senate will follow our lead one thing that i am so proud of our leader the leader of this house the gentleman from illinois the house speaker i thought made a very smart decision he made a decision to allow h r 6 to come to the floor as a standalone bill a bill that only deals with one subject a clean bill that wipes out the marriage tax penalty and that is all it does no extraneous issues remember when the president and al gore vetoed our effort to wipe out the marriage tax penalty last year it was part of a package taxrelated legislation and unfortunately they used the other provisions as an excuse to wipe out our efforts to eliminate the marriage tax penalty my colleagues we have a great opportunity and my hope is the senate will follow our lead and move quickly to move h r 6 the marriage tax elimination act through the senate as a standalone bill no extraneous provisions no riders no poison pills we need to keep it bipartisan let us keep partisan politics out of our efforts to wipe out the marriage tax penalty over the next few weeks 25 million married working couples like shad and michelle hallihan are going to be back home watching to see if congress and the president do something about the most unfair aspect of our complicated tax code and that is the marriage tax penalty we have a great opportunity and it is all about fairness is it right is it fair that under our tax code 25 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more just because they are married twentyfive million couples just like shad and michelle hallihan let us wipe out the marriage tax penalty the

committee on ways and means and others to talk about taxes a topic that is on a lot of americans minds right now it is a bottom line issue for families and businesses in my district and around the country as we draw close to tax filing deadline tax season is in a sense a time for renewed focus and that focus i think ought to be on two things first is the fact that taxes are too high and second the fact that our tax code is far too complex this afternoon we are going to focus a little on what this congress has done and what it is trying to do to address these problems through real tax relief through tax simplification and through tax reform there are a lot of different ideas out there a lot of good ideas and i think we will hear a little about them this afternoon i would like to start by stepping back a few years back when i was first elected to congress which was 1993 just before i was elected congress then run by the other party on the other side of the aisle passed the largest tax increase in american history in fact vice president al gore had to go to the senate to break the tie vote in order for that to pass we have to look at the changes that have happened since then in a relatively short period of time it has been 6 or 7 years and we have made some progress instead of the tax increases that did mark those first years of the clintongore administration we have had some tax relief we have held the line on taxes and also we have been able to put through some good proposals one is the child tax credit a 500 per child tax credit to help families make ends meet we have gotten that signed into law we have also eliminated the unfair capital gains that people paid when they sold their homes this is both tax relief and tax simplification no longer do people have to keep records of every home improvement they make to make sure they can reduce their capital gains this is the kind of legislation congress ought to be passing we have also developed and we got it enacted into law legislation that dramatically reforms and overhauls the internal revenue service that happened in 1998 it was the first time we had had major reform of the irs in 46 years it expanded taxpayer rights adding 52 new taxpayer rights it improves taxpayer services and brings the second largest agency in the federal government into the information technology age we have still got a lot of work to do with the irs but at least now they are on a track towards real reform and reorganization just last year we attempted to follow through on these successes by passing legislation in this house that attempted to return a substantial portion of the nonsocial security tax surplus not the surplus that goes into social security and medicare but the general revenues surplus we tried to pass a substantial amount of that back to the taxpayers who after all earned every dime of it we did it because we believe that taxes are too high that tax relief is appropriate as we build up these big surpluses but also because we think the tax code is unfair yes we provided tax relief across the board tax relief to millions of americans but we also went into the tax code and found out what is not working for instance there is an unfair penalizing of marriage today the marriage penalty is something we addressed in our tax legislation we did this because we believe that families ought to be encouraged and we ought not to have a higher tax just because someone gets married on average it is 1400 per couple in this country we also do not believe in taxation without representation which is why we believe the unfair death tax ought to be repealed and we passed that in this house we also passed education tax relief we passed health care tax relief we passed tax relief for those who want to save and invest in our economy and finally yes we passed tax relief in the area of expanding 401 k s iras and other pension vehicles to allow people to save more taxfree money for their own retirement these are very important measures that will help millions of americans keep more of their hardearned money for their own needs and for their families needs rather than relying on the government unfortunately president clinton chose to veto that tax legislation last year this year we are back again congress has continued the fight to give taxpayers in this country a break we have already passed in the last month here in congress tax relief again focusing on the marriage penalty to get rid of this unfair penalty on marriage we have also passed our retirement security reforms again to expand 401 k coverage for every american and we have also passed some estate tax relief as part of the small business tax package we passed a few weeks ago again these are part of our effort not only to return a substantial part of that nonsocial security surplus back to the people who earned it but also to make the tax code work better to make it fairer to correct some of the basic flaws we see in our tax code ultimately of course we need to take steps to fundamentally simplify and reform the tax code the current income tax code and its associated regulations now contain 5 6 million words seven times as many words as the bible and it is not nearly as interesting taxpayers now spend about 5 4 billion hours a year trying to comply with the 2 500 pages in the tax code and the 6 500 pages of tax rules and 8 billion pages of tax forms the cost of complying with the federal income tax in this country is now believed to be in excess of 200 billion a year that is more than 25 percent of the revenue of all the taxes collected what a waste of money and it hurts the economy it hurts job growth it hurts investment and it means less economic opportunity for all of us i learned firsthand from spending a couple of years working intensively on irs reform just how many problems our tax code causes not just for taxpayers which is evident to many of us as taxpayers but also for the irs itself it is very difficult to have an irs that works well given the complexity of the tax code it makes the irs bigger and more intrusive than any of us would like it to be and it makes the irs more costly and less efficient than it could be with real tax reform that is why for example the new irs reform law does contain some long overdue tax simplification encouragement these measures are designed to force congress prospectively with new tax legislation to come up with simpler ways to achieve the same results there is now a tax complexity analysis that every new piece of legislation has to go through as it works its way through congress it will help members of congress consider for the first time the additional complexity caused by what might be otherwise good sound and wellintentioned tax legislation so tax relief and tax simplification and reform to correct the problems with the current code are very important steps we can and should take together but it is time for us to take that next step to replace the current tax code with something that is simpler fairer and less intrusive for all americans again there are a lot of good ideas out there for doing that we will hear about some tonight some have proposed a flat tax on income others have proposed a fairer tax a national sales tax in place of an income tax other proposals out there as well are a value added tax or more selective simplification of major parts of our current tax code we need to get the public attention focused on this need for fundamental tax reform and to encourage that the committee on ways and means here in the house of representatives next week will host the first ever congressional tax reform summit it will be an opportunity for all the members of congress and the public to come forward and to talk about tax reform issues and to examine the range of alternatives to our current tax system for the past few years we have come to the floor close to april 15 with another interesting piece of legislation it is called the sunset the code bill it eliminates the current tax code by a date certain forcing congress and the administration to work together in that interim period to come up with an alternative that legislation has passed the house in the past i hope it will pass the house again this year it has never been enacted into law of course because it has not gotten through the process or signed by the president but next week we will try that again this time under the leadership of our colleague the gentleman from oklahoma we are going to try to bring a new sunset the code bill to the floor that will in addition to sunsetting the code establish a new bipartisan bicameral the house and the senate congressionalpresidential meaning the house and the senate and the administration tax reform commission this commission is going to have a very simple task which is to make recommendations to congress for fundamental tax reform and simplification the commission is modeled on the national commission for restructuring the irs that i headed up with senator bob kerrey i know commissions have a checkered past in this town and it is easy to give problems to a commission and hope they go away but some commissions do work the irs commission worked because it forced congress to tackle that reform and to clean up the irs that is the hope here in having a nonpartisan panel to look at this very complicated very contentious issue study the issue bring some expertise to bear and try to take the politics out of the process and lay the foundation here in congress for some very needed and important changes to our tax code the commission will have 15 members three appointed by the president four each appointed by the senate majority leader and the speaker and two each appointed by the house and senate minority leaders the important thing is most members in this commission will be from outside congress from outside the federal bureaucracy they will be members on the commission from around the country with expertise to bring to bear there will be one member from the house that will be a republican and one member from the house that will be a democrat same on the senate one democrat one republican but again most members will be people from the outside who can bring expertise in a nonpartisan approach to this important problem the commission will have a short timetable 18 months to complete its work and make a report to congress again on ways to fundamentally simplify and reform fundamentally reform the tax code i would like to urge my colleagues listening tonight to support this effort and to vote for that legislation next week that is so important to move us from our current broken system to one that meets all our needs better the tax season is a frustrating time of year for so many americans many of us are doing our taxes now the amount of taxes we have to pay the complexity and basic unfairness of the tax code makes a lot of us wonder if there is not a better way there has got to be a better way and congress has heard those concerns we are committed to changing the status quo let us start with meaningful tax relief and simplification where we can this year but let us go beyond let us also lay the foundation for the kind of longterm reforms that will give all americans a fairer a simpler and a less intrusive tax code with that i would like to yield back my time with the understanding that my friend the gentleman from pennsylvania a distinguished member of the committee on ways and means along

in this well of the house over the last several years and that is a pretty basic fundamental question that is is it right is it fair that under our tax code married working couples pay more in taxes than an identical couple in an identical situation living together outside of marriage it is just wrong that under our tax code 28 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married is it right that under our tax code that couples are punished that they are penalized when they choose to participate in societys most basic institution that is the fact today i represent a diverse district on the south side of chicago in the south suburbs in cook and will counties in joliet and the bedroom and farm communities they all ask the same question they wonder why for 30 years now washington has punished marriage and no one has gone back to fix it i am pleased that under the leadership of the speaker of the house the gentleman from illinois this house has made it a top priority to eliminate and wipe out the marriage tax penalty suffered by 28 million married working couples the speaker has said that the elimination of the marriage tax penalty will be fast out of the box and on a fast track through the senate and to the president wiping out the marriage tax penalty and stopping the tax code from punishing marriage the marriage tax penalty really results from our very complicated tax code and unfortunately because we have a progressive tax code if couples get married they getpunished that is just wrong here is how the marriage tax penalty works here is how it ends up say there is a machinist and a school teacher in joliet illinois a machinist who works at caterpillar at the local plant the machinist makes that heavy equipment the big bulldozers and cranes and earthmoving equipment he makes 31 500 a year if he is single he pays taxes in the 15 percent tax bracket now if he meets a tenured public school teacher in the joliet public school system with an identical income as long as she is single she pays in the 15 percent tax bracket but if this school teacher and machinist choose to get married when they are married they file jointly and add together their income what happens then is their combined income is 63 000 and that pushes them into the 28 percent tax bracket and they are punished with an almost 1 400 marriage tax penalty if they chose to stay single and live together outside of marriage they would avoid that marriage tax penalty in this case because this machinist and school teacher chose to live in holy matrimony societys most basic institution they are punished under our tax code i find most americans whether they live in the city or the suburbs or the country think it is just wrong and they want congress and the president to do something about it that is why i am so pleased because i have a another couple from joliet illinois two public school teachers shad and michelle hallihan they came and told me they suffered a marriage tax penalty of 1 000 they just had a baby michelle told me congressman tell your colleagues in the congress that 1 000 average in marriage tax penalty is 3 000 diapers of course they point out that 1 400 the average marriage tax penalty is one years tuition in the local community college well house republicans are going to do something about this we are going to work to eliminate the marriage tax penalty and the speaker has put it on a fast track this wednesday tomorrow the house committee on ways and means will have committee action on legislation that will essentially wipe out the marriage tax penalty for a majority of those who suffer it we double the standard deduction for joint filers to twice that of singles which will not only help 3 million couples who will no longer have to itemize 9h91 printed on recycled paper their taxes but will essentially wipe out their marriage tax penalty for those who do not itemize of course many homeowners itemize in order to help homeowners and those who itemize from suffering the marriage tax penalty we widen the 15 percent bracket so that joint filers can earn twice as much as single filers and still pay in the 15 percent bracket and for lowincome families who benefit from the earned income tax credit we also provide marriage tax relief for poor families and lowincome families who suffer from the marriage tax penalty it is good commonsense legislation and deserves overwhelming bipartisan support there is no excuse to vote against legislation wiping out the marriage tax penalty the speaker of the house has also indicated that by valentines day that we are going to pass this through to help couples like shad and michelle hallihan who suffer the marriage tax penalty and what better valentines day gift to give 28 million married working couples than legislation which will eliminate the marriage tax penalty think in these terms 1 400 is a drop in the bucket here in washington it is chump change for the washington bureaucrats and the big spenders here in washington but back home in illinois a 1 400 marriage tax penalty is one years tuition at a local community college 3 months of day care for shad and michelle for their child it is several months worth of car payments it is most of the contribution to an ira for michelle it is real money for real people house republicans are making it a priority we invite the democrats to join with us let us make it a bipartisan effort to eliminate the marriage tax penalty what better valentines day gift to give 28 million married working couples i urge my colleagues to pass the legislation with bipartisan support and send it to the senate and send it on the president i rise today to highlight what is arguably the most unfair provision in the unitedstates tax code the marriage tax penalty i want to thank you for your long term interest in bringing parity to the tax burden imposed on working married couples compared to a couple living together outside of marriage this month president clinton gave his state of the union address outlining many of the things he will spend the budget surplus on house republicans want to preserve 100 of the social security surplus for social security and medicare and use the nonsocial security surplus for paying down the debt and to bring fairness to the taxcode a surplus provided by the bipartisan budget agreement which cut waste put americas fiscal house in order and held washingtons feet to the fire to balance the budget while president clinton parades a long list of new spending totaling 72 billion in new programswe believe that a top priority after saving social security and paying down thenational debt should be returning the budget surplus to americas families as additional middleclass tax relief this congress has given more tax relief to the middle class and working poor than any congress of the last half century i think the issue of the marriage penalty can best be framed by asking these questions do americans feel its fair that our tax code imposes a higher tax penalty on marriage do americans feel its fair that the average married working couple pays almost 1 400 more in taxes than a couple with almost idential income living together outside of marriage is it right that our tax code provides an incentive to get divorced in fact today the only form one can file to avoid the marriage tax penalty is paperwork for divorce and that is just wrong since 1969 our tax laws have punished married couples when both spouses work for no other reason than the decision to be joined in holy matrimony more than 21 million couples a year are penalized they pay more in taxes than they would if they were single not only is the marriage penalty unfair its wrong that our tax code punishes societys most basic institution the marriage tax penalty exacts a disproportionate toll on working women and lower income couples with children in many cases it is a working womens issue let me give you an example of how the marriage tax penalty unfairly affects middle class married working couples forexample a machinist at a caterpillar manufacturing plant in my home

from indiana and the gentleman from delaware it is a bipartisan bill aimed at giving greater flexibility to local schools to do their job the important job they do of educating our children during the past couple of months i have visited 10 or 12 schools in my district and visited the school districts there to sort of find out what they think of the federal role in education the federal role in education usually accounts for about 4 to 8 percent of the budgets of the average school district and i wanted to know if they thought that was helping the answer i got back was yes the money helps but there is too much red tape and there is too much regulation they want greater freedom so that they can exercise their skills and use the teachers and principals and parents and everybody involved in education on the local level there is too much federal red tape and the education flexibility act would target that red tape right now we have a pilot project that allows some 12 states in the country to take advantage of education flexibility this bill would expand it to all 50 states and what it would do is give local school districts the ability to get waivers from those federal regulations but the important thing about education flexibility is that it combines flexibility with accountability which is the way it ought to be done you can get the waiver the local school districts can get the waiver from the federal requirements but only if they have local standards that they can demonstrate that they are meeting the key word in there is local not national standards they can have their own standards but they have to have that accountability flexibility mix the education flexibility act that is being proposed and introduced this week offers that mix and is a key to helping our schools move forward with the important job they do of reforming the education system and educating our children i think it is very important that we go further than the education flexibility act right now there is far too much red tape and far too many regulations in hundreds of different areas generated from the federal government that does not really help our local schools but only ties them in knots i do not want the people working in the schools in my community to spend all of their time filling out forms and justifying their existence to the federal government i want them to be educating the children there and doing the job that really matters right now far too often they are filling out the forms and trying to qualify for the money and continually justifying what they axe doing we need to change that we need to shift to local control from one end of this country to the other exciting things are going on in states and school districts they are making the reforms necessary they are moving towards accountability and right now the federal government is too big of a noose stopping them from making progress on that we need to make changes like the education flexibility act as a democrat i have always been a strong supporter of education and i support my fellow democrats in supporting spending the money necessary to help with education and supporting public education public education is responsible for over 90 percent of the children in this country getting educated it needs our support but we cannot simply spend money on it we must show that we are willing to move in two other critical directions one is accountability and the other is flexibility which means local control giving the power back to the individual school districts and the individual schools and ultimately to the teachers and parents who are closest to the product closest to our children and closest to educating them and who know best how to do it we need to make those changes so that we can have the world class public education system we need the education flexibility act that we introduce this week as i mentioned primarily sponsored by the gentleman from indiana and the gentleman from delaware is a critical step i urge all of my colleagues to support edflex pass it as soon as possible and then go further to encourage the flexibility and

death rates among advanced nations in 1997 4 000 americans died and 24 000 were injured in fires moreover the approximately 2 million fires reported each year result in direct property losses estimated well over 8 billion with total direct and indirect costs reaching 100 billion annually the bill before the house seeks to reinvigorate the efforts of the fire administration i am pleased that it endorses the presidents fiscal year 2000 proposal for a 40 percent funding increase and provides an additional 7 percent increase in the second year although these increases will raise the fire budget nearly 50 million it still pales compared to the scale of activity originally contemplated for the agency the landmark report america burning which was the genesis for the 1974 act recommended an initial budget for the fire administration of 124 million in 1974 dollars h r 1550 is a good start for providing the level of resources the fire administration needs to carry out its important mission in addition to resources the bill provides for the agency to develop a management plan and establish the program priorities that will help to ensure the increased resources are used to maximize effect h r 1550 will enable the fire administration to increase support for its critical responsibility of firefighter training through the national fire academy moreover the budget growth will enable the agency to reverse the steep decline in support for fire research and for public education programs greater research is absolutely necessary so that we can help prevent firefighter injury and death nationally including those that claimed the lives of three firefighters from the dallasfort worth area earlier this year regarding public education the fire administration must enlarge and improve its efforts to reduce losses for the population groups most at risk from fire death and injury we know that the elderly the very young and the poor are most vulnerable i included language in the report accompanying the bill tasking the fire administration to carefully assess whether research and additional data collection activities could improve understanding of the factors that lead to increased fire risk effective targeted fire prevention campaigns can be developed only from a sound base of knowledge also i asked the fire administration to look into the current use of security bars which are often called burglary bars these devices offer protection from criminals but can become fire traps in the event of fire as has recently been the case in texas and other states the fire administration could help prevent such tragedies by disseminating information about ways to install the security bars properly that also will allow for easy departure from a building in a fire emergency in addition to funding authorizations h r 1550 establishes the requirement for a 5year program plan for the agency this plan will constitute the formal documentation of fire administrations response to the recommendations of the blue ribbon panel convened last year by fema director witt to review the agencys management and programs i am particularly concerned about the recent decision the fema director made to create the position of chief operating officer for the fire administration the incumbent for this position a civil service employee would report directly to the fema director but assist rather than report to the administrator i understand the reasons that led to the creation of this new position and generally support the position the problem lies in the tangling of lines of authority within the fire administration and confusing the roles of two officials this arrangement in my view will create confusion in the line of authority within the fire administration that maybe harmful to the functioning of the agency i believe the fire administrator is committed to carrying out reforms at the agency consistent with the blue ribbon panels recommendations i will be following this situation closely to be sure the fire administrator plays an important role in developing and implementing the fema directors final respbfige to the blue ribbon panel report one part of the process required by h r 1550 for developing the 5year will include consultation with the national institute of standards and technology and the fire service organizations to establish a prioritized set of research goals i am particularly interested in seeing that this research prioritization places adequate emphasis on development of firefighter protection equipment firefighters put their lives on the line every day it is only right they have the equipment that will allow them to do their jobs effectively and as safely as possible h r 1550 is a useful bill that comes to the floor with bipartisan support and that authorizes programs that advance public safety i am pleased to recommend the measure to my colleagues for their approval i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.983218178153038, 0.016781821846961975, 1, "i rise today to urge fiscal discipline and fiscal responsibility as we work on the budget for the next fiscal year back in the 1980s when we were running up our yearly deficits and consequently our overall federal debt there was a phrase that politicians used to utter in dealing with the problem which was the balanced budget has no constituency which is to say that when you spend money or cut taxes there is somebody or some group of somebodies who are going to be happy about it it has a constituency that you can please who benefits from the balanced budget who specifically well obviously the entire public both present and future of our nation benefits from it but in purely political terms those folks in the 1980s and 1990s had a point the constituencies were definitely more well defined for all of the programs and tax cuts that were being proposed and passed i just stand up today to say that fiscal discipline and fiscal responsibility should still be a priority since i have been elected to congress a lot of folks have been talking to me about what it means to be a congressman how can in essence you prove that you have done a good job i talk a lot about my emphasis on fiscal responsibility and balancing the budget and there tends to be this look like well thats just not good enough as they like to say you have to have something to bring home something to put your name on whether it is a new bridge a new bus stop in your district a new swimming pool you name it something that you went back there and fought for federal money to bring home i understand that in fact i will say that many if not most of all of these programs are indeed worthwhile spending money on all of those things will help the district help the state help the future of the country but we also have to remember that we need to be fiscally responsible because a couple of reasons first of all in the future folks are going to need all of those things as well and if we spend all their money now they are not going to have them and second of all when you run debt up too high you drag down the economy drive up interest rates and create job loss which makes it even more necessary to spend federal money and it becomes a downward spiral what i want people to recognize is that being fiscally responsible and paying down the debt does have a constituency that is the legacy that i want to leave in my district i think that is something to bring home to go back to the people of the ninth district of the state of washington or any other district in the country and say yes maybe i didnt fight for every last federal dollar but i fought to balance the budget for your benefit your childrens benefit and their childrens benefit i think all politicians on both sides of the aisle should have the courage and stand up for that as we head towards this years budget there is going to be a major battle there is incredible pressure to spend money or cut taxes in thousands of different places the thing about it is these programs do have some value as i have often said i wish just once in my time as a public official somebody would walk into my office and say weve got this plan to spend 5 million on fillintheblank and i could honestly look at that person and say thats just a complete waste of money that doesnt do any good for anybody and theres no way were going to do it of course when you spend money there is always an argument that it is helping people and it does but you have to look at the long term as well if we spend all the money now we will be forfeiting and mortgaging our childrens future and that is not fair at this particular time it is particularly frustrating because we have a strong economy we have unemployment of just over 4 percent we have inflation of below 2 percent we have a strong economy so that we do not have to spend as much money the economy is taking care of people the government does not have to do as much now is the time to be fiscally responsible because if we do not do it now a few years from now when the business cycle turns on us it is going to be a thousand times more difficult because people are going to need those programs and that help or that tax cut even more now is the time to be fiscally responsible balance the budget and give something back to our future i think all politicians in this body should be proud to go back to their district and say dont judge me by whether or not i brought you back a highway or a bridge or some other federal program judge me by the fact that i had the foresight and the discipline to balance the budget and take care of our economy for today and tomorrow that is what i think we should be doing back here in congress despite the overwhelming pressure to spend money spend it fine the federal government spends a lot of money 1 7 trillion no reason we cannot spend it within our means no reason we cannot be fiscally responsible and balance the budget i urge that we do that as soon as possible and remember that discipline when we go into the budget battles that lie ahead this year"],

horrible problem we have a serious problem in this country because the demand for organs is much greater than the supply and there are essentially two ways to deal with that problem one is for those areas of the country that feel that they do not have enough organs to essentially raid other parts of the country and try to grab those organs the second option and the option that i strongly prefer and i will have an amendment later addressing this is to be aggressive and work together to increase the supply of organs the problem with the departments rule is that it defies the laws of economics it assumes that economics is not involved in this fight when the reality is economics is at the core of this fight these are hospitals these are businesses big businesses that are fighting over organs because organs unfortunately in this context equate with money so there are situations like my state of wisconsin that will see an essentially 30 percent drop in the number of organs available to them and my neighboring state of illinois seeing a 30 percent increase now chicago is 100 miles from milwaukee and it would not be that difficult for these patients to come to milwaukee but instead of trying to work together what we see is we see from wisconsins perspective a raid a raid on the fine job that we have done in wisconsin to try to encourage more people to donate their organs it defies logic to state that those areas of this country that have done a very good job including my home state of wisconsin in developing an organ procurement network are going to continue working as hard as they have if they are going to see those organs leave the state we have to recognize some basic tenets of human nature and one of those is if one is allowed to keep the fruits of their labor they are going to work harder if the fruits of their labor are going to be sent to another part of this country that increases the chances that they will not work as hard so i think that this bill again is an

say a few words add a few words to what our chairman the gentleman from wisconsin has said in support of the conference report the report of course provides a 3year authorization for the national aeronautics and space administration specifically it provides a total authorization of 42 4 billion over the period starting in fiscal year 2000 through fiscal year 2002 including the authorization of 14 184 billion for fiscal year 2001 and 14 62 billion for fiscal year while i feel like i may be as conservative maybe as some of the other guys around here in the house i still believe and i think we are on solid ground when we invest in nasa i think it is the right thing to do and i think especially it is the right thing to do now that we finally balanced the federal budget and that we are in for some years of surplus years within those overall spending levels the conference report fully funds nasas major programs in both fiscal year 2001 and fiscal year 2002 including the international space station and the space shuttle as part of the space shuttle authorization funding is provided for needed safety and reliability upgrades to the shuttle all of the other accounts are also funded at or above the levels requested by the administration including the space launch initiative an initiative that is intended to dramatically reduce the cost of getting payloads into orbit an area of research that i am personally interested in is life science and microgravity research i am very pleased that the conference report increased funding for this important research research that has already benefited our citizens here on earth in many ways and i am convinced that we will see even more significant ventures and more safe returns on our investment in that research once the space station is operational among the areas receiving increases are nasas educational programs in particular funding for the space grant program have been increased to 28 million in both fiscal year 2001 and fiscal year 2002 that is an increase of almost 9 million over what the president had requested for fiscal year 2001 in addition to other very good features of this bill in addition to the authorization levels the conference report for h r 1654 includes a number of policy provisions one of the policy provisions namely section 313 on innovative technologies for human space flight was proposed by our former chairman and my good friend the late george brown ever the visionary george wished to push nasa to apply the lessons of faster better and cheaper to human space flight so that human exploration behind earths orbit could become affordable for this nation in the nottoodistant future i will not take up a lot more time detailing all the provisions included in h r 1654 the gentleman from wisconsin the chairman has done a very good job of that my colleagues have copies of the conference report and accompanying statement of managers available to them instead i would like to close by expressing my appreciation to fellow conferees for all their hard work including the gentleman from wisconsin chairman sensenbrenner who is not only a good guy he is very knowledgeable he is good to work with and we appreciate him the gentleman from california chairman rohrabacher who worked steadily with us the gentleman from tennessee the gentleman from florida chairman mccain chairman frist chairman stevens senator hollings and senator breaux in particular i again want to commend the chairman for his leadership as chairman of the conference it was a difficult conference at times but i think all the conferees made a goodfaith effort to achieve a constructive piece of legislation if h r 1654 is enacted into law it will become the first nasa authorization act enacted since 1992 i think this is quite an accomplishment i believe that it is important for both nasa and for the congress that we do enact h r 1654 furthermore i believe that the conference report for h r 1654

to put it very bluntly would be perverse this language would put land in newly created national monuments in a state of limbo the lands would remain national monuments but the design the planning and management necessary to fully protect the lands and to make them accessible could not be accomplished who could possibly gain from keeping lands in this sort of halfwayhouse condition nobody not those who want to preserve the environmental value of the lands the prohibition in this rider would block the planning and management needed to protect the environmental and cultural values that prompted the monumental designation not those who want recreational access to the lands the prohibition in this rider would prevent the development of programs or centers to enable the public to take greater advantage of the lands not even those who have mineral or other economic interests in these lands the prohibition in this rider would prevent the development of rules and policies that would determine how to handle their claims so why would anyone propose a rider that cannot help anyone concerned about national monuments and a rider that would cause this entire bill to be vetoed to boot the reason is that the proponents of this rider want to signal their opposition to the 1906 antiquities act itself and with the particular monument designations that have been made this year but they have plenty of other ways to do that directly the congress could amend the antiquities act the congress could override any particular monument designation the congress could reject any particular management plan for a mofiument congress has all the direct authority it needs to have a full debate about lands policy but they do not want to do that because congress has repeatedly shown its unwillingness to significantly alter with monument authority or designation so instead we have a rider to try to do it in an indirect and inartful way through the appropriations process which could not be done through direct congressional action namely derail efforts to protect federal lands through the use of the antiquities act that is a misuse of the appropriations process and it is especially misguided in this case because the direct impact of the language is so counterproductive so i urge my colleagues not to turn the discussions on this rider into a debate over the legitimacy of the antiquities act or the wisdom of any particular monument designation if congress wants to weigh in on these matters it can and should do so directly in any event the rider leaves the act and all recent proclamations entirely intact this debate should be about the specific language in the rider which will leave the status of the land in an uncertain state which would hobble efforts to protect federal lands and

our nation it is indeed a personal loss for me i first met senator coverdell in 1974 when he came to columbus georgia where i lived and he did his best to recruit me to run as a republican for the state senate senator coverdell was not successful in that endeavor but he impressed upon me his commitment to integrity in government and his commitment to our twoparty system i eventually ran for the legislature 2 years later as a democrat and i have served with paul i guess now for nearly 20 years both as a member of the general assembly and as a member of our states delegation here in congress he and i worked together on a number of issues over the years and he was an extraordinary leader whose flexibility his ability and commitment and his integrity were recognized by anyone who knew him and had the opportunity to work with him he was a thoughtful and softspoken man but he was a tenacious fighter for all of the causes that he believed in shakespeare wrote all the worlds a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances one man in his time plays many parts so it was with paul he was a soldier having served in the army in korea and the republic of china he was a legislator and emerged as one of the most ardent defenders of our american freedoms and our democracy as a real true fighter for our twoparty system he was a senator he was elected by his colleagues to leadership in the unitedstates senate where he served as adviser counselor supporter confidant for the republican party and he gave an important voice to how our government conducts its business as a humanitarian paul dedicated a segment of his life to leading the peace corps an organization that needs no accolades in its efforts to lift the untouchables to places of respectability and to bring life and quality of life to people all across the vorld that was paul coverdells commitment he made numerous contributions in the peace corps such as redesigning the agencys mission to serve the emerging democracies in europe paul was a family man he loved nancy and his family and he always held them dear but paul was also a statesman and everything that he did he did it with dignity and with respect and with courtesy i have two personal stories or recollections and memories of paul i have shared one and that was his efforts in our conversations as he worked to try to recruit me as a republican candidate for the state senate in 1974 but even more important than that was the kind of individual that paul was the kind of integrity that he had he was a man who was committed to integrity who was committed to fairness and who was committed to that which was right my colleagues may remember that former state senator julian bond had been a member of the georgia state house of representatives and had made some statements regarding the vietnam war which angered his colleagues in the georgia house they got together passed a resolution and expelled him from membership in the georgia house so he could not take his seat then representative bond filed a lawsuit took it all the way to the supreme court and the supreme court had to order the state house to grant him his seat to represent his constituents shortly thereafter julian bond ran for the state senate and was elected overwhelmingly and became a member of that august body but the hostility was so great in the georgia house because of the resentment for senator bond and what he stood for that any piece of legislation that he offered that passed the senate even if it passed unanimously once it got to the house it was doomed to a certain death a certain death so paul and julian were friends anything that julian felt so strongly about that he wanted it to be passed he discussed with his friend paul coverdell paul would take julians ghostwritten legislation and he would offer it under his name and when it got to the house it would secure the usual passage paul did that not because he wanted the limelight not because he wanted the credit but because he believed in doing that which was right and if it was a good piece of legislation he felt that it did not matter who wrote the bill what was important was the result paul coverdell set an example for all of us in elective office to follow it is not important that we be concerned about the partisanship as it is that we be concerned about the policy yes all the world is a stage and all the men and women merely players each has his entrance and his exit one man in his time may play many parts and so to nancy and to the coverdell
