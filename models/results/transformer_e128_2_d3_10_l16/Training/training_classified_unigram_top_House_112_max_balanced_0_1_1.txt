newt gingrich and tom delay in this bill the house republicans are undermining the clean water act creating loopholes in the clean air act and gutting the endangered species act but thats not all this legislation makes it harder for our states and cities to improve their crumbling water and wastewater systems through the state clean water and drinking water revolving funds the legislation blocks the environmental protection agency from protecting us from mercury soot and power plant pollution under this bill the epa will hardly be allowed to do anything about dangerous pollution that threatens our public health the legislation blocks the new vehicle standards that will save consumers at the gas pump and would reduce the amount of oil that we import as a nation if that wasnt bad enough the bill decides to prohibit the state of california from setting its own clean vehicle standards the legislation also includes an extinction rider one of the most aggressive threats to the endangered species act in my career here that would freeze all of the efforts to protect imperiled species across the country one of the most offensive aspects of this bill out of a very long list is the 80 percent cut to the land and water conservation fund for nearly 50 years the land and water conservation fund has taken oil and gas drilling fields a finite resource to invest them in a continuing protection of our resources on land not taxpayer dollarsthese are taken from the oil companies that drill in the offshoreand they use that money to preserve the national parks the wildlife habitat trails and working ranches and forests with this cut republicans are breaking the decadeslong promise that has been a bipartisan consensus across this country the promise that we will use these oil and gas royalties to protect important american places for future generations outside of the republican conference in the house of representatives i dont know anyone in this country who wants to end our commitment to use these fees on big oil to protect our parks and recreation areas these are our public lands these are the lands that americas families use every summer use at different seasons and different parts of the country all of the time these are the public spaces that make us the envy of the rest of the world these are the public systems that countries from all

their families who are faced with a system that fails to meet their very basic needs this should really be a nonpartisan issue but we are here today because republicans are more focused on ending medicare and repealing a longterm care program than they are on creating jobs to put americans back to work last year the republicans first order of business was to eliminatemind you eliminatethe

fixing the medicare physician pay rate this tea party congress continues to waste time on pointless bills just to score political points repealing the class program will do nothingnothingto address the longterm crisis for the 10 million americans who need care now and the 5 million more who will require it over the next 10 years killing this program without offering any alternative is frankly irresponsible the law may not be perfect but repealing the bill does not make the problem go away we should be doing everything we can to ensure that senior citizens and the disabled also have a shot at the american dream we should not destroy this for them just because of their ages or their disabilities why in the world would the republican tea party want to throw them under the bus we should work to find a real solution that meets the needs of the millions of baby boomers who are retiring now of the senior citizens and the disabled and we should work to ensure that they get the longterm care over the next decade that they will need rather than repeal this bill today we need to give experts time to identify changes that would make the class program stronger and congress needs to focus on the real priorities of the day which are jobs and the economy we have work to do and we dont have a minute to waste lets not waste another year without a jobs bill and without extending vital unemployment benefits and payroll tax reductions to millions of americans while our economy continues to recover it is time for the republican tea party to stop walking away from our senior citizens

occasions now as for instance we did with the export import bank the bills that you sent over there we didnt work together on they were passed on a partisan vote for the most part not all of them and some votes were overwhelmingly bipartisan and guess what happened they became law the president signed them export import bank the jobs bill that you promoted and which i voted for you said you want to work together now its interesting when you say work together because what you say youre going to give us is a motion to recommit and what you will instruct and what your whip will instruct is for all of your members vote no and your side will inaccurately say it is a purely procedural vote and as you have for the last 18 months your members will vote no on motions to recommit notwithstanding the fact that they may agree with the substance and the fact of the matter is mr leader we can have a vote that ought to pass with 435 votes 435 votes everybody in this congress says that we ought to not have a tax increase on working americans on working americans making less than 250 000 in taxable income as you know thats more income but we wont get that vote except on an mtr on which you have instructed your members to vote no incorrectly arguing that its a procedural vote only and not a substantive vote i would say to my friend not only will you not allow us an amendment on the floor it appears but you wont allow an amendment to be offered in committee so that we can vote on that yes we have disagreement but youre prepared to hold hostage working americans by saying if the richest people in america might have a little bit of a tax increase then everybody else is going to get a tax increase you said it a different way i understand but the reality and the ramifications of the

that yes we can agree and that yes we can make sure that they dont get a tax increase then yes we can have a debate on the balance you will take one position and i may take another position and the american public will see that and then they can make a judgment as to with whom they agree now my view is an overwhelming majority of the public will agree with me and you will think the overwhelming

impact repeal will have on women children and older americans when republicans wrote a medicare prescription plan that created a gap in their coverage seniors across the country were forced to pay full price for their prescription drugs the affordable care act eliminated the donut hole allowing millions of seniors to buy life saving medications prior to the passage of the affordable care act many americans families were uninsured and underinsured families were forced to choose between paying for coverage for children with preexisting conditions or feeding them passage of the affordable

amendment and in defense of our nations seniors who are really under attack why is that because the current republican budget proposal passed by this house and up for senate consideration pulls the rug out from underneath our seniors it ends medicare by making huge cuts in benefits and by putting insurance companies in charge of our seniors health care letting insurers decide what treatment and what tests our seniors will receive under the republican plan medicare will end it will not only impact our seniors it will impact the family members of our seniors who will now have those responsibilities it will reopen the doughnut hole making it more expensive for our seniors to get their prescriptions the prescriptions they need to keep them healthy and under their plan they will slash support for seniors in nursing homes while continuing to give subsidies in the billions of dollars to big oil companies and what else more than 170 000 rhode islanders which is my home state rely on medicare and they will literally be paying to give additional tax breaks to the wealthiest americans in our country to make matters worse the nonpartisan congressional budget office determined that this budget actually adds 8 trillion to the national debt over the next decade because its cuts in spending are outpaced by the gigantic tax cuts for the richest americans our seniors cannot afford this republican budget it would deny them health care longterm care and the benefits that they have earned the republicans choice to end medicare by cutting benefits and by turning power over to the insurance companies for the important health care decisions of our seniors will result in reduced coverage and an exposure to greater financial risk for medicare recipients costing seniors an estimated 6 000 more each year for their care the congressional budget office determined that under this republican budget seniors outofpocket expenses for health care would more than double and could almost triple they concluded most elderly people would pay more for their health care under the republican plan than they would pay under the current medicare system to put that into context the cbo found that in 2030 seniors would pay 68 percent of premiums and outofpocket costs under the republican plan compared to only 25 percent under current law and it found that the republican plan means seniors will pay more for their prescription drugs because it reopens the doughnut hole costing each of the 4 million seniors who fall into that coverage gap up to 9 300 by the conservative wall street journal concluded that this plan would essentially end medicare which now pays for 48 million elderly and disabled americans as a program that directly pays those bills under the guise of deficit reduction this republican plan is recklessly attacking vital support systems for our seniors we all agree that we have to address the deficit the issue isnt whether we should reduce it but rather how we do it lets repeal subsidies to big oil lets eliminate fraud and waste lets end the wars that are costing us more than 2 billion a week we should not be balancing the budget on the backs of our nations seniors the federal budget is about more than just dollars and cents it is a statement of our values and our priorities as a country the republican budget reflects the wrong priorities it would rather cut benefits to our seniors than cut subsidies to big oil or corporations that ship our jobs overseas by ending medicare this republican budget breaks the promise we made to our seniors to protect them in their golden years we must do better for our seniors medicare has met the health care needs of seniors while providing them with financial stability for more than 40 years

must address our national deficit but i believe we can do it in a responsible manner that does not hinder our fragile economy and does not risk important programs i support the democratic budget proposal which makes practical cuts to reduce our nations deficit but without hurting americas seniors and sacrificing their health and financial security the republican plan is irresponsible it would hurt americas seniors while giving enormous tax breaks to the top 2 percent of the wealthiest americans it does nothing to create jobs but gives billions in corporate loopholes and subsidies to big oil most notably the republican plan would literally end medicare and while this may be a new plan these are not new ideas the republicans 2012 budget attempts to do to medicare what president bush wanted to do to social security in 2005privatize it and severely cut benefits can you imagine if we had privatized social security in 2005 the way the republicans wanted to do just before the biggest financial collapse since the great depression is that what we really want to do with medicare we cannot afford to have wall street control the fate of our seniors the republican plan would convert medicare into a voucher program that forces seniors to buy costly private insurance plans it asks seniors half of whom have less than 19 000 a year in total income to pay more and get less if this plan were put in place the nonpartisan congressional budget office has estimated that the average senior would end up paying nearly three times more outofpocket expenses meanwhile the health care law enacted last year is already helping to close the gap in prescription drug coverage known as the doughnut hole and provides annual exams and preventive services but a repeal of the health care law as the republican budget plan calls for would eliminate these benefits these benefits for medicare patients are making a real difference in the lives of my constituents i recently heard from a 71yearold woman from sacramento who requires several expensive drugs to maintain her health in october of 2010 she was worried about her ability to pay for her medication because she fell into the coverage gap but she was relieved to learn that she would get 250 in 2010 and that 50 percent of her costs would be reimbursed this year and even more would be reimbursed in the future but now republicans want to pull the rug out from under our seniors and their families what is astonishing to me is that in addition to privatization of medicare the republican plan also goes after medicaid instead of making real reform to the medicaid program the republican budget calls for converting medicaid into a block grant program that would sharply reduce funding for seniors and lowincome americans on medicaid so that it would not keep up with health care costs medicaid helps keep our seniors in their homes and helps them afford nursing homes if they need them but the republican plan would leave seniors on their own and ignores the promise that our country has made from one generation to another the federal budget should reflect our american values that have been passed down for generations where seniors earn the benefits that they have paid into and have been promised and are able to enjoy their retirement after working hard in their careers that is why i will continue to fight to protect the

by republicans that allows them to use current economic problems to pursue an agenda supported by the big business community year in and year out in other words it is a simple case of political opportunism not a serious effort to deal with high unemployment those arent my words those are the words of bruce bartlett a republican who worked for ronald reagan george h w bush jack kemp and ron paul think about what mr bartlett is saying in his last sentence republicans would rather play political games instead of putting people back to work they would rather fiddle while rome burns instead of putting out the fire and look at the republican track record since the start of the 112th congress no jobs bills not one but weve found time to debate bills defunding planned parenthood and national public radio theres no extension of the payroll tax cut or unemployment insurance but we can spend hours debating the need to allow unsafe people the right to carry concealed weapons from state to state no effort to take away tax breaks for oil companies who continue to make billions of dollars in profits each month but we can find time to make our air dirtier and our water less safe by dismantling the clean air act and the clean water act seriously the agenda of the far right continues to dominate this house leadership and that agenda is out of touch with the needs of the american people we have a jobs crisis in this country the rich are getting richer and everyone else is struggling yet the republicans continue to side with the people who dont need any help they killed the supercommittee because they would rather protect tax cuts for millionaires instead of dealing with the deficit they are refusing to take up the extension of the payroll tax cut that expires at the end of the year because they dont want their millionaire friends to pay just a little bit more just look at what were doing this week were going to consider antiregulatory bills that will make our country less safe and our citizens less healthy were going to consider a bill that actually promotes putting more corporate money into the political system and were going to debate a bill that makes it harder for workers to organize not one of these bills will put people back to work not one of these bills will help struggling families keep their heat on during the winter not one of these bills will help repair our aging infrastructure to quote mr bartlett again people are increasingly concerned about unemployment but republicans have nothing to offer them and thats the truth republicans have absolutely nothing to offer the president proposedand i have cosponsoredthe american jobs act its a proposal that would help put americans back to work would extend the payroll tax cut and unemployment insurance would help repair our aging infrastructure and would provide aid to cities and states so they dont have to lay off more teachers and more police officers and more firefighters its a bill that is paid for it doesnt add one cent to the deficit and its made up of measures that republicans and democrats have supported in the past let me repeat that what the president has proposed is a series of measures that republicans and democrats have supported in the past the idea that a program was good under president bush but not under president obama doesnt make much sense to me but that seems to be the thought process that passes for governing under this republican leadership so wheres the republican plan they dont have one its not enough to cross our fingers and hope that our economy improves its not enough to close our eyes and wish that more people would find a job actions speak louder than words and it is clear by the republican leaderships actions that they dont care about the economy either that or they are making a conscious decision not to act simply for political gain either way americans are hurting because of their inaction our economy is not where it needs to be there are still too many unemployed people in this country there are still too many people struggling to make ends meet struggling to pay their bills and to put food on the table but this notion that red tape is whats keeping our economy from getting off the ground and that thoughtful regulations are preventing people from getting jobs is just untrue we dont need to waste time debating bills that make our air and water dirtier and less safe we dont need to waste our time with bills defunding npr and planned parenthood we dont need to waste our time

dealing with this deficit that we have in this country has to be a pragmatic measured process it has taken us 10 years to get into the hole that we are in and we need to plan to get out of that with the same amount of time if not more we also need to talk about revenue generation we are not going to cut our way out of this deficit and you are certainly not going to cut your way out of this deficit when you are only concentrating on 14 or 15 percent of the federal budget which is why i support this amendment as it is an attempt to deal with defense we must create revenues we must quit giving huge subsidies to big oil and big gas we must ask mining companies for once to begin to pay royalties on the extractions provided them by the public lands we must close the corporate loopholes that exist that created the financial collapse of housing in this country and we must ask wall street to pay its fair share through a transaction fee which will generate billions and billions of

important work in constructing a democratic alternative to the republican budget that is mr van hollens budget proposal that is a statement of our national values that says to the american people what is important to you about the education health and wellbeing of our children the economic security of their families and the health security of our seniors those are important values to us and those values are reflected in the democratic alternative the republican ryan bill on the other hand i do not believe is a statement of our national values as to what is important to the american people as reflected in their budget priorities but you be the judge would it be a statement of your values if you had a budget that said to seniors were going to end the medicare guarantee and youre going to pay 6 000 or more while you get less in terms of benefits while at the same time were going to give an over 300 billion tax break to the wealthiest people in our country would that be a statement of your values this 6 000 more for seniors with fewer benefits 300 000 or more to the richest people in our country would it be a statement of your values for you my colleagues and the american people you represent if you had a budget that said to big oil were going to continue to subsidize you to the tune of tens of billions of dollars but at the same time were going to freeze pell grants were going to eliminate them for 400 000 young people and make them less available to over 9 million young people lower the benefits for some eliminate it for others and use the money to give tax subsidies to big oil big oil which is making tens of billions of dollars in record profits each year would it be a statement of your values if you said in your budget that all of those young people who are now children who have a preexisting medical conditionasthma diabetes birth defectany of those preexisting medical conditions under present law under the affordable care act they may not be discriminated against in obtaining health insurance but the republican budget says they should be because were going to eliminate that to the 2 5 million young people who are now on their parents policies until theyre 26 years old this budget says no to you too were eliminating that were too busy giving tax breaks to the richest people in america and while were at it with young people just graduating from college some of them may have student loans and in the house budgetthank you mr van hollenin the house budget we have a provision that says that come july 1 the interest on those loans will not double we have taken care of that under the circumstances the path were on the interest rates would go from 3 4 percent to 6 8 percent the house democratic budget says no to that doubling of interest the republican budget keeps it the same thats just to name a few things that i think may not be a statement of the values of the american people whether its interest paid on student loans availability of pell grants to young people ending the medicare guarantee and as the distinguished ranking member said right now today overturning the resources that were put in the affordable care act to reduce to narrow the doughnut hole maybe 5 million seniors have benefited to the tune of 3 2 billion already in the bill also there are preventative services there are annual wellness visits without a copay so were talking about kitchen table items for people where people are trying to make ends meet where people wonder about if their children will be able to go to college and if they do will they be able to have health insurance so that when they look for a job they can reach their aspirations without having their choices only narrowed by whether they have health insurance or not until the bill comes into full effect so there are just a couple of things that i would want people to know about this bill they are ends the medicare guarantee ends the medicare guarantee ends the medicare guarantee while making seniors pay more for less while giving over 300 billion in tax breaks to the wealthiest people in our country and by the way did i mention it its a job loser so i urge my colleagues to enthusiastically support the house democratic proposal which is a statement of our values and which our distinguished colleague will presenti dont know if its tonight or tomorrow morning i understand that it keeps changing the house democratic alternative invests in americas priorities creates jobs protects our seniors and our students strengthens the middle class democrats protect medicare republicans dismantle medicare the democratic plan asks the wealthiest to pay their fair share and put our fiscal house in order the republican plan gives them more than the tax break theyve had they almost double their tax break our democratic plan reflects the most enduring theme in america the american dream democrats want to reignite the american dream to build ladders of opportunity for all who want to work hard play by the rules and take responsibility it does this by investing in small businesses and entrepreneurialism in our country by strengthening the middle class in that regard we believe that our budget is a statement of our values we call upon our republican colleagues to work with us on a budget that reflects our values we must work together to protect and strengthen medicare we must put people back to work and build a broadly shaped prosperity for all americans we must make it in america to stop the erosion of our manufacturing base we must rebuild america putting people back to work we must do this with community involvement and all of these things strengthen the middle class which is exactly what our democratic alternative achieves for the sake of our seniors for our families for our children for our workers i urge my colleagues to vote no on the republican plan which ends the medicare guarantee and makes seniors pay 6 000 or more for fewer benefits while it gives 300 000 in tax breaks to the wealthiest people in the united states and it costs us jobs to do so and doesnt reduce the deficit until nearly 2040 its not a good deal for the

sense to spend money on that we have always given money for emergencies but the funding is offset in the chairmans amendment by a recision of all the remaining unobligated highspeed rail funding that was originally approved in the american recovery act the language of the amendment would rescind all unobligated highspeed rail funding as opposed to just 1 028 billion to be spent for the emergency this provision jeopardizes several important projects that are already underway already in the planning stages that support good jobs and will make longoverdue improvements to our rail system last may the department of transportation awarded some of these highspeed rail funds for major improvements on the northeast corridor such as 449 million for catenary improvements which would allow trains to reach 160 miles per hour on certain segments and 294 million for the harold interlocking in queens which would reduce delays for amtrak and on the long island railroad ive heard a lot of people complain about the trip times and reliability on the northeast corridor and complain that even the acela is not true highspeed rail and theyre right but these are the kinds of projects that have to be done to prepare to make significant improvements in the corridor and to prepare the way for true highspeed rail later make no mistake these are projects that are happening now this is not money just sitting there waiting for a visionary highspeed rail system to come about this is money going to real infrastructure investments now that support real jobs now and support real economic development

how to address the longterm deficit this is yet another example of the misguided thinking that cutting government spending is somehow the answer to these longterm economic challenges it is unfathomable that we would pass anything that would eliminate good jobs and not just the direct transportation and construction jobs but all of the jobs dependent on the connectivity and efficiency of our transportation system we need to make the investments necessary to put america on a path toward longterm economic growth we should be providing a lot more money for highspeed rail which is one of the connection systems of the future this bill that we will be considering today takes an extra step backward by revoking funds already allocatednot necessarily obligated but allocated and announcedfor ongoing projects that are moving ahead i urge my colleagues to fix this provision emergency funding is obviously warranted for the floods but it should not be done by eliminating already allocated funds for highspeed rail in an area where we very much need those improvements on the current transportation system i yield back the balance of my time"]], "top_incorrect":

not the way it is for many young people across the country even if they do have a job you say they dont have insurance because they dont have a job it may be news to you but there are many many many working americans who do not have health insurance but they will under the affordable care act if this amendment were to pass if it were to become law immediately all of those children who can now be on their parents policy if their parents are willing would lose their health insurance with a job or without a job these young people coming out of school are idealistic and ambitious they want to follow their passions and their pursuits that is what our founders told them they could dolife liberty and pursuit of happiness these young people want a healthier life to pursue their happiness to choose a job not based on the health benefits it may or may not provide but to choose an occupation which addresses their aspirationsnot ours theirs so i just want to repeat back to our colleagues something i heard them say over and over again they said we didnt read the bill well we did but clearly you did not and i urge you to read the bill because if you did you would see that the bill puts medical decisions in the hands of patients and doctors not your favorite insurance company you would see that it brings down the cost of prescription drugs for seniors you would see that it ends the days of discrimination based on preexisting conditions and lifetime caps on the care of children and families you would see that under this bill no longer would being a woman be a preexisting medical condition as it is now as women are discriminated against in terms of price and access to insurance you would see that it offers tax credits to millions of small businesses who choose to do right by their employees and offer insurance benefits it was for all of these americans that we acted it is for them that we stand here today to oppose this amendment and if you read the bill you will see contrarycontrary to misrepresentations that were set forth by those who do the bidding of the health insurance industry in our country you would see what the bill does you would see that it is about innovation its about prevention its about a healthier america not just health care in america its about using the technologies of the future its about bringing health care closer to people where they live to lower the cost to improve the quality and to expand the access you would see that it is a bill about the future instead of the misrepresentations about this that and the other thing which i dont even want to repeat here you would see that this is transformative for our country because it gives people the liberty again to pursue their lives so i would like to know how many of you read the bill we read it over and over again to each other drilling down on different parts of it so we know of what we speak when we come to this floor and maybe if you knew more about it you wouldnt be so quick to saywe do not want to allow children to stay on their parents policies we do not want to end discrimination on the basis of preexisting conditions for our children we do not want to begin to close the doughnut hole we do not want to have preventive medicines without cost and copay for our seniors and the list goes on and on so thats whats happening here today this is again yet again another example of our friends standing up for the insurance companies at the expense of the american people standing up for the insurance companies at the expense of the health and wellbeing of our country it is again an example of washington d c holding on to the special interest status quo it is again this congress saying to the american people we are here for the special interest we are not here for the peoples interest to stacie we are not here for your two daughters for vernal we are not here for women and having being a woman being a preexisting condition to claudette and richard to say to them too bad about your mortgage if you cant pay your mortgage because you have to pay your medical bills so be it i urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment which is another

budget drafted by mr chris van hollen and then of course the progressive caucus budget came up the black caucus budget came up i think mr mulvaney came up with a budget proposal they put the presidentsa very very watered down and inaccurate version of the presidents budget up there and weve been talking budget when we talk about the budget what were talking about is the values and priorities of america its important to keep this in mind what shows up in your budget is what you care about what does not show up in your budget is what you dont care about now i always caution people not to just take their family budget and the united states budget and assume theyre basically the same thing one just is bigger than the other thats not exactly accurate there are important differences and we shouldnt mix up the two but in this way they are similar in that they reflect what it is that people value if you have a family and their budget you can look at their budget they spend a lot of money on entertainment you can pretty much figure they value that if they put a lot of money into food you can figure they definitely think that is a priority for them you can go through the family budget and see what people spend their money on see what people dont have in their budget and then you can pretty much figure well maybe thats not a priority for them of course they may not be able to afford it at this time but if you talk about reasonably middle class people their budget reflects what they care about what matters and what doesnt and for our nation that certainly is true if our nation puts more money into warfare than it does into social uplift jobs and the economy and infrastructure that says something about who we are if our national budget puts more money into infrastructure and jobs and putting people back to work then that says something about who we are the various budgets that have come up reflect what the various caucuses think is important and project a vision for our country i want to talk about that today i want to start by talking about paul ryans budget paul ryan is the republican budget committee chair hes a nice guy i dont have anything bad to say about him personally because he is actually a nice person but the fact is we disagree in a significant way about what the priorities of america should be for example the republican budget 20 children will lose access to head start to pay for one millionaires tax cut thats their budget just if you want to understand what their tax cuts represent it means 20 kids dont get to go to head start so that a millionaire can get a tax cut150 000 equals 20 times 7 500 so if you look at this tax cut a millionaires tax cut which will amount to about 150 000 these little guys dont get to go to head start now what is head start head start is a great program for lowincome kids to make sure that they have a chance at getting a quality education and dont fall behind in school and so this is a great program it has great results these head start kids 20 of them going to head start versus what a millionaires tax cut would be which is 150 000 now this is the choice were making we should not act like were not making choices we are making choices we are deciding my friends on the republican side of the aisle like to say oh we shouldnt pick winners and losers were always doing it they just pick the rich people and weipick the kids in head start also if you just want to get a sense of what the republican budget what it does and what the tax cuts that its calling for mean republican budget 150 college students will have their pell grants cut by 1 000 to pay for one millionaires tax cut so one millionaires tax cut 150 000 but 150 times 1 000 all these kids these college kids trying to make something of themselves their pell grant is going to get whacked by 1 000 bucks so again choices do we want to make sure the country club set is doing even better or do we want to make sure that these aspiring engineers these aspiring doctors and teachers these aspiring police officers these aspiring workers of tomorrow will have a shot at an affordable college education this is what were talking about these are the choices that were making and i think its very important that americans know it its critical that we know it now lets just not stop there lets talk about other critical choices being made because i think it is so critical that as were talking budget week and all the budget decisions that we are making that we make it real clear to the american people what it is were choosing republican budget 216 pregnant or postpartum women infants and children would lose access to wicthats the women infants and children program and it provides food for poor women and their kidsto pay for one millionaires tax cut so 150 000 tax cut for a millionaireagain this is the country club setequals about 216 pregnant women or postpartum women and the amount of money that americans give them so that they can have good nutrition for their kids these are poor women these are women who are struggling economically but just because theyre struggling economically we dont want their kids to go without good nutritious food so as americans we have the wic program well theyre going to get slashed out of the program because a millionaire needs a tax cut thats the choice that were making i want to talk about why were making that choice in a minute but i want to give one more example republican budget 25 seniors paying 6 000 or more for medicare to pay for one millionaires tax cut so if youre a millionaire and you get a tax cut under what the republicans want to give youyoure already doing good but they want you to even do betterthat will mean that youve got about 25 seniors who have to pay 6 000 a piece more for their medicare so mom dadif youre my age mom and dad are senior citizens if youre younger theyre not but if your parents or grandparents are on medicare and theyre doing all they can on their fixed income to make it theyre going to need a little extra help because weve got to make sure that that millionaire gets his 150 000 tax cut these are the choices that were making now my friends in the republican caucusgod bless themits not like they dont like poor people many of them are very charitable they give in their different walks of life maybe their faith community or whatever they just dont think government should do it this is what they say they think that government needs to get out of that and let churches mosques synagogues and other folks do it of course that would mean that it wouldnt get done because even though churches mosques and synagogues do great work they can never possibly come up to meet the need thats out there what theyre really believing isthis is what they really believe they believe in something called trickledown economics they believe that if you give this millionaire 150 000 more dollars than he already has he will maybe hopefully perhaps invest it in plant and equipment and maybe somebody will get a job because of it or maybe not or maybe he will invest in china hell improve jobs but just not in america nobody knows what they will do with this tax cut but this is what the republicans believe they think that if you give rich people more money they will invest in plant and equipment create more economic activity and it will trickle down to the rest of us the only problem is that it has never worked it doesnt stop them from saying it but its never worked in fact the gop budget will destroy more than 4 million american jobs in the next 2 years according to the economic policy institute the economic policy institute estimates that the shock to aggregate demand from nearterm spending cuts would result in roughly 1 3 million jobs lost in 2013 and 2 8 million jobs lost in 2014 or 4 1 million jobs through so a little bit more than 4 million jobs over the next 2 years now people might think well keith is that right well yeah its right and ill tell you why its right its right because when republicans say we need to cut government waste we need to cut government cut government cut government they act as if theres just some big government thing over there like its a big giant piece of styrofoam and they can just cut it and it doesnt change anything what theyre talking about cutting are federal workers theyre talking about laying off federal workers and theyre very derisive about government jobs and act like people who work for the government dont do anything of valueof course this is not true at all but if you look on this chart right here it says i earn less than 45 000 a year explain to me gop how cutting my pay creates jobs this particular person is named paul and he is an army depot worker i think we need army depot workers teresa is a nurseand this is her right here she lives in my district and she says twelve percent of the salary i earn caring for veterans goes to my retirement explain to me gop how cutting my retirement puts people to work well one of the things that they do in the ryan budget is cut into federal workers retirement they act like oh the government no the government is people the government is nurses the government is army depot workers and what about federal prisons that keep dangerous criminals behind bars i pay more than 9 000 a year for my familys health insurance explain to me gop how cutting my takehome pay lowers unemployment this guy is a corrections officer and thank goodness for correction officers or the streets that we live on wouldnt be so nice the bottom line is when republicans say oh were going to shrink the size of government what they mean is theyre going to lay off and cut the pay and cut the employment benefits of federal workers people who work in prisons at risk to themselves nurses who care for our veterans people who are army depot workers and people who work in our parks and people who fix our roads and a whole lot of other people heres a chart for you if you look at the ryan budget if you look at the gop proposal if you look at it and it could do what they want it to do it could cause a loss of up to 7 million jobs by 2016 because it would cut federal workers and then they wouldnt be able to have the money to spend in the neighborhoods they live in anymore that would then have a ripple effect in their neighborhoods because theyre buying less for example if that young nurse at the va in minnesota if she doesnt have the same pay as she had before then she cant buy as much as she bought before then the company she shops at doesnt sell her as much as they have before you do that enough multiply it times enough people and that company then needs to start laying off people so its a ripple effect what the republicans are asking for but if you look at what they wantedand im talking about going all the way back to h r 1 which is their proposalyou would see repealing health care reform that would cut about 2 million the gop budget that would cut about 3 million cuts to the federal workforce that would cut about 285 000 the socalled jobs act that would cut a lot the fair tax that would cut and they would just cut on down the line what theyre basically proposing is by shrinking government and by doing all that stuff theyre getting rid of people now i just want to be on the record because your words do get twisted if there is a federal program that is not justifiable and its so poorly run that its of no value to anyone im okay with cutting it i just want to say that on the record on the house floor im all right with cutting programs that dont work but when youre talking about va nurses and youre talking about corrections workers in federal prisons we need these people they do good stuff and i believe that we should stand by them as they stand by us the gop budgetnow going back to the budget we addressed todaywill shift costs to seniors for the medicare guarantee according to the aarp and whats aarp thats the leading organization representing retired persons and the cbowhats the cbo that is the congressional budget office and for folks who like to watch cspan id just say you need to know what cbo is because this is very important congressional budget office theyre the nonpartisan group that says whats really going on with the numbers at the same time it is raising the seniors cost this gop budget gives those making more than a million a year an average tax cut of about 394 000 so i put 150 up there a moment ago that was the generic millionaire the actual number is about 394 for the average millionaire per year on the average tax cut and also the tax breaks for big oil companies you know they get about 4 billion a year im talking about if you look at conoco exxonmobil and all the big oil companies they get about 4 billion a year now how much did you pay for gasoline im not saying that theyre not good people im not saying that they dont run a good business and supply an important product im just asking you this does exxonmobil really need your money through a tax subsidy do they i think that they dont need your money i think their 4 a gallon is taking care of them just fine and i think its outrageous that the republican budget that we dealt with does not eliminate that tax break in short the big oil companies who are gouging americans at the pump and the wealthiest americans win while middle class and working class families get the short end of the stick last year oil profitsand this is an exact number or close to it last year big oil profits totaled about 137 billion but you dont need to remember 137 billion all you need to remember is big oil profits were the biggest ever that the oil industry ever had and yet were forking it over to them through our tax money not through the pumps some people might think well of course were paying them keith through the pump they give us gas weve got to get to work so we need to buy the gas im not talking about that im saying they getthey can apply for grants and subsidies and it all adds up to about 4 billion a year with soaring gasoline prices big oils 2012 profits will even be bigger yet republicans want to give big oil more money in our tax dollars and it just doesnt make any sense now of course you shouldnt expect the big oil companies like exxonmobil to say we dont want the money of course they want the money who doesnt want money everybody does including them but the people who have a public responsibility to look out for the american people should be willing to say no to public subsidies for the exxonmobils of this world and again if you work for exxonmobil im not running you down im just saying that youre doing well enough and you dont need the help of the american people you can do fine on your own now those kids on head start need help they need help those college kids need help but not exxonmobil executives the major consequence for medicare and medicaid the ryan budget the republican budget has big consequences for medicaid and medicare many seniors will be forced to pay sharply higher premiums to stay in traditional medicare and keep their current choice of doctors new medicare beneficiaries would pay more than 1 200 more by 2030 and more than 6 000 by 2050 before more seniors would gradually shift to private health insurance plans over time increasing privatization of medicare more than 47 million americans would lose health care insurance over 10 years because they would get rid of obamacare now my friends in the republican aisle when they say obamacare they dont mean it in a nice way its an insult but you know what obama does care so i dont mind them saying obamacare i hope they keep saying it because theyre just reminding americans that obama cares about them and that the people the republicans want to look out for apparently do not states under the republican plan would be forced to slash medicaid eligibility benefits and payments to health care providers their budget shreds the medicaid safety net and shifts health care costs to states and beneficiaries blocking medicaid this shifts all risks including future recessions health care cost increases and disasters to states and beneficiaries so heres the thing this ryan budget this republican ryan budget it helps and takes care of the rich it ignores everyone else and it hurts the middle class the republican budget would weaken the middle class in important ways first and foremost their plan ends the medicare guarantee of decent health insurance in retirement it also slashes critical middle class investments such as education and infrastructure by 45 percent and 24 percent respectivelyeducation by 45 percent infrastructure by 24 percent now look the american society of civil engineers has told us that we have crumbling infrastructure in this country to the tune of about 2 2 to 3 trillion a lot of money and if you are living in any city across this country you can drive over 75yearold bridges you can drive over potholes our sewage systems need upgrade i am from minneapolis minnesota a city i love so much but back a few years ago we had a bridge fall into the mississippi river because the gusset plates which are those plates that hold up the bridge gave way because the adequate maintenance just wasnt maintained over time now it happened to us but it could happen anywhere there are many structurally deficient bridges across this nation literally thousands we could put people back to work if we put the money into taking care of them and not only would we have people working wed have to save bridges to go over but the republican majority to use their phrase kicks the can down the road and doesnt deal with this looming infrastructure crisis so let me just say this ive talked a little bit about the socalled ryan republican budget i dont want to spend all my time talking about it but i do think its important for americans to know that this is a budget for the 1 percent this is a budget for people whove got it well who are doing fine now let me just tell you i swear i am a big fan of welltodo people i wish i were one of them but my point is that you dont need to help people who already have a lot of help on their own but you do need to help schoolkids head start kids pregnant moms pregnant lowincome moms seniors these people we should help people who are doing fine they dont need our help they should do the helping in my opinion and yet the ryan budget says were just going to help the country club set and i think thats not any way to have a budget im going to talk about the progressive caucus budget but i just want you to know first that the ryan republican budget is no good budget for america in fact its premised on the theory that rich people dont have enough money and poor people have too much really thats the animating organizing feature of their budget that if we gave rich people more money then they might invest it in plant and equipment and then itll trickle down to the rest of us and poor people have too much stuff we cant afford it we cant afford head start cant afford wic cant afford home heating oil for seniors cant afford medicare cant afford medicaid the poor folks are just theyre getting treated too well and thats basically what the theory is of the republican budget and so thats fine and i respect them for being real honest about what they believe in because a budget is a reflection of our values so now that weve talked about what theyre talking about lets talk about a real budget not for the 1 percent but a budget for all the progressive caucus budget has a name the name of the progressive caucus budget is the budget for all thats the name of the progressive caucus budget because unlike the republicans budget which is a budget for the 1 percent this is a budget for all let me tell you what it does it creates 3 3 million jobs in the first 2 years it cuts the deficit by nearly 7 trillion 6 8 trillion no benefit cuts to medicare medicaid and social security the budget for all makes the american dream a reality again for the vast majority of americans by putting americans back to work the budget for all enhances our economic competitiveness by rebuilding the middle class and investing in innovation and education our budget protects medicare and medicaid social security invests in americas future and asks those who have benefited the most from our economy to pay their fair share now as i said you cant have a budgetyou can have a budget that cuts taxes for rich people if you then cut services for poor people and you can have a budget that pays for infrastructure and education but the money has to come from somewhere and we ask people who already have lots of it to do a little more for their fellow americans were not hiding that fact yes we would raise taxes on the wealthiest americans not to punish them because we dont think taxes are punishment but because its necessary to meet the needs of the nation and any selfrespecting patriot would do so if they could in fact there is a group out thereand i would urge you to check them out mr speakercalled patriotic millionaires who understand that they may need to pay higher taxes if you already are making a million dollars a year would you pay a little extra just to make sure that lowincome pregnant women got some food for their kids if you are already making a million or more a year would you pay a little extra to make sure that little kids had head start to go to if youre already making a million dollars a year would you pay a little extra just to make sure that the federal workers dont have their pensions cut to pay for your tax cut thats just my thinking i dont want anybody to think the republicans are mean they do charitable work in their individual lives and thats a fact and i think people ought to know that but they dont think government has any role in helping people i disagree with that and call on americans to look carefully at the choices that they offer the budget for all is not a budget for the 1 percent its not a budget for the 99 percent but a budget for all because we care about the 1 percent too we want even the 1 percent to live in a good nation with fairness with economic opportunity with economic mobility with good roads good bridges good education clean water clean air we want this for everyone the budget for all attacks americas persistently high unemployment levels with more than 2 4 trillion over 10 years in jobcreating investment this plan utilizes every tool at the governments disposal to get our economy moving again including directhire programs that create school improvement corps park improvement corps student jobs corps and others targeted tax incentives that spur clean energy manufacturing cuttingedge technological investment in the private sector widespread domestic investment including an infrastructure bank a 556 billion surface transportation unlike this thing that they tried to pass today which is a 3month extension by the way can you believe it the republican caucus is always going on and on about uncertainty what did they do they created uncertainty by passing some 3month transportation bill my goodness it boggles the mind actually back to the budget for all there is approximately 1 7 trillion in widespread domestic investment unlike the republican budget the budget for all substantially reduces the deficit and does so in a way that does not devastate what americans value we achieve these notable benchmarks by focusing on the true drivers of our deficit unsustainable tax policy wars overseas and the policies that helped cause the recent recession rather than putting the middle class and the social safety net on the chopping block the budget creates a fairer america it ends tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of americans on schedule at the years end extends tax relief for middle class households and the vast majority of americans creates new tax brackets for millionaires and billionaires in line with the buffett rule principle eliminates tax code preferential treatment for capital gains and dividends abolishes corporate welfare for oil gas and coal companies eliminates loopholes that allow businesses to dodge their true tax liability creates a publicly funded federal election system that gets corporate money out of politics for good it responsibly and expeditiously ends our military presence in afghanistan leaving america more secure at home and abroad it also adapts our military to address 21st century threats through modernization the department of defense will spend less and stop contributing to the deficit but they will have what they need to keep america strong which is very important to all of us it provides a makingworkpay tax credit for families struggling with high gas and food costs extends an earned income tax credit and child dependent care credit invests in programs to stave off further foreclosure invests in childrens education by increasing education training and social services the budget for all is a budget for all i know that sounds repetitive but its important to note that the name of our budget reflects the reality of our budget and the reality of our budget is that we want to see rich poor and everybody in the middle do well in america that means a budget for all as i begin to wind down i just want to say that it is an honor to come before you to talk about the budget for all but its also an honor to talk about the ryan republican budget because the ryan republican budget offers a very different vision of america than the budget for all the ryan vision says that if we just could get rich people more money they might create some plants and equipment that will hire the rest of us the budget for all says no were in this together and were going to ask the wealthiest to pay more to invest in health education transportation and infrastructure so that we can have a stronger better greater america two visions of a nation one says austerity for the middle and working class and the poor and one says investment one says if you are out of luck youre on your own and one says as americans were all in this together i want to thank you for allowing me

about the problem of having such a big national debt recognizing those two facts i want to speak up about them first of all if this were just talking about how we can reduce the deficit the best way to do that is job creation we know that if we want to talk about what happened in the nineties we have to reference the fact that under president bill clinton the reaganbush deficit that he inherited he turned around and five of his last budgets the clinton budgets were in balance or were in surplus he put us on a trajectory he and the growth of jobs in our country in the public and largely in the private sector took us to a path a trajectory of 5 6 trillion in surplus along comes president george w bush and in record time he reversed that it was the biggest fiscal turnaround in our nations history taking us to a trajectory of over 5 trillion in deficit an 11 trillion turnaround two unpaidfor wars said the cbo the nonpartisan congressional budget office that was because of two unpaidfor wars the bush tax cuts particularly at the high end which did not create jobs and a giveaway pharmaceutical bill to the pharmaceutical industry those were the three main reasons for the big fiscal turnaround and how we got deeply in debt i dont remember a lot of complaints coming from the republican side of the aisle while president bush was taking us down this path mr goodlatte referenced two paths well this is one path that president bush took us down so now we have to deal with that because the deficit is a concern to all of us we believe that the best way to deal with that is what president clinton did which was to have a great economic agenda to generate jobs yet here we are nearly 320 days into the republican majority and they have taken no action on any serious jobcreating bills here we go again debating legislation that will not create jobs in fact according to experts the enactment of this proposed amendment to our constitution would destroy 15 million jobs double the unemployment rate and cause the economy to shrink by 17 percent as bruce bartlett said recently former economic adviser to president ronald reagan and to president george herbert walker bush even if we were not in an economic crisis and fighting two wars a rapid cut in spending of that magnitude would unquestionably throw the economy into recession just as it did in 1937 this legislation is an attack on our economy and it is an attack on our seniors according to the nonpartisan center on budget and policy priorities it could result in cuts over 10 years of 750 billion to medicare and 1 2 trillion in cuts to social security these cuts would be devastating to the 40 million seniors who rely on medicare and social security every day they are even more draconian than the cuts in the republican budget which would effectively repeal the medicare guarantee and just one week after our nation celebrated veterans day we are debating potentially cutting 85 billion over the next 10 years from veterans benefits my colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim this is a clean balanced budget amendment it is not because this proposed amendment to our constitution will require a supermajority in both chambers of congress to raise the debt limit it puts the full faith and credit of the united states of america in the hands of a minoritythis after we went through all of the stress and strain and uncertainty and downgrading of our credit rating when we couldnt even get a majority and now were thinking of a supermajority vote for the debt limit increase again that was never a requirement when president bush was president that there would be a supermajority to raise the debt limit this amendment promotes further brinkmanship and uncertainty enshrining extreme ideology into the constitution at a time when americans have been very clear that they expect us to set differences aside and to get to work it is our duty as members of congressindeed we take the oath of officeto be the elected guardians of our constitution to protect and defend it and to do no harm to our founding documents yet if this proposed amendment is adopted it will have farreaching and adverse consequences i repeat that it was a democratic president president clinton who balanced the budget in the nineties five of his budgets were in balance or in surplus we can do it again without harming our constitution our economy our seniors or our veterans we must start by creating jobs and strengthening our economic growtha key to reducing the deficit it was interesting to me to hear others on the other side of the aisle talk about our children and our responsibility to them yes thats what we said when president bush was amassing his deficit but i didnt hear anyone on the other side of the aisle talking about that this is about our constitution we owe it to the vision of our founders to the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform and to the aspirations of our children to get our economic and fiscal houses in order this is the exact wrong way to do it we must reignite the american dream and we have work to do on that so lets get to work to create jobs so

bill republicans want to put forth h r 7 and it also diminishes safety that is not a formula for a good transportation billless safety fewer jobs losing jobs and so we have an opportunity to support a bipartisan bill that has come from the senate threequarters of the senate in a bipartisan way passed it out march 31 is the deadline when all of this will expire unless congress acts and congress is not acting because the republican majority does not have its act together their our way or the highway attitude means no highway bill that creates jobs and promotes public safety its really so sad because in the tradition of our country from the start from the very start thomas jefferson understood the need for building the infrastructure of america he tasked his secretary of the treasury gallatin to come up with a project that would expand into america the louisiana purchase and the lewis and clark expeditions and out of that initiative came the cumberland road the erie canal and other things like that over time and in that tradition the transcontinental railroad and the rest that would come later then in our century a republican president president eisenhower at a time of bad economic times bad economic times he went forward and took the initiative for the interstate highway initiative which was so important to our country it was a security issue to unite america it was a jobs initiative to build that interstate highway system and it was about promoting commerce connecting people and improving the quality of life it was a great initiative and it too was a bipartisan initiative in fact in the senate our friend senator gore vice president gore his father took the lead on that legislation the distinguished gentleman from tennessee as we heard earlier from the gentlemen from tennessee so this has all been a bipartisan initiative its about rebuilding america which is part of our reigniting the american dream to build ladders of opportunities so people who work hard play by the rules and take responsibility can have a ladder of success to climb and then put down for others to do and part of that is a make it in america so that people can make it in america and b and i get to this point build america build america build the infrastructure of america and that means everything from the highways with mass transit rapid transit highspeed rail and all kinds of technological infrastructure that we need with broadband and the rest it doesnt have any political or partisan cast to it at all it never hasuntil now and until now for reasons that are very hard to explain to the american people while we have a solution we have a challenge the authorization expires march 31 we have a bill that can be sent to the president in a matter of hours from this house of representatives this day and instead of smoothing the way the road to jobs we have the republicans putting up yet again another obstacle because they have not been able to get unity in their caucus on a bill that promotes commerce builds america promotes safety and creates jobs jobs jobs jobs so what are we doing wasting the publics time with a 60day extension i support the leadership of our ranking member mr rahall when he talks about why we have to do something better something more important something more worthy of the concerns of the american people than a parliamentary maneuver that isnt going to produce anything it doesnt even have anything attached to it that says lets do this now so that we can do something better later it has a bill that they cannot even pass on the house floor their own h r 7 if they could pass that they would their own caucus doesnt support what theyre putting forth so they expect the rest of us to cover for them well that is a real disservice to the american people it is a real disservice to the hundreds of thousands of construction workers who are out of work this job in its totality and the jobs it would save and the jobs it would create over 2 million jobs and yet instead of doing that we have a tactical maneuver for god knows what reason everything we do is about time its about time shortening the time in which people have to wait for jobs shortening the times in which people get to and from their jobs and its about time that we put the american people back to work by passing the biggest jobs bill that congress can ever pass and that is a transportation bill we have it right at our disposal mr bishop introduced it as h r 14 we brought it up earlier today and the republicans resoundingly voted against the senate bill and i understand it was a procedural vote now in a substantive vote why dont you bring that bill to the floor why dont you bring that bill to the floor and i ask the question again to my republican colleagues why dont you bring the bill to the floor that threequarters of the united states senate in a bipartisan way passed out we all want a longer bill this is the bill they can pass this is the bill we should pass so that the president can sign it into law anything else is just a conversation taking action taking the votes that is what the american people expect us to do so we can talk all we want what the american people want us to do is to act and so i reject 60 days when we can do something much better for the american people"], [0.9988932013511658, 0.9988932013511658, 0, "every day and every week you speak on this floor about the afghanistan war and previously about the iraq war and you carry a message that is extremely important one that i agree with and one that i would hope that our colleagues here in congress would take up this issue in a very strong and determined way to bring this afghanistan war to an end i thank the president for bringing the iraq war to an end and now theres yet another task for all of us to do and that is to end this continued use and abuse of the american soldiers they endure much and its time for us to bring them home we thank them for their service we see them as they return some of my colleagues and i are working on a major effort to try to deal with more than 365 000 of those men and women that have returned that are suffering from posttraumatic stress syndrome dealing with everything from suicides to depression and other issues as they return home and many of them still in the military dealing with those issues we also have the traumatic brain issues and so theres much to be done and there will be much more to be done for those that are currently suffering and the longer this war in afghanistan continues the more men and women will be suffering from all sorts of medical physical and mental issues so walter thank you so very much for what youre doing here on the floor day in and day out and reminding us that its time for us to end this war what i want to spend some time on today is really talking about americas middle class the middle class in america has suffered for the last 25 years the american middle classs circumstances have stagnated and in the last 5 yearsactually 6 yearshave seriously declined weve seen this in the statistics weve seen them in the economic statistics the only way the american middle class has been able to sustain its economic position has been for both husband and wife or children to join in providing the income for the family its no longer a singleperson income sustaining the american middle class it is about our policies here on the floor of congress and the senate that has led to the decline of the american middle class specific policies have been enacted over the last two decades that have hollowed out the opportunities that the american middle class has counted on specifically manufacturing in america once 20 million americans and their families were in the manufacturing sector they enjoyed a good salary a good hourly wage was available to them such that one individual in that family working in the manufacturing sector was able to support the family own a home take a vacation buy a boat provide for the college education that is not the case today only 11 million and a few thousand beyond that are actually engaged in manufacturing in america today so what happened to the 9 million they lost their jobs those jobs disappeared not from the earth but disappeared from america they went overseas they were outsourced american jobs were outsourced why well theyd like to say its simply the nature of the free market system and indeed thats part of it but thats not all of it a major part of it had to do with specific tax policies and other manufacturing industrial policies that were enacted by congress and remained on the books for some 20 years or more we need to address that issue because if in fact it is the policies of this congress and previous congresses that have led to the great outsourcing and decline of the american manufacturing sector and along with it the american middle class then theres something that we can do about it we make laws we establish policies and if we find that there are policies that are contrary to the good ability of the american economy to prosper and the middle class to prosper along with it then we ought to change those policies thats what the make it in america agenda is all about the make it in america agenda is specifically designed to rebuild the american manufacturing sector this is an issue thats been taken up by the democratic caucus led by our minority whip mr hoyer and carried on by my colleagues and i so were going to talk a little bit about that i notice that my colleague from new york has joined us mr tonko we were going to start out on health care but we kind of morphed into the issue of the american manufacturing industry and the role of the middle class now the middle class i went off on manufacturing and the need to rebuild that and the make it in america agenda but also a key part of the inability of the american middle class to sustain itself is health care and the affordable health care act which the supreme court recently confirmed was constitutional is constitutional is a major effort on the part of the democratic congress and president obama to provide not only health care but to lift up the american middle class so lets hold for a moment the issue of make it in america well come back to it in the latter half of this hour but lets take up the health care agenda which i know you wanted to speak to initially while youre doing that im going to run and get a couple of placards that show what it is were talking about please mr tonko from the great

weve heard from the bills supporters the bill is intended to address the boiler mact rule that was proposed by epa in april of 2010 and finalized in february of 2011 many of us here know that when the boiler mact regulation was finalized epa asked for 15 months to issue a reproposal the courts rejected that request and thus epa was forced to issue the rule on time in february of 2011 however epa immediately instituted an administrative stay on several major rules within the regulation saying that they would begin reconsideration with new information that had been made available in the last few months ive met with many industries and companies that expressed concern with the provisions in this final rule ive listened and even helped foster ongoing conversations between those industries and epa as they worked toward a reproposal of the boiler mact rule then we were offered this bill the epa regulatory relief act we were told that this bill would simply give epa the time that they had already asked for to work on the rule and repropose a new final rule after the conversations i had had with companies in my district i thought this would be a good solution the problem is when you dig a little deeper ive said for a long time this epa boiler mact rule is far from perfect but the trouble is the bill we have before us today is even further from perfect because it doesnt just give epa time to reconsider the rule it tells epa they cant issue a new rule for at least 15 months but theres no deadline for final action further it practically rewrites sections 112 and 129 of the clean air act by eliminating the need for numeric emission limits for mact standards but perhaps the most egregious to me was section 3 of the bill it once again rewrites the clean air act the clean air act provides for 3 years for compliance with mact standards with the possibility of a 4th section 3 of this bill tells us to throw that out it tells us that for the boiler mact rule compliance cannot be required for at least 5 years however it then says to the epa administrator it gives the administrator the ability to establish compliance dates so depending on who the administrator is at the time these rules are finalized compliance could be required in 5 years in 10 years in 50 years in 105 years thats just unacceptable and thats why im offering this amendment today i support many of the things in this bill and i recognize the need for a reproposal of this rule but i dont support 5 years to infinity for compliance and so this amendment will simply require that we go back to the established compliance time lines in the clean air act it even gives the possibility for an additional year of compliance if a compelling reason is found i urge my colleagues to support this amendment

highly successful this amendment would block the use of catch shares from managing our nations fisheries by superseding the regional fishery management council process set up by congress i live in the heart of a district where people have lost a tremendous amount of fish and are looking for ways to make sure that they have a fisheries industry to pass along to their children and grandchildren the sectors management system in maine has done that it has allowed innovative fishermen like members of the maine coast fishermens association to manage their small business in a way that works best for them in their own way of managing it by having an allocation and the flexibility to fish on their own schedulewhich i can tell you is far safer and far more profitablefishermen can enter into contracts with processors and avoid the race to fish improving their bottom line and their safety and its been proven over and over again some maine fishermen have even developed communitysupported fisheries coops which bring local fish to the tables of local consumers strengthening our communities while getting fishermen a better price for their catch it is critical for coastal communities and working waterfronts that fishermen are allowed to utilize the best management tools for their particular fishery catch shares may not be the best option for every fishery but that decision should be left to the industry the management experts and the scientists in their region where the fishery occurs in order to help our fishermen we should be focused on improving the stock assessments implementing cooperative research programs addressing monitoring challenges and ensuring fair enforcement this amendment would do none of these things instead it would take a critical management tool out of the toolbox to keep our fishermen on the water i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting fishermen by keeping all options available for wise fisheries management by opposing this amendment
