of chicago the south suburbs and cook and will counties a lot of industrial as well as farm communities and even though this district that i represent is so very very diverse i find there is a common message and that is the folks back home want us to come here republicans and democrats and work together to find solutions to the challenges that we face that is why i am so proud that over the last 5 years we have done so many things we were told we could not do we balanced the budget for the first time in 28 years we gave a middleclass tax cut for the first time in 16 years we reformed our welfare system for the first time in a generation and a great accomplishment just this past year was we stopped the raid on social security for the first time in 30 years that is progress on our agenda and we are continuing to move forward to find better ways to help find solutions our agenda is pretty simple paying down the public national debt saving social security and medicare helping our local schools and we also want to bring fairness to the tax code that is one of the issues i want to talk about today because i believe that as we work to bring fairness to the tax code particularly to middleclass working families that we should focus first on the most unfair consequence of our current complicated tax code and that is the marriage tax penalty which is suffered by almost 21 million married working couples let me explain what the marriage tax penalty is under our current tax code if they are married both husband and wife are working they pay more in taxes than they do if they stay single let me give this example a marriage tax penalty example a machinist and a schoolteacher middleclass working folks in joliet illinois with a combined income of 63 000 paymore and here is how they do it if they have a machinist making 31 500 he is in the 15 percent tax bracket if he marries a schoolteacher with an identical income of 31 500 under our tax code they file jointly their combined income of 63 000 pushes them into the 28 percent tax bracket and for this machinist and schoolteacher they pay the average marriage tax penalty of almost 1 400 more just because they are married under our tax code now if they chose to live together instead of getting married they would have saved that 1 400 our tax code punishes them if they choose to get married that is just wrong it is a pretty fair question is it right is it fair that under our tax code this machinist and schoolteacher in joliet illinois pay more in higher taxes let me give my colleagues another example here of two schoolteachers also of joliet illinois michelle and shad hallihan they were just married in the last couple of years a wonderful young couple i have had a chance to sit down and talk with them and of course i have a nice wedding photo the point is that shad has taught a little longer than michelle and he makes 38 000 a year his wife michelle makes 23 500 because they chose to get married to live together in holy matrimony they suffer the marriage tax penalty because their combined income when they file jointly pushes them into the 28 percent tax bracket for them for michelle and shad hallihan in joliet illinois two schoolteachers they pay almost a thousand dollars more michelle has pointed out to me since they have just had a baby that is almost 3 000 diapers that 1 000 of marriage tax penalty would pay for in that family if they were allowed to keep it now the republicans in this congress believe that eliminating the marriage tax penalty should be a priority and we believe that in this era of budget surpluses when the federal government is taking in more than we have been spending that we should give some of it back we want to focus that on bringing fairness to the tax code this past year we sent to the president legislation that would have wiped out the marriage tax penalty for people like michelle and shad hallihan unfortunately the president and vice president gore chose to veto that legislation because they wanted to spend the money on new government programs my colleagues should it not be a priority to help people like michelle and shad hallihan married working couples who work hard and who are unfairly treated by our tax code we have legislation today which now has 230 cosponsors a bipartisan majority of this house that is cosponsoring the marriage tax elimination act h r 6 cosponsored by myself and the gentleman from missouri and the gentleman from indiana as well as 230 members of the house that is why it is so important we want to bring fairness to the tax code that is why i am so pleased that the leadership of this house led by the gentleman from illinois the speaker of the house has made a decision to move a standalone piece of legislation a standalone bill which wipes out the marriage tax penalty for the vast majority of those who suffer in the next few weeks the speaker intends to bring that legislation to the floor that is good news as we work to bring fairness to the tax code by eliminating the marriage tax penalty i was just informed earlier today that the president in his state of the union speech tonight is going to discuss eliminating the marriage tax penalty that is good news because it is time to make it a bipartisan effort and while the president and vice president gore vetoed the legislation last year he is now coming our way i am very pleased let us make it a bipartisan effort let us wipe out the marriage tax penalty and let us send the president a standalone bill and let us bring fairness to the tax code"], [0.0038654287345707417, 0.0038654287345707417, 0, "i thank the gentlewoman from ohio my good friend and the gentleman from massachusetts for the opportunity to address this house i rise in strong support of eliminating the marriage tax penalty i rise in strong support of the house and senate going to conference and sending to the president this week legislation that wipes out what i consider to be the most unfair tax of all we have often asked from the well of the house a pretty simple basic question that is is it right is it fair that under our tax code 25 million married working couples pay higher taxes just because they are married is it right is it fair that 25 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 in higher taxes just because they are married and today the only way to avoid that marriage tax penalty when both the man and the women that are in the workforce is either not get married or get divorced it is wrong that under our tax code one pays higher taxes just because they are married i was so proud of this house just this past week when we passed and sent to the senate legislation which wiped out the american tax penalty for 25 million couples this afternoon the senate by a vote of 61 to 38 an overwhelming vote including democrats joining with republicans voted to eliminate the marriage tax penalty of course the bills are a little bit different we have to work out the differences the bottom line is we want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty let me give an example of a couple from the district that i represent in the south side of chicago in the south suburbs who suffer the marriage tax penalty this is michelle and shad hallihan they are two public school teachers they live just outside joliet illinois shad teaches at joliet high school michelle teaches at manhattan junior high they suffer about 1 000 in marriage tax penalty their combined income is about 62 000 they are homeowners and i would point out that since we introduced the bill to eliminate the marriage tax penalty a year and a half ago shad and michelle have since had a little baby if the democrats have their way this child will probably be out of college before we eliminate the marriage tax penalty because there is always an excuse not to do it today the bottom line is for michelle and shad hallihan and for their new little baby ben 1 400 the average marriage tax penalty is real money in the joliet area 1 400 is 3 months of day care at a local child care center for little ben 1 400 is 3 000 diapers for little ben 1 400 is one years tuition at a community college called joliet junior college in joliet illinois it is a washer and dryer for their home our legislation that passed the house of representatives will help people like michelle and shad hallihan the democrats talk about their alternative it would leave michelle and shad hallihan out they would still be stuck with the marriage tax penalty under our legislation which passed the house of representatives with the vote of every republican and also 48 democrats who broke with their leadership to support the elimination of the marriage tax penalty we helped couples two public school teachers like shad and michelle hallihan as i pointed out earlier shad and michelle are homeowners they also have a baby and of course they give money to church and charity so that means they itemize their taxes under our proposal we double the standard deduction to twice that for single people under our proposal that helps those who do not itemize but if we are going to help people like michelle and shad hallihan we have to help itemizers that means we need to widen the tax bracket so in the 15 percent bracket two joint filers a couple with two incomes have to be able to earn twice as much as what a single person can earn in that tax bracket under our proposal in the 15 percent tax bracket we widen it so that twoearner households can earn twice as much that will help shad and michelle hallihan i would point out that the proposal that the gentleman from massachusetts talked about would not help those who itemize and think about it most middleclass families who itemize their taxes itemize because they own a home or they give money to church and charity we as members of congress can all think of our neighbors back home middleclass working families who pursue the american dream they buy a home and because of their mortgage interest costs and because of their property taxes they itemize their taxes the democrats say if one itemizes their taxes they are rich so they should continue to suffer the marriage tax penalty now michelle and shad make 62 000 a year back in the south suburbs of chicago that is kind of a middleclass working family under the democrat definition of rich they are rich making 62 000 a year our goal is to make the tax code more fair when i am in the south side of chicago at a steel workers hall in the tenth ward or a legion post in joliet or at a local iron workers hall in la salle or a chamber of commerce function or coffee shop people tell me theirs taxes are too high but they also point out that the tax code is unfair that is why we should help people like michelle and shad hallihan let us eliminate the marriage tax penalty let us go to conference"], [0.003944391384720802, 0.003944391384720802, 0, "i am pleased to come to the floor of the house again on a tuesday night to talk about an issue that i talk about as often as possible and that is the problem that we have in our country and also in dealing in congress with the issue of illegal narcotics and the tremendous impact that illegal narcotics are having on our young people tonight i am going to focus a little bit on some of the issues that relate to the question of the district of columbias appropriation and some specific measures that are in the appropriations bill that deal with the district of columbia i also intend to talk a bit about the general war on drugs and review a little bit how we got ourselves into that situation time permitting i also hope to talk some about colombia and the administrations potential request which certainly will dramatically affect our spending as soon as we finish with the problems we have now in funding the fiscal year 19992000 requirements we are expecting a rather substantial request to come in by the administration and we will talk about that and colombia and how we got ourselves into that particular dilemma and i will also talk a bit about the situation in panama that whole region that has been such an active area as far as illegal narcotics trafficking and disruption in general for the entire hemisphere so those are a few subjects and then time permitting i will get into some of the updates that i usually try to do on problems relating to illegal narcotics and how they affect all our communities across the land the first thing that i want to talk about tonight is something that i hear repeatedly over and over that the war on drugs has failed that indeed we have lost the war on drugs i have some very good friends even on the conservative side and i noticed one of the columnists who is very conservative in his opinion this past week came out and said why not legalize narcotics that the war on drugs is a failure i always try to relate my topic of discussion to the facts and deal with the facts and statistics information that we have had presented to us in the subcommittee which i chair which is the subcommittee on criminal justice drug policy and human resources of the committee on government reform we have had many many hearings since i have taken that subcommittee h10852 cc over the beginning of the year dealing with illegal narcotics and we have looked at the question of whether or not the war on drugs is indeed a failure we have looked at the question of legalization in fact we probably conducted the first hearing the only hearing to date on the question of legalization and decriminalization of drug penalties we have talked in our subcommittee and held hearings on the problems wvith mexico with colombia with some of our treatment programs and most recently the education program that this congress has funded to the tune of a billion dollars over the next 5 years getting an update on that first years progress in that program additionally the southwest border and the billions of dollars we spent in federal resources at that border in trying to contain not only illegal narcotics but illegal immigration and trafficking illegal commerce across our borders so we have covered the gamut of this topic we have heard from gao dea department of justice department of defense department of state many many agencies of federal government and rely on their facts and support and statistics in our reports basically i came to the conclusion and i think my colleagues would too if they spent time in those hearings as we have done we came to the conclusion that in fact the war on drugs did not fail what happened was we had an end of the war on drugs in 1993 with the clinz ton administration which took over not only the executive branch of government which executes the law but also had very substantial majorities in both the house of representatives and also the other body the united states senate they controlled and dominated the agenda the legislative agenda and the executive and administrative operations of this government for over 2 years from 1993 through 1995 i have had these charts out before and i will refer to them once again foremost in our responsibility as a federal government are our programs to stop illegal narcotics at their squrce outside the country now state and local governments law enforcement folks cannot do that but it certainly must be done and whether we legalize what are now illegal narcotics or not we would still have a fundamental responsibility in keeping what would be an illegal commodity coming into the united states in this case it happens to be primarily heroin cocaine and methamphetamines the first thing that the clinton administration did after completely decimating the drug czars office and that was the beginning of the ending of the war on drugs they took the drug czars office down from a staffing level of over 120 to some less than 2 dozen personnel that was the first cut slash burn that ended the war on drugs"], [0.0040087467059493065, 0.0040087467059493065, 0, "this is a great opportunity this evening to talk about an issue that many of us haye raised in this congress over the last several years that is an issue that really is a fundamental issue of fairness an issue of fairness that the american people have been asking some pretty basic questions about over the last several years i represent the south side of chicago the south suburbs in cook and will counties as well as bedroom communities and farm communities in illinois and i found whether i was in the steel workers union hall in hegwish or a neighborhood in chicago or at the local legion post in joliet or the local grain elevator in tonica people often ask a basic question is it right is it fair that under our tax code that the average married working couple pays higher taxes just because they are married they say why do the folks in washington allow a tax code to be in place that tells us that if we choose to get married and work we are going to pay more in taxes they are stunned when they learn that 28 million married working couples pay an average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married clearly the marriage tax penalty suffered by working married people is fundamentally wrong and something we should change i am so pleased that the leadership of this house the speaker of the house the gentleman from illinois has made reduction and elimination of the marriage tax penalty the first priority this year first out of the box and on a fast track as a taxrelated initiative to help middleclass families the marriage tax penalty has been in place for almost 30 years and no one has gone back to fix it i am pleased this republican congress has made a decision to bring fairness to the tax code by working to eliminate the marriage tax penalty the marriage tax penalty is something that affects real people i have a photo here of a young couple from joliet illinois shad and michelle hallihan two school teachers they teach in the local public schools in joliet shad and michelle suffer a marriage tax penalty of almost a thousand dollars because they are married they recently had a child a baby and as michelle hallihan pointed out to me she said that 1 000 the marriage tax penalty that they suffer that is 3 000 diapers that they can buy for their child that goes to uncle sam instead of taking care of their child it is real money 1 400 in joliet illinois where shad and michelle live is one years tuition at joliet community college and it is 3 months of day care at a local day care center let me explain how it came about our tax code has grown more complicated and since the late 1960s married working couples moms and dads husbands and wives with two incomes have paid higher taxes just because they are married of course we have made this a priority and i would like to announce of course this wednesday the committee on ways and means is going to be marking up committee action will occur on legislation essentially to wipe out the marriage tax penalty for almost 28 million married work couples a real change that is going to help people this is how the marriage tax penalty works take a machinist and a school teacher in the south suburbs of chicago they have identical incomes this machinist is making 31 500 as a single person under our tax code he is going to be taxed at 15 percent rate so he meets a school teacher a gal with an identical income of 31 500 and they choose to get married and at the point they choose to get married they begin filing their taxes jointly when we file our taxes jointly we combine our two incomes in this case this machinist and school teacher who previously were taxed at 15 percent because they chose to get married their combined income pushes their combined income to 63 000 they pay almost 1 400 more in higher taxes because they are pushed under our tax code into the 28 percent tax bracket the higher tax bracket that is wrong but today that is the current situation for working married couples so really the incentives is in the wrong place marriage is one of the most basic institutions in our society and our tax code punishes marriage i would point out that had this machinist and school teacher chose to live together outside of marriage they would not suffer that extra tax only when they choose to get married do they pay that higher tax and i think we all agree that is wrong that we impose higher taxes on married working people i am proud to say that the house republican leadership under the leadership of speaker hastert has made elimination of the marriage tax penalty our first initiative in an effort to bring fairness to the tax code and lower the tax burden on working families this afternoon the gentleman from texas unveiled the legislation that will provide tax relief for 28 million married working couples it is similar almost identical in many ways to the marriage tax elimination act h r 6 legislation that we introduced earlier this year which now has 230 cosponsors and overwhelming majority of republicans and i am pleased that 12 democrats have joined with us in an effort to make this a bipartisan proposal let me briefly share what the proposal that we will be working on in the committee on ways and means on wednesday will do it is the goal of the house to act and approve and send to the senate by february 14 valentines day our effort to wipe out the marriage tax penalty think about it what better valentines day gift to give 28 million married working people than elimination of the marriage tax penalty this legislation will essentially wipe out the marriage tax penalty for almost everybody who suffers it that will be a big change in our tax code the legislation that we will be acting on and voting out of the house in the next couple of weeks will help 28 million married working couples for those who do not itemize their taxes they will see immediately 230 dollars in marriage tax relief for those who itemize because they own a home they will see 1 400 marriage tax relief under this legislation i would point out that this makes a big difference under our plan we provide immediate marriage tax relief in 2001 next year helping millions of couples and because we double the standard deduction for those who do not itemize for joint filers to twice that of singles 3 million married working couples will see their tax code simplified because they will no longer need to itemize and fill out extra forms so we make filing for taxes easier and for those who do itemize primarily homeowners they will see marriage tax relief as well twentyeight million married work couples will see up to 1 400 in marriage tax relief as a result of what the committee on ways and means will approve on wednesday and i expect that an overwhelming majority of this house will see it approved before valentines day what a great valentines day gift that we can give 28 million married working couples elimination of the marriage tax penalty i am joined by a number of my colleagues today who have been real leaders in the effort to eliminate the marriage tax penalty as i pointed out earlier of the 435 members of this house we need 217 to pass a bill so an overwhelming majority of the house have joined in cosponsoring this bill i am joined today by a number of cosponsors of this legislation who have stepped forward and fought hard to eliminate the marriage tax penalty at this time i would like to yield to the

primary topics one closely related to the second that first topic is trying to eliminate waste fraud and abuse in the federal government and in federal spending i want to start out by alerting members to a brief history lesson on where congressional overspending has gone over the last 30 years in fact going back to 1970 members can see the line below the baseline here is the amount of money that the congress has spent money that it did not have this is deficit quantity spending back in 1970 we began a dangerous habit and trend going down here in 1976 here we were at almost 100 billion in deficits we continued to drop and drop spending more and more without regard to the cash that was on hand for the federal government we can see here in 1982 and 1986 the height of democrat control of congress was when we were on a virtually spending spree here in washington then when deficits got at about their worst down in this area that is about the point in time that the american people changed their mind this is when the republican revolution took place americans were fed up with a congress that year after year after year from 1970 right on up to the 19921993 fiscal years had spent more money than it had on hand in fact borrowing from my children and the children of every other american in order to appease the spending appetite and habits of washington that ended at about this point here we can see the line beginning to go up when a new idea a new party was put in charge with majority status in congress members can see when we took over that the deficit spending began to ease that we began to start moving toward a goal of spending the dollars that we actually had on hand to run the legitimate purposes of the federal government back there in 1994 when republicans took over the congress they promised in a great contract with america that we would balance the budget by the year 2002 well we underpromised and overdelivered because right here in 1998 was the first year in 30 years that the expenditures came above the line here of our baseline spending in other words we began to start saving money this little purple section here represents a cash surplus that we began to accumulate here in washington d c it is this surplus that has allowed us to do a number of things one it has allowed us to stop borrowing the money i would remind my colleagues when we start borrowing money spending more money than the congress actually has to spend we borrow it from somewhere and the fund of preference for many many years has been the social security system in fact this congress and the white house has raided the social security trust fund the social security system to the tune of about 638 billion over a little bit shorter of a time frame this goes back to 1984 once again we can take a look at where we were when we came here and president clinton continued and this was the year of the tax increase and the year that the congress spent quite a lot of money at the presidents insistence again in 1998 this congress got serious about stopping the raid on social security members can see the dramatic decrease this is not the final column of the graph here this is an actual decrease in the propensity of congress to borrow from the social security system this is an effort to stop the raid on social security members can see that that does end right here this year in 1999 the first year we stopped raiding the social security system in order to pay for government that is a trend we want to see continue in fact we want to see this line continue to go down further and build greater surpluses including the social security fund in order to accomplish that we have to exercise some fiscal discipline right now this year in congress that is the debate that is taking place presently between the white house and the congress here is one of the suggestions we came up with as a republican majority to avoid raiding social security as the president has proposed to do we have proposed that of the increase in spending that we have budgeted for this year that we just tighten our belt a little bit for every dollar in federal spending we are asking the federal government to come up the federal bureaucrats and the federal agencies to come up with one cent in savings in efficiency savings in order to help rescue the social security fund and to stop borrowing from the social security system we want to stop that raid we think that out of every dollar that is spent in washington we can find that one cent in savings and continue to run the legitimate programs and the legitimate services that are needed and necessary under our federal system and do it in a way that allows us to save social security at the same time that is what that one penny on the dollar represents when we suggested this idea folks over at the white house almost had a heart attack they said one penny on the dollar we cannot possibly come up with one penny on the dollar in savings because that would cripple the federal government finding this one cent in savings therein lies the difference between the republican majority in washington and the liberal democrat leadership that we find down at the white house we believe that the government can do what every american family does every day work a little harder to find that one cent savings to just simply start realizing that we can be more efficient and more effective with a whole assortment of federal programs to find that one cent again it was a little frustrating but not surprising here in washington to hear the various cabinet secretaries say we cannot find that one penny on the dollar all of the federal departments are so efficient so lean so effective so accountable with their dollars that we cannot possibly find the savings necessary to save social security so we as members of congress decided that we would take it upon ourselves to help that is the point of todays special order i appreciate members going through that brief history with me about how it is we came to the position we are in it is a very relevant and important position to consider because at this very moment the impasse in passing a budget hinges on the difference of opinion between this congress and that white house to find that one penny and do it in a way that honors and respects not only the taxpayers of america but the children of america who rely on a sound and credibly run government and certainly the seniors the current retirees who rely on social security there are a number of great examples one of our colleagues who i have been told was planning on joining us here issued a report out of his committee and that report lists assuming i can put my fingers on it lists just agency by agency the savings that can be found here are some good examples here is the gentleman from california who has arrived in his report he e2319 suggested that we could find savings in the department of agriculture he cited examples in the department of defense the department of defense spent nearly 40 billion on programs for 15 overseas telecommunications systems that cannot be fully used because the department failed to obtain proper certifications and approvals from the host nations that is according to a 1999 inspector general report we found savings in the department of education 3 3 in loan guarantees for defaulted student loans according to one general accounting office audit there is more we will talk about more of that today he found savings in the energy department in the health and human services department administration and so on and so forth it is not hard to find savings to find that one penny if you are devoted to rolling up your sleeves and doing the hard work of finding the money it is an important proposition i suggest for this congress and for the white house rather than fighting over the relative merit of saving one penny out of a dollar to save social security we ought to be joining in partnership and rolling up our sleeves together and getting down in the trenches at the department of education in the department of defense over at the department of energy over in health and human services and working together cooperatively to find all the efficiencies and savings that we possibly can to build a credible government for the future security of our children and for our nation i yield to the gentleman from california who has led the house through this investigation of where these funds may be found and pointed not only me but other colleagues in the direction that we ought to look in order to find some of these savings"], [0.0042052180506289005, 0.0042052180506289005, 0, "of course today is known as valentines day it is a great day for those who care for one another it is a day of the heart this past week we had some important action in this house of representatives which affect 28 million married working couples who because of their heart pay higher taxes the american people have often told me that they are frustrated they think it is unfair that 21 million married working couples on average pay 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married that really is a fundamental question is it right is it fair that under our tax code 25 million married working couples on average pay 1 400 more now i represent the south side of chicago and the south suburbs in illinois and folks back home they tell me that 1 400 is a years tuition for a nursing student at a community college in illinois it is a washer and a dryer it is several months worth of car payments it is 3 months of day care but it is higher taxes money that is taken from married couples just because they are married that is wrong of course valentines day is today and today is the day that we can celebrate the fact that the house passed h r 6 legislation wiping out the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working couples let me explain how the marriage tax penalty works if one is single of course they file as a single person but when they get married they file jointly they combine their incomes the way our tax code works is if a couple is a machinist and a schoolteacher with identical incomes say a machinist makes 31 000 if he stays single he pays in the 15 percent tax bracket but if he meets and marries a public school teacher with an identical income of 31 000 their 62 000 combined income pushes them into the 28 percent tax bracket they pay the average tax penalty of almost 1 400 just because they got married right now the tax code discourages marriage by punishing it with financial penalties that is wrong this past week the house passed h r 6 and i want to commend the leadership of the house speaker dennis hastert for moving a standalone clean marriage tax elimination legislation there is no other extraneous provisions there are no excuses like the president used last year when he vetoed our effort to wipe out the marriage tax penalty we deal with one issue that is wiping out the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working couples i would point out that h r 6 helps married couples in a number of ways if one looks at who pays the marriage tax penalty one half of married couples h346 cop itemize their taxes because they own a home or give money to church or synagogue or charity or have education expenses the other half do not so we help both in the legislation that we passed we double the standard deduction for those who do not itemize for joint filers to twice that of singles and for those who do itemize and of course most middleclass families own their home so they are required to itemize their taxes so we help them by widening the 15 percent bracket so that joint filers can earn twice as much in the 15 percent bracket as a single filer it is fair that way we also help i would point out the working poor with addressing the marriage penalty that is in the eligibility for joint filers for married couples for the earned income credit to help the working poor so we double the standard deduction we widen the 15 percent bracket we address the earned income credit marriage penalty and we help 25 million married working couples by being fair it is time that we make the tax code fair it is time that we make the tax code marriage neutral so that one is not punished when they get married of course i am proud our proposal does not raise taxes on anyone else in order to wipe out the marriage tax penalty so two single people two married people no one pays more taxes than the other it is the fair way to do it and i am proud that 268 members of this house every republican and fortunately 48 democrats broke from their leadership and supported our effort to wipe out the marriage tax penalty that is progress tremendous momentum an overwhelming majority of the house supported our effort to wipe out the marriage tax penalty an issue of fairness for 25 million married working couples i am concerned though i have been told that there are some in the senate who want to load up the marriage tax elimination effort they want to put poison pills and they want to put other extraneous provisions on this bill my hope is we can avoid that my hope is that we can convince the senate to keep it a standalone clean marriage tax elimination bill that is the best approach that way it is fair there are no excuses for the president to veto it this time he said during the state of the union that he thought we should address the marriage tax penalty we want the president to keep his word we want to give the president the opportunity to do that by sending him a standalone bill there is no need for partisan politics we had a bipartisan vote when this legislation passed

safe deposit box act of 1999 how many of us over the last 30 years and i have only been in the house and had the privilege of serving here for the last 42 years have been asked in town meetings and senior citizens centers union halls vfws and other public forums when is washington going to stop dipping into when is washington going to stop raiding the social security trust fund to spend social security on other things other than social security today we are going to pass legislation that will do that that will stop the raid on social security let us review the history here for over 30 years now washington has been dipping into the s6cial security fund regardless of the rhetoric on the other side where they say it has not it has gone on back when president johnson and the democratcontrolled congress 30 years ago began raiding the social security trust fund they have run up quite a bill according to the social security trustees appointed by president clinton the social security trust fund has been raided by more than 730 billion over the last 30 years i have a check here written on the social security trust fund it is a blank check washington for the last 30 years has used the social security trust fund as a slush fund and as a blank check to pay for other programs this walls off the social security trust fund and puts a stop for those who want to raid it we set aside those funds for social security and for medicare i believe that is an important first step setting aside 100 percent of social security and locking it away before we consider any other reforms or changes to social security let us lock it away first that is an important first step we can use those funds to strengthen medicare and social security this legislation accomplishes this goal i would like to point out of course that not only is the social security and medicare safe deposit box a centerpiece of this years balanced budget but there is a big difference between the clintongore democratic budget and the republican budget the republican budget sets aside 100 percent of social security for social security the 137 billion social security surplus this year will go to social security if we compare that with the clintongore democrat budget that only uses 62 percent of social security for social security and the clintongore democrat budget spends 52 billion of social security money on other things all good programs education defense things like that but the clintongore democrat budget raids the social security trust fund this lockbox will prevent the clintongore raid on social security i would also point out that the social security and medicare safe deposit box sets aside 1 8 trillion the president talks about 62 percent sixtytwo percent is 1 3 billion over the next 10 years clintongore will raid the social security trust fund by 12 billion let us put a stop to it"], [0.0043306052684783936, 0.0043306052684783936, 0, "i come to the floor late tonight to talk about a subject i often talk about normally on tuesday nights in a special order but did not get that opportunity this week so i am here tonight to talk about what i consider to be one of the most important social problems facing not only the congress but the american people in almost every community and almost every family across our land and that is the problem of illegal narcotics in the house of representatives i have the honor and privilege of chairing the subcommittee on criminal justice drug policy and human resources of the committee on government reform and in that subcommittee we have done our best to try to bring together every possible resource of the congress and of the american government in an effort to combat illegal narcotics the ravages of illegal narcotics and its impact on our population i have spoken to many times on the floor of the house i just mentioned last week that we now exceed 15 200 individuals who died last year in 1998 from duginduced deaths this is up some nearly 8 percent over the previous year i have also talked on the floor of the house of representatives and to my colleagues about some of the policies that were passed by the clinton administration in 1993 when they controlled both the house of representatives the senate and the white house all three bodies and fairly large voting margins in the house of representatives so basically they could do whatever they wanted to do unfortunately as is now history they took a wrong turn in the effort to combat illegal narcotics they began by closing down the drug czars office from some nearly 120 employees in that office to about two dozen employees in that office they dismissed nearly all of the drug czars staff with the republican congress and through the efforts of the former chairman of the oversight committee of drug policy the gentleman from illinois who is now speaker of the house of representatives we have restored those cuts we have manpower now in that office of nearly 150 individuals under the supervision of our drug czar general barry mccaffrey under the clinton administration the source country programs to stop illegal narcotics at their source were stopped in 1993 they were slashed some 50 percent plus this took the military out of the interdiction effort which closed down much of the interdiction effort and having the coast guard work to secure some of our borders and our maritime areas those efforts were dramatically slashed and additionally other cuts were made changes in policy were made that were quite dramatic the surgeon general chief health officer of the united states appointed by the president was then joycelyn elders and that individual sent the wrong message just say maybe so we had the highest leadership in the land and we had the highest health officer developing a different policy a policy that really failed us i have some dramatic charts here tonight that show exactly what happened i had our subcommittee staff put these together to show the longterm trend and lifetime prevalence of drug use we can see during the reagan and bush administration that the longterm trend in lifetime drug use was on a decline and i have talked about this and sort of illustrated it by hand but we have graphically detailed this from 1980 when president reagan took office on down to where president clinton took office i do not think there is anything that i have shown on the floor that can more dramatically illustrate the direct effects of that change in policy and that policy as we can see had illegal narcotics going up what is interesting is we see a slight change here and that is after the republicans took control of the house of representatives and the united states senate and started to put as i say humpty dumpty back together again because we basically had no drug war here if we want to call it a drug war we have actually almost doubled the amount of money for treatment now just putting money on treatment of those afflicted by illegal narcotics not having the equipment the resources the interdiction the source country programs is like conducting a war and just treating the wounded someone told me it is sort of like having a mash unit and not giving the soldiers any ammunition or the ability to fight or conduct the war and this is so dramatically revealed in this chart what is interesting if we look at some other charts of specific narcotics we see sort of a steady upanddown trend and a good trend down during the bush administration in the longterm lifetime prevalence in the use of heroin in the clinton administration it practically shoots off the chart and again when we restarted our war on drugs through the leadership of the gentleman from illinois who claired the subcommittee with this responsibility before me and in this republicancontrolled congress there was a renewed emphasis a change in policy employing a multifaceted approach which again began attacking drugs at their source again employing interdiction again trying to utilize every resource that we have in this effort and it is a national responsibility to stop illegal narcotics at their source and now here we see graphically displayed what has happened with heroin use what is absolutely startling is that some of this usage in this area these dramatic increases we had an 875 percent increase in teen use of heroin in that period of time that we see here with the clinton administration eight hundred seventyfive percent and we are experiencing dozens and dozens of deaths in my central florida community from this heroin because it is not the same heroin that was on the streets in the 1980s or the 1970s that had a purity of 6 and 7 percent this is 80 and 90 percent pure these young people take it and they die and there are mffore and more of them using it but we have managed to begin to turn this around through the efforts again of a republicanled congress and this shows again some dramatic change in usage this is another absolutely startling chart that our staff has prepared we traced the longterm trend in the prevalence of cocaine use in the reagan administration we see here where we had a problem and i remember as a staffer working with senator hawkins who led some of the effort in the united states senate back in the early 1980s that they began the downturn in the bush administration incredible progress was made back in the clinton administration we see again a rise of cocaine use and drug abuse and this is basically where they closed down the war on drugs now what is very interesting is we are at a very important juncture here in the house of representatives we need 13 appropriations measures to fund the government and among the 13 appropriations measures one of those is to fund and assist with the finance and operations of the district of columbia many people do not pay much attention to this some of the members pay little attention to this but i think that the situation with the district of columbia is very important to talk about tonight as it relates to changes in drug policy we have to remember that one of the major issues of contention here between the republican congress and between the democrat side of the aisle is a liberalization of drug policy that manifests itself in two ways first there is support on the other side of the aisle for a needle exchange program in the district there is also an effort here to allow the medical use of marijuana and liberalization of some of the marijuana laws here two policies with a liberal slant now let me say something about the liberal policies that have been tried and i have used this chart before let me take this chart and put it up here this is the policy of baltimore which baltimore adopted some 10 years ago baltimore has a needle exchange program that needle exchange program has resulted in 1996 in 38 900 according to dea at that time drug addicts so they started a needle exchange program they lost population and they gained dramatic increase in drug addiction particularly heroin addiction now this is the chart from 1996 i have a time magazine article from september 6 and it says and this is not my quote it is a quote from this article it says one in every 10 citizens is a drug addict and that is more to what the representative from maryland in that particular area has told me however listen to this government officials dispute the last claim here is a quote and it is not my quote it is more like one in eight says veteran city councilwoman rikki spector and we have probably lost count so a liberal policy that this house of representatives democrat representation wants for washington that this president wants for washington has been tried in baltimore this is the result i also will illustrate what has taken place in new york city with the murder decline in new york city you have mayor rudy giuliani who has adopted a zero tolerance nononsense get tough and the opposite of a liberal policy but a tough policy from the 2000 mark they are down to the 600 level in other words in baltimore baltimore in 1997 and i checked the figures had 312 murders in 1998 they had 312 murders no decline static and with a liberal policy here is a tough policy and we see a dramatic decrease it is almost a 70percent decrease in murders i think if you look at these murders in both of these cities you will find that they are drug and illegal narcotics related so the question before the congress and the question before us tonight is really do we adopt a liberal policy now we have been there and we have done that i came to this congress in 1992 and watched how with the other side controlling the house the senate and the white house what they did they had 40 years of control of this body and over policy of the district of columbia we have had a little more than 4 years this is what we inherited we inherited almost threequarters of a billion dollar deficit that they were running here here are some of the statistics about what had happened in washington and i will read these from the washington post and some other articles they are not my quotes or statements but the facts are although the district of columbia was 19th in size among american cities its fulltime employee population then was 48 000 we have got it down to some 33 000 kicking and screaming it was only exceeded by new york and los angeles when we inherited that responsibility so we had a liberal policy which gave us one of the highest debts of any local government in the nation one of the highest number of employees and the question was was enough revenue coming in d c also had revenues per capita of 7 289 which at that time was the highest in the nation we have managed in a little over 4 years to balance the budget in this budget that is being presented that is being vetoed and the d c appropriations measure that is being vetoed has been vetoed by the president the debt that the average citizen had was one of the highest figures in the united states at 6 354 and that is what we inherited here the other side is always concerned about how policies affect people the republicans inherited the district of columbia this is an article from 1995 when we inherited it of the impending cutbacks at d c general this is the hospital make it apparently inevitable that washingtons own public hospital will close its trauma center and who would be hurt the hardest this article says that thousands of poor and expensivetotreat patients would be those who were hurt this is what we inherited now we have gotten this in order and the question is do we want to go back to those liberal policies and highspending hightaxing policies here is a great story talk about helping children after 6 months in the district bureaucratic trenches this is a woman who came from guam and was a welfare specialist and this is quoted from 1995 in the washington post this lady quit saddened and shocked she said by a foster care system so bad that it actually compounds the problems of neglected children and their families she said she came here from guam she worked in guam and she said then to come here and see one of the worst situations it is depressing this is what the republican majority inherited and this is what the other side would like to go back to with again their liberal policies their tax policies here is an article that i saved from 1996 ghost payrolls ought to determine dead retirees in district getting pensions again a system out of control again the question of responsibility and education this is what we inherited in 1995 currently we have 20 condemned boilers in the schools 103 of 230 buses are nonoperational because of the budget crisis and at that time again they were spending threequarters of a billion over their budget and very sadly i recall and i saved this article it says with past due st elizabeth skimps on childrens meals they want to go back to those wonderful days of yesteryear when they controlled the district of columbia for some 40 years this is what they did for those people that they supposedly care about after taxing them nearly to death running business running population out this is a quote some mentally ill children at the districts st elizabeths hospital have been fed little more than rice jello and chicken for the last month after some suppliers refused to make deliveries because they havent been paid and they had not been paid even with running a supplement from the taxpayers across the united states of threequarters of a billion dollars running in debt the housing program in the district of columbia again to return to those wonderful days of yesteryear when they controlled the house of representatives the senate and the white house this is 1995 according to a unitedstates department of housing and urban development rating system the district subsidized housing program achieved the lowest ranking of any urban public housing agency in the nation on a scale where a score below 60 places an agency in the troubled category the districts rating plunged from 37 in 1991 to 19 in 1993 they ran it into the ground and now they want to do it again what is interesting is i had another chart here that i wanted to show but i will not have time tonight i will try to get back to it next tuesday when we continue our effort to show why we should not go to a liberal policy on narcotics on spending on taxation that is being proposed by the other side of the aisle do i have any time

tie back on i think i got it on straight and i even buttoned my tab i want to thank the gentleman for holding this special order because there are a couple of areas which i want to the gentleman to talk about one i heard the gentleman on the socialsecurity issue the other is where the president claims to put a percentage in medicare and actually draws out 9 billion out of medicare when we talk about doubleusing figures in a budget and the president takes out 9 billion and then puts in money and then takes money out of social security and then puts 62 percent in and he takes those billions of dollars and spends them on programs then when it comes to our budget time he claims that we are cutting programs first of all we believe in maintaining the caps a balanced budget to us is very very important for those it is not we will see in every single bill except for defense that our liberal colleagues over here will increase spending regardless of what the program is they will pay for anything a chicken in every pot that is where our big disagreement is in the field of education i was chairman of the committee on k through 12 before i went on the committee on appropriations gao said that for direct lending programs when it was capped at 10 percent it cost 1 billion annually 1 billion not a million just to administer it out of the government that was when it was capped at 10 percent it cost 4 billion to 5 billion to collect because the department of education did not have the collection funds the president wanted the direct lending program to go to 100 percent i absolutely fought tooth hook and nail from doing that because of the waste rather than letting it go to private the government shut down at that time that was one of the presidents key points we got blamed for it but at the same time our leadership said duke we need to let this go to 40 percent i said no i want to zero because we can get more student loans out of the private sector at reduced cost instead of having uncle sam here do it they negotiated they let it go to 40 percent they put in just a few language words in the bill that neither the president nor the democrats saw but it limited the amount of money that went to the bureaucracy we added and paid additional money to the eisenhower grants we increased idea for special education to the highest level ever that was possible as a matter of fact i was the chairman that started the idea program along with the gentleman from pennsylvania and when i was subcommittee chairman we enhanced and increased student loans by 50 percent by limiting the amount of bureaucracy i think the overall aspect of the differences as the gentleman said it right we want to give people the freedom instead of having government control their lives i had a committee hearing we had 16 different groups come in and each of them had one of the best ideas in the whole world for education programs in their district at the end of the hearing i asked which of the 16 had any one of the other 15 in their districts and not a single one i said that is the whole point what we want is to get you the money directly let you decide what is good for your particular district because there may be a difference from san diego where the speaker is from and maryland or the gentleman from colorado and let the teachers the families and the community make those kinds of decisions yet the big government way would be to take all 16 of them spread them out give very little money for them and defuse all of them that is what has happened over the last 40 years here in the field of education we want to get the money to the classroom there is a bureaucracy group here that wants to keep it i would ask the gentleman and i would ask the speaker i want to members to look up on the web page and i will say it very slowly www dsausa org that stands for the democrat socialists of america in there their socialist agenda is government control of private property just as the gentleman spoke of where the government owns over 50 percent of the state where i belong california yet they want to enhance it even more they want governmentcontrolled health care they want government control of education they want the unions to have power over small business because they support big government dominance they want to pay for it by increasing our taxes to the highest progressive tax ever and they want to pay for it also by cutting defense by onehalf in there is the progressive caucus there are 58 democrat members in the democrat caucus that are poster children in the web page for the democrat socialists of america 58 of them on my left side they want government control of health care they want to tie up all the government lands privately owned to government control if they cannot control it directly they want to control it with the endangered species they want to control it with osha they want to control it with epa whatever this is not the

when representing a diverse district of course one wants to listen and find out what is a common message and i find as i listen and learn the concerns of the people of this very diverse district they tell me one very clear message and that is the people of our part of illinois want solutions solutions to the challenges that we face in fact in 1994 when we were elected they sent us here with a very clear message that was part of that effort to find solutions and that is we want to change how washington works and make washington responsive to the folks back home when we were elected in 1994 we wanted to bring solutions to balance the budget to cut taxes to reform welfare to tame the irs there were an awful lot of folks in washington who said we could not do any of those things because they had always failed in the past but i am proud to say that we did i am pretty proud of our accomplishments balancing the budget for the first time in 28 years cutting taxes for the first time in 16 years reforming welfare for the first time in a generation taming the irs for the first time ever we produced a balanced budget that is now projecting a 2 3 trillion that is t as in tom trillion dollars surplus of extra tax revenue we produced a 500 per child tax credit that will now benefit three million illinois children we produced welfare reform that has now lowered rolls in illinois by 25 percent and taxpayers now enjoy the same rights with the irs that they do in the courtroom and that is a taxpayer is innocent until proven guilty those are real accomplishments but we continue to face challenges in this congress and because this congress held the presidents feet to the fire we balanced the budget and now we are collecting more in taxes than we are spending and the question is today what do we do with that extra tax money what do wedo with that 2 3 trillion surplus of extra tax revenue i believe its pretty clear what the first priority is and i think we all agree we want to save social security we want to save social security first and i want to point out that last fall this house of representatives passed the 9010 plan which would have set aside 90 percent of the budget surplus the extra tax revenue to save social security two weeks ago in this very room the president said we now only need 62 percent well we agree we want to make the first priority and we certainly agree that at least 62 percent of the surplus tax revenue should be reserved for saving social security the question is what do we do with the rest some say particularly bill clinton we should save social security and spend the rest on new big government programs now i disagree i believe we should save social security and give the rest back in tax relief the question is it is simple whose money is it in the first place if my colleagues go to a restaurant and they pay too much they overpay their bill the restaurant refunds their money they do not keep it and spend it on something else well clearly in this case the government is collecting too much well let us give it back the question is do we want to save social security and create newgovernment programs and spend the rest of the surplus or do we want to give it back by saving social security and eliminating the marriage tax penalty and rewarding retirement savings tax foundation says today that the tax burden is pretty high in fact for the average family in illinois 40 percent of the average familys income in illinois now goes to washington and springfield and local taxing bodies at every level in fact since bill clinton was elected in 1992 the total amount of tax revenue collected has gone up 63 percent since 1992 clearly taxes are too high we can help working taxpayers we can help working taxpayers we can help working families let us save social security and cut taxes let us save social security and eliminate the marriage tax penalty let us save social security and reward savings for retirement some say we cannot but i believe we can just as we balanced the budget for the first time in 28 years it is because we also cut taxes for the first time in 16 years reformed welfare for the first time in a generation and tamed the irs for the first time ever we can also save social security and lower taxes for working families and bring that tax burden down for the first time in a long time let us save

to i urge my colleagues to vote aye pass something and think they are mr gekas i yield going to solve the problem myself such time as i may consume i understand the concern of the gen i wanted to say to all tleman from pennsylvania mr of those who opposed the amendment gekas but that does not answer the on the floor particularly the ones on concern it does not solve the problem our side of the aisle on the republican every time we run into a conflict and side that i was elated a few years back there is no deadline we just put it off when this same proposition came up in that is the nature of the legislative the midst of the debate on disaster rebusiness lief i was overjoyed when i saw that so i say to the members we make a the gentleman from florida chairman serious mistake if we think there is young and the gentleman from kentucky others who oppose this legislation voted in favor of the gekas amendment of that era the rationale was exactly the same and the prospects were exactly the same and the result would have been exactly the same it would have been in operation today had the president not vetoed it it is the fault of the president that we do not have a continuing resolution an instant replay concept like the one we are proposing here today he vetoed the disaster relief program that contained the gekas amendment of that era now what i am imploring the members to consider is to replicate that which was said by the gentleman from maryland and the gentleman from iowa that this is not about this congress and the makeup of the personalities and egos of this congress the gentleman from florida and i are going to be friends way beyond our service in the congress but both of us can look back i would presume to say that we put some mechanism into play as incumbent legislators for the good of the future of our government the future of our system the bolstering of our constitution how anyone can say that it would be automatic pilot has to forget the fact that when we vote for this amendment we are saying that is what we want for the american people we want a continuing automatic transition until the appropriators can work out a budget i want this bill to pass not for me or for the gentleman from florida but i want it to pass for the future congresses of the united states long after we are gone to put something stable and something of which we can be proud to know that forever and ever never again will the government of the united states shut down and particularly will that never occur again when we are poised for some emergency action and then become toothless in the face of the inability of the members of congress to come to an agreement let us support the gekas amendment today is a great day for the american people soon the house will be voting to approve a measure of which all americans can embrace and be proud the government shutdown prevention act unfortunately the image of government shutdowns from the 104th congress remains etched in the mind of the american citizen as shamefuland unnecessaryincidents in our nations history as taxpayers they were incensed that the government would choose not to perform its essential duties as statesmen we were all embarrassed to have forsaken our obligations to the american people while the republican congress was blamed for the shutdowns i believe we were all responsible for this disgraceful exhibition of failed governance the house the senate republicans democrats and the president before us today is a message to the american people an affirmation if you will in the h3134 co form of an amendment which states that we the congress will not forsake the american peoples tust to deliver essential government services and allow for another shameful govemnment shutdown in this fiscal cycle we will achieve this by voting for my amendment to provide 100 percent of a fiscal years spending levels to continue through the end of the next fiscal year in the absence of a regularly passed appropriations bill or a continuing resolution since my election to the house of representatives in 1982 i have witnessed eight government shutdowns the worst of which occurred when our soldiers were poised for battle in the persian gulf it was at this time that i introduced my first govemment shutdown prevention bill what i referred to as an instant replay mechanism at the time i knew i was facing an uphill battle in a long war after all the threat of a shutdown is one of the most effective weapons in the arsenal of legislative politics however i remained vigilant with the image in my mind of our fighting men and women ready to sacrifice their lives as they stood poised for operation desert storm without an operating government for which to fight i pledged never to let that happen again today i and others proudly stand ready to fulfill that pledge as the house prepares to vote on the government shutdown prevention act amendment now before us so that we can send a clear message to the american people that we will no longer allow them to be pawns in budget disputes between congress and the white house without question we should

mandated this study congress has received its mandated report and yet last year we gave 448 million about half of what is called for only 3 percent of the total nih budget for diabetes that is simply 28 per patient that is not enough yet every day research and new technologies are improving diabetes diagnosis and treatment for example current diagnostic methods cannot always detect adult onset diabetes at the earliest stage of the disease but a new technology has been developed that will diagnose adult onset diabetes as much as 5 years earlier than any current method by scanning the eye retina with low intensity florescent light an early diagnosis can significantly reduce the risk of serious complications we need to increase research for diagnosis blood testing is also becoming less obtrusive a continuous glucose monitoring system recently approved by the fda continuously and automatically monitors glucose levels underneath the skin future generations of this device may permit the patient to monitor blood levels and connect to an insulin pump for seamless care a glucowatch a device worn like a wristwatch will test blood levels easily and painlessly this device which is pending fda approval is as successful at blood testing as conventional methods that require pricking the finger multiple times every day and causes only a slight tingling sensation we need to increase research for blood monitoring we also must increase research for treatment for example we are at the brink of developing an ability to inhale insulin rather than inject it into the body multiple times per day another burden for people with diabetes is the need to inject themselves with insulin several new drugs taken orally may reduce the need to take insulin injections one class of drugs called insulin sensitizers helps to lower blood glucose primarily by reducing insulin resistance in muscles other groups of drugs work by suppressing glucose production from the liver increasing insulin production by the pancreas or decreasing sugar absorption from the intestine for those who will still need insulin a power is being developed that can be inhaled so that injections might not be necessary we need to increase research for treatment in juvenile diabetes type 1 insulinroducing cells called islets are destroyed making daily insulin injections necessary the juvenile diabetes foundation jdf has established three centers for islet transportation which will attempt to transplant healthy islets to cure juvenile diabetes and find new ways to prevent transplant rejection and other dangerous sideeffects the nih and the jdf are also developing new ways to manipulate the immune system by inhibiting harmful immune responses while keeping protective ones intact we need to increase research for cures ultimately genetics may hold the key to a cure the american diabetes association has initiated the genetics of noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus gennid study in order to maximize the rapid identification of the gene or genes involved in adultonset diabetes this study has established a national database and cellbank to store information and specimens from families with long histories of the disease the human genome project which is currently mapping the entire human genetic structure may also provide significant clues to the nature of diabetes again we need to increase research for treatment but the fight goes on we must increase support and research for diabetes for diagnosis for monitoring for treatment and ultimately for a cure"], [0.989748171530664,

this committee could not find anyone to manage this piece of legislation no one thought it was significant enough to take the time to manage so i kind of am stuck with this responsibility my understanding of this legislation is that right now on the w2 forms there is an aggregate number of the fica tax and the hi tax and what this basically will do will break it up into employer employee taxes now bear in mind that the information is already provided by the social security administration beginning this year the social security administration will be sending out on an annual basis to everybody that pays the payroll tax the aggregate amount over the lifetime of the individual of both the hi tax and the payroll tax the fica tax and broken down from management or the employer and employee side so that information is provided there is no secrecy involved in it it will be provided to every taxpayer every employee on a lifetime basis every year so there is no secret to it in fact what this will do is probably put an additional small burden on the employer because now the employer perhaps will have to go back to the computers and make some adjustments but i guess that is not an unfunded mandate although i am not quite sure it could be an unfunded mandate but i do not think anybody will object to it because it is not that big of a deal most employers will probably be able to do it i might also say just to have no misunderstandings about this that we are not going to oppose this legislation the more information to the public the better off we are and if breaking it down from employer employee side gives more information to the average citizen more to it the only problem is that i did hear on the other side as i was coming in that the whole issue of true costs then people will be able to figure out the real true costs and obviously rate of return they are going to get but this really will not have any relevance to that because i have done a lot of studies on social security and the fact of the matter is that right now the overhead costs on ones social security benefits the money coming in and going out is about 1 percent we have done some studies had some hearings in the committee on ways and means the subcommittee on social security and we find that actually the costs of maintenance if one privatizes and actually invests in the private market is about 20 percent because there are fund managers and all of that and we are not going to put that on that w2 form because that would be too much trouble then once there are the aggregate benefits in the trust fund and one is ready to retire then they have to amortize the account that will cost another 20 percent so we are talking anywhere from 35 40 maybe even 45 percent in terms of the overall cost if the social security system is privatized whereas the overall cost is 1 percent in terms of the current social security system so this does not give anybody any comparison again as i said the more information the better off we are and so we are not going to oppose this just in conclusion it would be my hope that we begin to focus on the real issue of social security is that how do we deal over the next 35 years with the fact that we are going to have a 25 to 30 percent shortfall in the social security system that is a big issue and we need on a bipartisan basis to come up with a solution to that because that is going to hit us much sooner than we expected the reality is that we cannot leave the uncertainty in the system that we currently have i urge a yea vote on this resolution and i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.9861248871311545, 0.013875112868845463, 1, "i thank my friend from louisiana for yielding to me and i can identify with that story that my friend from arkansas told about making the circle with the harvesting machine and trying to figure out what the yield was and what kind of return his friend was going to have i have done that a few times myself i would tell the gentleman that i do not ever remember writing it on my pant leg but i used to write it on the palm of my hand that is something a lot of our ag people do i wanted to take this opportunity today to speak to the congress and to the people of america about my notion about this country and where we are and where we should be going i was listening this morning to one of the local talk shows i guess it was the cspan washington journal i heard a caller call in and talk about our country and the fact that no major power had ever lasted 300 years that may be true the truth is also that no other democracy in this world has ever lasted as long as ours has none has ever lasted 200 years and this caller was saying that america is on the brink of demise well i am here today to dispute that i think our country is stronger than it has ever been in its history if we just look at the numbers and look at the facts we are the strongest and greatest country in the world militarily we are the only true superpower left with the demise of the soviet union we are truly the greatest country in the world economically at a time when many countries around the world asia russia central and south america are going through some very difficult economic times we are flourishing even our federal reserve chairman alaif greenspan says that the economy is doing great and the outlook is superb i think that that does not come very easy though there has been a lot of hard work on the part of all the american people to make sure that we move forward to make sure that our economy stays strong to make sure that each generation has a better quality of life than their parents did we are sort of at a crossroads now here in congress and i want to talk briefly about that we are at a crossroads because for the first time in 30 years this congress after receiving the demand from the american people has adopted a course of fiscal responsibility we have come to an era where we are not spending more money than we take in we have come to an era where we do not talk about 200billion 300 billion annual deficits any more we talk about surpluses just 6 or 7 short years ago in 1992 this country or this government that runs this country spent some 290 billion more than it took in and last year in 1998 this federal government took in about 60 billion more so we went from a 290 billion deficit to a 60 billion surplus now i have heard a lot of people argue about who is responsible for that whether it was ronald reagan bill clinton or this congress or that congress i think the american people probably had more to do with it the american worker is more productive the american capitalist is more ingenious in how he spends his money and uses his money around the world and i am very proud of that and i think the american people should be very proud of that i think what i want to do today is bring a warning about the idea of surplus the socalled 60 billion surplus that this government had last year of that 60 billion 100 billion came out of the social security trust fund in other words exclusive of the social security program this government had about a 40 billion deficit last year and so we ought not to be talking about how we spend the surplus when we do not really have one i know there are people on either side of that aisle over there and i always wondered when i served in the state legislature where that term on the other side of the aisle or on this side of the aisle came from and i guess now i know once i have arrived here in congress but we will find people on one side of the aisle who want to take the socalled surplus which i submit to my colleagues is not really a surplus and spend it on a new program we find others who want to spend it maybe on tax cuts now each of these ideas has some merit but i would submit to my colleagues that with a 5 6 trillion debt that this country owes that we ought to do something else with that surplus we ought to take it and pay down the debt we ought to shore up the programs that we have in existence we ought to make sure that we are able to fulfill the commitments that we have already made and where are those commitments a couple of them are in social security and medicare now i have heard a lot of talk in the last week or so about the presidents budget and his plan for social security and i think we all know that what the president has submitted to us is a starting point he certainly has done a good job in saying to us to congress and the american people in saying that we are not going to spend that money until we make some substantive reforms in social security and make sure that it is solid through the year 2075 or 2100 and i think this is a reasonable thing to do now we all know the president did not make any recommendations on substantive reforms and that is something that this congress has to begin to deal with in concert with the president so i look foiward to getting bisy on that task of making those substantive reforms in the meantime i think that the proposal to set that money aside is a reasonable proposal after all it did come into the social security trust fund to start with so it certainly should not be used for something else there is another up side to paying down the federal debt the public debt and that is part of what the president has proposed my colleagues the money that it costs to service the debt of this nation is about 215 billion annually 215 billion that is almost as much as our national defense budget on an annual basis think of the things that we can do with 215 billion if we had that and we did not have to pay it to our creditors that money does not buy us one cop on the street it does not put one new teacher in the classroom and it does not put one new gi in the field to defend this country all it does is pay for the excesses of the past i wish that we had that 215 billion to do something else with and then we could really have a lively debate about tax cuts or spending programs so i think the first thing we ought to do is begin to pay down that debt and reduce that interest bill it is what any prudent constituent that my colleagues have would do it is what any prudent businessman would do it is what any prudent local government whether it be a county or a school board or a city would do if they had extra money and they owed a debt they would go pay it off so i think that is a reasonable approach in the meantime that works hand in glove with shoring up the social security system my colleagues we already have in law that commitment we have a tremendous unfunded liability in the social security system into the 21st century so there is nothing wrong with setting aside money to cover that unfunded liability now if we want to change the law and take away that liability that is a different issue i do not think that is something the american people are going to stand for we need to remember that the social security system is one of the programs that has enabled us to advance as a society and each generation become more affluent and live a better quality of life i have one statistic that i like to quote from time to time when i speak to my kiwanis clubs and lions clubs and that is in 1963 a year prior to the advent of the medicare system over 55 percent of the people in this nation who reached retirement age the age of 65 lived in poverty that is just 36 years ago over 55 percent of the folks who reached retirement age lived below the poverty level do my colleagues know what that figure is today 35 years after the advent of medicare and 55 to 60 years after the advent of social security that figure is less than 10 percent those two programs have been very important to us in our advancement as a society and i think that they should be on the top of the list in terms of what we do budgetarily i want to speak to one other issue before i yield back if i might and that is that i talked earlier about the economy and how well it is going and we really are in a very unusual situation with unemployment at 4 percent the lowest it has been in 25 years we have got real domestic growth at about almost 4 percent that is double the 25year average we have got inflation at less than 2 percent there are some real special things going on in this country economically but there is a sector of our economy that is not doing well and that is our agricultural folks i would like to remind my fellow members of congress that the agricultural economy industry is very critical to this nation it is critical to our food supply and it is critical to our national security we never want to put ourselves in a situation where we are totally dependent upon some other country for our food supply i would implore this congress to look seriously at our national agricultural policy i do not think we have a good national agricultural policy we had one and we sort of undid it in 1996"],

proud of and it honors the contributions of those very brave space explorers the apollo astronauts who helped humanity to achieve the dream of finally setting foot on the moon it is hard to believe that more than 3 decades have passed since neil armstrong and buzz aldrin first stepped out onto the lunar surface while mike collins orbited overhead their accomplishments and those of the apollo astronauts who followed them made all of us proud to be americans and so it is fitting that we honor them with this award it is also fitting that we honor the brave astronauts who preceded them in the missions that helped prepare for that first moon landing in that process we especially need to remember the three heroes virgil gus grissom edward white and roger chaffee who lost their lives in the tragic apollo 1 fire back in 1967 they made the ultimate sacrifice to help push back the frontier and i am glad that this bill recognizes their contributions some day in the nottoodistant future i expect that we will go back to the moon and i believe we will ultimately go further to mars and beyond when we do we will be building on the accomplishments of not only the brave astronauts that we honor in this piece of legislation but also on the efforts of all of the thousands and thousands of men and women who worked on the apollo project their contributions large and small all helped make apollo a success while we cannot honor each of them by name i hope that they take pride in what they accomplished and know that we salute them back several congresses ago as a matter of fact in the
