of title xviir of the united states code the federal rules of criminal procedure and the federal rules of evidence the bill was drafted by the subcommittee on criminal justice after consultations with interested parties including the unitedstates department of justice the administrative office of unitedstates courts the american bar association the federal public and community defenders and the national association of criminal defense lawyers the technical amendments correct grammatical punctuation and spelling errors the other amendments make minor substantive changes in current law for

provision to permit the transmittal of gambling information if gambling is legal in the state from which the information is transmitted and in the foreign country to which the information is transmitted another minor substantive change concerns the temporary release of a person who is hospitalized following an acquittal by reason of insanity for a serious offense current law is silent about such furloughs the bill amends current law to provide that such a person may be temporarily released from the hospital only if first the committing court approves second a federal law enforcement officer accompanies the person or third thereis an emergencysuch as the persons need for immediate medical attention a death of a family member would not be an emergency within the meaning

conducted by a licensed psychologist who is not a physician rule 35 a however unambiguously precludes selecting such a person the massey court erred in not following the rule even if in that courts opinion the purpose of the rule was served by permitting a licensed psychiatrist to conduct the examination no matter how desirable that outcome as a matter of policy the massey decision is wrong as a matter of rule interpretation the massey courts conclusion that a licensed psychologist is as capable as a psychiatrist of carrying out mental examinations is consistent with section 142 of the bill

federal courts and the federal rules of evidence in brief the rulemaking procedure begins with an advisory committee of the judicial conference of the united states preparing an initial draft of a proposed new rule or amendment to an existing rule which it submits to the judicial conferences standing committee on rules of practice and procedure the judicial conference reviews any proposal recommended by the standing committee and submits that proposal together with the conferences recommendation to the supreme court the supreme court acts upon the judicial conferences recommendation and must before may 1 of any year promulgate any new rule or amendment to an existing rule of which it approves a new rule or amendment promulgated by the supreme court does not take effect until 90 days after promulgation 180 days after promulgation in the case of the federal rules of evidence in order to give congress an opportunity to review the new rule or amendment before it takes effect the rules enabling acts process worked well for many years with the federal rules becoming a model for the states new rules and amendments to existing rules routinely took effect without any congressional intervention in recent years however congress has taken a greater interest in new rules and amendments promulgated under the rules enabling acts congress intervened in 1973 to delay indefinitely the effective date of the proposed federal rules of evidence and subsequently enacted a congressional lydrafted rules of evidence along with an enabling act for the rules of evidence since then congress frequently has intervened either to delay the effective date of disapprove or modify rules and amendments promulgated under the rules enabling acts see h r rep no 422 99th cong 1st sess 79 131 cong

similar the supersession clause of the rules enabling act for the federal rules of civil procedure for example provides that all laws in conflict with any such rules shall be of no further force or effect after such rules have taken effect originating in the rules enabling act of 1934 this clause sought to ensure the replacement of a large number of procedural statutes that it was believed would have been difficult to identify before those rules were promulgated see s burkank the rules enabling act of 1934 130 u pa l rev 1015 105054 1982 in addition the clause was thought necessary in order

the pleading practice and procedure statutes and repealed the cbnformity act the supersession clause therefore no longer serves the purpose forwhich it was intended in addition to having fulfilled its purpose the supersession clause is unnecessary today because congress tends to legislate against the backdrop of the existing federal rules of practice and procedure see eg comprehensive crime control

misdemeanors before united states magistrates additionally congress has responded promptly when the judicial conference has criticized practice or procedure statutes that interfere with the efficient and just administration of the judicial system for example over many congresses a series of civil priorities were engrafted into the united states code judicial conference criticisms off those provisions led congress to repeal them pub l no 98620 401 98 stat 335657 1984 see h rep no 1062 98th cong 2d sess 1984 thus in practical terms the supersession clause is unnecessary moreover as a

and states rights it clearly grandfathers all existing systems that states have in place today are in process of putting in place for monitoring existing nuclear powerplants and keep in mind that we

commission would be receiving in the event of an accident the exact same parameters and the bill asks the states to pay for their share of this information of collecting this what is wrong with that

ensure that appropriate state and local officials are adequately informed about offsite radiological conditions and sixth advise the licensee based upon the chairmans assessment of the situation

more homemarch 5 1 987 less people in america today than at any time since the great depression despite the last 4 years of economic recovery the homeless population has been growing at the rate of about 25 percent a year and the number of homeless is expected to increase still further unless action is taken the explosion in the number of homeless americans has outrun the ability of local governments and charitable organizations to cope with the problem cities across the country report that homeless peopleincluding families with childrenare routinely being turned away from emergency shelters due to the lack of space efforts to deal with the homeless crisis have been hampered by persistent myths about who the homeless are why they are in such a desperate situation and what can be done to help them there are six myths which perpetuate a distorted picture of the homeless these myths are first most of the homeless have always lived this way second the homeless are almost entirely made up of single adults third the vast majority of the homeless are the chronically mentally ill who generally choose to be homeless fourth state and local governments and charitable organizations have the resources to handle the homeless problem fifth economic growth will solve the problem and sixth the federal government cannot afford to deal with the homeless the facts are first most of the homeless have become homeless only in recent years second families with children are the fastest growing group among the homeless now comprising almost onethird of the homeless population third the mentally ill which make up only 29 percent of the total number of homeless are not a majority of the homeless and while some do refuse assistance most mentally ill homeless have not chosen to live that way fourth existing shelter programs are already filled beyond capacity despite the best efforts of charitable organizations and local governments to create more shelters fifth there is no correlation between an expanding economy and solving the homeless problem in fact the fastest growth in homelessness has occurred during the current economic recovery and sixth modest andtargeted federal funding can greatly improve the lives of the homeless without straining the budget in response to the alarming increase in homelessness in the last few years homeless relief legislation has been a high priority of this congress on january 21 the democratic steering and policy committee adopted a resolution urging prompt enactment of legislation and appropriations to care for the homeless the legislation before us today is the first important step in realizing this goal h r 558 authorizes 500 million in new budget authority in fiscal year 1987 for a variety of homeless aid programs the funds autnorized are largely for existing local programs that will be unable to meet the needs of the homeless during fiscal year 1987 without additional assistance notably all funds appropriated under this bills authorizations would remain available until expended h r 558 authorizes for fiscal year 1987 funding for the following an existing emergency food and shelter program an ongoing program for rehabilitating buildings into temporary shelters support services for the homeless at group homes rental certificates for lowcost rental housing new permanent housing for the handicapped homeless conversion of underutilized government property into facilities for assisting homeless families and individuals and outpatient health care and mental health services for the homeless in addition food assistance for the homeless reported out of the agriculture committee have been incorporated into the bill by the rules committee these provisions would not increase spending for fiscal year 1987 but would authorize increased spending of 225 million in fiscal year 1988 through fiscal year 1990 for food assistance to the needy these provisions amend the food stamp program to better target benefits to the homeless and to prevent homelessness expand the surplus cheese program and reauthorize the temporary emergency food assistance program through fiscal year 1990 as a representative from southern west virginia i am very much concerned with the plight of the homeless the residents of my congrssional district have been burdened with failing industries and the ensuing high unemployment rates for the past decade while the figures on what monetary relief this bill will provide to west virginia are either nonexistent or very rough in nature i have gleaned some hope for my states future ability to address the homeless situation through the assistance of this measure while most of the money is distributed on a competitive grant basis there are a handful of programs which are funded on a formula derived basis i have obtained tentative figures for the amount which would be made available to west virginia on three of these programs of the 225 million provided for emergency fiscal year 1987 funds for programs administered by the housing and urban development 100 million would be for the emergency shelter grants program this program provides grants for the renovation rehabilitation or conversion of buildings into emergency shelters to expand the supply of shelters for the homeless hud distibutes the grants to local governments which can use the grants themselves or distribute funds to private charitable organizations up to 15 percent of these grants can also be used for supportive services for the homeless such as job counseling and health services under the bill grant applicants could apply for a waiver of this 15percent cap on supportive services funding if appropriated roughtly 739 000 of this money would go to west virginia approximately 523 000 would be at the governors discretion while the following amounts would be allocated to the accompanying major cities 67 000 to charleston 70 000 to huntington 32 000 to parkersburg and 47 000 to wheeling the bill authorizes atotal of 70 million in additional fiscal year 1987 funds for an existing food and shelter program and for the community services block grant program to provide food shelter and services to the homeless 50 million of this would be authorized for the community services block grant program administered by the health and humanservices department the 50 million would be reserved for services for the homeless and would be given only to local community action agencies that are already providing services food and shelter to the homeless an estimated 538 000 of this amount would be distributed in west virginia the remaining 20 million of this 70 million is earmarked for the ongoing emergency food and shelter program administered by the federal emergency management agency this program provides funds to charitable organizations and local governments that run food and shelter programs for the homeless roughly 224 100 of this money would go to west virginia with approximately 17 100 at the governors discretion the counties in my congressional district would receive roughly 60 000 of this amount the amounts of federal funds that are being discussed to address the homelessness crisis are minimal when compared to the overall size of the federal budget the cost of h r 558 is in fact less than half the cost of one trident submarine furthermore federal dollars spent now can avoid higher costs to the federal treasury later initiatives taken now to prevent the growing number of families and working poor from becoming homeless in the first place will reduce future public expenditures to help move these people back into mainstream society studies have shown that every additional week spent without a home tends to create further dependency only adding to the ultimate bill paid by american taxpayers with homelessness getting worse by the month it makes fiscal sense for the federal government to target resources to reverse this trend before the cost in lives and dollars gets still worse finally providing the minimum needed for survival is one of the core responsibilities of government just as the federal government has a responsibility to protect the country against foreign attack it also has a responsibility to assure that everyone can be sheltered and fed at least at minimum levels while some government programs should be curtailed or eliminated in the fact of budget deficits giving people a place to sleep at night and food to survive are not luxury items in a decent society the united states as the worlds richest democracy can surely provide its citizens with the basic requirements for physical survival in this vein i cosponsored h r 558 i will support its passage and urge

presenting the bill to the house i want to take the opportunity to say a word of appreciation and thanks to those who helped make this presentation possible we have been working on this bill since last january and have held many hours of committee hearings and it has been only due to the diligence effectiveness efficiency and dedication of the committee members that we are able to be here today i especially appreciate the assistance of the gentleman from new mexico he has been of invaluable assistance participating in all of our hearings and i want him and all the other members of the committee to know that i appreciate their help the appropriations committee presents a bill for your consideration today that provides 15 4 billion in recommended appropriations for 1988 an increase of 780 million over the budget 1 6 billion over 1987 40 million under the proposed 302 b allocation for discretionary budget authority and 49 million under the proposed budget ceiling for discretionary outlays i would also like to point out that the bill is 23 million below the total proposed 302 b allocation for budget authority and 32 million under the proposed total in outlays the departmental amounts are as follows for the treasury department 7 4 billion an increase of 248 million over the budget and 1 1 billion over for the postal service 556 million an increase of 485 over the budget and a reduction of 93 million below for the executive office of the president 107 9 million the amount of the budget request and 6 6 million over 1987 for independent agencies covered by this bill such as gsa the office of personnel management the tax court and others 7 3 billion an increase of 47 million over the budget and 560 million over 1987 first in the unitedstates customs service the committee recommends 160 million above the budget in order to bring unitedstates customs staffing up to a level adequate to prevent the influx of massive amounts of drugs and other contraband into this country in response to the grammrudman sequestration the administration proposed to reduce onboard staffing by 1 998 positions the committee disallowed the proposed reduction and added 800 new positions the committee believes that the high level of drug abuse and related crime in this country requires a strong law enforcement effort to stem the tide of illicit drugs coming into the united states the recommended increase would also expedite the processing of visitors to this country and of our own citizens returning from abroad further this increase would also expedite the processing of commercial goods being imported and help prevent the illegal importation of high technology items to unfriendly countries i might also point out that the unitedstates customs service is the second largest producer of revenue for the government over 15 billion per year in customs duties second in the internal revenue service the committee added 58 million above the presidents budget to fund an additional 1 500 positions above the presidents budget for the past several years this subcommittee has been concerned about inadequate funding for the internal revenue service fiscal year 1988 represents an important year for the internal revenue service because of the tax jl 14 187 reform act it will be very expensive to administer these changes and i should point out to you that the internal revenue service is the major reason for the large increase from fiscal year 1987 budget to fiscal year 1988 budget it does appear the administration has requested adequate funding for the irs this year in every area except taxpayer assistance the committee felt that it was necessary to help the taxpayer in adjusting to the new tax act by adding 58 million for taxpayer assistance this increase strongly supported by the committee on ways and means and a letter from that committee has been included in the committee report third unitedstates postal service i am particularly pleased today to inform you that this bill provides an appropriation to the postal service of 566 507 000 of which 517 000 000 is for revenue forgone this appropriation will permit the postal service to maintain rates charged to preferred rate mailers at less than full postage rates qualified preferred rate mailers are defined as religious educational scientific philanthropic agricultural labor veterans and fraternal organizations and include such groups as the american cancer society the american heart association the national easter seal society the march of dimes birth defects foundation the american association of retired persons national wildlife federation the salvation army as well as many many others these nonprofit groups have long played a vital role in american life supplying a considerable share of the social services health care education research arts culture community improvement international relief conservation environmental protection and public advocacy occurring in the united states they also have established a mechanism through which citizens can band together to support a variety of community purposes and worthwhile philanthropic pursuits although private in structure nonprofit groups are public in purpose providing the major vehicle by which private charitable resources are channeled to solve community problems and facilitate the action on a wide range of social cultural and economic objectives i would like to point out that providing funding for revenue forgone is the major reason that this bill is above the budget request the committee had to add 485 million to the budget request to provide this funding the committee has funded most other agencies including those within the executive office of the president at approximately the budget level i again commend the ranking minority member for the outstanding job that he has done and i appreciate the conscientious and faithful service of all the members of the

record however i would like to take a brief moment to explain that s 2042 as passed by the house authorizes the vietnam womens memorial project inc to establish a memorial on federal land in the district of columbia or its environs to honor women of the armed forces of the united states who served in the republic of vietnam during the vietnam era the housepassed version of the bill makes it clear that this memorial will be established in full compliance with the commemorative works act of 1986 while also voicing the sense of congress that the most fitting and appropriate site for this commemorative is within the 2 2acre site surrounding the vietnam veterans memorial there has been some disagreement about whether this commemorative is a new memorial or an addition to an already existing one and what standards or restrictions apply to it however the senate has agreed to accept the house language which i think is in the best interests of the groups concerned and the existing law i would like to pay a special tribute once again to the gentleman from connecticut for making us have a conscience about this project and his constant persistence which in the long run did pay off and i want to thank the gentleman very much s 2042 as amended by the house authorizes the vietnam womens memorial project inc to establish a memorial on federal land in the district of columbia or its environs to honor women of the armed forces of the united states who served in the republic of vietnam during the vietnam era to commemorate the dedication and sacrifice that so many women offered our nation is a noble and worthwhile cause over 10 000 woman served in vietnam and through their efforts our wounded were nursed back to health our dying were comforted and our soldiers morale was kept high there is little doubt that the wall of the vietnam vieterans memorial would list thousands of more names if these women had not chosen to serve their willingness to aid our nation in its time of need definitely deserves to be recognized the house of representatives has remained firm in its position of upholding the commemorative works act of 1986 with regards to the authorization of this memorial this law sets forth certain guidelines for the placement of monuments and memorials and its enforcement is essential to preserving the integrity of the districts landscape the other body has argued that the house language does not all under the jurisdiction of the commemorative works act because it is an addition to a memorial rather than a new one the houses response to this argument is that additions to memorials must be reviewed jointly by the house administration and the interior and insular affairs committees when this legislation was introduced it was referred solely to the committee on house administration it was thus inferred that the house administration committee would treat the legislation as a new memorial with the interior committee subsequently handling the siting of the commemorative after the secretary of the interior had made his recommendations the other body suggested that the committee on house administration and the committee on interior and insular affairs be given joint jurisdiction over s 2042 the interior and insular affairs committee has made it clear that they would not intend to move such legislation without hearings of its own additions and alterations are not specifically addressed in the commemorative works act however if this issue is not addressed in the statute itself it is addressed in the spirit of the law it may well be that the issue of additions and alterations to existing memorials needs to be looked al if so it should be done in an open and fair manner a specific process must be set up where such proposals like this can be met at this point we simply cannot circumvent the process there are several other points that i would like to address first the other body has argued that this legislation must be sitespecific because they believe the house language will prevent the womens memorial from being placed in area i let alone the vietnam veterans memorial one source of their concern is that section 6 b 1 of the commemorative works act states a military commemorative work may be established only to commemorate a war or other branch of the armed forces no commemorative work commemorating a lesser conflict or a unit of the armed forces shall be permitted a commemorative honoring women is not necessarily excluded in the language of the commemorative works act while the women who served in vietnam may not constitute a branch of the armed forces their service is by no means limited to a specific unit women have served our country in all branches of the armed forces and in a variety of capacities in recognition of that fact the vietnam nurses memorial project changed its name to the vietnam womens memorial project and revised its statement of purpose to encompass all of those services the other body also argues that the site of the memorial must be legislated because section 7 b 2 of the commemorative works act provides that a new memorial may not encroach upon any existing memorial and the commission of fine arts the national capital planning commission and the sccretary of the interior will therefore be prohibited from agreeing to the placement of the womens memorial at the existing vietnam veterans memorial the question that arises is who should judge whether a new memorial constitutes an encroachment of an existing memorial because the commission of fine arts the ncpc and the secretary of interior handle the site selection process and other judgments of esthetics they also are instilled with the power to decipher what constitutes an encroachment or interference with another memorial the committee feels very strongly that these agencies are the experts on those matters in addition the other body argues against the siting process set up by the commemorative works act under the act the group must return to congress to be authorized for an area i site the other body believes that the commemorative stands little chance of being placed at the vietnam veterans memorial we firmly believe that the commemorative can and will be placed at the vietnam veterans memorial even if the process set up by the commemorative works act is preserved the secretary of the interior has already made it clear that he believes that the vietnam womens memorial is of historical and lasting significance october 8 1987 letter from secretary hodel second because the project enjoys such overwhelming support in both houses of congress authorization for an area i site can be expected to occur quite expeditiously third the commission of fine arts has informed the committee and the vietnam womens memorial project that it is willing to commemorate women at the vietnam veterans memorial and we see no reason to doubt this pledge furthermore because the congress has expressed its sense that it would be fitting and appropriate for this memorial to be located at the vietnam veterans memorial and because the commission of fine arts cannot veto a memorials siting for area i after that commemorative has been authorized by congress for area i and because section 7 b 1 states that a commemorative work shall be located in surroundings that are relevant to the subject of the commemorative work it is our belief that the commission of fine arts would be hardpressed to find a reason not to place the memorial at the vietnam veterans memorial there are so many of my colleagues that deserve my gratitude for their patience and diligence with this legislation we would not be here today without help of my distinguished friends representative bill frenzel representative sonny montgomery representative sam gfjdenson and representative bruce vento my colleagues have demonstrated forthright leadership on this issue i would especially like to thank senator alan cranston for his leadership as well we would not be at this point if he had not taken the leadership in the other body with regards to this legislation i would also like to thank

grateful to the armed services committee for the cooperation that the chairman and his committee gives in this double effort the programs authorized by h r 2968 are classified many are extremely sensitive their very existence in some cases is itself secret there is therefore little detail in the bill or the public report which accompanies it on the amounts and particulars of the programs authorized the committee has recommended against publishing even the overall budget figure on the grounds that it would be meaningless without significant amounts of detailed explanation the committee as in years past has prepared a detailed schedule of authorization which is incorporated by reference into the bill and an annex to its report both are classified and are available in the offices of the committee some members have already examined them i urge those who have not yet done so to avail themselves of the opportunity to examine them closely this bill besides authorizing funds for the intelligence programs of our government would provide two new administration authorities to the director of central intelligence in one case it would provide explicit authority to the dci to set minimum and maximum age limits for entry level operations officers second it gives him the authority to provide incentive awards to civilian and military detailees of the cia and the intellgience community staff in other respects the bill is indentical to those which the house has considered for the past 5 years it has the bipartisan support of all the committee the only exception to that and a principal focus of the debate that will ensue on this bill is its stipulation that none of the funds authorized by the bill may be used for military or paramilitary activities in nicaragua at the appropriate time i will offer an amendment to strike section 108 and insert in lieu thereof the text of h r 2760 h r 2760 is the bill which the house passed on july 28 the bolandzablockiwright bill it provides as members will recall for the termination of united states funding of paramilitary activities in nicaragua at the expiration of a period of time which has been classified by the committee that period of time is for the safe withdrawal of insurgents funded by the program the bill also provides security assistance funds to friendly nations in the region to help interdict the flow of arms from nicaragua and cuba to insurgencies in other central american nations those funds also may be used for peacekeeping efforts or for efforts to monitor agreements prohibiting aid to insurgencies in central america finally the language inserted by the majority leader provides that unitedstates policy should be to seek redress for unitedstates and central american grievances against nicaragua in the forum of the organization of american states it requires the president to bring nicaraguas violations of international law and its guarantees to the oas on democratic freedoms before the oas it expresses the sense of congress that negotiations are the best method of securing a lasting peace in central america and requires the president to report to the congress concerning the progress he has made in these efforts thus i will be asking the members of this body to vote again on exactly the same proposal which passed the house in july that bill has never been considered by the other body i therefore will offer this amendment in an effort to reaffirm the position taken by the house and to insure that it reaches a conference committee with the senate that is why we must vote again on this same matter what has happened since july 28 the most alarming change has been the expansion of the war in nicaragua it has acquired a new facet it is now an air and sea war insurgents have engaged in bombing raids on nicaraguan cities airports and harbors targets have been economic such as the oil storage tanks in corinto and the electrical generating plant and oil pipeline in puerto sandino the ground war has heated up againwith deeper penetrations of insurgent forces into the central highlands and largescale clashes between insurgent and sandinista troops another significant development has been the announcement by the nations participating in the contadora process that all of the central american participants including nicaragua have agreed upon a list of 21 goals for negotiations to bring peace to the region those goals cover the gamut but include the end of foreign military presence in the region the end to insurgencies and support for them and a guarantee of democratic freedom in all central american countries all americans welcome this development the administration claims that its program of support for the nicaraguan insurgents has produced this change to me it is obvious that this agreement upon an agenda for negotiations came in spite of that insurgency in any case even if negotiations are scheduled the objectives posed by the administration some of which are contained in the new secret findings are even broader than those to be discussed by contadora nations the final development is that the administration has reformulated its position on the war in nicaragua in a new presidential finding trhe finding authorizes the continuation of the present program the scope of activities which are authorized is very broad and in no way limited to arms interdiction it includes keeping the military pressure on the sandinistas its bottom line is the continuation of the war the finding makes no mention of overthrowing the government of nicaragua although this is the stated purpose of the contras and the administration is offering no guarantees the new finding then is one more effort to defend the secret war in the congress while the finding contains more detail it contains no new ideas or policies it is a compendium of the symmetry arguments you heard and rejected in july make no mistake about it military victory is the administrations bottom line the statement of under secretary of defense for policy fred ikle on september 12 before the baltimore council on foreign affairs clearly shows that there is a feeling in this administration that the sandinistas must be defeated on the battlefield before the problems of central america can be solved but what will be the result of this increased military pressure will the sandinistas surrender or are they more likely to seek more aid from cuba and russia or will they attack honduras or costa rica the war is counter to the best interests of the united states and it is also inconsistent with the principles which underlie american government in fact it is more consistent with the dictates of lenin than principles of washington and jefferson finally it reawakens the image of the united states as the north american meddler in latin american politics the american bully who can only live with an arrangement that he imposes you do not have to be in favor of nicaraguas policiesand i am notto oppose the openended war to which the administration has committed us my conclusion is that the not so secret war in nicaragua must end that is why i am asking members to vote again to end this program the congress ought to send a clear signal that this war is not nor should it be unitedstates policy our policy should be to encourage peace through negotiation with and through the organization of american states and the shield of security assistance that is what the bolandzablocklwright amendment does that is why it should be adopted"],

services and education appropriations bill for fiscal year 1988 my statement is entitled a committee responds this year this title is appropriate and fitting the subcommittee on labor health and human services and education held hearings for 4 months this year we heard from a broad spectrum of witnesses including those from the administration and numerous interest groups unlike other years many interest groups joined forces and pushed for their priorities this strategy was not only effective but sensible it has become clear to the members of the subcommittee and i presume to congress and the american people that there are programs that are in desperate need of a substantial increase in federal funding a few years ago there was a lot of publicity concerning the findings included in a nation at risk the administration publicly stated that it shared the concerns of our nations educators over the state of education however in its 1988 budget the administration didnt address those concerns the congress both the house and senate did put its money in the right place the conference agreement on the budget for fiscal year 1988 recognizes the domestic needs of this country without ignoring our national defense the budget conference agreement provided the appropriations committee with the necessary flexibility to address several problems and provide additional federal funding to key programs several of which i will address in my remarks this year the debate over education funding has centered around providing assistance to atrisk children these are the children who lag behind their classmates on standardized tests and who have not realized the benefits of our educational system many of these children are minorities some are handicapped some come from broken homes and they come from both urban and rural communities these children are however part of our future for our society to be all that it can be they must become productive and successful members of it we will have nice offices with no one to staff them well have a huge military with no one to operate the weapons and well have empty college dormitories because only a small fraction of our population will be ready or able to take part in higher education the labor health and human services subcommittee understands the problem facing at risk children in this nation and what needs to be done to insure these children the opportunity to get on the right track h r 3058 provides funds for highly successful and cost effective federal programs for our nations childrenprograms such as head start chapter 1 compensatory education maternal and child health block grant job corps and many others in this bill we have provided a 650 million increase for the chapter 1 program an effective program which can do a lot to address the problems of at risk children in relative terms this is a small step in recouping the damage that has been wrought since 1980 the proposed 1988 funding level for chapter 1 as adjusted for inflation is still approximately 13 5 percent less than it was in fiscal year 1980 presently only 40 to 45 percent of the 8 9 million eligible students are served by this program the increase provided for in this bill will allow the chapter 1 to increase its participation by 15 percent or 715 000 students i am also proud to note that the committee provided a 125 4 million increase for the head start program programs such as head start which are referred to as early intervention programs have been proven time and time again that they are costeffective programs early childhood education is a critical investment head start works hand in hand with the chapter 1 program insufficient funds have limited head start participation to only 16 percent of the eligible children every eligible child should have the benefit of a head start experience we have made a big step in the right direction another subject that id like to mention is the subject of aids this is another area where the committee and the congress heard the facts and responded the committee heard testimony from all sources that the federal aids research and education effort should be expanded greatly several institute directrors discussed the need to expand clinical trials on aids increased funds will also go to expand the effort to develop a vaccine for aids and expansion of efforts to develop drugs for treatment of aids and to test those drugs it became clear from testimony we received that we had to try for a new balance between our search for cures or vaccines with efforts to prevent and control the spread of aids and until such time as we find a cure funds must be provided to expand education and prevention efforts particularly those affecting the minority and iv drug using communities this bill provides 945 million for aids research and education 315 6 million of this increase can be associated with various information and education activities throughout the public health service including 95 8 million for testing and counseling the overall increase if 466 2 million over 1987 the presidents revised budget request requested 766 million just 5 years ago we provided 5 5 million for research the committee report points out in clear and specific terms the danger we face with this disease the committee has also directed that administrative steps be taken to increase the amount of scientific expertise available to the national institutes of health the alcohol drug abuse and mental health administration and the centers for disease control id like to remind the members of the

198889 as i noted when the house considered house resolution 156 yesterday the procedure we are using to govern consideration of h r 1748 is a bit unusual we have already adopted two rules governing the consideration of h r 1748 and a rule which allowed the house to consider this rule today we have followed this procedure not because the rules committee enjoys reporting four rules on the same bill but because we were faced with a very important and complex piece of legislation with more than 200 amendments that members wished to offer to that legislation and a desire on the part of the vast majority of members to complete action on that legislation in a reasonable amount of time i might also state that this procedure is at least in part the result of the rules committees efforts to work with the chairman and ranking minority member of the armed services committee in order to develop a rule with bipartisan support that effort complicated our work but we think it was worthwhile this rule provides for the consideration of amendments to h r 1748 which are printed in the rules committee report accompanying this rule these amendments must be considered in the order and manner provided in the rule and the report these amendments are divided into three categories which are listed in three sections of the committee report i will describe each category but because of the very large number of amendments i cannot describe each amendment members will find all amendments which are in order and the amount of debate time accorded each amendment printed in the committee report accompanying this rule during consideration of h r 1748 pro forma amendments for the purposes of debate are in order only if offered by the chairman or ranking minority member of the armed services committee the rule also provides that any amendment under consideration when the committee of the whole rises shall be completed when the committee next resumes its sitting the first section of the report contains amendments which address major policy issues the rule structures the consideration of these amendments around the policy issues involved sometimes even providing for general debate on the issue before specific amendments are considered for instance the rule provides that the committee of the whole will consider four amendments dealing with sdi authorization levels there will then be 1 hour of debate on sdi policy issues followed by consideration of amendments dealing with those issues there are 13 major policy clusters including such issues as contracting out davisbacon chemical weapons nuclear testing asat and central america the rule specifies the day on which consideration of the amendments within each cluster may begin if all amendments in a cluster are not disposed of when the committee rises at the end of that day it is in order at any subsequent time for the chairman of the armed services committee after consulting with the ranking minority member of armed services and giving 1 hour notice to request that the chair recognize the proponent of such amendments if the chairman of the armed services committee does not exercise this option the proponent of such amendments will be recognized after the disposition of all of the amendments contained in section 3 of the rules committee report the amendments contained in section 1 of the report are not subject to amendment or a division of the question except as specified in the rule the debate time for each amendent is specified in the report the rule waives clause 7 of rule xvi which prohibits nongermane amendments against amendments in section 1 of the report the second section of the report contains eight amendments that address significant issues but do not fall into a major policy category this category includes for instance amendments dealing with the the nreactor at hanford wa and amendments dealing with procurement of the c17 aircraft it is in order for the chairman of the committee on armed services after consultation with the ranking minority member of armed services and 1 hour notice to offer any amendment printed in section 2 of the committee report these amendments are printed in the committee report along with the debate time allotted to each amendment these amendments are not subject to amendment or a division of the question except as specified in the rules

consideration of new entitlement authority prior to final adoption of a budget resolution against the amendment relating to military pay the third section of the committee report contains 83

consideration on that day the amendments contained in section 3 are subject to perfecting amendments with debate on any perfecting amendment limited to 10 minutes in addition the chairman of the armed services committee has the discretion at any time to offer any of the amendments numbered 28 through 83 en bloc with modifications of the text such en bloc amendments are debatable for 60 minutes divided between the chairman and ranking minority member of the armed services committee they would not be subject to amendment or to a demand for a division of the question the original proponents of

may consume i would like to commend the subcommittee chairman the gentleman from mazsachusetts for convening the hearings on h r 3763 last year and for moving this bill through the committee to the house floor for consideration i would also like to commend the author of this legislation mr besiman for his work in crafting this legislation i was a member of this committee in 1976 when we drafted and enacted the foreign sovereign immunities act which is codified in our law today in title 28 while i believe the law has been successful toward its purpose i believe some of its provisions leave room for amendment i think it is important however with regard to these amendments that we keep in perspective the purpose and history of the foreign sovereign immunities act until congress enacted the foreign sovereign immunities act in 1976 questions with regard to whether or not a foreign state should be granted sovereign immunity with regard to its actions were for the most part left to the state department in makfig those determinations the state department beginning in the early 1950s adopted what became known as the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity which is the prevailing trend in international law today the restrictive theory of soverign immunity provides that the immunity of a state is restricted to its public acts and does not extend to its commercial or nongovernmental activities congress enactment of the foreign sovereign immunities act was intended to codify the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity and in so doing provided that our judicial branch and not our executive branch was the proper forum to determine whether immunity should be applied in certain circumstances the act provides a statutory framework through which litigants may proceed against a foreign government regarding commercial disputes and certain causes of action in tort our task back in the 94th congress in drafting this law was one of attempting to balance two sets of interests that of recognizing unitedstates citi zens right to have access to the courts to resolve ordinary legal disputes involving foreign states and that of providing ample respect for the concerns of other governments and the foreign policy implications of making foreign states subject to suit in this country during the 99th congress and again in this congress i introduced legislation to amend one aspect of the foreign sovereign immunities act h r 1689 which i introduced this year would amend the foreign sovereign immunities act to ensure that neither the federal act of state doctrine nor the doctrine of sovereign immunity would constitute grounds for circumventing the effect of an agreement to arbitrate or an arbitral award entered against a foreign state that bill was the subject of a hearing by the administrative law and governmental relations subcommittee last year a case in point which amply illustrates the need for an amendment to clarify when use of the act of state doctrine would be inappropriate is the case of libyan american oil company versus socialist peoples libyan arab jamahlrya in that case a dispute arose between the country of libya and the libyan american oil co otherwise known as liamco regarding the enforcement of an agreement to arbitrate the parties had entered into an agreement to arbitrate in the event of a dispute a dispute arose with regard to libyas nationalization of certain concessions it had granted to liamco and when liamco sought a resolution to the dispute by enforcing the arbitration agreement libya refused to participate in the proceedings in the end the united states district court for the district of columbia ruled that the act of state doctrine precluded enforcement of the agreement to arbitrate because libyas actions to nationalize the concessions was considered an act of state clothed with immunity decisions like the iarnco decision indicate a need for language clarifying the intent of congress with regard to arbitration and the act of state doctrine clearly theactofstate doctrine should not be used to allow a party to a commercial relationship to circumvent an agreement to arbitrate disputes section 2 of h r 3763 adopts language similar to the bill which i introduced regarding arbitral awards consequently section 2 of this bill amends title 9 of the united states code to ensure that the enforcement of arbitral agreements or awards made pursuant to such agreements shall not be avoided because of the application of the act of state doctrine due to the inclusion of this language in h r 3763 i am inclined to support the bill however i have some concerns regarding other provisions in h r 3763 h r 3763 as cuirently drafted in section 3 would limit the immunity of execution currently provided to a foreign government by broadening the category of commercial assets available for execution against foreign state property the language in section 3 of the bill not only broadens the category of commercial property subject to execution but broadens the category of causes of action which may be brought and which may result in execution against commercial property i think it is important to keep in mind that prior to the enactment of the foreign sovereign immunities act successful plantiffs could not execute against the property of foreign sovereigns in the united states under any circumstances the section of the act section 1610 a which this bill attempt to amend was intended to partially modify this absolute rule against execution of property of foreign sovereigns by allowing for execution of judgments on foreign state property used for the commercial activity upon which the claim is based a reading of the current language of the act in that section illustrates that there is currently the requirement of a nexus between the property to be executed upon and the legal dispute the language of h r 3763 proposes to extend execution under section 1610 to reach any commercial property regardless of whether the property was involved in the cause of action further it would make available assets to satisfy a noncommercial tort judgement which is not presently covered in the act i have some concerns as to the broad brush with which we are sweeping with the language in this bill especially in that should a foreign state reciprocate with a similar law property of the unitedstates government which is present in a foreign country at the time a legal dispute may arise could also be vulnerable to attachment or execution it is no secret that this country has on any given day substantial amounts of property existent in many foreign countries around the world it is my understanding that the united states is currently a defendant in over 800 cases in about 50 countries throughout the world the department of defense has expressed concern that if the united states liberalizes its attachment and execution provisions as this bill contemplates that we would be in a vulnerable situation should other countries decide to initiate reciprocal treatment especially those countries where much unitedstates property may be located in light of these facts i think we should consider whether expanding this area exposes our assets abroad to a greater risk than under existing law and whether this expansion is worth the risk i nevertheless support this bill and urge passage i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.588375985622406, 0.588375985622406, 0, "i rise in strong support of the conference report on h r 4783 the fiscal year 1989

bill moreover i believe they should be further congratulated for having achieved this success within the rigorous parameters set forth by both the 1987 economic summit and the fiscal year 1989 budget resolutions tight 302 b allocations some months ago i was given the oppolunity to appear before the appropriations subcommittee to discuss the programmatic and funding issues which have concerned my committee this year we had more than the usual number of these since this was a year which has seen my committee reauthorize some of the major legislation under our jurisdiction and in so doing both strengthen existing programs and launch new initiatives in particular since this past spring my committee concluded an indepth revision of our elementary and secondary education programspublic law 100297 the hawkinsstafford elementary and secondary school improvement amendments of 19881 was most eager to persuade the subcommittee to provide appropriate levels of funding for both the familiar and the new programs in our legislation septemtber 9 1 988 i117340 the appropriations committee and this body did indeed once again express their steadfast commitment to the funding of elemontary and secondary education programs and as one who has always viewed eseas chapter 1 as the flagship of federal support to our nations schools i was especially pleased to learn how well the conference report supports chapter ls various programmatic components not only are chaptor ls basic grants andfor the first time since 1981its concentration grants well provided for but it is clear that our conferees fought to preserve funding for one chapter 1 initiative even start and agreed to the funding of another new component the rural educational opportunities program developed by our distinguished colleague bill goodling even start seeks to encourage schools to offer programs that will have the dual effect of helping parents who have not completed their high school education gain literacy skills and simultaneously become active partners in their childrens educational development aware along with many other members of the special problems faced by small rural schools i was delighted to find that the conference report provides almost 4 million to get the rural educational opportunities program underway under this program at least 10 regional rural assistance centers will be established to provide technical assistance to rural schools with chapter 1 children in attendance with the view of improving the quality of the education such children receive i also want to particularly commend and thank our conferees for preserving the greater part of the modest 2year funding they and the house had eadler provided to launch the national commission on responsibilities for financing postsecondary education when my committee was preparing to reexamine and reauthorize the higher education act heal it occurred to me that if at one time each of the usual participants in financing postsecondary educationstudents parents colleges the states and the federal governmenthad held a reasonably clear grasp of their respective financial responsibilities this was no longer the case today students have greatly increased loan debt burdens at graduation some parents refuse to help their children finance their education a few states have increased higher education appropriations while others have cut them congress and the executive branch are debating the appropriate magnitude of federal student assistance in light of our deficit burden with these factors in mind i successfully sponsored an amendment to hea now section 1321 of the act which would establish a national commission of highly respected individuals their tasks would be to study the impact of the changing roles of the various participants in the financing of postsecondary education and within 2 years provide useful guidance on who should be expected to pay what share of a students education i am sure that the modest cost of this commission will be repaid back to the taxpayer as it moves forward to create a new national consensus over who benefits from a college education and who should pay in the course of reauthorizing and amending the child abuse prevention and treatment and adoption reform act of 1976 this year my committee contributed to the development of two new adoption opportunities program initiatives the minority children placement program and the postlegal adoption services progran im pleased that the conference has seen fit to launch these programs by providing each of them with 500 000 even these modest levels of funding make good humanitarian and fiscal senseit is far more expensive to maintain tnese children in temporary foster care or in longterm institutional settings than to place them in homes where they are desired and loved the conference report also makes it clear that thanks primarily to the levels of support our appropriations committoe recommended and the house endorsed as well as to the agreements reached by our conferees four key postsecondary education programs have been provided with funding levels above their fiscal year 1989 baselines the group of special programs for the disadvantaged known as trio the supplemental educational opportunity grants the pell grants and the income contingent loan program i was also especially pleased to find tmat in the area of our special education concerns the early intervention components of our education for the handicapped act programs as well as the rehabilitation act programs received funding above their respective fiscal year 1989 baseline levels one of the funding issues which concerned my committee earlier this year was that our budget resolutions assumptions were not responsive to the needs of the older americans act oaa programs i expressed these concerns to our appropriations committee noting that if the funding of supportive services to seniors and of the senior congregate and homedelivered meal programs were frozen at fiscal year 1988 levels we could expect to see these programs cut back in the number of services and meals provided or in the quality of what was provided or both i was very pleased consequently to find that the conference report provides these three oaa title iii programs with funding levels that will at least partially cushion the erosion of inflation on their service levels our conferees also deserve our thanks for having fought to prevent truly drastic reductions in the funding of the state student incentive grants issig program their support for this program an important one in the educational effort of my state serves to further correct the current imbalance between student loans and grants as generally pleased as i am by this finely crafted conference report i would not be candid if i did not express my disappointment with the funding cuts it imposes on the low income home energy assistance program was woefully lacking in inspectors in general and in welltrained construction inspectors in particllar they had also made it clear that because the national institute for o3ccupational safety and healths i eases in funding in recent years had barely covered the erosion of inflation niosh was in danger of losing its stateoftheart capability to analyze hazards connected with the roughly 5 000 new toxic substances coming on the market every year as well as part of its professional staff the fiscal year 1989 funding the conference report provides for osha and niosh is once again below the respective fiscal year 1989 baseline levels for the two agencies hence service levels in the critical arena of worker safety and health will continue to be eroded on balance our conferees have brought us a careful and thoughtful compromise in funding priorities and funding levels in this conference report that will benefit a broad range of americans of all ages i encourage my colleagues to give it

numerous archeological natural cultural and fish and wildlife resources particularly the flying foxes the park would encompass approximately 8 200 acres including large areas on the islands of tau and tutuila and a small coastal area on ofu when this legislation was introduced in june of this year i was pleased to join as an original cosponsor as i recognized the importance of preserving tropical forests and their unique wildlife i have been fortunate to deal with insular issues affecting samoa since i fiist came to congress my work has taken me to samoa where i have witnessed the beautiful and diverse flora and fauna of the islands and coastal areas i was equally impressed by the tospitable and proud people of the territory of american samoa they have good reason to be proud the tropical islands of samoa are an often overlooked scenic natural resource of the united states american samoa has one of only three tropical rain forests under unitedstates jurisdiction puerto rico has the beautiful el yunque hawaii has the highly vulnerable forest in the hawaii volcanoes national park and american samoa has the third the diminution of tropical forests worldwide is accelerating with numerous adverse impacts on our environment there exists a considerable amount of interest in the congress as well as elsewhere in the government and among private organizations to stem stop or even reverse the decline of world tropical forests it appears to me that we should first do whatever we can to preserve our own tropical forests a very important factor in sustaining the tropical forests of samoa is a small and often misunderstood animal pteropus samoenis or flying fox a symbiotic relationship exists between these little animals and the tropical forests they need each other to survive the flying fox helps to pollinate the trees and the forest provides safe refuge it is anticipated that a national park would help protect the forests and the flying foxes so that both will continue to thrive and contribute to the environment in our exuberance to establish a park and preserve the forest we have been careful to remember first and foremost the people of samoa they know their islands better than anyone the culture of samoa revolves around the land and respect for nature in agreeing to the cession of the samoan islands of tutuila aunuu and the manua group the chiefs requested that the indigenous ownership of lands by samoans be preserved therefore the legislation provides for the secretary of the interior and the governor of american samoa to enter into a 50year lease of the lands and waters in the park with the option to extend the lease on or before its expiration if the lease is not extended the administration of the park would be transferred to the governor the secretary and the governor would negotiate the amount of the lease payments which would be disbursed by the governor to the villages and families located within the park the high court of samoa would determine the amount of the payments to individuals thus the park would be established without federal ownership of the land prior to the establishment of unitedstates jurisdiction in samoa in 1900 the samoan people had inhabited the islands for thousands of years the people had long recognized the vulnerability of animal and sea life and had incorporated strict conservation methods as part of their way of life in addition it was customary for the chiefs to monitor the population sizes of various species of fish once the number of fish neared the threshold of endangering the continuing viability of the species a temporary ban on taking that type of fish would be instituted the ban which is called tapu in samoan would not be lifted until the chiefs determined that an adequate population base existed given the samoans historical concern for the environment it is not surprising that there is widespread support in samoa for a park that would continue to preserve the islands natural resources under h r 4818 the park will also seek to potect the traditions and customs of samoa subsistence farming and subsistence reef fishing as have been traditionally used in the past will be allowed to continue in addition the access to park areas will provide for the traditional subsistence harvesting of breadfruit coconuts yams kava wild fruits and vegetables and plants for medicinal purposes the park will also permit the careful and customarily limited extraction of native trees to be used in traditional samoan houses and ware as land in samoa is such an important issue the legislation provides that the boundaries of the proposed park area will be clearly defined and mutually agreed to by the governor and respective villages before publication of the park maps h r 4818 also requires the secretary of the interior to develop a program to train native american samoans to work in the park and to extend a hiring preference to these individuals to ensure that the park employees are familiar with the samoan islands the people language and traditions i am confident that there are adequate native american samoans as clearly defined in the bill qualified to meet the staffing needs of the park the real employment opportunities that the national park offers however will be generated from business established in samoa to support the increase of visitors the villages families and individuals of american samoa can provide tours food and lodging as well as other services to visitors to the national park of samoa a great deal of time and effort have been invested by many individuals and organizations to help make the dream of a national park of american samoa to become a reality the national park service conducted an excellent study and recently transmitted a superb draft report to congress with recommendations for the park the chairman of the subcommittee mr vento certainly deserves recognition for his hard work on this legislation as well the subcommittee traveled to samoa last year to inspect the areas of the proposed park hold a hearing on the issue and moot with several of the high chiefs and local officials to obtain their views concerning the park i would clearly be remiss if i did not commend dr paul cox and dr merlin tuttle renowned experts on the flying fox and tropical forests dr cox and dr tuttle along with mr verne read have worked extremely hard for several years to achieve their goal of creation of a national park in samoa i am pleased we have boon able to assist them in their dedicated efforts i believe we have a unique opportunity to join with the people of samoa in the proservation of the third major tropical forest of the united states by the establishment of the national park of american samoa the establishment of the park under h r 4818 would assist in the conservation of samoas wildlife such as the flying fox and the variegated marine life of the islands reefs in a manner consistent with the

supports this measure the washington parks wilderness bill will go far in protecting three magnificent national parks that are located in my home statemount rainier olympic and the north cascades the legislation would also establish wilderness status for parts of the ross lake and lake chelan national recreation areas by enacting this legislation we will be doing a great deal to guide future park management congress will be setting a firm policy that it intends careful management of the three parks these are some of the most unique natural places in the united states if not the worldranging from miles of uninhabited ocean beaches to dense rain forests to mountain glaciers and alpine meadows we want the parks to remain as beautiful and pristine as they are today this bill will be an insurance policy for the future 118166 cor future generations of park visitors will thank us for the actions we now take on this bill under the bill more than 1 7 million acres of area already within the national park system in washington state would be given a wilderness designation the bill would designate 872 000 acres of wilderness and 594 acres of potential wilderness in olympic national park 635 000 acres of wilderness and 5 226 acres of potential wilderness in the north cascades national park and national recreation area complex and 217 000 acres of wilderness in mount rainier national park why do we need this legislation i represent an area which in recent years hs experienced one of the fastest rates of population growth in the united states the eighth district of washington state including areas east and south of seattle grew 29 percent between 1970 and 1980and continues to grow for many people in the puget sound area of washington state the national parks are convenient places to get away from the stresses of urban and suburban living mount rainier is just a 2hour drive from seattle with substantial population growth these parks are bound to feel the pressures of over development the threat is serious mount rainier the boundaries of which are within my congressional district has insufficient lowlevel elevation to protect the ecological community surrounding the mountain olympic national park has recently been listed as one of the 10 most endangered national parks in the united states by the wilderness society these parks are wilderness today they should remain wilderness tomorrow make no mistake the national park service by and large already does an excellent job of managing these park areas as wilderness this bill seeks to ensure that this careful management continues over many years a wilderness designation would require a high standard of management however the object of the bill is not in any way to discourage recreational use all recreational activities now associated with these park and recreation areas will continue wilderness boundaries in the legislation would be drawn to accommodate existing transportation corridors within the parks including campgrounds and lodges new trail development will also continue to be a high priority certain lands under the bill will be identified as potential wildernesslands that are either not owned by the federal government but targeted for acquisition or on which a nonwilderness use exists that the national park service anticipates terminating potential wilderness would allow the park service to administratively declare the area as wilderness once it has been acquired or the nonconforming use is terminated wilderness boundaries have been carefully considered throughout the bill wilderness boundaries have been drawn to protect private landholdings each park will be assured of continued substantial road access wilderness boundaries have been drawn around both existing roads and those currently in park planning documents what would be limited under a wilderness designation are physical changes which could negatively impact the environmental importance and natural beauty of these areas new road construction would be limited mineral extraction dam construc tion and largescale commercial recreational development would also be strictly limited by a wilderness designation at some point sooner or later we will have to say that limitations on development of these park areas are both necessary and desirable this legislation would ensure that the natural character of these areas take precedence we cannot forget that it is the natural significance of these areas that draw thousands of tourists every year the bill does make provisions for new visitor centers in two new park locations the pacific coast of olympic national park and at an entrance to the north cascades national park in the north cascades the bill is sensitive to the concerns of area residents the stchekin valley in the lake chelan national recreation area is truly unique with no roads into or out of this historic area at the north end of lake chelan its residents are proud of their beautiful surroundings and rightfully protective of their landholdings senator evans and i have sought to carefully protect these interests by specifically excluding the stehekin valley from wilderness status carefully considered wilderness boundaries exclude most of the valley floor from wilderness designation as well as the road far up into the mountains and into the cottonwood campground to the north stehenkin homeowners would be permitted a reasonable use of gravel and firewood for personal use private land private home development and the use of aircraft on lake chelan and the public airstrip in the valley would be protected report language recognizes an agreement concerning the stehekin airstrip made with the state of washington many years ago the proposed legislation would also make a number of necessary administrative reforms for the three parks at the request of the park service several provisions amend unclear and outdated provisions in existing law and clarify the legal authority of the parks other language enables park superintendents to have reasonable latitude in servicing often mountainous road corridors within 200 feet of existing paved roads several technical boundary adjustments with the forest service are also proposed by the bill a boundary adjustment affecting crystal mountain ski regort adjacent to mount rainier woum remove 311h acres from the park and turn administrative authority over to the forest service although subject to debate this seems like the only practical solution to a longstanding administrative problem for the park a portion of a ski lift tower has occupied park land since 1962 this technical exchange is needed so that the crystal mountain resort can make necessary repairs and modifications to continue operation of the lift rather than complicate matters by having the park service issue a special permit for continued operation on parkland the park and forest services have agreed that the continuing nonconforming use should be deleted from the parks jurisdiction as compensation a total of 240 acres of forest service land would be added to mount rainer national park in the areas of backbone ridge on the south and klapatchee point on the west side this exchange will place two park roadsthat briefly cross over into forest service landwholly inside the park putting mount rainiers

agriculture the food assistance for the homeless title of h r 558 was reported by the committee on agriculture as h r 177 the goal of that legislation is to help meet the food needs of homeless people an issue the committee has looked at in depth i support these and other programs aimed at providing food assistance to needy individuals and families in fact these are but two of the several programs operated in the unitedstates department of agriculture to provide food assistance the usda programs alone account for over 20 billion in 1987 spending the committee bill does not increase expenditures in 1987 that was one of the goals of this legislation and i commend the subcommittee chairman for achieving that target however there are significant costs to the budget in 1988 and the outyears with insufficient offsets to accommodate these spending increases the committee was informed that the 1988 budget resolution will accommodate this additional spending at this point the 100th congress has not adopted the 1988 budget resolution and yet we are proposing to spend money we do not know if we will have for example the shelter deduction ceiling might be as low as 162 if the most recent weight given fuels and other utilities were used throughout the period under consideration included in the food assistance title are several changes to the food stamp program and reauthorization and improvement of the temporary emergency food assistance program this title first allows states to conduct outreach activities aimed at persons without permanent homes to encourage them to participate in the food stamp program the federal government will pay onehalf of all outreach costs second increases the shelter deduction for food stamp participants with high shelter costs from 149 per month to 168 per month effective third exempts housing assistance payments made on behalf of households living in temporary quarters from consideration as income for food stamp purposes such payments will not be counted if the temporary housing lacks facilities for preparation and cooking of hot meals or refrigeration fourth coordinates the annual adjustment of food stamp income levels with annual adjustments of food stamp benefit levels and deductions all will take place on october 1 fifth denies the earned income deduction to food stamp participants who deliberately fail to report earnings sixth allows the secretary upon certification of need by a state governor to provide up to 14 million pounds of surplus cheese for distribution within the state governors must certify that there are eligible participants not being served by tefap or that the unemployment rate within the state has risen and that the distribution of surplus cheese will not substantially displace the commercial sales of cheese seventh reauthorizes tefap through 1990 at the following levels 1988 52 million 1989 53 9 million 1990 56 2 million according to the congressional budget office there is no cost to the budget in 1987 as a result of the food assistance for the homeless provisions however in 1988 the cbo estimates the cost will be 111 millionthe total cost through 1990 is 387 million the cost of these provisions in 1988 and the outyears remains a concern to me as i stated during the subcommittee and committee consideration the congress has not yet adopted a 1988 budget resolution and i believe we must be budget conscious we must be assured that we can pay for future increases in the budget as we make these changes not only for aid to the homeless but for all expenditures of taxpayer dollars h r 558 of which the food assistance to the homeless title is just one part presents even greater budget problems cbo estimates the cost to be 500 million in 1987 with no offsets to pay for these additional expenditures at least in the agriculture committee we did exercise fiscal responsibility for 1987 and show no additional expenditures to the budget however for 1988 and the outyears we too have problems i am concerned about the homeless individuals and families however as we did in house joint resolution 102 we must be able to pay for the benefits we provide of the many issues before the 100th congress this is one which i find to be difficult to resolve as i have said before during the several hearings the subcommittee has held concerning this issue of food assistance to the needy i firmly believe that in our nation of abundance it is a tragedy for one child or one elderly person or anyone to go hungry we are a generous countryboth through government programs and through the private sector usda programs alone provide over 20 billion in food assistance private sector contributions to various nonprofit organizations regularly increase from year to year and approached 80 billion last year and yet there is no dispute that there are significant numbers of homeless people in both urban and rural areas of the united states the causes of homelessness are many and are complex they include the deinstitutionalization of mental health patients redevelopment of cities and the loss of lowrent housing highunemployment rates and a breakdown in traditional family structure the federal state and local programs available to low income individual and families often do not meet the needs of the homeless despite the bilions spent each year while housing is the key issue in dealing with homelessness other services are needed as well these include food assistance health and mental health clinics and for those who are able assistance in getting and keepng jobs the two major programs under the jurisdiction of this subcommittee that provide food assistance are the food stamp program and the temporary emergency food assistance program tefap neither of which are designed for the homeless but both provide assistance to this group of individuals through the food stamp program participants are provided food coupons which in most cases supplement the food budget of low income people however for the homeless difficulties arise in making full use of food coupons since they lack homes and cooking and food storage facilities last year the congress amended the food stamp act to allow the homeless to use food coupons in shelters and soup kitchens this provision was patterned after a proposal that i was working on along with chairman panetta concerning demonstration projects designed to allow the homeless to purchase low cost nutritious meals at soup kitchens while the amendment adopted last year does not address all concerns we covered in our proposal i am anxious to see how this further extension of the food stamp program to the homeless will work the pilot project we proposed presented a unique opportunity to begin solving a difficult problem in a straightforward manner lacking facilities for storage and preparation of food homeless individuals are unable to make optimal use of food stamp benefits to which they may be entitled by permitting such eligible individuals to use food stamps to purchase lowcost prepared meals the proposal would increase the effectiveness of the program for some of its most needy beneficiaries those operating the soup kitchens could have used food stamps for the purchase of food in large quantities thereby maximizing the efficiency of food stamp benefits for the homeless in addition the use of food stamps would have been limited to the purchase of food rather than preparation services and other associated costs also maximizing food stamp program funds by alleviating hunger and adhere to the goal of the food stamp act the second program under our committees jurisdiction is the temporary emergency food assistance program tefap provides surplus commodities to states for distribution to organizations serving lowincome people some of whom are homeless in 1988 it is anticipated that the commodities made available will include 420 million pounds of cheese 180 million pounds of rice 144 million pounds of flour 96 million pounds of honey 96 million pounds of nonfat dry milk 72 million pounds of butter and 48 million pounds of cornmeal with regard to tefap i am pleased that the congress acted to overturn the proposed deferral of 28 6 million of tefap administrative funds i introduced house joint resolution 124 which disapproved that deferral so that the full amount of money states had planned to use to distribute surplus foods will be available during this year the agriculture committee may be able to contribute to easing the problems of the homeless but solving this problem will require much more and must involve not only the federal government but state and local governments and our communities as well i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.5871162414550781,

numbers of citizens to grow up uneducated illhoused and underfed not only limits future productivity but undermines the integrity of our strength as a nation public policy debates regarding the

receive influence and often determine the type of job they can hold their jobs in turn contribute heavily to the standard of living enjoyed by their families public policy changes made to revamp or retool the workplace will also have a major impact on the home the stakes in this debate are particularly high for children one program that has been part of the public policy debate in this area over the past 20 years is the work incentive program it was established in 1967 with the purpose of providing skill assessments job training and employment placement to help afdc recipients become selfsupporting unfortunately the program has not achieved its potential it has however managed to weather criticism and serious efforts to eliminate its funding recently though new support has surfaced for the win program this support is due to the great strides made in recent years under the win demonstration program authority as part of the provisions of the 1981 omnibus budget reconciliation act states could for the first time as part of their regular programs require afdc recipients to work in public or nonprofit agencies in return for their welfare benefits in addition greater flexibility was given to the win program to fund onthejob training programs by diverting recipients welfare grants into wage subsidies for private employers the intent of these innovative programs has been to provide the means by which welfare recipients can be moved into gainful employment with the flexibility permitted under win demonstration programs states have begun to offer a mix of services ranging from basic skills education to sophisticated training as well as more traditional community work experience and what is now known as workfare in which clients undertake public service for a period of time in exchange for their grants the most discussed of these programs is the massachusetts etchoices program which has placed more than 30 000 welfare recipients and applicants in unsubsidized jobs the program is expected to save massachusetts taxpayers 107 million in reduced welfare benefits and increased tax revenues this year since its inception the et program has helped to reduce the welfare caseload by 4 percent my own state of vermont has initiated a similar program called up reach which is designed to consolidate at the state level many existing

assist the homeless but i have serious reservations about this bill to begin with it creates a new categorical grant program which identifies and uses underutilized buildings and property to house the homeless but all too often these buildings are not suitable for housing marh 5 1987 the homeless because they are located away from the innercity where the vast majority of the homeless are located furthermore the use of surplus government buildings to house the homeless could well result in the development of large or mass shelters which are generally agreed to be inappropriate for housing homeless families with children since it is a categorical program the federal government will dictate the use of funds instead of playing the more appropriate role of providing support to state and local governments in their effort to aid the homeless it also needlessly duplicates an existing program the emergency shelter grants program by providing similar supportive activities for the homeless i am also concerned that the funding level for this bill is excessive given the existing efforts of both congress and the administration to aid the homeless since 1984 when congress began turning its attention to the problem of the homeless congress has appropriated 435 million in direct assistance to the homeless the administration has run successfully the emergency shelter grant program which provides assistance to 36 major cities and additional funding is already planned for this program which will provide grant assistance to approximately 469 metropolitan cities and urban counties it is a program designed to minimize hud administration and give maximum control to state and local governments the administration likewise plans to spend 400 million to help fund nearly 600 community health centers and it already funds nearly 300 runaway and homeless youth centers given the difficulty which this body is having in meeting the grammrudman targets h r 558s authorization to spend an additional 750 million is difficult to justify the bill will likewise have a limited immediate impact on the plight of the homeless and thus it is not an emergency piece of legislation many of the bills provisions such as converting unused buildings into shelters could well take years to implement furthermore by the time appropriations are enacted in h r 558 it will be virtually impossible to spend all of the money authorized for fiscal year 1987 effectively all this spending is hard to justify when the definition of a homeless individual is so broad in this bill that even some congressional staffers could fall under its coverage the original bill terms a homeless individual as anyone who lacks a fixed and adequate nighttime residence or anyone who lives in grossly substandard accommodations the problem with these definitions is that they create entitlements for millions who are not presentlyconsidered to be homeless furthermore the writers of the bill were unduly influenced by mitch snyders inflated estimates of the number of homeless his group the community for creative nonviolence claims that nearly 3 milion americans are homeless a harvard university study on the other hand estimates that the nationwide population of homeless stands at approximately 350 000 roughly the same number estimated by hud the problem of the homeless is also exceedingly complex and to a great extent a local problem reports prepared by the house govemment operations subcommittee on intergovernmental relations and human resources found that over i million lowrent apartment units are lost each year to condominium conversions abandonment arson and demolition over the last 10 years the subcommittee found that the united states lost more than half of its cheap singleroom occupancy units used by poor people the vast majority of decisions to tear down these units were made at the local level furthermore decisions made at the state level to force patients in mentalhealth hospitals back into the mainstream of society as part of a process of deinstitutionalization have had the effect of putting mentally unstable people on the streets and adding them to the ranks of the homeless the problem of the homeless is also greatly complicated by the fact that these local conditions vary greatly from locality to locality the cause of the homeless in some regions derives from deinstitutionalization while in other regions rent control and condo conversions are to blame hence while some federal programs such as the emergency shelter program have been successful the majority of federal programs have difficulty taking into consideration the differing needs of these communities it is simply too difficult for bureaucrats based in washington to tailor programs which can adequately deal with these problems it makes more sense to allow state and city govemments which are closer and more responsive to the people than the federal government to design programs which fit the needs of their communities many state governments moreover are running budget surpluses while the national government is running a massive deficit individual states are already beginning to tackle this problem roughly half of the states have formal plans which provide shelter medical care and counseling many municipal governments also have creative and detailed homeless programs according to a 1984 hud study nonprofit organizations such as the salvation army the ymca and churches run over 90 percent of the centers which provide services to the homeless many already receive funds from existing federal programs which in my opinion leaves little reason to establish another one we in congress should therefore commend local efforts to aid the homeless and should likewise urge state governments to do even more to aid the homeless in conclusion i submit that my colleagues reconsider the wisdom of passing this legislation it is a bill which usurps local initiative by increasing the power of the federal government the plight of the homeless will be served better by allowing local communities to play a greater role in dealing with this problem"],

nonpoint source pollution of both ground water and surface water we have come to realize that the overapplication of fertilizer can in certain instances contaminate ground water and lead to serious health problems farmers and other rural residents are the population at most risk since they often depend on the private untreated well water located below the farmed land minnesotans are particularly aware of this dilemma since ground water serves as a potable water supply for threefourths of the population we are faced with difficult policy questions in light of the environmental and public

years after date of enactment section 3 provides two amendments to section 319 of the clean water act which establishes a new nonpoint source management program within the environmental protection agency subsection a amends the clean water act to require that any state assessment report and any state management program be developed in consultation with the agricultural nitrogen best management practices task force established by section 2 of this bill similarly subsection b amends the act to require the administration of epa to consult with the task force in preparing the administrators annual and final reports to congress these amendments will highlight the important link between nonpoint source pollution and agricultural best management practices section 3 will also encourage greater consultation with and coordination among federal state and local agencies since the recent enactment of the water quality act of 1987 we are already beginning to see greater cooperation and consistency between the states and epa my own state of minnesota is setting a fine example in this area just recently the state enacted the minnesota clean water partnership act to meet its nonpoint source pollution needs develop best management practices and satisfy other requirements under the clean water act the new minnesota law will help to identify the combination of education incentives and best management practices to tackle ground water and surface water problems across the state my bill is intended to build upon these efforts emphasizing the connection between agricultural and nonpoint source pollution strategies and strengthening the ties among federal state and local agencies and the american farmer based on my experiences as a farmer and on testimony received by the public works and transportation committee the agriculture committee and others i see a tremendous need for this bill we must place greater emphasis on nitrogen management agricultural practices and their overall impact on water quality my bill takes an important first step to address this need and provides a good springboard for further legislation i hope in the coming weeks members of the agriculture and public works committees will take a close look at my legislation as we consider comprehensive ground water research bills i believe the agricultural nitrogen management act of 1987 is something all of us can and should support"], [0.5868222117424011, 0.5868222117424011, 0, "i rise in support of the conference report on h r 4784 making appropriations for rural develop ment agriculture and related agencies for fiscal year 1989 let me commend my good friend and colleague the chairman of the full appropriations committee and chairman of the appropriations subcommittee on rural development agriculture and the related agencies mr wnirren for his hard work in running the conference and bringing us a bill that i believe the president will sign and that significantly addresses the needs of rural america yet serves an extremely broad spectrum of constituencies i also want to thank the other members of the subcommittee who have worked hard and in a bipartisan manner on behalf of agriculture and of all rural residents they truly recognize the importance of agriculture to the unitedstates economy and to the wellbeing of all americans i also want to thank our staff for their dedicated assistance with 146 amendments containing over 400 items of disagreement i am happy to report to you that most of these have been worked out very satisfactorily from the houses and the administrations point of view let me stress that we had a very difficult task but after 3 a days of meeting with our counterparts in the senate i believe we have a bill that will address the concerns of members on both sides of the aisle and the needs of the american public this years total new budget obligational authority is almost 10 billion below fiscal year 1988 in fiscal year 1988 our bill had 56 18 billion in total obligational authority and this year it is down to 42 512 billion the funding levels of this bill are within the proposed levels in the presidents budget 27 million below the presidents request and 1 986 million below the 302b allocation and the outlay allocation the bill is in line with last years budget summit agreement three major programs that were expanded this year include the women infants and children nutrition program the food safety inspection service and tie food and drug administration first the wic program has been increased by nearly 127 million for fiscal year 1989 above the 1988 level and is more than 52 million above the presidents request this program has proven itself over and over again as one of the most effective methods of inprovlng our nations future citizens health and prosperity unfortunately funding limitations have prevented us from being able to serve even half of those eligible for the program wic is not the only nutrition program other nutrition programs help disseminate information vital to our citizens health through the human nutrition information service and send food for peace to africa asia south america and other regions of the world where there is a shortage of food we have provided funds to help serve nutritious meals for both the young and the elderly of the united states through programs like the school lunch program and the elderly feeding programs under title iii of the older americans act of 1965 second the food safety and inspection service has been increased by more than 12 9 million above fiscal year 1988 to 404 954 000 this is a vital program to assure that americans have meat and poultry products that are wholesome unadulterated and properly labeled and packaged while americans enjoy a nutritious abundant food supply we must be ever vigilant to ensure that our meat and poultry products are the best and safest possible third the food and drug administrations appropriation las been increased by more than 31 million to 481 844 000 for fiscal year 1989 the primary goal of the fda is to protect the consumer by setting standards on food testing drug safety conducting research on health hazards and helping to promote orphan drug development although may important issues are addressed in this bill none is more vital than providing assistance to our farmers and ranchers agriculture has been and will continue to be the backbone of americas economic military and political strength unfortunately the backbone of america has lost over 261 000 farmers and ranchers or 11 percent of the farm population since 1981 on the other hand you and i have both heard how much better off our agricultural producers were in 1987 the united states had record net cash farm income totalling 57 billion in 1987 compared to 52 billion in 1986 and 47 3 billion in 1985 estimates for 1988 earlier this year indicated an income in the 50 to 55 billion range but that was before the drought began to take affect and this level cannot be sustained and will fall in 1988 but for now the good news is that the ccc needs only 8 8 billion to restore prior years lossesa substantial drop from 14 3 billion of a year agoanother positive sign of the improvement in the agricultural economy last year also dramatic increased exports are helping to reduce total spending on agriculture the number of farm workers in the civilian labor force is 2 75 million s of april 1988 when added to the 20plus million workers who support the production and delivery of food and fiber to our citizens you have the largest single industry in the united states agriculture employs as many workers as the transportation steel and automobile industries combined one of the reasons our country has been able to achieve so much is so little of our family income is used to buy food in fact our families spend the smallest percent of their income for food than families in any other country in the world only 12 3 percent for all food and 7 9 percent for food purchased for use at home for every dollar spent on food last year only 25 cents went to the producer while athome expenditures for food averaged a 31 cents return to the farm away from home food purchases only returned 17 cents this clearly indicates consumers ability and willingness to spend more for food for conv ience and in
