{"top_correct": [[0.0004318356513977051, 0.9995681643486023, 1, "for a great number of hours today in this chamber there has been a great debate on whether or not to repeal the affordable care act when we know fully that the chances are slim to move forward and the measure would not be signed into law is it political posturing i believe it is of a grand style theres a pattern being established here theres been an attackoutright attackon social security attempts to privatize the system its been under attack for the last 76 years its been the underpinning that provides stability for working families across this great nation it has been a security piece that has enabled many to have at least assurances that there would be some support in family budgets as they move month to month we know that that measure social security has been dealing with its enemies for a long timesince before it was made a law likewise medicare which came to us in the midsixties enabled our senior community to have its health care needs met provided predictability and stability for retired households enabled people to enjoy a quality of life a better quality of health care we know that before medicare many of those who had retired expected to see their economic security dip south because of the expected cost of providing health care when they perhaps could not get that coverage in an insurance context so medicare as we know it today would be undone by the republican majority in this house they would prefer to privatize social security allow us to reach to the financial sector to perhaps see a repeat of what happened to so many individuals and families out there with this past recession where they saw their lifetime savings wiped away trillions lost in the american economy pain and suffering endured by families across this land theyd rather see a voucher system for medicare handing it over to the insurance companies to leave seniors digging deeper into their pockets so the pattern has been established here and now a repeal of the affordable care act before its full implementation before given a chance as we arrive as the last industrialized nation in the world to provide a universal health care coverage program unacceptable progress is struck a decision is rendered by the highest court in the land a conservativeleaning court before the ink is dry on that decision a move to repeal the court spoke it has spoken to america and said the litmus test for constitutionality was debated and a decision rendered that said yes in fact it meets the constitutionality test and so this evening on the eve of the attempts to repeal the affordable care act as it stands is a very telling moment it is one that suggests to us that there is this outright attempt to undo programs that serve our middle class so very well and without a thriving middle class our nation is not prosperous without that thriving middle class theres not purchasing power strong enough to provide the recovery of our economy without a strengthening of our middle class there is not a confidence in the economy a confidence that is needed so as to grow more customers for our business base and so the affordable care act is offering promise and hope to millions tens of millions of americans across this land whether youre insured underinsured uninsured all categories will see strengthening because of this measure think of it i represent a large proportion of senior citizens who are concerned about their pharmaceutical costs many dealing with that doughnut hole have reached that threshold that requires them to dig into their pockets we close that doughnut hole we make more affordable the prescriptions that are required for people to stay well and in some cases to have the medications that keep them alive we deny that opportunity to our nations seniors we deny the respect that we offer we deny the dignity in the equation that speaks to affordable outcomes for the pharmaceuticals that our senior community requires that doughnut hole would have been closed by 2020 further at the other end of the age spectrum many young adults finding it difficult in this recessionand now the recovery periodto gain a job as they perhaps leave high school or college are given the opportunity with the affordable care act to remain on their familys policy until the age of 26 therein lies a strong benefit for some 6 6 million young adults denied with the repeal measure denying access and affordability to health care situations how many cases of young adults impacted by catastrophic illness or accidents will it require to turn the hearts and the minds in a positive direction that would not forego this opportunity for our nations young adults a strong benefit associated with this package what about those who have a preexisting condition some 17 million children in that category and thats not to account for the many adults who would be denied because of preexisting conditions asthma in children diabetes in our senior community being a woman utilized as a preexisting condition an opportunity to deny coverage and the basic core need that we should consider to be truly american another benefit lost to the greedy notion of repealing success that was achieved in this house and the united states senate and signed into law by this president what about the efforts to deny lifetime benefits as a threshold cutting people off of an insurance coverage at perhaps a very demanding time in their lives games played with people and their lives and their recovery hope pulled from working families across this nation because of an insensitivity of this congress a deplorable situation assistance to our small business community now if we profess our small business community to be the economic engine that is part and parcel of our economic comeback our economic springboard then would we not want to provide assistance in that basic core need area would we not want to allow tax credits to come the way of our small business community many a majority of those businesses will remind all of us as representatives that they want to provide for their employees they want a productive workforce that means a strong and well workforce and so they see it as a strong investment one however that they could not afford in recent years because of the escalating costs 18 percent larger bill than industry and perhaps weaker coverage they wanted that turned around they wanted a smart approach a businesslike approach a sensitive response they got it with the affordable care act progress denied the small business engine weakened by this sort of neglect that could be advanced in this cited pattern of undoing social security privatizing social security changing medicare as we know it forever now repealing the affordable care act we see the pattern we see the gross neglect the disrespect for americas middle class her working families so we go forward and we understand that with the opportunities of an exchange small employers our small business community understands that if theyre unable to enter into an exchange where all the private sector participants agree to play by the rules to sharpen their pencils roll up their sleeves provide the service live within the parameters and allow for the many to enter into a common exchange to provide corresponding benefits think of it if 1 of 10 in that employee firm of 20 were to be impacted with catastrophic illness its devastating an actuarial impact that hits that small business owner hard in the pocketbook because of the premium increase for that 1 person of the 10 you employ if those same 10 employees were allowed to enter the exchange a better outcome a different outcome a stronger outcome for the economic recovery of this nation because the gross majority of jobs being produced in this comeback are being done by our small business community and so you know the formula is quite obvious we want a comeback we want that strongest response here from washington for that kick that we endured from a recession that drained us of 8 2 million jobs the best way to do it first of three principles small business provide for the strengthening of small business which the affordable care act does because that small business community has forever been the pulse of american enterprise secondly invest in that entrepreneur the dreamer the mover the shaker it always stretched us since our days of pioneer spirit with the industrial revolution and the westward movement very familiar to the district i represent which is the donor area to the erie canal in upstate new york in the capital region mohawk valley that pioneer spirit exists in our fabric today its our dna invest in the entrepreneur to be the ideas economy kingpin we rely on these wizards to build us sustain us stretch us empower us and then finally invest in a thriving middle class which the affordable care act does it enables us as a middle class community to be bolstered by the confidence the security the stability that has come with this success story in guaranteeing access and affordability to quality health care that will underscore the value of wellness and not just deal with illness that will put together efforts to cost contain that will bring people into a structured program so that we can monitor their activities and connect them to a system you know youll hear from some on the floor we dont want to pay for this its going to cost us too much were paying today for the neglect for the consequences of a notsoperfect system status quo will not cut it and so we need to go forward with progressive policies with the soundness of reform with the boldness of transition with the confidence we can instill with the progressiveness of policies that we can draft and so it is a sad note here echoed in this chamber that would attempt to unravel dilute destroy deny the promise we can make to america as i look at this effort for a comeback the containment of health care costs is just one of those areas that we need to help control create that better environment in which to grow jobs cultivate a prosperity its important its important for us to understand that it is part of an economic recovery equation but theres also the wisdom of investing in education in higher education again under attack by a system that does not always profess the strength of research and education and patents and discovery we understand that we are in the midst of a global race on innovation clean energy and ideas and high tech to be outstanding competitors to arrive at that race ready to conquer we will need to be strong and fit in order to be the winning agent on that global scene we saw that order of passion we saw that order of investment in the global race on space just decades ago this nation impacted by a sputnik moment dusted off its backside and said never again never again and what was the result together a nation grew in its commitment to winning the global race on space we are going to be that agent that nation that proud people that would stake the american flag on the moon and we won that race because of a commitment because of investment in the soundness of the people of this great country and her business community we embraced research we embraced science we believed in our strength as a people and the confidence exuded was the elixir that brought us to the victory where is that like passion today where is that leadership a rather youthful president that led us in the sixties and challenged us in almost replication today finds us interestingly to be challenged by a rather youthful president asking us to enter into the global sweepstakes committing with passion to the cause and so we need that investment in education in higher education and research just today in schenectady new york in the 21st congressional district of new york that im proud to represent we announced formally the creation of the advanced battery manufacturing center at that facility of ge ceo jeff immelt traveled for the celebration came to town to announce this wonderful wonderful addition that is america at work with her genius activity thats america determined to win the global race on ideas advanced battery manufacturing the battery the linchpin to so much potential out there to grow domestic supplies of energy to grow jobs as we grow our energy future to reduce the gluttonous dependency on fossilbased fuels oftentimes imported from some of the most unfriendly nations to the united states sending hundreds of billions of dollars annually to those foreign treasuries that are then used to train troops to fight against our own daughters and sons on the battlefield unacceptable there is a better way and this congress knows it we invest in jobs we invest in health care we invest in education we invest in research we do it in a way that promises our best attempt as a nation to generations yet unborn someone was there for us and we need to be there for future generations of americans to provide the sort of cuttingedge opportunity that will spell america at her best i look at that opportunity for not only battery manufacturing but nanotechnology and semiconductor signs chip manufacturing the newly designed 20th congressional district in new york that comprises a good portion of the now existing 21st district that i represent is probably one of the most technology investedin congressional districts in the country it is happening because there is this belief in the worker a belief in the entrepreneur a belief in the small business community a belief in the industrial context of the district and knowing full well that americas needsbe they for the environment or energys sake or business creation job creation business opportunityare inspiring this remarkable progress it requires our moving forward with a plan it requires our moving forward academically with the soundness of policy and with the corresponding resource advocacy that will yield lucrative dividends i see it all the time i see it in energyefficiency programs that produce jobs that enable us to capture waste heat that is part of the energy process enabling us to be much more efficient efforts that enable us to create more and more patents in a world that has grown much more competitive much more sophisticated we can ill afford to weaken in our attempts to be the kingmakers of the international economy the old american spirit the history of this nation replete with those rags to riches scenarios that became the reason and the inspiration for the compilation of journeys made by our ancestors to these shores because the opportunity called the american dream became the prize for which they searched i see it in my own roots the proudest label i carry in life is as the grandson of immigrants their journey gave me great opportunity and it gave my family great opportunity those journeys chased after the american dream we need beginning in this house chamber to reignite the american dream to go back to the core essence of who we are as a people to reach into that american heart and soul that has forever relied on its passion that we can achieve because we have opportunity and that we will not deny that opportunity that we will strengthen the boldness of those dreams and enable us to respond to the needs of the moments and the future and to write our legacy as a generation of americans let us not fail in that attempt let us continue to reach deep into that american spirit at a time when we were challenged and our economy was brought to its knees by failed policies that did not manage well that did not provide for the stewardship of our resources and when we tripped and fell let it be known that in the recovery we were stronger than ever before because of that belief that our best days lay ahead of us the belief that those best days were in the future we moved forward and we dug deep into that american spirit to respond with the respect for americas middle class our middle classall of us in that middle classhave always understood if you play hard if you abide by the rules if you roll up your sleeves and do your best you could rightfully anticipate the taste of success that is america in her most shining moments and that is an economy that we can produce it begins with the soundness of a strong and productive workforce that went through training and retraining that got to taste the potential for success by that self discovery that comes with education and to then understand our gifts so that we could share them in the most profound way and then to provide for the wellness of that workforce so it could be most productive so that the conditioning that came with that sort of commitment and that order of respect and that potion of dignity could then allow for us to speak to a nation that was humbled by its own beginnings where the rightful stories of so many who made it their journey were written by a nation that believed in her people so tonight on this eve of an attempt to repeal the affordable care act let us understand that our budget here in washington our actions with legislation our responsiveness to the needs of the american people are an establishment of our prioritiesa prescription of what we see our future to bea reaching into the heart to say that we are a truly caring lot thats what separates us from other nations it is the uniqueness of america and her greatness the affordable care act is a measurement of not only sound policy it is a statement of a compassionate society that understands its not about oneself that its about neighbors that its about community that its about the great society it has been the history through the decades through the vintages of time that has enabled us to reach to the greatness of our government to reach to the soundness of ideas and innovation to respond to the challenges that have enabled us to build upon those who preceded us always anticipating that the next generation would be made stronger we owe it to our children and grandchildren and generations yet unborn let them look at this moment in history american history knowing that america was challenged that she stepped up to the plate and said yes to her people and truly made a difference and allowed people to understand full well that the best days of this great nation lie ahead of us with that i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.00044852495193481445,

a great challenge in reducing the deficit and creating jobs the greater challenge is to do this in a way that is consistent with our values slashing funds for programs that help put food on the table for the neediest of americans young children pregnant mothers the elderly and those struggling to make ends meet is not good policy the special supplemental nutrition assistance program for women infants and children wic the commodity supplemental food program csfp which serves predominantly lowincome seniors and the emergency food assistance program tefap which works with states to assist food banks are just some of the programs that were targeted for extreme cuts the cuts to wic concern me the most wic provides food to new mothers babies and children under five who have been identified as nutritionally at risk nearly 50 of the babies born in our country each year rely on wic on top of that it is incredibly costeffective serving nearly 10 million people each year and costing less than 100 per person in my district nearly 54 000 children and women suffer from food hardship and depend on wic to make ends meet this is yet another chapter in the republican attack on working families to give handouts to special interests first they came after seniors who rely on medicare and now theyre coming after children and mothers who rely on food assistance we cannot let republicans destroy programs on which our most vulnerable population depend to pay for 45 billion in tax breaks for millionaires according to the center for american progress if we got rid of tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires for one week we would pay for the entire wic program for a year i urge my colleagues to protect working americans not millionaires and billionaires thank

going to be paid thats a scandal and its scandalous that our republican colleagues would threaten for the first time in american history to torpedo americas creditworthiness and american jobs unless they succeeded in enacting a budget plan to end the medicare guarantee slash medicaid and slash critical investments in education and our future that was the plan they wanted to do that now and they wanted to have this whole debate again 6 months from now why not to reduce the deficit if the goal was to reduce the deficit why refuse to end taxpayer subsidies for the oil companies if reducing the deficit was the purpose why refuse to end special breaks for corporate jets and the folks at the very high end of the income scale that wasnt the plan the plan was to use this moment to threaten the economy to try and slash the social safety net and those critical investments in education and innovation in our future and guess what they failed they failed to do that they failed to end the medicare guarantee they failed to slash medicaid they failed to slash education in this measure we succeeded in protecting medicare and social security beneficiaries we succeeded in protecting seniors in nursing homes individuals with disabilities and poor kids who depend on medicaid for their health care and we succeeded in providing room for critical investments in education and americas future dont get me wrong theres much in this plan i dont like we did not succeed in shutting down special interest tax loopholes that add hundreds of billions of dollars to our deficits our republican colleagues refused to cut those subsidies for big oil companies they refused to cut the others and now were going to have a great debate were going to have a great debate about how to grow the economy and reduce our longterm deficit it will be a debate about our national priorities i hope we will support the balanced approach that the president has called for one that refuses to put greater burdens on medicare beneficiaries in order to provide greater tax breaks to the wealthiest americans in the coming months our republican colleagues will be given the following test will they choose to protect special interest tax breaks over investments necessary to keep our nation strong and secure will they finally demonstrate a willingness to pay for our national defense rather than put it on the credit

the importance of clean air and on the value of good health for all americans despite our differences on how we treat air pollution my amendment offers us an opportunity to come together on a bipartisan basis specifically to protect the health of our older neighborsamericas seniors the passage of my amendment will not prevent the passage of the underlying bill if the amendment is adopted it will be incorporated into the bill and the bill will proceed to a vote the amendment i offer today will ensure that we respect the health of our older neighbors our parents and our grandparents by protecting the quality of the air that they breathe seniors are more susceptible than others to the harmful impacts of dirty air and pollution and our neighbors need to understand what is in the air that they breathe so my amendment proposes to do two things one require waste incinerators located within 5 miles of a nursing home an assisted living facility or a hospital to simply use the most effective pollution control methods available two require polluting boilers to notify surrounding communities of toxic emissions without my amendment the gop bill will cause a dramatic increase in the emissions of mercury dioxins acid gases and sulfur dioxide near populations that are particularly vulnerable to pollution the clean air act protects us all from some of the most carcinogenic and dangerous pollutants mercury damages the developing brain and reduces iq and the ability to learn sulfur dioxide is known to interfere with breathing and as a result is especially harmful to seniors some seniors are so sensitive to dirty air and pollution they require oxygen tanks to aid their breathing and a variety of health conditions afflicting seniors is aggravated by poor air quality any increase in hazardous air pollution will disproportionately harm our older neighbors at a time in their lives when they are the most vulnerable we can save lives and we can save money by requiring that these waste incinerators that are located near our older neighbors use the most effective pollution control methods available when it comes to the health and health care costs for older americans my colleagues weve got to be smarter it is not wise to aggravate the respiratory ailments of our older neighbors who likely are on medicare just as it is not wise for the gop to advocate for ending medicare as we know it it doesnt save any money the nonpartisan cbo explained that the gop plan to dismantle medicare would simply shift costs to seniors without addressing the underlying issues actually the gop pollution bills here can be viewed as handing our parents our grandparents and our older neighbors higher medical bills tied to dirtier air so lets be smart lets ensure that waste incinerators located in areas where our seniors live use the most effective pollution controls other industries have done it and this small industrial subset should not receive a special interest carveout while our older neighbors would be disproportionately affected by this gop bill in its current form theyre not the only ones young people and pregnant women are also extremely vulnerable to an increase in the toxic emissions that this gop bill promotes this congress has a duty to prevent such harm from happening when the evidence is so clear one sure way that we can help our families take adequate steps to protect themselves and their children is to ensure theyre fully aware of the dangers that they face from specific pollution sources so this amendment also requires large boilers to notify their local communities of emissions that are likely to increase because of this gop bill that way families can take adequate steps to protect their children from mercury dioxins particulates and sulfur dioxide this information will also enable our local communities to make determinations on where to locate playgrounds and schools we must ensure that our families and communities have all the information they need to make the best decisions for the health of their children and that they have a complete understanding of the location and scale of the threat posed by air pollution the gop bill blocks critical health protections against air pollution the epa estimates that the gops anticlean air bills together mean over 30 000 more premature deaths over 19 000 additional heart attacks and over 200 000 asthma attacks that otherwise would have been prevented we shouldnt let it happen"], [0.0004763603210449219, 0.9995236396789551, 1, "i thank my friend for

symbolic and political votes that are going nowhere the republicans wanted the supreme court to decide on health care and now our supreme court has spoken and they are still fighting it its time that everyone accepts the result of the supreme court this has been a long fight and now its over if there are changes that need to be made to the affordable care act we should work together to make them

insurance companies deny you coverage or say you have a preexisting condition or say you have a cap and they wont pay any more this bill attempts to get health insurance companies health insurance away from the insurance companies who try to control everything and back into the hands of the consumers i urge my colleagues to vote against this bill and i implore the republican leadership to turn their focus instead on the economy and on jobs this health care bill there have been so many lies spread about it that its unbelievable the fact of the matter is its a good bill it will take the 50

to the floor a balanced option on how we go forward to the floor yes we know we have to make cuts and we have to increase revenue but most of all we have to increase jobs growth is what is important and the difference between these two budgets the budget that mr van hollen is proposing and the ryan republican budget is that the ryan republican budget loses jobs the van hollen budget the democratic budget is a jobcreator its a jobcreator it also invests in education think of it if youre a student and you have a student loan on july 1 your interest rate will double from 3 4 percent to 6 8 percent the ryan republican budget says thats just fine the house democratic budget prevents that from happening and if youre a senior the ryan budget takes you down a path where the medicare guarantee is cut you may have to spend 6 000 or more for less in terms of benefits all the while while not protecting our students while not creating jobs while not protecting our seniors and their medicare the ryan budget gives an over 300 000 tax break to people making over 1 million a year how can that be how can that be the more people know about that budget the more they know that it hurts them and their lives the budget that is put forth by the house democrats is a positive one for economic growth for investing in our small businesses for honoring the entrepreneurial spirit of america

afghanistan this legislation is an affront to the very principles of this nation in 1961 president john f kennedy in his inaugural address said if a free society cannot help the many who are poor it cannot save the few who are rich unfortunately it seems that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have no regard for this fundamental american value as the bill they have brought to the floor today attempts to balance the budget on the backs of those with less for the benefit of those with more it attempts to balance the budget on the backs of seniors by taking away their medicare benefits it attempts to balance the budget on the backs of the disabled by taking away their social security benefits it attempts to balance the budget on the backs of lowincome americans by taking away their medicaid and who stands to gain from taking away medicare medicaid and social security benefits special interests and the rich in addition to taking away medicare medicaid and social security benefits h r 2560 would also subvert the federal governments ability to respond to downturns in the economy or special needs including a possible national security crisis during inevitable cyclical downturns it will be necessary to raise the debt limit to stimulate growth by cutting taxes and providing unemployment benefits to help people get back on their feet if theyre laid off among several proven effective measures furthermore in the event of a security threat we have an obligation to act this bill including the proposed balanced budget constitutional amendment would make it nearly impossible to respond to any economic or security crisis at the root of all of this is a system of misguided priorities my republican colleagues have determined that in order to balance the budget we should prioritize cutting medicare medicaid and social security benefits instead of addressing what got us into this current deficita porous lopsided tax code designed to make the rich richer and two unnecessary wars one of which we continue to wage this bill does nothing to end the tax breaks we currently provide for millionaires and billionaires hedge fund managers and oil companies nor does it

harvard researchers which take into account longterm costs like caring for our veterans put the total cost of these wars in the trillions rather than ending tax breaks for corporations and

lives working in the swampy fields bordering lake apopka in florida their backbreaking work helped to provide the bulk of the winter season produce on the eastern seaboard in the early 1990s a settlement was negotiated with the large farming corporations where 20 000 acres of land were sold for roughly 100 million a negligible amount of 200 000 was allocated for the 2 500 farmworkers and most were simply given pink slips despite decades of service on the farm for years these workers were exposed to a chemical mixture of carcinogens and other contaminants as planes cropdusted the fields now these workers are suffering from an array of diseases that have been linked to longterm pesticide exposure their children suffer from defects cause by prenatal exposure to harmful contaminants these women have worked for over a decade to bring attention to their cause while many of their former colleagues unfortunately have passed away although these women are desperately seeking some relief and good health what they ask for more than anything else is their dignity dignity is the contribution of their community to feeding this nation and the sacrifices they made in doing so i would therefore offer my profound and earnest gratitude to these incredible women to their community and to farmworkers across the country for theirs truly are the hands that feed us now more than ever we need to redouble our efforts to reward hard work we must work to be sure that americans who work all of their lives have something to show for it this does not just affect linda lee

of a rising tide of poverty and an economy with high unemployment the tea partyled republicans continue their efforts to slash programs which protect the health and wellbeing of millions of lowincome and working poor families in the coming weeks and months we will begin to see the impact of the quite frankly immoral cuts to vital unemployment benefit extensions as thousands of people thousands of people across our country who are struggling to find a job will be thrown off of unemployment benefits thrown off kicked off the rolls some of them may be lucky enough to find work but far too many will be suddenly cut off with nearly nothing nothing to keep them from falling behind into poverty they will have been left out and left behind we may disagree on how to help families in need and workers who are struggling find work access needed health services or feed their children but we can all agree that leaving struggling families completely cut off of unemployment insurance with nowhere to turn for help is not the american way when republican politicians protect tax cuts for millionaires we must be very adamant about protecting the working poor when tea party republicans fight to protect tax writeoffs for corporations and big oil we must fight to protect hardworking americans when republican tea party members continued to expend their energy protecting the dividend gains on investments we must fight to protect linda lee and geraldine matthew women who have worked their entire lives and are left with nothing to show for it unfortunately there are some who

anniversary of the peace corps theyd had a gala reunion and a program at the kennedy center with such luminaries at that time as harry belafonte and many others it was a memorable occasion sargent shriver of course was a great leader in many different areas i met him in a reception line awhile back he didnt really much like though that id said so great to meet arnold schwarzeneggers fatherinlaw he really didnt want to be known as arnold schwarzeneggers fatherinlaw he wanted to be known and is known as the most dynamic director of the peace corps and for many others of his workswith mrs

ethiopia which was somaliaa troubled place now it was a great experience though people ask about the peace corps and i always say that one of the things you have to remember about the peace corps is that you get a lot more out of it than you really give youre serving other people but youre learning youre learning about another culture and at the same time youre learning about your own country and your own experiences because of the points of contrast what a wonderful thing it is that america has now tens of thousands of people who have served in the peace corps who have returned and who now are working in every walk of lifeworking in international organizations working in business organizations knowing different cultures knowing different languagesthereby providing a dimension to our own national life that we would otherwise not have if we did not have people who had had the experience of serving in the peace corps there is one other thing i still can remember the quizzical but interested reaction that so many people in somalia or im sure anywhere in the world had who are you why are you doing it explain that to me again the spirit was kind of catching and they would participate in all kinds of little volunteer activities and things that they hadnt necessarily thought of doing themselves of course the peace corps volunteers are not representatives of the american government they are representatives of the american people that was always emphasized very very strongly to all of us as part of our peace corps training the way we were living was among the people not behind these diplomatic bunkers that we sometimes see in the world today youre experiencing life in the country in which youre serving one thing just as an example is that peace corps volunteers of course do their assignments but theyre also people who do volunteer work of one kind or another one of the big hits was when i was in mogadishu in the peace corps i was with two other people who were peace corps lawyers at that time and there were about 50 60 people who were teachers some were community health workers and some were community school construction workers they would come to mogadishu for a couple days off for vacation time when school was down that kind of thing and five or six of them got together and started playing some american young peoples music and the next thing you know they were invited to a restaurant in mogadishu crowds of hundreds of people gathered and it was the sensation of the town for a couple weeks of course they couldnt be paid for doing this sort of thing but they might have gotten a couple of free meals from the restaurant and that kind of thing what a wonderful sort of natural way of building bridges the people in this country had never really seen something like this they werent on a tour for any of these international shows and they just thought it was the most wonderful thing to see live music played by american peace corps

ombudsman in each coast guard district the district ombudsmen are intended to serve as liaisons between the coast guard and ports terminal operators ship owners and labor representatives the ombudsmen will enable these stakeholders to seek further review of disputes regarding the application of the coast guard regulations let me be clear that the provisions creating the ombudsman specifically provide that the district ombudsman shall not provide assistance with respect to a dispute unless it involves the impact of coast guard requirements on port business and the flow of commerce the provisions further clarify that in providing such assistance the district ombudsman shall give priority to complaints brought by petitioners who believe they will suffer a significant hardship as a result of implementing the coast guard requirement i authored the provisions creating the ombudsman at the request of the port community which approached me seeking another mechanism to engage with the coast guard to ensure that the application of regulations achieves critical safety and security objectives while having the least possible impact on commerce many members of congress and

understand that the coast guard has not yet appointed any ombudsmanand i know that the service would probably prefer never to appoint an ombudsman because they would prefer that their regulatory decisions not be challenged that said rather than eliminating the requirement that the coast guard appoint an ombudsman i believe that this authority should be implemented quickly to give businesses the opportunity to improve the application of coast guard regulations finally let me also explain that this provision does not require any new personnel to be hired the statutory language is clear and staff have reconfirmed with the coast guard that the position of ombudsman could be a collateral duty that a qualified staff member performs in addition to their other duties this is not my ideal

my district so our reliance for our local economy and for our state economy is just so very important i want to talk a little more about what this health care law is going to do to medicare and do to our hospitals there is 112 billion in reduced market basket updates to hospitals there is a 36 billion reduction to medicare and medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments now disproportionate share may sound a little confusing im going to explain what that is in a district such as mine we have hospitals that have missions and im sure across the country many hospitals have missions they want to make sure that the indigent population folks who cant afford insurance who are selfpays or maybe are on medicaid that they have access to quality services so the government says to these hospitals we understand that medicaid reimbursements or selfpay patients will not cover your services so what were going to do is were going to try to make you whole with this disproportionate share the health care law eliminates the disproportionate share for hospitals and so hospitals that have a high indigent population or a high number of selfpay patients or those who are on medicaid they are not going to get that disproportionate share the hospital in my district came down here it is a large teaching institution they made a special trip down here to tell me that provision of the health care law will bankrupt them they probably receive somewhere around 80 million a year to make them whole because of their mission and isnt that what we want we want to make sureand wasnt that the original intent of the health care law to make sure that there was accessible care for all americans but here again we reached the unintended consequences and the effect that this law is going to have on our hospitals there is a 7 1 billion reduction for readmissions we will talk about that in a little bit hospitals and many of the ones in my district and i know throughout this country they are heavily dependent on medicare and medicaid dollars and with that narrow margin medicare and medicaid dont even cover their costs and so theres such a small margin for them to operate that theres really little capacity for improvements realistically hospitalsespecially teaching hospitals and hospitals that are treating the underservedcannot bridge that gap and they wont be able to bridge that gap because of this new health care law hospitals must be able to invest in their infrastructure having such a narrow margin and or no margin operating in the red theyre not going to be able to do

the collapse of the social security system but as promised it threw every working family a vital lifeline in very tough economic times we need to meet three conflicting objectives we need to continue the payroll tax cut we need to stimulate real economic growth and we need to avoid doing further damage to the social security system first we need to understand that not all tax cuts stimulate lasting economic growth cutting marginal tax rates does so because it changes the incentives that individuals respond to cutting inframarginal tax rates such as the payroll tax does not but that payroll tax cut did make a huge difference in the ability of working families to make ends meet in a time of declining family incomes and steadily rising prices to restore that payroll tax rate today given the economic pressures on working families is simply unthinkable yet at the same time the payroll tax is what supports the social security system last year that system entered a state of permanent deficit and this condition will worsen until the social security system bankrupts in 2036 at that moment every retiree will suffer a sudden and permanent drop in benefits of roughly 25 percent further reducing the revenues into that system will hasten this day of reckoning just as bad in the intervening time the expanding social security deficit will heap growing burdens on the nations already staggering public debt now some have proposed paying for the inframarginal payroll tax cut that doesnt help the economy with a marginal tax hike that actually harms the economy surely

same time offering families continued relief from crushing payroll taxes his measure h r 3551 the social security preservation through individual choice enhancement or sspice act constitutes the most realistic and innovative approach to these twin and related crises that has yet been placed before congress by linking the cost of social security to the benefits that it provides h r 3551 would give every american the choice of paying a lower payroll tax each year in exchange for working a month longer thats all it would take to pay for itselfa months delay in retirement for a years worth of tax relief for the first time individuals can make this choice to pay a lower payroll tax based on their own circumstances without further undermining the fiscal integrity of the social security system or the financial security of those relying on that system for the first time costs and benefits would be linked in a manner that all consumers can understand and judge for themselves based on their own circumstances in a difficult year like this i think most families would rather save the extra tax and work the extra month in better times ahead they may choose to pay the extra tax to maintain their retirement schedule but it will be their choice based on their needs their plans and their best judgment and not the governments and by linking costs with benefits it will protect the longterm

for their drive to make sure that this bill came to the floor today all of us in this house agree that we want consumer protections where any one of our friends or family members our neighbors and our constituents when they deal with a financial institution they are dealt with in a fair way and in a transparent way our reform here to the cfpb does exactly that it advances that very same cause i want to talk about a couple of the components of this bill one is we are moving this from a director to a bipartisan commission i think its important to note that my friends on the other side of the aisle when they first crafted this bill the ranking member they included a bipartisan commission and the president when he talked about this bill he was in favor of a bipartisan commission and now all of a sudden today as we have brought this back up they are now opposed to a bipartisan commission i think its important that we note that today you may have a democrat president and you might like the recommendation for the director of the cfpb but if im going to project in the future i am one to guess that i bet at one point in our future there will be a republican president and you may not like his appointee lets come together lets not regret this moment lets come together and make sure we have a bipartisan commission that is going to work on behalf of consumers because this isnt a republican or democrat issue it is truly an american issue that should be dealt with on a commission level one other key component of our legislation is the review standard of rules that come from the cfpb the way it is set up right now the only way a rule can be overturned is if we are going to have armageddon in the financial industry and so the only one that can have a rule overturned is a big bank on wall street one who is too big to fail the way it is currently written you have given a voice to those people who helped cause this financial crisis you know what im not from wall street i am from small town rural wisconsin we dont have big wall street banks we have small community banks and we have credit unions the way the current bill is writtennot mine the one thats in existence today the current lawit doesnt give a voice to the people in my community if a rule that comes out from the cfpb is going to affect them negatively and you know what on main street the very people who had nothing to do with the financial crisis who havent been given a voicebut will if my bill passesthose are the people who deal with our small business owners with our family members people who are looking at expanding their business growing their business creating jobs in our community they rely on community banks and credit unions for loans and they dont have a voice i dont understand that and then the same people that we look to when we want a mortgage for our home or we want a car loan its these people we look to and they have been left voiceless in the current law but my bill gives a voice to main street america i have to say the point i dont think can be made clearer with those who support my bill i dont have big wall street support for my bill but ill tell you what support i do have i have the community bankers of wisconsin i have the wisconsin bankers association i have the independent community bankers of america american bankers association i have the consumer bankers association all those who are about small community banks that deal with customers support this reform we go a step further we have the wisconsin credit union league the credit union national association and the national association of credit unions all people who didnt have any role in this financial crisis all people in our communities who are looking out for consumers because if they dont they dont survive in small town america and they all support this reform legislation i would encourage all of my colleagues to jump onboard and support commonsense reform that is going to strengthen consumer protection and provide great oversight for a very powerful agency and its going to hold it accountable"], [0.0014922022819519043, 0.4985077977180481, 0, "along those lines the
