course and making sure that we are here really speaking truth to power each and every week on behalf of the black caucus also to you congressman don payne thank you very much for your leadership and for really rising to the occasion on so many issues in the very short time that you have been here you have hit the ground running and really have made a tremendous difference i want to just speak for a few minutes as it relates to the review of the congressional black caucus for the last year or 2 years i have to just say that our leader mr butterfield has been a very bold and tremendous leader we have accomplished quite a bit and we have a lot more to do while 2015 has been very challenging i believe that the congressional black caucus has really stepped up and made a huge difference not only for the african american community and communities of color but for the entire country it has also been an inspiring year we have seen the birth and growth of the vital black lives matter movement we have also witnessed powerful and moving protests across the country in places like missouri new york and even in my district in oakland and in berkeley california with people of all backgrounds and ages coming together to demand justice to petition their government to exercise their democratic rights i am so proud of the young activists who are standing up and demanding an end to racism and injustice in many of our communities they are truly bringing the civil rights movement into the 21st century i want them to know that they have allies here in the peoples house for too long congress has ignored or brushed aside issues affecting the african american community and other communities of color it is past time that everyone steps up and does the good work that we were sent to washington to do that the congressional black caucus has done for many many decades we need to start by talking about and looking at what has happened with the voting rights act as you know this year marks the 50th anniversary of this landmark legislation the voting rights act was gutted by the supreme court in its shelby v holder decision and of course republican state legislators have fallen all over to restrict voting rights across the country everywhere these dangerous restrictions come in the form of voter id requirements elimination of sameday voter registration and really severe reduction in early voting efforts we must call these efforts for what they are republican attempts to take away one of our most fundamental rights but we will not let this happen i am so proud of the congressional black caucuscongresswoman terri sewell and john lewis and mr clyburn the entire congressional black caucus our bill h r 2867 the voting rights advancement act sponsored by congresswoman sewell who represents selma alabama would restore the preclearance provisions of the voting rights act for any state that has had 15 or more voting rights violations in the last 25 years in the preclearance process as dr king once said give us the ballot and we will fill our legislative halls with menand of course womenwith goodwill we can fill this body with those who really want to see democracy fulfilled so we need our young people to keep up the street heat and demand that congress act it is past time that we get serious about restoring the voting rights act and ensuring that all americansand that means all americanshave free and unobstructed access to the ballot box also the serious economic disparities that persist in the african american community are very very evident according to a report released earlier this year by the joint economic committee led by ranking member congresswoman carolyn maloney and the congressional black caucus we learned and it is very glaring that more than one in three black children are born into poverty and the african american poverty rate is three times that of white americans the cycle of poverty and inequality starts in our school systems where black students account for 42 percent of preschool student expulsions despite accounting for only 18 percent of enrollment now that is preschool expulsion every time i remember this and say this it really makes me very terrified about what is taking place with young black kids especially with young black boys because there is no way anybody no kids should be expelled from preschool that is ages 1 to 4 that is outrageous i am the mother yes of two fabulous great black men and i am the grandmother of two black boys and i find statistics like that very very troubling for african americans we have allowed our school system to be turned into a pipeline to prison we must act now to address systemic issues facing our education and our criminal justice systems i want to applaud congressman bobby scott and congressman conyers because they have worked for decades on criminal justice reform and we are beginning to see some progress as a result of their very diligent work our criminal justice system is broken it needs to be rebuilt from the ground up so alongside of our cbc colleagues once again we are calling for comprehensive criminal justice reform also i want to mention our effort which i cochair with chairman butterfield our tech 2020 initiative silicon valley is right next to my district in california there are great opportunities there for everyone however the tech industry has not been inclusive of hiring and contracting with and working with communities of color especially the african american community so i am very pleased that the tech 2020 of the congressional black caucus has been initiated we are working with our great leader reverend jesse jackson with an insideoutside strategy many of the tech companies understand what is taking place and that they need to be an industry that is inclusive of everyone so the black caucus along with rainbow push along with the tech industry are working on a variety of strategies to make sure that this industry which provides goodpaying jobs and opportunities is an industry that is inclusive that does not discriminate and that includes the diversity of this great country so i have to just say to congresswoman kelly and congressman payne thank you for giving us a chance to talk about so many of the issues that we have been working on when you look at the issue of poverty cutting poverty in half in 10 years we know how to do it we have legislation the half in ten act h r 258 to do that and the pathways out of poverty act h r 2721 we know how to provide opportunities the congressional black caucus once again is leading on all of these fronts it is a big agenda but it is an agenda that makes our country stronger so thank you congresswoman kelly and thank you congressman payne for the chance to be with you tonight"], [0.0006041526794433594, 0.9993958473205566, 1, "first let me thank congresswoman robin kelly and congressman donald payne jr for hosting this important special order i appreciate your leadership in organizing this important discussion on the state of black health in america every april we observe national minority health awareness month this year is particularly significant as we mark 30 years since the groundbreaking health and human services task force on black and minority health report this report sparked the first serious discussion in washington on addressing the deep racial health disparities that exist in this country this year also marks 50 years since the creation of medicare and medicaidprograms that have kept and continue to keep americans healthy we are also celebrating the fifth year anniversary of the passage of the affordable care actthe most significant legislation to improve the health of all americans in more than a generation these legislative achievements continue moving us closer to health equity for allhowever major health disparities still exist the zip code in which you are born still determines your likely life expectancy gross disparities exist from zip code to zip codeeven within the same city or county so today i rise to join my colleagues in the congressional black caucus to bring to light the state of black health in america and call for more action to address persistent and lingering disparities in health access treatment and care since the passage of the affordable care act access to care has dramatically expanded in communities of color the uninsured rate has declined 7 3 percent in the african american community and more people have access to affordable quality healthcareall thanks to the affordable care act when we were crafting the affordable care act i had the privilege of serving as chair of the congressional black caucus and let me tell you we worked day and night with our colleagues in the congressional hispanic caucus and congressional asian pacific american caucus to push congress and the administration to craft the best possible bill since its passage the affordable care act has improved the american health care system healthcare is now more affordable and accessible than ever women can no longer be discriminated against because they are a woman have a preexisting conditionsuch as hiv aidsor have been the victim of domestic violence young people can stay on their parents health insurance until they are 26 and people with serious conditions like cancer no longer face the real fear of hitting their lifetime cap and being denied lifesaving treatment the aca also expands the capacity of the healthcare delivery system to better serve those at risk for and living with hiv aids these are the facts the affordable care act has dramatically increased access to preventative care for women lowincome communities and people of color despite rabblerousing and grandstanding from the right this law is saving livesevery day in communities across americafrom maine to my district in the east bay during the last enrollment period 16 4 million americans obtained health insurance and more than half a million came from my home state of california make no mistakethe affordable care act is working african americans and latinos historically underinsured or uninsured groups have seen the greatest declines in their uninsured rates this is especially good news for african americans who are living with hiv where the key to halting the epidemic is access to affordable and quality care with this increase in coverage we are beginning to close the gap in racial and ethnic health disparities and access to care however much work remains to truly realize health equity in america right nowin america the richest and most powerful country in the worldafrican americans still suffer from disproportionately high numbers of preventable deaths disparities in access to quality health care and underrepresentation within the medical community african americans have the highest mortality rate of any racial and ethnic group from cancer furthermore africanamericans are 40 more likely to die from a stroke than whites and 30 more likely to die from heart disease than whites and while african americans are only 13 of the unitedstates population they account for nearly half of all new hiv infections african americans also account for the highest hivrelated deaths and hiv death rates madam speakerthis is unacceptable in an age where technology and innovation are paving the way to new medical breakthroughs these persistent disparities in healthcare cannot be allowed to continue that is why today i urge my colleagues lets work together and commit ourselves to passing legislation that will end racial and ethnic disparities and achieve health equity the affordable care act was a good start but more is needed for years the congressional tricaucus has championed this effort by introducing the health equity and accountability act heaa congresswoman robin kelly will have the honor in introducing this important legislation this congress and i am proud to colead this effort as cochair of the capac health task force this important legislation builds on the affordable care act and puts us on track to eliminate health disparities in our country the health equity and accountability act would address incidences of terminal and chronic diseases that disproportionally affect communities of color including cancer diabetes heart disease and hiv aids so in recognition of national minority health awareness month i urge my colleagues to support this important bill in order to truly achieve health equity for all the state of black health in america is improving but much work remains before us as our drum major for justice dr king told us of all the forms of inequality injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane i urge my colleagues to join us in securing health equity for all"], [0.0006249547004699707, 0.99937504529953, 1, "i thank congresswoman kelly and congressman payne for organizing this special order and for your continued leadership on so many vital issues and for staying the course and holding down the fort for the congressional black caucus it is so important that our message of unity and our messagewhich really describes what many of the issues are that all of our communities are faced withthat that message goes out both of you have really been tremendous in this effort so i rise this evening to join this critical conversation on race relations in america and to challenge our colleagues to work with the congressional black caucus to realize progress for racial justice and equality i join congresswoman kelly and congressman payne in sending my condolences to the families and the victims of the horrific terrorist attacks in paris lebanon nigeria and also in egypt know that we join in this quest for global peace and security throughout the world now tonights special order is an important part of our work to address the discrimination and racism that still plagues our nation specifically as it relates to african americans but we know that it impacts all communities of color it is manifested in many ways and it affects our entire country as congressman payne said so eloquently we are the united states so when one is affected all are affected all across the country at universities like mizzou and yale in places like baltimore and ferguson and in high schools like spring valley high in columbia south carolina we are witnessing the painful impact of institutional racism in our communities very recently we saw this in my home district at berkley high school in one of the most progressive and enlightened cities in the country black students were subjected to threatening messages on campus but i am so proud of the students at berkley they walked offit was not only black students it was all studentsand marched out peacefully through the city to protest these terrible despicable messages this is unacceptable all students have a right to learn free from violence and from threats as long as black students and any student of color feels unsafe in their classrooms our work for justice remains incomplete this crisis isnt limited to our schools tragically people of color face institutional racism from the moment they are born according to a report released earlier this year by the joint economic committee and the congressional black caucus more than one in three black children are born into poverty this cycle of poverty and inequality continues in our school system where black students account for 42 percent of preschool student expulsions mind you now that is preschool that is students from about 2 years old to 4 years old black students account for 42 percent of preschool student expulsions despite accounting for only 18 percent of enrollment i cant figure out how any student aged 2 to 4 is expelled from school that is outrageous yet 42 percent of preschool student expulsions are african american babies these kids dont even get a start let alone a head start outside of the classroom african americans are overpoliced overcriminalized and underemployed a report published by the new york times in april found that there are an estimated 1 5 million black men between the ages of 24 to 54 who are missing from civic life just missing it these missing men who account for one in every six black men have been victims of mass incarceration or premature death and this crisis of inequality extends to the structures of the community and have persisted from generations over the past four decades the average unemployment rate for blacks has been double the rate for white americans for many black families it feels like this is a permanent recession this must be our call to action that is why i am so proud of our young people throughout the country and students who are standing up to racism and injustice in their communities it is time for congress to listen to the young people saying that black lives matter and black students matter earlier this month i held a forum on racial justice in my district to address these issues more than 300 east bay residents from all backgrounds attended and raised their voices for justice this was the second forum that i have held throughout the last 3 months now i have been able to reach over 1 000 east bay residents so tonight in this dialogue which congressman payne and congresswoman kelly have talked about this dialogue leads to action hopefully our colleagues would think about hosting these types of forums and listen to what people are saying listen to what the impact of some of our policies are on their daily lives we must be part of the conversation and the solution but we must listen we must hear the pain and the suffering that people are experiencing as a result of discrimination and racial injustice now the congress must act to start addressing the systemic racism that degrades our institutions and threatens our communities it is past time for us to get serious about us addressing the lack of opportunity for black and minority families in this country right now today in this chamber there is legislation that can start moving the needle forward we need to empower our communities to build greater trust between law enforcement and communities of color and we need to address chronic recidivism which would be a huge step toward returning some of our missing men to their families and communities to do this congress should pass the safe justice act sponsored by congressman sensenbrenner and congressman scott congress should also pass the stop militarizing law enforcement act h r 1232 to stop the militarization of our nations police forces we also should pass the police accountability act h r 1102 and the grand jury reform act h r 429 so we can ensure that deadly force cases are heard by a judge and that there is more accountability for police officers as we reform our broken criminal justice system and work to help repair those families hurt by mass incarceration we will be strengthening america we will have people who really can make a contribution not only to their families and their communities but to the entire country the federal government shouldnt continue to put up barriers to work for those trying to rebuild their lives after making a mistake and should ban the box totally by federal contractors and by federal agencies we also need to repeal the lifetime ban on pell grants for those formerly incarcerated as it relates to drug felonies the ineligibility for public assistance and food stamps we need to remove these barriers so that people of color primarily african american men and latino men can get back into society get a job and take care of their families once again this is an example of public policy that racism wreaks its ugly head in our own institutions and policies finally we must address the poverty that plagues communities of color all across the country we have the whips task force on poverty income inequality and opportunity which i am proud to chair with our whip mr hoyer we are working with more than 100 of our colleagues now to advance policies that give all families including african american families living below the poverty line both in urban communities and in rural communities a fair shot this effort includes our half in ten act h r 258 which calls for a national strategy to cut poverty in half in the next decade that is more than 22 million americans lifted out of poverty into the middle class in just the next 10 years by being strategic and coordinating our existing programs our pathway out of poverty act h r 2721 would create goodpaying jobs it would lift families out of poverty into the middle class while strengthening our safety net for those who are still struggling ultimately the only way to end institutional racism is to give african americans and people of color a seat at the table and we need to pass legislation and policies that begin to remove these barriers my mentor the honorable congresswoman shirley chisholm used to say if they dont give you a seat at the table bring in a folding chair that is what our young people are doing around the country so i want to thank all of the people across our country who are bringing in folding chairs and ensuring that these important conversations happen we hear you we support you and we will keep fighting for you for ensuring liberty and justice for all which means just that it means for all in doing so we will make the united states a stronger country i thank congresswoman kelly and congressman payne for organizing this very important special order i know that out of this discussion we are laying out what can be done and it doesnt take

representatives to beg the majority party just to debate and vote on commonsense gun legislation that the vast majority of americans demand we should not be living in a society where debate and even scientific research about gun violence are stifled and silenced by the majority in congress and we should not live in a country where gun violence takes such a toll on our citizens but here we are standing up for the millions of americans who want congress to do something and honoring the thousands of americans who have lost their lives to gun violence here we are standing up for our constituents who are tired of the excuses and want to hear a debate and want to see us take action on gun violence and here we are today to represent the victims the list is so long orlando san bernardino newton fort hood charleston the list goes on nine in a church 23 in a restaurant 26 in an elementary school and now 49 in a nightclub the victims are men and women black and white rich and poor old and young at a mcdonalds in california an 8monthold baby was killed along with his mother who was trying to shelter him when a gunman came in and started shooting at a north carolina nursing home a 98yearold grandmother was killed when a shooter came in and opened fire here in the united states you are 10 times more likely to be killed by a gun than in any other developed nation in the world of the 23 richest and most developed countries in the world we have by far the most gun violence we have half the population of the other 22 but 90 percent of the women killed by a gun are killed by a gun in the united states ninetyone percent of the children under age 14 who are killed by a gun are killed by a gun in the united states and if you are a young person in this country you are 50 times more likely to die of a gun death than in all of those other countries we have the most guns and we have the most gun violence we have the nra through fear intimidation and misinformation the nra has taken control over the debate on guns to such an extent that we cannot even vote in this chamber on whether we should keep guns out of the hands of terrorists right now someone can be on both the terrorist watch list and the nofly list in other words the fbi thinks you are a terrorist and the tsa bans you from flying but if you want to drive down to your local gun store and buy an assault rifle there is nothing anyone can do to stop you over the last 10 years people on the terrorist watch list tried to buy explosives or firearms 2 233 times over 90 percent of the time they were successful this is wrong the american people know it is wrong public health officials know it is wrong and nearly every single law enforcement association in america knows it is wrong which is why they are all in favor of closing the terrorist gun loophole in fact a recent poll by a republican pollster found 76 percent of gun owners and 71 percent of nra members said suspected terrorists should not be allowed to buy guns if you were to walk outside the house of representatives right now and stop someone walking down the street and ask the simple question should terrorists be allowed to buy guns you would get a very simple answer they would say no of course terrorists should not be allowed to buy guns but they can republicans here in the house wont even let us have a debate and a vote on it how did we get here mr speaker how has the debate shifted so far away from commonsense gun regulation that a proposal to close the terrorist gun loophole is this controversial why is it that here in the house debate is silenced and we are not allowed to vote the closest we came to a debate on gun legislation recently came last week when a controversy erupted about the standard procedure to observe a moment of silence on the house floor after a mass shooting it is shameful that we have allowed this country to get to a point where congress has to even have a standard procedure to observe mass shootings yet we arent even allowed to have a debate about legislation to address this problem it is time for us to stand up to the nra to have a fair and open debate about gun violence and it is

my colleague from ohio congresswoman joyce beatty who spoke on the floor about the 60th anniversary of what happened in montgomery when rosa parks with great courage refused to give up her seat on the bus the courage of that woman and all of those who supported her has made such an incredible difference in our country and it is indeed related to what i want to say about hiv and aids many of us had the privilege of knowing rosa parks when she worked for john conyers we honored her here in the house and are so proud that we have a statue of rosa parks in the capitol of the united states we think of her and we think of the courage she had which led to the civil rights act the voting rights act and that voting rights act and civil rights act led to our having a much more diverse congress of the united states from there came our congressional black caucus the hispanic caucus and the asian pacific caucus the black caucus directly related to mr conyers who was a founding member and rosa parks who was an inspiration they were responsible for so much change in the leadership of our congress and because so many issues spring from the congressional black caucus some say the conscience of the congress so the relationship from rosa parks through the caucus to now we are observing the 25th anniversary of world aids day the link is congresswoman barbara lee who has been such a champion in the congress on this subject we take great pride in the accomplishments she has had in her capacity as a member of congress but also as our representative to the united nations general assembly each year world aids day is observed internationally to reflect the progress that has been made in reaffirming our determination to banish aids to the annals of history we recognize that achieving an aidsfree generation requires our relentless energetic and undaunted commitment to testing treatment and finding a cure the world aids day theme this year the time to act is now challenges us to act with the urgency that this global epidemic demands aids as we know and the hiv virus is a ferocious and resourceful disease a resourceful virus evermutating to escape our efforts to destroy it therefore we have to be ferocious resourceful and adaptable in our effort to succeed to end hiv we must bring bold thinking and deep commitment to testing treatment and the search for a cure and a vaccine to prevent president bush with his pepfar initiative took a big advance in how we can help prevent the spread of aids in the rest of the world he and mrs bush with their pink ribbon red ribbon initiative to link cervical cancer prevention with hiv testing and treatment in africa was a remarkable initiative so we salute the bipartisanship we supported of course president bush with pepfar we wanted it bigger and he wanted it strong and there we were with something that has saved millions of lives and given hope to people i visited some of the clinics in africa where pepfar is being administered and some of the people i met there said i would never have come in to be tested before because there was no reason i had no hope that there would be any remedy or any maintaining of a quality of life that would have encouraged me to risk the stigma of saying that i was hivinfected so again it is all about the people in new york today bono will be observing the 10th anniversary of the one and red initiatives that have set out to alleviate poverty and eradicate disease with a heavy focus on hiv aids we know the work of the melinda and bill gates foundation and what they have done on this issue particularly in india i today also wish i could be in san francisco where amfar will be saluting the work at university of californiasan francisco on hiv aids by establishing a new initiative there i am just mentioning a few other observances of world aids day it is happening throughout the world if you go back a number of years when i came to congress we were going to two funerals a day it was the saddest thing now we are going to weddings and helping people make out their wills and all the rest because they have a longer life ahead the maintenance of life the quality of life is really important but we do want a cure so i said it was the 25th anniversary of world aids day i meant to say the 25th anniversary of the ryan white care act that young man whose name is something that is iconic to all of us left us but his mother carries on the tradition and it has made such a tremendous difference my colleague henry waxman who is no longer in the congress but is still a champion on hiv aids was so instrumental in leading us to passing that legislation so it has been bipartisan it is global it is personal it is urgent that we continue so that one day 50 years from now people will say what was aids what was that and the books will show that it was a terrible terrible tragedy that befell the worlds population regardless of status of wealth of gender or of race and something that is now buried in the news somewhere as a terrible memory but not a part of our future again as we observe world aids day may we all wear our red ribbons in sympathy with those who have lost their lives sadly before the science took us to a better place on this that is what we are counting on research and science to take us to a better place on this and also the enthusiasm determination and relentlessness of so many people throughout the world to make hiv aids a horrible horrible memory again but not part of our future"], [0.000648796558380127, 0.9993512034416199, 1, "again let me offer my appreciation to the gentlewoman from minnesota the gentleman from california and their staff who have worked with us let me remind my colleagues that just a few days ago i offered this amendment dealing with museums and dealing with my concern for the funding and the smithsonian to provide for the nations museum let me also say to my colleagues that i have offered this amendment in the past because i have a particular interest in the museums of america and their ability to do outreach i imagine i am not alone standing here amongst appropriators to again say and call for the end of sequestration to be able to provide the appropriators and to provide the people of america the full funding to address these quality of life issues from the various lands and federal parks and as well the historic trails of which i will talk about but museums urban reforestation all elements of the beauty of this nation and i frankly believe that museums likewise are that form of beauty my amendment specifically says none of the funds made available in this act may be used to limit outreach programs administered by the smithsonian institution in order to fulfill the smithsonians mission the increase and diffusion of knowledge the smithsonian seeks to serve an even greater audience by bringing the smithsonian to enclaves of communities who otherwise would be deprived of the vast amounts of cultural history offered by the smithsonian our museums of the nation are in trouble the smithsonian has a beautiful array of museums that are here that millions of americans have the opportunity to visit but the outreach program serves millions of americans thousands of communities and hundreds of institutions in all 50 states through loans of objects traveling exhibitions and sharing of educational resources via publications lectures and presentations training programs and web sites allow me to mention just a few in my own district the holocaust museum unique in its presentation of a horrible time in history but it also serves as a very unifying entity in our community the childrens museum as one of the original board members and founders now the childrens museum is one of the major childrens museums in the nation but again it needs the impact of the outreach of the smithsonian and then of course the museum of african american culture headed by a dear friend but also a champion of holding this museum together and that is john guess he needs a fuller embrace by the smithsonian including its expertise its experts its ph d s traveling efforts and again its encouragement of corporate communities to recognize the value of participating in museums the smithsonians outreach activities include the smithsonian institution traveling exhibition the smithsonian center for education and museum studies national science resources center the smithsonian institution press the office of fellowships and the smithsonian associates who are we if we do not value preserving those items that tell the varied and diverse history of america the good history of america the history that is unifying and purposeful in citing us as a country that recognizes our wonderful diversity so i ask my colleagues to support this amendment that deals specifically with allowing the outreach to the kinds of museums that really need the help of the smithsonian the smithsonian in concluding is very important to urban areas and rural areas alike and its ability or its affiliation is to build a strong national network of museums and educational organizations in order to establish active and engaging relationships with communities throughout the country again allow me to salute in particular john guess with the museum of african american culture in houston he has literally put that museum together along with his board members the smithsoniani hope they are hearing me as i am talking on the floor of the housewe need your help in houston texas we probably need your help in washington state in california minnesota new york and beyond to preserve and help these small museums throughout the nation i ask my colleagues to support not only this amendment but the museums of this nation and i say to mr calvert we had discussed this before this amendment now is a placeholder hopefully for our discussion going forward dealing with the preservation of our museums let me thank mr calvert mr simpson and ms mccollum i yield back the balance of my time mr chair thank you for this opportunity to speak in support of my amendment to h r 2822 the interior and environment appropriations act of 2016 let me also thank chairman calvert and ranking member mccollum for their leadership in shepherding this bill to the floor among other agencies this legislation funds the smithsonian institution which operates our national museums including the air and space museum the museum of african art the museum of the american indian and the national portrait gallery the smithsonian also operates another national treasure the national zoo mr chair my amendment is simple but it sends a very important message from the congress of the united states the jackson lee amendment simply provides that sec none of the funds made available in this act may be used to limit outreach programs administered by the smithsonian institution this amendment is identical to an amendment i offered to the interior and environment appropriations act for fy2008 that was approved by voice vote on june 26 mr chair the smithsonians outreach programs bring smithsonian scholars in art history and science out of the nations attic and into their own backyard each year millions of americans visit the smithsonian in washington d c but in order to fulfill the smithsonians mission the increase and diffusion of knowledge the smithsonian seeks to serve an even greater audience by bringing the smithsonian to enclaves of communities who otherwise would be deprived of the vast amount of cultural history offered by the smithsonian the smithsonians outreach programs serve millions of americans thousands of communities and hundreds of institutions in all 50 states through loans of objects traveling exhibitions and sharing of educational resources via publications lectures and presentations training programs and websites smithsonian outreach programs work in close cooperation with smithsonian museums and research centers as well as with 144 affiliate institutions and others across the nation the smithsonians outreach activities support communitybased cultural and educational organizations around the country they ensure a vital recurring and highimpact smithsonian presence in all 50 states through the provision of traveling exhibitions and a network of

kindergarten through collegeage museum education and outreach opportunities these outreach programs enhance k12 science education programs facilitate the smithsonians scholarly interactions with students and scholars at universities museums and other research institutions and disseminate results related to the research and collections strengths of the institution the programs that provide the

smithsonian artifacts from the most iconic presidential portraits historical american flags civil war records astronaut uniforms etc to the simplest items of everday life family quilts prairie schoolhouse furnishings historical lunch boxes multilingual store front and street signs etc has been a longstanding organizational priority of the smithsonian sites mobile museum is the only traveling exhibit format able to guarantee audience growth and expanded geographic distribution during sustained periods of economic retrenchment but also because it is imperative for the many exhibitors nationwide who are struggling financially yet eager to participate in smithsonian outreach for communities still struggling to fully recover from the economic downturn the ability of museums to present temporary exhibitions the mobile museum promises to answer an evergrowing demand for smithsonian shows in the field a single conventional sites exhibit can reach a maximum of 12 locations over a twoto threeyear period in contrast a mobile museum exhibit can visit up to three venues per week in the course of only one year at no cost to the host institution or community the net result is an increase by 150 in the number of outreach locations to which sites shows can travel annually and in addition to its flexibility in making shortterm stops in cities and towns from coasttocoast a mobile museum has the advantage of being able to frequent the very locations where people live work and take part in leisure time activities by establishing an exhibit presence in settings like these sites will not only increase its annual visitor participation by 1 million but also advance a key smithsonian performance objective to develop exhibit approaches that address

three bills all of which i oppose in their current form i want to talk about each of those we also have under this rule a closed process this resolution contains the 19th and 20th closed rules of this congress instead of having an open debate about taxes here on tax day we see nothing more than recycled partisan measures and attacks on consumer protections that are disguised and under the guise of a small business advisory board which had historically been a bipartisan effort while discussing tax legislation on tax day may not seem the most exciting piece of legislative news to our constituents i hope they are watching today this rule and this bill we are bringing under it really demonstrate the gulf that exists between our two parties when we talk about things like middle class economics this is a 296 billion tax cut so if we have 296 billion in taxes cut who are we going to cut taxes for this bill affects 100 families in colorado with the same amount of money 296 billion we could cut taxes for every american adult by 1 000 that 1 000 would mean a lot to middle class families it might help pay for your kids college tuition it might help pay for a family vacation but instead of directing money there we are directing it to the very wealthiest americans namely those who die with more than a 10 million estate for a married couple i think we see a stark contrast on priorities while i disagree with the policies and tactics that are under consideration i think it is important to talk about what a democratic majority would do here on tax day we would certainly not be about to consider a bill that applies to literally zero percent of taxpayers let me clarify because that may seem strange to some people that this applies to zero percent of taxpayers but the bill we are considering with regard to the inheritance tax on estates over 10 million would apply to 0 15 percent of taxpayers that can be rounded down to zero it doesnt even apply to those taxpayers it applies to them after they are dead so it applies to zero living americans mind you we wont have a debate about the broken immigration policies that impact over 11 million immigrant workers who would grow the tax base we wont have discussions on reducing taxes for the middle class but we are having policies that affect a few thousand dead people a few thousand rich dead people i might add if there were a democratic majority on tax day we would be working to provide tax relief to middle class families rather than offering a bill that would gut one agency whose sole purpose is to protect middle class consumers and delivering a tax break to rich dead families we have another bill under this rule ostensibly about a small business advisory board this is a worthwhile effort to provide a small business advisory input to the consumer financial protection bureau unfortunately it is a minimal cost 9 million but the republicans are offering a way of paying for it that guts the consumer financial protection bureau they are effectively cutting off your arm to remove a splinter in your pinky well look if the majority was consistent when they say the deficit matters and we must pay for legislationbut we are dealt with two bills that are mutually exclusive on the one hand they are handing out 269 billion in deficit spending through providing tax cuts to 1 000 americans who are already dead and on the other hand they are saying this 9 million dollars somehow we have to figure out a way of paying for and they are effectively gutting the financial protection agency to do it that is because this 9 million is apparently a step too far even though they are offering two bills one that adds 269 billion to the deficit and the other adds 42 billion to the deficit which i will talk about in a minute in this year alone the house ways and means committee has given congress nine tax expenditure bills at a cost of 317 billion all unfunded 317 billion in tax expenditure spending not even including this 269 billion that they are looking at doing today and what bothers me most about this rule today is where we say to ourselves look we will spend 269 billion for a tax expenditure for dead rich people 42 billion on a tax reform that will ultimately make tax reform harder but we cant spend 9 million on a bill to help small business i am sure that we all have a lot of ideas on both sides of the aisle about how we can spend money if we have 269 billion in tax expenditures to use why dont we direct that to a tax cut for small businesses or to reducing the corporate tax rate which is one of the highest in the world or reducing the middle class tax rate but instead it is being directed entirely to approximately 100 dead people in colorado rather than allowing businesses to keep more of their money so they can reinvest in their infrastructure and create jobs this precious tax break we are giving to 100 dead people in the state of colorado we should be talking about tax reform today we should be talking about how to reduce taxes for the middle class instead we are having a closed debate about another set of bills that will likely not pass the senate and if they got to the presidents desk he would veto i urge my colleagues to reject this rule the repeal of the estate tax is very hard to explain to our constituents that is because it is 269 billion that benefits almost no oneless than 100 people in the state of colorado now when my friends call this the death tax or somehow say this will help small business lets keep in mind you dont even pay inheritance tax on the first 5 million of your estate 10 million for a married couple so you can die with a 5 million small business a 10 million small business for a couple and your heirs pay zero tax on thatzero tax what we are saying now is that the very limited number of families that might have estates of 50 million or 60 million instead of paying tax on that should pay zero tax on that and just have the costs of that added to the deficit there are a lot of ideas about spending 269 billion we could say oh we could spend it on schools or science and research or even if we limit ourselves to what we want to do with taxes why arent we lowering taxes on business why arent we talking about reducing the marginal rate why arent we talking about reducing all the tax brackets across the board why arent we talking about a tax refund to middle class families instead we are spending 269 billion on a few hundred dead rich people from a tax policy standpoint that has got to be one of the least productive ways to attempt to cut taxes you want to cut taxes on small businesses no argument here give it to them while they are living i was a smallbusinessman before i got here i would have loved to have been able to keep more of my own money to be able to invest in the growth of my small business rather than receive a tax break when i am already dead this makes no sense in the world look we would all love to get rid of every tax wouldnt weestate tax business tax income taxbut we all agree that government needs so much money to function we have a house budget the house budget that this body agreed to stipulates a certain amount of tax breaks it is up to our body to decide how to deliver those tax breaks i honestly think that almost every businessowner would rather see lower rates while they are alive so they could grow their companies faster creating growth and employing people rather than a tax break after they are dead proponents of this bill tell stories about how many businesses or farms are harmed every year by the estate tax well how many of those same farms and businesses are harmed by the hardearned money that they are forced to turn over to the government every year why arent we saying give less of your hardearned income to the government every year but no the republican taxandspend approach continues to oppress small businesses with higher and higher taxes oppress the middle class with higher and higher taxes while they are only concerned with delivering a tax break to dead rich people i simply disagree that this is an efficient way to use our tax code to spur economic growth chairman ryan knows full well that i am enthusiastic about having a discussion about our tax code how to cut taxes for business reduce the burden on small businesses simplify and streamline the tax code by reducing tax expenditures and bringing down tax rates to ensure that the capital expenditures by businesses and reinvesting in businesses are determined by businessowners rather than by lobbyists here in washington these bills are a step in the wrong direction away from tax reform and are detrimental to the american middle class and to american small

butterfield of the congressional black caucus i as well am overwhelmed with the pain that we have seen not only in baltimore which we have seen most recently but in cities like ferguson in north

them over the past couple of days in the midst of their mourning to be able to stand up and call for peace nonviolence nonviolent protests they should be honored and to those in baltimore and particularly my colleague from marylandi will call him congressman cummings with the bullhorn politics the bullhorn leadershiphe should be commended for the stunning and outstanding engagement that he touched the hearts and minds of his constituents walked those streets to be able to acknowledge the pain the poverty but that there is a better way that there is a way toward the stars that we all want our children to have and yes to ms graham who wanted better for her son michael i want him not to be embarrassed but to be proud that he had a mother with such deep love that she wanted to take him away from doing it wronglynot against protests not against the quiet marching of the spirit of dr king but to know that engaging in violence is intolerable and will not allow him to reach the very high heights that he can reach today i stand here to acknowledge the convergence of the need for criminal justice reform and the deep and abiding poverty in the african american community one in every six americans is living in poverty totaling 46 2 million people this is the highest number in 17 years children represent a disproportionate amount of the united states poor population it falls heavily on the african american community in my district there are 190 000plus living in poverty it falls heavily on the african american community this is not a standing invitation for the door to open and say lets blame president obama president obama has been a stellar leader on the questions of realizing the investment in people from the stimulus that brought us out of the depths of collapse of the markets and a complete imploding of the capitalistic system he provided the stimulus that moved us toward an economy where we were creating jobs but here we have in congress this dastardly sequester that is cutting head start seats not investing in infrastructure not creating jobs or providing opportunities for our young people so today i say that there needs to be a call for action that call for action is that this congress must get rid of sequester and must look at the baltimores and must look at the fergusons and houstons and l a s and new yorks and cities across america and realize that we are coming upon a summertime and if we dont act to invest in our children and to begin to give an agenda to release ourselves from poverty we will have doomed ourselves and i would offer to say that the inertia of moving toward criminal justice reform in this congress is unacceptable i call upon members to come together collectively to be able to pass legislation the cadet bill that i have introduced the build trust bill but more importantly i am calling upon our government to invest in our youth to get rid of the poverty to prepare them as they go into higher education as they go into upper grades we must have a program of summer jobs this summer and we must have a collaborative effort with corporate america wake up corporate america wake up corporate baltimore wake up corporate new york wake up corporate houston there must be an investment in summer jobs collaborating with the federal government to make a difference to lift families out of poverty we do know that summer jobs with young people elevate families ability to pay their bills and to provide resources for their families so if the story of baltimore is any it is one dont jump to conclusions dont jump to conclusions that freddie gray tried to hurt himself dont jump to conclusions that these young people dont mean well dont jump to conclusions that they shouldnt have done what they have done jump to the conclusions that these are young people who are hungry and looking for leadership and are in pain as congressman cummings said look for the opportunity for them help rebuild baltimore help give them jobs help tell them that the improved relationships between police and community are going to be moved forward as a number one agenda for the united states congress and this government that they

shooting that took place on june 12 at the pulse nightclub in orlando florida is a stark reminder of the urgent responsibility that we have to reduce gun violence in this country this monstrous attack on the lgbt community in a place of refuge and empowerment requires us to act the shooter in orlando used an assault rifle that is virtually identical to the ones used by mass killers in san bernardino umpqua community college aurora and sandy hook elementary school that is no coincidence out of the eight highprofile mass shootings that have taken place in the past year seven involved the use of an assault weapon when an assault weapon is used in a mass shooting the number of people shot increases by 153 percent and the number of people killed increases by 63 percent these are weapons of war that are designed to kill as many people as possible as quickly as possible they belong on a battlefield they dont belong in our communities and i will continue to fight to reinstate the assault weapons ban this morning i want to use the time that i have to talk about two proposals that the speaker should bring up for immediate vote no fly no buy and universal background checks this is really really simple if you are too dangerous to fly on an airplane then you are too dangerous to buy a gun but under the laws that we have in place today someone who is on the fbis terrorist watch list who is too dangerous to get on a plane can still walk into any gun store in america pass a background check and walk out with an assault weapon or any other gun he wants in fact from 2004 until 2014 more than 2 000 suspected terrorists bought firearms legally in this country and they are going to continue doing so until we stop them until 9 11 bombs were the weapon of choice for terrorists looking to strike the united states but in the 15 years since then 95 percent of terrorist deaths that took place in the united states resulted from gunfire it is impossibleimpossibleto understand that house republicans have now voted 13 times to block the no fly no buy proposal that congressman peter king and congressman mike thompson introduced to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists in this country why what are they afraid of that we might actually stop a terrorist from passing a background check before he buys an assault rifle at cabelas bring the no fly no buy bill to the floor today lets have an upordown vote let the american people hold us accountable for where we stand this should be a nobrainer more than 80 percent of americans believe we should prevent suspected terrorists from buying a gun and more than 90 percent of americans believe that a background check should be required on every firearm sale so we can keep guns out of the hands of criminals and those with such serious mental illness that possessing a gun would make them a danger to themselves or others bills are pending to fix our background check system and to require a background check on every gun sale this is one of the single most important and effective steps that we can take to reduce gun violence in this country right now anyone can go to a gun show or get on the internet and purchase a gun without a background check as many as two out of every five firearm transactions today are conducted without a background check it is too easy for a criminal a domestic abuser a terrorist or someone with a serious mental illness to buy a gun through this loophole every day background checks block 171 attempted purchases by felons 48 attempted purchases by domestic abusers and 19 attempted purchases by fugitives it is critical that we strengthen the background check system and require checks on all firearm sales so we can keep more dangerous individuals from acquiring these deadly weapons bring the fix gun checks act to the floor today we held a moment of silence last week for the victims in orlando i know that all of us have kept the victims and their loved ones and the people of orlando in our thoughts and prayers since june 12 but the best way to honor the lives lost in this horrific tragedy is to do something to prevent it from happening to others a moment of silence is not enough we need a moment of sustained action in this chamber and we need it today it will be an insult to the victims of this shooting and their families and every victim of every shooting in this

should take in response to the deadly threats to the jewish communities in europe as we all know the number of violent antisemitic attacks have increased from 100 to 400 percent in some european countries since 2013 alone murders in paris and copenhagen and elsewhere remind us that there are those who are motivated by antisemitic hate and have the will and the means to kill i would just note parenthetically that my work in combating antisemitism began back in 1981 in my first term from this very podium speaking out in favor of jewish refuseniks i joined mark levin and the ncsj 1 year later in 1982 on a trip to the soviet union where we met with men and women who were targeted by the kgb and the soviet evil empire simply because they were jewish sadly antisemitism has not abated and in recent years it has actually worsened 1915 this resolution calls for the united states government to work with our european allies on specific actions that are essential to keep european jewish communities safe and secure it is based on consultations with the leading experts who are working directly with these communities the resolution focuses on the formal partnerships between european law enforcement agencies and jewish community security groups here in the united states the collaboration between the department of homeland security and security community networkan initiative of the jewish federation of north america and the conference of presidents of major american jewish organizationshas been essential to protecting jewish communities here the formal partnerships between the community security trust in the united kingdom and the jewish community security service in france and their respective governments are also excellent models that need to be emulated the resolution emphasizes the importance of consistent twoway communication and information sharing between law enforcement agencies and jewish community groups it encourages the development of a paneuropean information sharing communication and alerting system and envisions governments intergovernmental agencies and jewish communities working together on it such a system should function dayround and yearround and include training for personnel who are implementing it the resolution also calls for european governments to support assessments in several key areas and accordingly adjust their actions and strategies details matter the assessments should gather and analyze data on crimes committed response from law enforcement types of attacks or incidents that are most prevalent and the types of targets that are most at risk it is essential to understand how law enforcement agencies usually receive reports of antisemitic crimes and what initial actions they take when a report is filed i remember years ago when i offered a resolution at the osce parliamentary assembly we heard that it was just hooliganism and other kinds of acts done by young people when you spraypaint a swastika on a tombstone in a jewish cemetery when you deface a synagogue and you attack a man simply because he is wearing a yarmulke clearly these are acts of antisemitic hate yet they were being dismissed as something that was other assessments are also needed on jewish community security groups particularly of their capabilities resources relationships with local law enforcement agencies preparedness including emergency response plans and the extent to which their decisionmaking is based on the best available information analysis and practices the resolution calls for governments to use these assessments to help these community groups develop common baseline safety standards these standards should include as i said before training controlling access to physical facilities physical security measures including cameras and crisis communications emergency exercises and simulations mapping access to facilities and sharing information with law enforcement agencies should also be part of the standards these assessments will help achieve the resolutions call for law enforcement personnel to be well trained to monitor prevent and respond to antisemitic violence and to partner with jewish communities for all of these assessments governments should draw information from sources that include jewish groups law enforcement agencies independent human rights ngos research initiatives and other civil society groups and leaders h res 354 calls for safety awareness and suspicious activity reporting campaigns like if you see something say something here in the united states other aspects of the resolution include appropriately integrating initiatives to counter violent extremism and those to combat antisemitism and the urgency of implementing the declarations decisions and other commitments of the organization for security and cooperation in europe that focus on antisemitism to accomplish these goals the resolution calls for european governments to ensure that they appoint or designate senior officials with the necessary authority and resources to combat antisemitism and collaborate with governmental and intergovernmental agencies law enforcement and jewish community groups finally the resolution reaffirms support for the mandate of the united states special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism as part of the broader policy of fostering international religious freedom and urges the secretary of state to continue robust unitedstates reporting on antisemitism by the department of state and the special envoy to combat and monitor antisemitism i would note parenthetically that i authored the amendment to the global antisemitism review act of 2004 introduced and sponsored by senator voinovich my amendment created the office to monitor and combat antisemitism within the state department that has proven to be a key tool in this fight the resolution has the support of leading organizations and it has 89 cosponsors including all eight of the

constructive to suggest that one side of the aisle is complicit in mass attacks on our nation simply because some of us have had grave concerns about a proposal that for 2 years has been offered that we believe is flawed in recognizing constitutional protections but it is also not acceptable to embrace inaction and that is true on my side of the aisle as well i have voted against the democratic

has been closed and someone has been removed from the watch list and he later goes to purchase a firearm the fbi should be notified i think that is reasonable that is h r i ask for your consideration i ask for you to help make it better the terror strike in orlando struck at the heart of america yes it struck in the name of isisa terrorist who proclaimed he was doing it in the name of radical islam those were his words it also struck at the heart of an lgbt community that for generations has been fighting for freedom and it saw that freedom attacked americansall americansfeel less safe now lets inject some radical common sense into this debate we can ensure no fly no buy while also ensuring due process and the second amendment if we take the context of novemberthe narrative of a campaignout of this we can actually get this done lets listen to the 85 percent of americans who disapprove of the job we are doing rather than go home and have a message of blaming each other lets go home and say we solved it together if h r 5544 is not something you can support lets talk about how to improve it with regard to the proposal my friends on the left have had for 2 years add due process real due process you will get the support you will get the support on our side of the aisle if you add due process i say to my friends on my side of the aisle lets lead on this issue the

hateful terrorist attack targeting americas lgbt community in orlando is another reminder to come together and work across party lines to root out terrorism prevent gun violence and put an end to bigotry of all kinds an attack on one american is an attack on all of us we cannot allow partisanship to define this debate we must take decisive and united actions to ensure that nothing like the attacks on orlando paris newtown or san bernardino ever happen again congress should immediately move forward and pass the denying firearms and explosives to dangerous terrorists act this commonsense bill would prohibit suspected terrorists from possessing guns or explosives keeping dangerous weapons out of the hands of people who wish to do our country harm is a solution that we should all be able to get behind the hateful attack in orlando also reminds us once more of the growing threat of isisinspired radical islamic terrorist on unitedstates soil is real and cannot be ignored or downplayed congress must reassert leadership in the fight against isis by passing legislation to hold the president accountable for developing a comprehensive plan to destroy isis through congressional oversight hearings we must also ensure that federal agencies and local law enforcement are effectively communicating with each other to identify international and homegrown terror threats through both traditional security approaches and social media internationally congress must act to cut off sources of funding to other radical islamic terror groups by restoring crippling sanctions on iran the recent agreement which frankly shipped billions of dollars to the worlds largest state sponsor of terror while helping finance organizations like hamas and hezbollah is simply unacceptable at home we cannot allow the tired partisan bickering to distract us from the difficult but necessary work of preventing gun violence we need to bridge the partisan divide and put the best interests of our country before politics a good first step is the legislation that i helped introduce with former congresswoman gabby giffords to require universal background checks on firearm purchases the vast majority of the american people support this commonsense idea and it is past time congress moves forward with this proposal that will keep more people safe we also need to improve communications so that local law enforcement is notified when someone attempts to purchase a gun and fails a required background check my colleague congressman mike quigley introduced a commonsense bill to make this fix which i strongly support other important efforts to prevent gun violence include my bill with congresswoman debbie dingell to prevent domestic abusers from being able to purchase weapons this proposal would help again prohibit firearm trafficking used to evade background checks and also a longoverdue increase in mental health resources in short there are numerous commonsense proposals that will keep guns out of the hands of those that should not have them while protecting our second amendment rights it is time that we take action there is no quick and easy solution to all the problems underscored by the orlando terrorist attack but if we are able to set aside partisan differences and unite in the best interests of our nation we can make serious strides in the ongoing

the ranking member of that committee karen bass have also done indepth work on nigeria and on boko haram in particular i appreciate their travels to nigeria nigeria holds a critical presidential election this weekend it is expected to be the continents most consequential political event in years africas most populous nation has over 70 million registered voters who will report to more than 100 000 polling stations i had the opportunity with don payne to lead a delegation years ago with election observer responsibility there for one of these national elections in nigeria along with general colin powell at the time let me tell you the political environment is always tense but it is especially tense now the leading candidates are neck and neck as was the case then i just have to say that we have seen nigeria transition from military rule to democracy in the election that general powell and i witnessed and that was a very peacefulvery peacefultime but recent elections in nigeria have seen political violence and we are right to be concerned this resolution urges all political candidates to respect their pledges of nonviolence and insist that the government hold a free fair and credible election and that they do so on time this election date has already been postponed once meanwhile nigeria continues to face grave insecurity in the north at the hands of boko haram which loosely translates to western education is sin this islamist terrorist organization indiscriminately kills in mass and pillages villages in their quest to establish a sharia state satellite images document that after boko haram comes through villages are literally wiped off the map the group is responsible for 5 000 deaths last year in 2014 and displacing over 1 million people last year making this organization by the way one of the worlds most deadly but this weekend forces fighting boko haram reported discovering another hundred bodies in a shallow mass grave we dont really know how many they have killed out there in total but we know that the killing continues after watching boko harams violence i wasnt surprised to see that that group pledges allegiance to isis isis publicly accepted the overture claiming this new relationship expands their selfdeclared caliphate to west africa at the same time we have seen boko harams propaganda increase in quality mimicking the production of isis videos sweeping what we call the virtual caliphate on the internet so the good news is that nigerias neighbors chad niger and cameroon have all been making progress in the fight against boko haram under a newly established african union regional force they have rescued more than 30 northern nigerian towns to date from boko haram and from that harsh rule this is a good beginning but this african union regional force lacks equipment and it lacks training this resolution expresses the houses support for robust security assistance to these troops in their fight against boko haram nevertheless we cannot rely solely on other countries in the region nigerias security forces should have the lead role to play if dismantling boko haram is the goal we need a welltrained

rightfully asking questions about national security and yes about the second amendment and about firearms the numbers dont lie eightyfive percent of americans believe that if you are being investigated for terror you should not be able to purchase a firearm but 88 percent of americans also believe that this body should follow the constitution the congressional approval ratingnot 58 percent not 88 percentis somewhere around 10 percent why it is because the american people want to see a congress that is governing a congress that is solving problems we each run on closely held convictions and we should honor those every day in the halls of this body the days of reaching consensus seem to be imperiled seem to be just out of reach we prioritize the politics of blame over the politics of governing we prioritize the politics of november over the politics of now in the past few weeks this conflict has played out in very real time on very closely held issues personal issues right here in this well my friends on the left want to vote on a bill that will lose it will lose we on the right are often chastised for bringing up legislation that will be vetoed with the question why even go down that road the same questions can be asked about why do we demand a vote on a bill that will lose and it will lose based on constitutional convictions about a lack of due process in the current draft of the no fly no buy bill eightyeight percent of americans support the constitution and that includes due process current restrictions on firearm purchases are all postadjudicationif you have been adjudicated mentally incompetent if you have been adjudicated and convicted of a violent crime if you have been adjudicated and separated dishonorably from the armed forces but a no fly no buy list with no process says there is no adjudication and that raises constitutional convictions which is why that bill would go down my friends on the right are rightfully concerned over a slippery slope about the second amendment a fundamental right to purchase and bear firearms we cant let this debate end in inaction which is the great fear of the next 2 weeks the truth is we can protect the second amendment we can protect due process and we can protect communities throughout the country which is why i have introduced h r 5544 as a consensus bill is it perfect perhaps not but work with me to make it better it says this if you are being investigated as a terror suspect you cant buy a firearm but if your government denies you the right to purchase that firearm your government has 10 days to notify you they did so because you are being investigated you are then entitled to a due process hearing within 30 days at which the government has the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence to prove why you shouldnt be able to purchase a firearm the individual is entitled to see all unclassified evidence and the hearing remains private to protect the interests of the individual and the interests of government my bill would also notify law enforcement if somebody who is the subject of a closed investigation later tries to purchase a firearm we can probably make it better together we can add reimbursement of court fees we can allow a provision in the collins bill that says law enforcement should be allowed to let a transfer go through if it helps an investigation as opposed to hindering it to the left it provides no fly no buy with due process to the right it protects the second amendment the second amendment is not infringed because someone is being investigated it is infringed because someone is denied the right to purchase a firearm which is why my bill finally provides due process and puts the burden of proof on the government if that right is denied we can do this we can actually do this we can reach consensus on both sides of the aisle the real scandal in this town right now is not about sitins the real scandal is not about inaction the real scandal is that this isnt that hard this isnt that hard eightyfive percent of americans say no fly no buy eightyeight percent say support the constitution so lets do that lets stand with those who support no fly no buy lets stand with those who support the constitution and lets give some level of hope to cling to to the 90 percent of this country who disapprove of what is

have happened in civilized society this is the 70th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz death camp as a schoolboy growing up in east texas later attending texas a m and especially in my time my 4 years in the united states army as we discussed and looked at world war ii things that had occurred theni was a history major and was with the army for 4 years and majored in history it was just always amazing how could people who said they were civilized kill 6 million of any race gender national origin how could that happen but it did happen on learning that eisenhower required people from the surrounding villages to be brought in to help clean up concentration camps death campsas i understood the reasonwas so no one could ever deny that the death camps occurred i thought that seemed ridiculous how could anybody deny the holocaust there arent all that many survivors but there are enough and the evidence is there and it clearly happened but just as hitler showed if any lie is told often enough people begin to believe it especially if it is even printed here is something that was in print yesterday from a man named martin greenfield from foxnews com and these are martin greenfields words mr greenfield said seventy years ago i was in a nazi concentration camp since then i have seen tyrants and dictators enter and exit the global stage yet as the world prepares to mark the 70th anniversary of the auschwitz liberation it is perhaps well and right that we reflect on how the holocaust shocked the moral imagination on a scale the world could scarcely fathom why ponder such things because for far too many the holocaust remains a mystery a major poll taken last year of 53 000 people found that just 54 percent had ever heard of the holocaust knowledge of auschwitz is likely even more limited particularly among young people past surveys have shown that nearly half of britons had never heard of auschwitz some schoolchildren even thought auschwitz was a type of beer here at home in america a debate erupted last year when a teenager posted a smiling selfie at auschwitz whatever your opinion on the appropriateness of her actions i was at least pleased to be reminded that some young americans still visit the nazi concentration camp to learn history up close i too visited auschwitz as a teenager in 1944 my family and i stood in line before dr josef mengele the nazi physician known as the angel of death as my mother grandparents two sisters and baby brother were all sent to the left to be burned in hitlers ovens my father and i were sent to the right the first night inside auschwitz my father said we must separate because together we would suffer double he quoted his father on your own you will survive his father told him you are young and strong and i know you will survive if you survive by yourself you must honor us by living by not feeling sorry for us this is what you must do that was the last time i ever saw my father i am grateful for my fathers words of grace and guidance they echo in my heart even still it is a cruel thing feeling guilty for surviving but my father erased any future guilt and replaced it with purpose it was a gift only a fathers wisdom could give it gave me a reason to go forward a reason to be it does still part of heeding my fathers words involved replacing the horrors of my holocaust past with a life spent creating beauty in the form of handtailored suits for unitedstates presidents hollywood films and the worlds most influential men in fact my first sewing lesson took place in the auschwitz concentration camp laundry when i accidentally ripped the collar of a nazi soldiers shirt a guard beat me before a kind older inmate taught me how to sew a simple stitch to repair the torn shirt it was hardly the ideal tailoring apprenticeship but it was my first lesson in the skill that became my livelihood but at 86 another part of honoring my fathers wishes requires being a voice for the voiceless indeed as parents educators and citizens we must all do our part to help ensure that never forget remains much more than a threadbare catchphrase that gathers dust and loses meaning with each passing year for example many people are surprised to learn that auschwitz was actually a complex comprised of three main camps and dozens of satellites the united states holocaust memorial museums statistics estimate that between 1940 and 1945 at least 1 1 million jews and 200 000 of hitlers undesirables were sent to the auschwitz complex of those 1 1 million were murdered as i have noted elsewhere that number would have been far greater were it not for the courage of the american soldiers sailors airmen and marines who traveled around the world to defeat a moral darkness that consumed at least 6 million jewish souls that is a lesson worthy of remembrance the 70th anniversary of the liberation marks that moment when freedom conquered barbarism through sureness of virtue and strength of will sadly as recent events reveal that remains a lesson humanity must learn and relearn from generation to generation the word holocaust means sacrifice by fire may the memory of the millions who were engulfed in the flames like my family never be forgotten that is martin greenfield 70 years after being liberated from auschwitz death camp there is another article from cbc news aleksandra sagan includes this regarding mordechai ronen 82 born with the family name markovits he would be making a second visit to auschwitz for the commemoration ceremonies at nearly 12 ronen saw auschwitz for the first time as a prisoner after soldiers forced all the jews in his hungarian town into a ghetto and 2 weeks later shipped them in cattle cars to the camp dr josef mengele the nazis angel of death sent ronens mother and two sisters to the gas chambers on arrival young ronen made a lifesaving decision when he held on to his fathers hand and joined the line of men he spent about 2 weeks at auschwitz where he witnessed soldiers using an infant for target practice and slept on piles of corpses to avoid selection for the gas chamber he and his father were moved to a nearby labor camp where the brutality continued one day his father told ronen he could no longer get up to work for the cement brigade ronen last saw his father as soldiers took him away it is the only day he remembers crying and the day he decided to survive ronen was liberated from a third camp gunskirchen and remembers walking to a nearby town knocking on a residents door and asking if he could take a shower ronen who prefers to be called a victorer rather than a survivor first returned to auschwitz in 1999 when he guided thenprime minister jean chretien around the grounds it is important to ronen to show the world he is alive and to share the history of the holocaust maybe the world will realize what we went through and it will be the end and we are going to have peace and quiet in the world he explains unfortunately it is not the end of horrors tragically christians now are being killed persecuted and tortured in greater numbers than ever in the history of the world antisemitism hatred against jews is growing like i couldnt have imagined in college when i studied in history i couldnt have imagined the kind of antijewish hatred the kind of antisemitism that would be growing as it has and the united states of america would be doing precious little about it instead of standing up for the jewish people and calling out antisemitism where it exists and where it grows and proliferates as it does in the united nations for example as it has in europe as it has in england as it has right here in america it is unconscionable that at a time in world history when the united states is said to be the true superpower of the worldeven as that power has been seen as diminishing by people around the world as polling indicates around the world but still to be seen as the great superpoweras antijewish hatred grows and we do precious little about it and even at times stoke those flames even in our universities who are so proud of accepting massive amounts of money from people who are part of organizations that hate jews and fund such courses or seminars on things like islamophobia not a liberated mental process of recognizing antisemitism recognizing jewish hatredno stoking those flames against the jewish people it is unbelievable that it is happening here in america as well and it is even more unbelievable that it is happening among what some would refer to as the intelligentsia those who are supposed to be more enlightened than the rest of a nation who see things as they truly are and yet in america some of those supposed enlightened intelligentsia are growing to be some of the most antisemitic people in the country how did all this happen money for one thing political power for another but it has to stop money and initially power in nazi germany stoked the flames of antijewish hatred but there is antichristian hatred growing as well radical islam has proliferated around the world violent radical islam has grown they arent junior varsities these are literal cutthroats who have to be stopped it is not enough for the united states administration to beg radical islamists jew and christianhating leaders to sit at the table or offer to let their murderers go free if they will just sit down and visit with us reminiscent of what jimmy carter wanted to do after an act of war was committed against our embassy and in the 36 years that have followed what appeared to radical islamists as a weak paper tiger toothless america did nothing but beg to sit down and talk and try to encourage iran to let our prisoners go it was not until ronald reagan took office they were released they never wanted to fight the united states superpower that has been changed over the years since 79 when they committed an act of war attacked our embassy around the world people have been shown oh you can do that against the united states and get away with it the good thing is they may end up leaving your country and then they may offer to give you money they may offer to release murderers from prison so they can come back and help kill more americans you know they are not very smart over there in the united states that has been going on since 1979 it is tragic when we encourage radical islamist holocausts which is what they would like to do they said they were going to do by letting the murderers go how could this administration for months now think that yemen was a great example of moderate islam working out i have known since a constituent months ago was in jeopardy and we were able to get special ops people to help get them out according to them the embassy was attacked many months ago back at the time embassy personnel officially said no it was a nearby attack but it wasnt us when the iranianbacked houthis the radical islamists in yemen were taking over the capital and taking over the countryand instead of standing up firmly against them and protecting our american interests we were releasing murderers radical islamic murdererswe were talking about how wonderful things were in yemen that is exactly how the kind of antijewish antichristian sentiment could grow to the point of having a holocaust it is literally breathtaking for an administration not to understand that while it is trying to placate radical islamic leaders in iran and telling them we just want to talk as long as you will keep talking to us we will keep israel from protecting themselves to their own detriment just keep talking to us and you keep those centrifuges spinning that is fine with us now we know we have been informed that the administration has taken complete dismantlement of the centrifuges and their equipment to help them create nuclear weapons off the table it is not even something they are demanding anymore in other words the word is out that this administration is apparently okay with iran getting nukes but just would prefer that it wait until after this president leaves office it doesnt matter when a president leaves office if an administration gives bloodthirsty zealots the ability to create a holocaust history does not forgive them simply because they had already left office when the holocaust actually started nigeria doesnt need us to send troops to stop the radical islamists there but they need help boko haram continues to kill rape torture there it is about going after christians the smallscale holocausts that boko haram is creating dont get so much as a whimper these days from this administration they may say a few words but they are hollow and they do not affect boko haram as they continue to be emboldened just like when the irs was caught redhanded being weaponized and used as a democratic political tool which appears to have violated criminal lawyes we have had hearings but we havent held them accountable and therefore it seems to have encouraged even more impropriety by people within the irs when people get caught in impropriety and dont pay a cost then you see what we are seeing in nigeria you see what we are seeing in afghanistan in pakistan in syria in iran in iraq and in libya oh i know the president his administration bragged about the arab spring and about taking out qadhafi who had become an ally after he gave up any efforts for nuclear weapons completely opened his defenses to the united states this administration and the prior administration had agreements with qadhafi but this administration never lets agreements get in the way of helping radical islamists because this administration did help radical islam turn libya into a smoking country where people die where our own people were not protected because of the fantasy of those who thought that somehow the name the united states would be adequate to keep chris stevens and the other americans safe in benghazi we didnt need to give them added security like they asked for we didnt even need to respond when chris stevens called and said they were under attacknever said anything about a video because it was not but that smokescreen worked the president got reelected he didnt have to account for that before the election still hasnt had to account for where he was and why help was not forthcoming i mean even after 20 hours this administration that had planeswe know for sure within 31 2 hoursafter 20 hours they get a private plane there that is it david ubben with most of his leg right leg blown off no painkillers no morphine they dont have a c130 that they land to take him up in on a gurney they get a private plane from somebody who wasnt even american and they have to knock david up against the door turning the gurney every which way trying to get him in without painkillers causing more pain more suffering because this administration apparently they were thinking that if they sent more help than just a private plane like that a military plane if that were sent it might look like libya were not the wonderful country that this administration helped create by bombing qadhafi out of existence and yes it was not it is true it was not a unitedstates bomb that took qadhafi out but our bombs put him on the run our bombs stopped his caravan our president wouldnt respond for 3 days after qadhafi offered to leave in exile and avoid any bloodshed before it all started this administration didnt respond obviously they were okay with having bloodshed and qadhafi being wiped out so they got what they were hoping for obviously but what do we have now we have a country in libya that is in absolute turmoil by the way because libya is in turmoil due to this administration they are helping turn egypt into as much turmoil as they can thank god for president elsisi in having met with him on more than one occasion i was impressed by the man before he was president he asked that we bring back a message to this administration since this administrationthis presidentfroze the helicopters that were being sent the apaches the question was does this administrationdoes this presidentnot understand that we use the apache helicopters to keep the suez canal open although there were some that bought morsis lies that he was deweaponizing the sinaisupposedly to diminish the threat to israel from the sinaiand after morsi was removed for his unconstitutional actions not in a coup but in an uprising which was a peaceful revolution by reportedly over 30 million of their 90 million people they found that the sinai had been dramatically weaponized and had been contributing weapons equipment to gaza to help threaten and cause terror to israel once again whether it is the sinai gaza northern israel that was given to lebanon it seems going back to the very inception of israelback when israel was first brought according to the bible into the promised landwe know of canaan the canaanites no longer exist so other people claim it who are not canaanites actually the israelis had claim to it after the canaanites others who occupied the land back over 3 000 years ago dont exist this land according to the bible was given to the children of israel it seems to be true that there has never been a time when israel gave away land when trying to buy peace that that land that they gave away was not used as a staging area from which to attack it gaza what a noble thing to do by the israelis they took an area that was prosperous selfsustaining with greenhouses growing vegetables that would feed the people who lived there an amazing place was the gaza strip then some noble israeli leaders thought do you know what it is not required we are getting absolutely nothing in return but we are going to do the unilateral act that will be so noble that will be so full of grace that the world even those who dont like us will go wow those israelis they are okay they are nice folks look they didnt get anything in return yet they still gave away the gaza strip what a wonderful group of people i mean that just doesnt happen the united states never gave back its land to england or to spain or to france or to other countries that initially had claims here other countries dont do that but israel did they gave away the gaza strip previous to that they had given away what northern israel now calls southern lebanon southern lebanon people will recall has been the site of attacks on israeliswar so how was this grace this beneficence of israels giving the gaza strip to the palestinians rewarded it has been rewarded by their giving back to israel thousands upon thousands upon thousands of rockets some kill all terrorize all cost money to israel the most important problem they have created is the threat to life the threat to their existence and we still have people in this country who say well if you just keep giving away land eventually they will be satisfied when the very materials that are being promoted by the people this administration supports among the islamiststhey made very clear the reason we name holidays streets areas parks after suicide bombers who kill innocent children women men is that we ultimately are going to destroy israel and wipe it off the map we hate jews that much and this administration thinks somehow they will bring radical islam around to really being this group of peace now there is a document that was an exhibit in the united states v the holy land foundation in which there were many individuals and groups named as coconspirators they were not indicted but they were named as coconspirators it includes the council on americanislamic relations cair which has a nice office building just up the street here and the islamic society of north america isna the leader of which is imam magid who goes to the white house who goes to the state department who advises the president and lets him know when somebody is criticizing islam so the administration steps in and goes after him in this exhibit from the holy land foundation trialit was the biggest funding of terrorism case ever in unitedstates history and people who were involved originally had indicated the goal was to convict these first five to name all of these coconspirators and if we get convictions of those first five like we think we should then we proceed and go after the remainder they were convicted in late 2008 president obama took office a month or two later and this administration would under no circumstances go after these people who had been alleged in the documents of funding radical islamic terrorism even after the unitedstates district court in dallas and the unitedstates fifth circuit court of appeals in new orleans confirmed that there was plenty of evidence to support that someone like isna or cair was a legitimate coconspirator named in the indictment and that their names would not be removed i have asked for years now of the justice department to make available the documents that were provided to the convicted terroriststhose funding terrorism or terroristsand this administration now for years has drug their feet and has refused to provide all of the documents that were provided to the terrorists on one occasion the attorney gen eral basically said there are issues here of privilege and my point wasand isyou gave them to the terrorists surely you can give them to members of congress but the answer is no they cant they are going to keep obfuscating they dont want us to see all of the documents that they had in their possession that they gave to the terrorists i have a feeling if we saw all of the documents it would be very very clear in the purging that this administration has done of our training materials of the fbis of the intelligence agencys of the state departments and the justice departments that if there is anything that might bother a radical islamist who wants to kill us then it has to be removed they removed it in the document from a 1991 meeting in what is called an explanatory memorandum it spells out their goals it was written in 1991 by a member of the board of directors of the muslim brotherhood in north america and by a senior hamas leader named mohamed akram it had been approved by the muslim brotherhoods shura council and organizational conference and it was meant for internal review by the muslim brotherhood leadership in egypt it was not intended for public consumption these are the words from the introduction that is part of this document from the center for security policy i want to quote from the document itself prepared by the muslim brotherhood in 1991 setting their goals for america one the memorandum is derived from one the general strategic goal of the group in america which was approved by the shura council and the organizational conference for the year 1987 is enablement of islam in north america meaning establishing an effective and stable islamic movement led by the muslim brotherhood which adopts muslims causes domestically and globally and which works to expand the observant muslim base aims at unifying and directing muslims efforts presents islam as a civilization alternative and supports the global islamic state if that name sounds familiar wherever it is two the priority that is approved by the shura council for the work of the group in its current and former session which is settlement skipping down to two an introduction to the explanatory memorandum it says the question we are facing is how do you like to see the islam movement in north america in 10 years or taking along the following sentence when planning and working islamic work in north america in the year 2000 a strategic vision it goes on also we must summon and take along elements of the general strategic goal of the group in north america for those large numbers of people in college who may not realize north america is where we live the document says i will intentionally repeat them in numbers they are one establishing an effective and stable islamic movement led by the muslim brotherhood two adopting muslims causes domestically and globally three expanding the observant muslim base four unifying and directing muslim efforts five presenting islam as a civilization alternative six supporting the establishment of the global islamic state wherever it is the document says it must be stressed that it has become clear and emphatically known that all is in agreement that we must settle or enable islam and its movement in this part of the world three the concept of settlement the term was mentioned in the groups dictionary and documents with various meanings in spite of the fact that everyone meant one thing with it we believe that the understanding of the essence is the same and we will attempt here to give the word and its meanings a practical explanation with a practical movement tone and not a philosophical linguistic explanation while stressing that this explanation of ours is not complete until our explanation of the process of settlement itself is understood which is mentioned in the following paragraph we briefly say the following settlement that islam and its movement become a part of the homeland it lives in establishment that islam turns into firmly rooted organizations on whose bases civilization structure and testimony are built further down it goes on that islam is stable in the land rooting that islam is resident and not a passing thing or rooted entrenched in the soil of the spot where it moves and not a strange plant to it four the process of settlement in order for islam and its movement to become a part of the homeland in which it lives talking about north america stable in its land rooted in the spirits and minds of its people enabled in the life of its society and has firmly established organizations on which the islamic structure is built and with which the testimony of civilization is achieved the movement must plan and struggle to obtain the keys and the tools of this process in carrying out this grand mission as a civilization jihadist responsibility which lies on the shoulders of muslims and on top of them the muslim brotherhood in this country talking about here in the united states north america among these keys and tools are the following it goes on to talk about the settlement concept and the fundamental shift toward settlement of this country number four understanding the role of the muslim brother in north america the process of settlement is a civilization jihadist process with all the word means anyway it goes on another place here it says there is a conviction with which this memorandum disagreesthat our focus in attempting to settle islam in this country will lead to negligence in our duty towards the global islamic movement in supporting its project to establish the state we believe that the reply is in two segments one the success of the movement in america talking about the united states of america one the success of the movement in america in establishing an observant islamic base with power and effectiveness will be the best support and aid to the global movement project and the second is the global movement has not succeeded yet in distributing roles to its branches stating what is the needed from them as one of the participants or contributors to the project to establish the global islamic state the day this happens the children of the american ikhwani branch will have farreaching impact and positions that make the ancestors proud it is a great document goal for taking over the united states which brings another story to the surface it is from bob price from breitbart com islamic tribunal confirmed in texas attorney claims its voluntary and it talks about the new islamic tribunal in texas that has been confirmed now by breitbart texas the tribunal is operating as a nonprofit organization in dallas because when you understand the goals if there is a major defeat or a major success muslim brotherhood requires a mosque be built there and a presence there naturally they would want one at ground zero in new york further they would want a mosque and a strong presence in dallas which was they believe the place of their big defeat when the holy land foundation principals were convicted and sent to prison i did want to point out as we finish up here today that the president was giving an excellent speech in india about the importance of stopping the global war on women he didnt call it that he only calls it that for republicans but there is a war on women and it is not by republicans it is radical islam and even some moderate islamists he is giving this talk about the importance of recognizing the importance and the equality of womenor some of us might say they are more equal than we arebut as he was doing that this picture was on saudi television we have our united states president depicted here and this is the first lady of the united states of america being blurred out by this countrys allies because she wasnt covered michelle obama should never need to be covered if she doesnt want to be yet at the very time our president is talking about equality of women he fails to notice that people that he considers allies are treating his own wife like this it is critical that we stand up against radical islam or any islam that wants a settlement civilization jihad in america anything and anybody who disagrees with the united states constitution and wants to destroy it tear it down is an enemy to the united states and needs to be recognized as such and not welcomed with open arms at the state department and the white house with that i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.9969266951084137, 0.0030733048915863037, 1, "i appreciate the gentlemans courtesy i have certain sympathy to what my friend from

on taxation jct incorporate into the official cost estimates required under section 402 of the congressional budget act of 1974 budget act the macroeconomic effects of major legislation because this rule builds on the existing requirement for cost estimates it does not apply to appropriations legislation by including an analysis of how major legislation will affect the economy this rule provides the house with a more comprehensive estimate than can be produced using only the traditional conventional scoring methods which implicitly assume that legislation has no effect on the broader economy in particular this analysis is required to include the budgetary effects of changes in economic output employment the capital stock and other macroeconomic variables resulting from major legislation in addition this rule requires a qualitative assessment of the longterm budgetary and macroeconomic effects of major legislation major legislation is defined as legislation causing an increase or decrease in revenues outlays or deficits in any fiscal year covered by the budget resolution equal to or greater than 0 25 percent of the projected gross domestic product for that year in applying the 0 25 percent threshold cbo and jct are required to look at the gross budgetary effects of the legislation in carrying out this requirement the intent is that cbo and jct review provisions in the bill that have a significant effect thus the test is whether any provision in the legislation has a budgetary effect larger than the threshold or if the absolute value of the sum of the provisions exceeds the threshold rather than whether the legislation as a whole has such an effect when all of the provisions are netted out alternately for legislation that may not have a large fiscal effect but would still have significant economic impacts the new rule empowers the house to designate major legislation for all legislation other than purely revenue legislation the rule authorizes the chair of the budget committee to designate major legislation for purely revenue legislation i e legislation that contains only provisions described in section 201 f of the budget act the rule authorizes the house member serving as the chair or vice chair of jct to designate major legislation for purposes of this rule the rule carefully preserves the existing division of labor between cbo and jct which requires close collaboration between these two nonpartisan institutions when major legislation involves both revenue and nonrevenue provisions cbo and jct will need to work together to produce a single integrated cost estimate for the legislation drawing on each agencys institutional responsibilities the rule requires enhanced transparency around these budgetary estimates both cbo and jct as applicable must provide together with their estimates a description of the critical assumptions and the source data underlying such estimates it is important that cbo and jct make this information available so that the public academic and other experts have an opportunity to review the analysis and pursue possible improvements in the methodologies used to develop these estimates distributional analyses of proposed tax changes that jct provides as background information is another area where estimates could be improved by incorporating macroeconomic effects into these analyses the preparation of cost estimates incorporating macroeconomic effects is frequently more complex and requires more time than the preparation of conventional cost estimates committees should therefore build in additional time to allow for the completion of the cost estimate both cbo and jct should strive to promptly produce the estimates required by this rule to the extent it is not practicable for cbo and jct to produce the required estimates the rule provides an accommodation in this instance two possible circumstances may arise when it is not feasible to produce the required analysis first committees and the house may be operating under tight deadlines and it is not possible for cbo or jct to complete the analysis prior to the legislations consideration second while cbo and jct have developed a great deal of expertise and experience in producing these analyses there may be situations where it is not possible for cbo and jct to produce the required analysis the material previously

improvement act of 2015 i appreciate the support and assistance of both chairman chabot and ranking member velazquez to include my legislation h r 2397 the tornado family safety act of 2015 as part of this legislation the small business administration is currently afforded the authority to issue physical disaster loans for 120 percent of the value of property destroyed but not covered by insurance the purpose of the additional 20 percent is so that individuals and business can modify structures to reduce damage from future disasters in oklahoma the threat of tornadoes is ongoing and we are always in between tornadoes planning is essential in order to militate against damage and loss of life it is for this reason that section 4 is necessary it reinforces the intent of congress that already exists in statutethe sba should already be including the construction of safe rooms as a use for physical disaster loans because it is mitigating measure the sbas existing interpretation of existing language in the small business act is incorrect because of misinterpretation of this section previously the sba should now understand that physical disaster loans can also be used for other types of storm shelters as well including but not limited to structures that protect occupants from not only tornadoes but from other natural disasters such as hurricanes floods and wildfires it is important to note that loans may not be used to upgrade homes or make additions unless as required by local building codes and secondary or vacation homes are not eligible for these loans the sba does not duplicate insurance claim payments generally loans are made over 30 years and interest rates are not more than 4 percent for those cannot obtain credit elsewhere and for those that can obtain alternative credit the rate does not exceed 8 percent for the loan while local and state governments have an obligation to meet the increase in shelter demand the construction of the shelters is expensive under guidelines from the federal emergency management agency fema and the international code council icc a safe room should withstand 250 mph winds and the impact of a 15pound plank hitting a wall at 100 mph according to the insurance institute for business and home safety safe rooms designed to the fema and icc standards are recommended for both tornadoes and hurricanes for individual
