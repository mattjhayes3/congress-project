month ago this house decided by nearly a 100vote margin to increase the funding for the environmental protection agencys research program to last years appropriations level at that time it was made clear that such an increase was modest indeed given the epas new responsibilities with regard to toxic wastes and given the magnitude of the cuts in epas budget between 1981 and 1982 if we want to reaffirm the commitment we made 1 month ago to the epa budget and environmental protection we must vote today to bring the appropriations for epas research closer to the fiscal year 1982 appropriations level when we debated this issue previously i think we made obvious a contradiction in epa research policy on the one hand the agency is committed to improving the quality of scientific research that it uses to support our environmental standards that is a goal that all of us can enthusiastically endorse at the same time however the agency is cutting exactly those longterm research projects that keep the epa in the forefront of environmental science the point is obvious if the agency is going to focus its entire environmental program on shortterm regulatory needs the quality of its science will inevitably deteriorate that point has been underscored by the american chemical society which represents 125 000 chemists and engineers and which has enthusiastically endorsed the amendment to restore appropriations for epa research let me quote directly from the societys letter the scheuer amendment would increase funding for extramural research an area slated for drastic cuts by administration thereby allowing the agency to draw upon qualified creative experts outside epa who can assist in solving environmental problems the extramural program is critical because it is open to the entire scientific community including many of the best environmental scientists some of whom have become discouraged by their inability to have their work supported by funding through the epa laboratories the proposed additional funds will allow epa to increase its longrange research on emerging environmental problems it would be shortsighted to wait until such problems reach crisis proportions before attempting to develop the information that is needed for appropriate policies and regulations a lack of fundamental information is a major reason the agency has failed to meet some of the regulatory deadlines established by congress in summary the american chemical society believes that the house would be wise to accept the scheuer amendment i include the full text of the

people who had not committed crimes but who the fbi thought might be induced to commit crimes for the courts this kind of perverse process raises the legal question of what entrapment is or is not for me and others who are concerned about our constitutional system the question is whatever happened to the right of presumed innocence and whatever happened to the separation of powers even the justice department recognizes how thin is the line between what they are doing and what they can properly do even they recognize that this kind of technique is so dangerous that abusive investigators could wreck the constitution itself that is why they add to their guidelines on undercover operations the caveat in any undercover operation the decision to offer an inducement to an individual shall be based solely on law enforcement considerations another way of saying this is tiat the justice department does not think it would be nice to offer bribes to public officials as a way of getting at or doing in the opponents or enemies of any particular administraion now i am not an enemy of the present administration far from itbut i know that past administrations and specifically the nixon administration was not above using investigative powers and regulatory powers to punish perceived opponents knowing that history how could anyone fail to balarimed at the assertion that investigators can attempt to bribe people who are known to be innocent and how can anyone believe that the caveat quoted above has any mneanhig or offers any protect ion the undercover operations guidelines issued yesterday by the attorney general sanctify the abscam teciniques but they do not erase the questions about this sinister method of socalled law enforcement legal investigations are supposed to be concerned with solving crimes that have actiially taken place not creating criminal acts the quick reaction to what i am saying is to shrug and say that an innocent person might be counted on to refuse to be tempted but that begs the question why should an innocent person be put to such a test what kind of orwellian vision is it that invites agents of the government to place in front of innocent persons deals that they cannot afford to pass up the guidelines say that the f1il cannot offer a bribe to anyone who is not predisposed to accept but by definition anyone who does accept would be predisposed and therefore anyone can be approached by the bagmen of the fbi now let us suppose that the f11 uses this kind of technique merely to amass evidence so as to put officials under its control what then becomes of the independence of public officials the answer is selfevident and we should not think for a moment that this kind of blackmail has not taken place we know that it has the undercover guidelines issued yesterday simply make it easier for this to happen the business of law enforcement agencies is to investigate criminal acts not manufacture them abscam was not an jnvestigation into criminal acts it was the actual manufacture of criminal acts there is no denying that the evidence showed money changing hands and that was illegal but the issue is this how can we know that any one of those individuals has ever before committed a crime or would have ever done so does the fbi have a license to go out and offer fantastic termlptations so as to entice people into criminal acts i say that they do not and if they do if they can go out and manufacture crime the whole basis of our judicial system is in trouble we are confronted with the techniques of the tyrant i have grown up in a rougher school than most i know what it is to have someone try to set up a frame to coipromise a political enemy for that has been done to me i know what it is to be the target of

dismantle our strategic or active defense system air defense was one of those victims in the 1960s air defense had about 2 600 interceptor fighter planes today we have less than 300 in the 1960s we had over 1 000 surfacetoair or sam missiles assigned a role of guarding our key militarv ipstall lions today we have noner in the 1960s theliuatd tates had a formidabldffetifense radar system today

the mayor a county executive persons involved in volunteer efforts within the business community and somefor want of a better term real people who are feeling the effects of federal funding reductions we took the committee to a major and largely federally funded center for the specialized treatment of children with severe handicaps we learned from this visit two important points first there is a general willingness on the part of people to recognize that the federal goverinment must rein itself in and get control of its expenditures and second there is disbelief disappointment and not just a little bitterness at the results of taking a meatax approach to budget cutting time and again we were told that in no way were people at the local levelthose who are fighting the trench warfare

estimates for the next fiscal year are too lowon the order of 20 to 25 billion too low the news is disturbing because it makes it that much more difficult for congress to begin the work of cutting the budget the news is not surprising however since economists and budget experts spent all last week telling congressional panels that the presidents budget was based on unrealistic assumptions that would undermine his figures and his promise of a balanced budget by 1984 in fact the administration has been through this once before already when it discovered 2 weeks ago that it had underestimated spending by 6 to 7 billion the cbo reestimates call into question the nature of president reagans cuts is he actually cutting federal spending by 48 6 billion the staff of the senate budget committee now with a republican majority says no the real figure is probably around 42 9 billion because the presidents budget assumes lower interest rates and inflation than can realistically be expected so that one bit of optimism on ihe presidents part just increased the deficit by almost 6 billion it now appears that the whole range of overly optimistic economic assumptions woven into this budget only

last years appropriations level at that time it was made clear that such an increase was modest indeed given the epas new responsibilities with regard to toxic wastes and given the magnitude of the cuts in epas budget between 1981 and 1982 if we want to reaffirm the commitment we made 1 month ago to the epa budget and environmental protection we must vote today to bring the appropriations for epas research closer to the fiscal year 1982 appropriations level when we debated this issue previously i think we made obvious a contradiction in epa research policy on the one hand the agency is committed to improving the quality of scientific research that it uses to support our environmental standards that is a goal that all of us can enthusiastically endorse at the same time however the agency is cutting exactly those longterm research projects that keep the epa in the forefront of environmental science the point is obvious if the agency is going to focus its entire environmental program on shortterm regulatory needs the quality of its science will inevitably deteriorate that point has been underscored by the american chemical society which represents 125 000 chemists and engineers and which has enthusiastically endorsed the amendment to restore appropriations for epa research let me quote directly from the societys letter the scheuer amendment would increase funding for extramural research an area slated for drastic cuts by administration thereby allowing the agency to draw upon qualified creative experts outside epa who can assist in solving environmental problems the extramural program is critical because it is open to the entire scientific community including many of the best environmental scientists some of whom have become discouraged by their inability to have their work supported by funding through the epa laboratories the proposed additional funds will allow epa to increase its longrange research on emerging environmental problems it would be shortsighted to wait until such problems reach crisis proportions before attempting to develop the information that is needed for appropriate policies and regulations a lack of fundamental information is a major reason the agency has failed to meet some of the regulatory deadlines established by congress in summary the american chemical society believes that the house would be wise to accept the scheuer amendment i include the full text of the american chemical societys letter of endorsement at this point in the record and i ask that my colleagues support this important
