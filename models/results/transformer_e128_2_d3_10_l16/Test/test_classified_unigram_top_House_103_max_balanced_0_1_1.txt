their hard work in crafting this legislation fusion is a critical and necessary component of the worlds future energy supply and this nation must not surrender our lead in this scientific field as we did in particle physics when we killed the supercollider the world petroleum supply may expire in as little as 60 years where will the world energy supply from then how will our children and grandchildren continue to maintain our quality of life the world is growing and maturing but in order for our quality and standards of living to continue our levels of energy production must continue to grow in order for third world countries to evolve they must have a number of things modern medicine improved transportation and simple things that they do not now have such as clean water you can have none of these things but even pure drinking water without energy and in order to have that energy supply for much of the world we need a plentiful inexpensive source fusion seems to be the answer with commercialization just a few decades away this scientific investment in our future is one of the most critical efforts we can conduct for future generations fusion fuel is as plentiful as seawater and fusion reactors will be safe and productive japan europe and the russians are poised to seize the lead in fusion from this country fusion is quality science and its potential is something we must not abandon otherwise in just a few decades we will be purchasing our electricity from abroad we must invest in those steps that will take us to commercial fusion energy production the administration strongly supports the fusion program and the international thermonuclear energy reactor or iter which is based on the tokamak concept in order to produce the iter we must continue work on the tokamak physics experiment or tpx at princeton university the tpxwill be an advanced fusion reactor that will be the first major fusion machine to operate continuously for this country to maintain its global position in the fusion market the tokamak physics experiment must continue fusion is the same process that powers our sun and the stars one out of every 6 500 atoms of hydrogen in ordinary water is the fusion fuel deuterium also called heavy hydrogen giving each gallon of water the energy content of 300 gallons of gasoline this makes the fusion fuel supply virtually inexhaustible fusion produces no highlevel radioactive waste and will eventually cost about the same as modernday electricity commercial application is expected in less than 30 years the petroleum supply is expected to run out in less than 60 years because the department of energy estimates that world energy needs will be about four times the current demand in the year 2050 we must begin building now for those huge future energy needs this legislation is a strong step forward in that direction and i am pleased to support it here today"], [0.4998505711555481, 0.5001494288444519, 1, "1

at my alma mater american university with the eloquence that only john f kennedy could deliver he outlined a path to peace centered around nuclear disarmament i am going to ask that the statement of the gentleman from massachusetts honoring this occasion and sharing his own thoughts on nuclear disarmament be introduced into the record following my remarks my colleague mr kennedy continues to carry today the torch of peace which his late uncle lit no doubt this was a difficult and risky political speech for president kennedy the cold war was raging the united states and the union of soviet socialist republics were engaged in a massive arms buildup the earth was a chessboard both countries made foreign policy based on the moves of the other country nations were pawns of the two great powers those countries with special chess moves were those who had some form of a nuclear capability no country had more moves more bombs more delivery capability more killing power than the united states and the unitedstatess r might was measured in number of bombs in the nuclear stockpile and their accuracy at the same time thought was given even urged by the two superpowers that nuclear proliferation was not good for the world order nations were encouraged not to develop a nuclear capability 2040 thoughts and words were forming that in the midst of the arms race the two great powers should take steps to end the entire arms race especially between the two great powers president kennedy took that first great step in 1963 30 years ago today at that time the united states and the unitedstatess r were still conducting nuclear tests above ground atmospheric tests as they were called the unitedstates tests were conducted above ground at the nevada test site i visited that test site as a member of congress i even spent the night there i received all kinds of briefings and a tour of the current test sites and how they do it now conducted of course underground in tunnels a mile and a half into the ground in very deep wells i also toured a historic site the flats where above ground nuclear bombs were detonated and tested one can still find wooden bleacher seats where vips and the media could view a detonation like a grand holiday imagine imagine the stupidity also at that time citizens of the world were calling for an end to test ing not only because of the human health hazard from these atmospheric tests but also as a first step to ending the nuclear arms race it is in this context 30 years ago that president kennedy took this bold step seeking an end to atmospheric tests driving them underground but that was significant progress at that time thirty years later we are still testing underground in nevada i will include for the record president kennedys entire speech but let me recall some of the words from president kennedy it makes no sense in an age when a single nuclear weapon contains almost ten times the explosive force delivered by all of the allied air forces in the second world war it makes no sense in an age when the deadly poisons produced by nuclear exchange would be carried by wind and water and soil and seed to the far corners of the globe and to generations yet unborn quoting further there is no single simple key to this peace no grand or magic formula to be adopted by one or two powers genuine peace must be the product of manifestations the sum of many acts it must be dynamic not static changing to meet the challenge of each new generation quoting further we have also been talking in geneva about other first step measures of arms control designed to limit the intensity of the arms race and to reduce the risk of accidental war our primary longrange interest in geneva however is general and complete disarmament designed to take place by stagestagespermitting parallel political developments to build the new institutions of peace which would take the place of arms the pursuit of disarmament has been an effort of this government since the 1920s the president further stated the one major area of these negotiations where the end is in sight yet where a fresh start is badly needed isan a treaty to outlaw nuclear tests the conclusion of such a treaty so near and yet so far would check the spiraling arms race in one of its most dangerous areas it would place the nuclear powers in a position to deal more effectively with one of the greatest hazards which man faces in 1963 the further spread of nuclear arms it would increase our security it would decrease the prospects of war surely this goal is sufficiently important to require a steady pursuit yielding neither to the temptation to give up the whole effort nor the temptation to give up our insistence on vital and responsible safeguards then the president outlined and stated his two important decisions one was that he was asking chairman khrushchev and prime minister mcmillan to have discussions in moscow looking for an early agreement on a comprehensive test ban treaty to show his good faith he proposed and said that the united states would not conduct atmospheric tests so long as the other states do not do so it was brilliant the president said we will not be the first to resume we will not be the first to resume atmospheric testing finally our president said in closing confident and unafraid we labor onnot toward a strategy of annihilation but toward a strategy of peace thirty years later there is no cold war and there is no soviet union the great bear is dead let us deal with it there is a new threat however with nuclear bombs yes of course and this threat we must deal with today yes in the next few weeks the question is no longer how many nuclear bombs are in the stockpile of any nation nor how accurate those bombs are the threat to the world the threat to every american citizen is whether any nation has even one nuclear bomb one bomb regardless of delivery capability regardless of accuracy one is enough many nations today still fear the united states why because the soviet union no longer exists no one great power exists to check the overwhelming power of the united states on this world chessboard on which we still live thus as the argument proceeds they must have at least one bomb many little nations with one bomb imagine recently i had a meeting with the american ambassador to the peoples republic of china he says your law says you can test 15 more times so what if we test once so what many little nations with one bomb one baby bomb imagine korea pakistan india iraq libya israel the world is at a new crossroads the united states has a new young bright president and he will soon make a decision a decision as profound yea maybe even more so certainly as historic certainly with wider ramifications than president kennedys decision 30 years ago today editorial writers recently throughout the united states are giving our young president advice on this matter this issue has not gone unnoticed in those who have followed this issue through the years those who understand history those who understand the new world order and fears to help president clinton with his decision these editorial writers have written let me take a moment to quote from a few and maybe even comment the statesmansjournal my hometown newspaper in salem or said on june 10 just today resuming nuclear tests at the nevada testing site makes no sense unless you want to maintain salaries and good jobs for government scientists in bombmaking labs or unless you want to create more nuclear disorder in the world it goes on to say a world that finally may have achieved relief from the threat of nuclear war should not have to live with a new escalation of tensions from a new threat if the united states resumes testing we could become that new threat let us talk about the testing labs for a moment what i call this american death squad of scientists who relish new ways of destroying planet earth using their great minds and intellect that god gave them that probably the american educational system nurtured that they use in their testing labs this evil purveying of science yes these lab scientists are significant and qufte frankly they are very powerful they are very powerful though they are out west they are very powerful here in washington dc in reading the history of disarmament you see their fingers designing the bombs looking for more ways to destroy people not just buildings not just plant life not just a military target but every living person on earth that is what occurs in these testing labs and these people use their education and their talents and their creativity to design death that is their job they enjoy it they live it they come to congress every year and ask for more money now they are afraid because we told them last year we stood up to them and we said we will not test after 1996 unless some other nation tests and after the law went into effect they scurried about saying we have got to reorganize we have got to go to the new president and convince him and his administration of the need for continued testing of the ability to come up with new ways to destroy every living person on earth the american death squad is alive and well they are powerful they almost convinced the staffs of the administration recently to propose testing to the president beyond 1996 enough political heat was applied such that it is our understanding that that will pot be one of the options presented to the president it is a hollow victory because it is a victory we already won but these folks want to continue their job of creating death so they are still about there is mischief in the air and it originates from these testing labs the mischief is here in washington pervades the air there is no question about it there is no excuse for this the oregonian newspaper may 14 clinton has an opportunity to assure a safer and saner world by rejecting this last gasp of the nuclear arms industry and gettang on with the work of taking nonproliferation a big step closer to reality the new york times play tape for nuclear tests it begins the nuclear arms race has run its course but the nuclear laboratories and the pentagon dont seem to know it rattling windows in nevada to warn the world that washington still has the bomb seems particularly perverse when the unitedstates is trying to persuade nuclear havenots to stay out of the bombmaking business true banning tests wont guarantee that proliferation can be prevented states like pakistan have developed nuclear arms without testing them but a test ban will help stigmatize the bomb once again the new york times knows and recognizes the power of the nuclear laboratories in this whole political decision finally the washington post may 18 in fact no other decision serves the national interest as well as an immediate and permanent halt to all testing considerations of safety reliability and development are not foolish and irrelevant but they can be dealt with without testing subverting the overwhelming purpose of discouraging the spread of nuclear arms a test is more than a test it is a spectacular announcement that nuclear weapons are important useful and appropriate instruments of national power if the nuclear great power says so who are wouldbe nuclear countries to say no les aspin speaking a few months before he became defense secretary said international cooperation is at the core of nonproliferation efforts and that cooperation is going to be difficult if the united states continues insisting on nuclear testing he got it just right today 30 years later from president kennedys speech we walt with apprehension anxiety and hope for a report has gone to the president outlining variousoptions for the future of testing in this united states the window is open for only a few more years and the issue before the president is whether to test at all if so under law american law he is allowed only 15 more tests relating to safety and reliability only and as the one paper suggested scientists have said repeatedly that both safety and reliability tests can be done without detonating a bomb but with computer moduling and other forms of scientific advancements that we have today what are the options that went to the presidents desk that sit there waiting for a decision peace a giant step toward nonproliferation or another mirage of peace perpetrated by the testing labs and those who make their careers and money and reputation and who with all the gluttony of a pig in a cornfield anxiously await an excuse to test another bomb history the history of nuclear weapons on earth started with america and i do not debate at this point the arguments back then at this time but history will it end by the actions of an american one american our president bill clinton i do not know i do not know the reality of today is that for the first time since 1944 a period of 48 years this nation will not have detonated a nuclear bomb for full calendar year because of the various reporting requirements in the law which we passed this last year in congress it will be impossible to test a nuclear bomb in calendar year 1993 what a historic occasion for the first time in 48 years this nation will go a full calendar year without detonating a nuclear bomb no nuclear explosion for 1 year and we will continue to be militarily the strongest second to none yea i even say the second and third place in military might in this world the question this raises for president clinton therefore is will he become known in history as the president who resumes this nations dance with death and starts detonating nuclear bombs again will president clinton flip the switch and detonate nuclear bombs what will history say of this little flick of a switch i trust the president will give this decision his utmost consideration this is without question one of the most important decisions he could ever make as a president were he to flip a switch the chain reaction he would begin is not limited to the nuclear chain reaction that unleashes the single most powerful destructive force created by mankind he will set off another nuclear chain reaction other nations france could detonate a nuclear bomb again they have suggested so russia perhaps the ukraine could again demonstrate its nuclear prowess the presidents flip of a switch could give the green light to china to detonate another nuclear bomb what will pakistan india and other nations with a nuclear capability do today we have a world pause in the detonation of nuclear bombs will president clinton break that pause or will he turn the pause into a policy of cessation what a grand peaceful opportunity for our new president by not acting by not flipping the switch he could make history by not flipping the switch he will make peace he will make our world safer safer than it has ever been since prior to 1945 he will restore sanity to the world a saneness we have not had for nearly 50 years 50 years will he flip the switch i plead and pray that he will not i hope the president will do as john f kennedy did which he ordered which he ordered as president with respect to the atmospheric tests i remind us of president kennedys words 30 years ago today we will not be the first to resume what will president clinton do he will do only that which he truly wants to do i include for the record the remarks of president kennedy"], [0.4998505711555481, 0.5001494288444519, 1, "4 war to thank

with bill dannemeyer a pal of mine who has retired i said would he take my call so he took my call this is like 1985 or early 1986 i said dan bob dornan and he said yes congressman what can i do i said dan you just said something on the air tonight that is not true you said the major categories for aids this is in the 19851986 8 years ago maybe 8 years still are homosexuals hemophiliacs and haitians and that is a nice alliteration but haitians had nothing to do with hemophelia or activism in homosexuality there is no genetic coding in haitians that make them susceptible to aids or makes them have aids mdrq than any other nation in the world you are not only slandering a country it is historically inaccurate and you are causing a terrible social problem for every decent haitian whether they are naturalized american citizens or not and he said well congressman what is the answer i said are you broadcasting from new york this week he said yes i said check it out check it in the homosexual community in new york new york homosexual activists have discovered haiti as a vacation port of call they took aids to haiti and when health people interviewed haitians and i know of what i speak dan because i am a loyal catholic people of french catholic culture when asked if they took money for homosexual services they deny it so every haitian whether he is into voodoo or practicing catholic or some protestant faith will say i have had no homosexual contact so you think it is something genetic i said dan it is new york hoinosexuals taking it to haiti and it spread in that country because they are impoverished and when tourists come down there with a lot of money it breaks down peoples moral ethos h 10000 cc and he said congressman i am going to check it out get

culmination of his fears a bloated and ineffective mass that stretches itsconstitutional authority to the limit how bad is it this year with the introduction of his budget bill clinton claimed his administrations policies had solved the budget crisis his director of omb leon panetta stated that republicans would have killed to be able to offer this budget and we have been exposed to democrat after democrat crowing about the strength of the economy and their success at cutting the deficit what were they all cheering about according to clintons budget the deficit will fall to 175 billion next year then it will rise to 182 billion in 1997 256 billion in 2001 and 365 billion in 2004 in washington this is considered success obviously something stronger is needed despite these awesome numbers some groups still oppose the balanced budget amendment first they fear a balanced budget amendment will tie the hands of congress and force it to cut some programs in order to fund others in other words they fear that congress will have set priorities and stick with them that is not an argument against a balanced budget amendment its an argument for it if special interest groups object to the balanced budget amendment because it would restrict congress ability to spend and make the budget process less flexible lets pass it quickly unrestricted flexible spending is what created the deficit in the first place second there are those groups who question the effectiveness of a balanced budget amendment they claim it is just a feelgood measure which will fail to reduce the deficit and will add lots of unnecessary detail to the constitution someone should get the opponents of the amendment together and let them know their arguments contradict each other which is it will the

have to make the spending decisions but it will be done without the openended funding option now available this is the third time in the last 4 years the house will vote on a balanced budget amendment
