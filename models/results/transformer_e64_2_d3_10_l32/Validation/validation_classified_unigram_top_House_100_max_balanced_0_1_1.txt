francisco at a commemoration a memorial tribute to one of the great people of the house sala burton basically what i said was that to me sala burton had the glamour of a marlene deitrich and the heart and good will of a mother teresa and the political savvy of a golda meir if anyone read the congressio al record when my distin guished colleague mr edwards dean of the california delegation introduced the privilege resolution they would know the overwhelming expression of grief and love for sala she was really a mother a sister and a friend to all of us she cared in a very special way for people she really did love her roots her family her country the congress and she had a real affectionthose callfornians stick togetherfor the california delegation she certainly loved san francisco she was extremely proud to represent and it was americas perfect city with its great diversity of people she meant very very much to the wives of the members of course she was the cofounder of the congressional wives task force and always reached out to make them feel a part of congress sala often told me of the pride and love she had for her daughter and her soninlaw and her grandchildren she admired her daughters abilities and independence her parents meant very very much to her her mother still is living god bless her and she had a marvelous impression from her parents she often talked about her fathers brilliance and her mothers common sense and their interest in current affairs she was very proud of her brotherinlaw john and believed he had tremendous values as did her husband and values that are known in california indeed nationally as the great burton tradition she was proud of johns personal courage as well and proud of her brotherinlaw bob as well she was very very proud of her brother and her nephew tom who was so gracious to so many of us during salas illness i want to say this about her staff she felt that they were an extended part of her family and they ought to know how much affection sala had for them and how much it meant to her that they carried on during her illness so in a very special way all of us can claim sala in a very real way of course she loved her beloved phillip as she would say you could not talk to her for any length of time without knowing of the respect and love she had for her husband she quoted him often she felt even after he died that she was an extension of him but sala in her own right was a magnificent congresswoman and a very savvy politician she was intensely political and long before she became a congresswoman she served her political apprenticeship she traced her interest to her childhood in prewar poland she said i saw and felt what happened n western europe when the nazis were moving you learn politics is everybodys business she had instant clout in the house when we look at her assignments we see that she was practically hmmedlately after a term of being here assigned to the prestigious committee the committee on rules she was a delegate to the north atlantic assembly where 60 parliamentarians from nato elected her vice chair of the political committee last spring in luxembourg i saw her chair the committee and i saw the love and esteem of our allies and our fellow and sister parliamentarians who really thought that she was so outstanding she knew how to get things done one can recall the many instances in which sala did in fact buttonhole her friends i said in san francisco that she buttonholed the men in congress by flicking the lint from their lapels rather than twisting their arms her style was different from phils to say the least but it was equally as effective so how do we accept her death one of the things that sala was most proud of really was her jewish background so i quoted from the mourners kaddish in which there are a line or two that indicate that thru the long centuries and this is a quote from that beautiful prayer thru the long centuries we have learned to rise in the face of every storm out of the abyss of anguish on the ashes of every destruction to praise gods name to maintain a stance of human dignity and to affirm our consecration to the task of life that was her goal life was so important to her and she was consecrated to this the wednesday before salas death i had the great privilege of visiting her along with senator alan cranston and my friend and colleague the gentleman from california don edwands and at the end i whispered a few words to sala and she said to me and the last words she said to me were tell everyone i think of them and love them and she said goodbye mary rosewell talk which was a common expression of saas we will talk about salafor we will think of her legacy and her values that wonderful burton tradition we know that already there have been a number of things that people are proposing to name after her such as the sala burton maritime museum which of course was part of her legislation to have that funded properly and the gentleman from arizona mr mo udall did change the name in the legislation naming it after her one of the things that i would like to suggest i have introduced a bill that would allow the staff and people who work on the hill to have access to a daycare center and that has been passed i think that it would really be an honor for me to know that my legislation somehowand the gentlewoman from colorado mrs pat schroeder is the one who suggested it and i think it is a great ideato somehow dedicate that daycare center to the memory of our friend sala burton so we accept her death in the sense of alfred lord tennyson when he recalled in his wonderful poem in memoriam when he had the death of one of his dear friends thrust upon him and he was wondering how he could accept this great tragedy one of the lines that he uttered then and which is recorded for all of us immortally is something that consoles me very much when i think of her and that is ris better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all we all loved sala burton and we will talk to her many many times"], [0.0024064183235168457, 0.9975935816764832, 1, "i rise

today haiti today once again stands at a crossroads after 2v tumultuous years the haitian people have again gotten back to the point where they may be able to break with the past a past market by repression cruelty and corruption after the downfall of duvalier the people of the united states proved their willingness to help the haitian people in their struggle for economic development and social justice today we stand ready to help again once we know that the hand of tyranny has again been truly thrown off and we are certain that the will of the haitian people will not again be thwarted make no mistake about it this congress likes what it hears general avril saying with the support of the noncommissioned officers and the haitian army general avril and those supporting him have stated their desire to return haiti to the path toward democracy he has reached out beyond the army to involve the opposition leadership and other key groups in a national dialog and that is an important step toward national reconciliation we like what has been done with the removal from office some of the most notorious defenders of the old order determined to halt a transition to democracy the last few weeks have seemingly brought about an almost unbelievable transformation where there was despair there now is hope but we in the united states have learned through harsh experience that the performance of haitis leaders seldom has reflected their democratic rhetoric while we hope and pray that the apparent alignment of the haitian army with the desires of the haitian people will bring a new day united states policy must be based on reality and not expectations if we are to again provide large amounts of assistance to haiti it must be on the basis of haitian government performance toward achieving the goals of liberty justice and prosperity laid down by the haitian people in the constitution they approved overwhelmingly in 1987 general avril has spoken well of democracy but without free open and fair elections there is no democracy it is to be hoped that the new government of haiti will promptly set a date for elections in the not too distant future and that it will establish an electoral process that will have the respect and support of the haitian people the concurrent resolution before us today is offered neither in a spirit of concession or confrontation the resolution sets forth clearly and simply the sense of congress with respect to those goals to which we deem the haitian government must be committed if in behalf of the american people the congress is ever to approve providing assistance to the haitian government today no such assistance is provided it is forbidden by the appropriations law just enacted while assistance to the haitian people continues through private voluntary organizations this resolution would make explicit the intent of congress that aid to the haitian government not be resumed until and unless the government of haiti has taken clear and decisive actions to acheive certain specified goals these are not washingtons goals but goals repeatedly called for by the haitian people themselves what are the steps we expect the haitian government to take to embark on a credible transition to democracy based on the 1937 constitution and announcement of an election date to respect human and civil rights to reform the corrupt bureaucracy to promote economic development and to assure the personal security and right to assembly essential to grassroots development to step up cooperation with us on narcotics trafficking and to demonstrate the militarys willingness to accept civilian rule and to abide by haitis constitution section 2 of the resolution provides that it is further the sense of congress that we not have a regular and sustained assistance relationship with the government until a civilian government has been elected through free and open elections and further provides that no assistance should be given until after there have been full consultations with the congress by the executive branch sectioti 3 of the resolution declares congress support for the aspirations of the haitian people for an elected civilian government and for economic government and urges appropriate committees of congress to take whatever actions they deem appropriate to promote free elections either through positive steps such as assistance or through the enactment of economic sanctions such as those now pending in h r 4152 if progress is not made toward free elections section 4 of the resolution calls on the executive branch to work with our friends and allies to shape a multilateral policy toward haiti this resolution enacts no sanctions it lifts none it is offered at a time of hope and expectation as an expression of our willingness to work with haiti to achieve a democratic and effective government based on values shared by the haitian and american peoples i am confident that if progress in haiti is reflected by concrete actions the congress will give high priority next year to reviewing existing aid restrictions and especially to assure appropriate financial support

to the proposed amendment this amenldment is nothinm more than a raw naked attempt to take jobs from the district of coluniilia under the thinly veiled guise of promol ing the federal interest over the past several weeks we have been saturated by a carefully designed strategically executed program of disinformation misinformation half truths and whole lies aimed at convincing the public and the congress that crime will bedeterred and public safety improved if persons from virginia and maryland are hired as police firefighters and teachers by our local government before addressing the many myths put forth by the proponents of this amendment i wish to share with my colleagues a bit of background about the d c residency law the district of colunbia like many other state and local governments enacted in 1980 a law requiring that new employees of the government must move into the district within a reasonable period of time in order to work here a person do s not have to live in washington dc to get a job here but if a person chooses to work for the district government that person must become a district resi lent persons who were employed by the district prior to enpctment of the law are grandfathered that is they are not required to become residents and once a person is employed that person has up to 180 days to move into the district tie law is more than reasonable and is being updated constantly for example there is proposed legislatlon to amend tei law lo provide for an exemption from the residency requirement for narried couples the residency rcquirement according to wellestablished law through a string of cases in federal and state courts over the past half ceatury is a reasonable and rational local legislative option moreover there is widespread useof residency laws approximately 70 percent of cithis with populations of 250 000 or more have some form of residency la let me now deal with the myths that have been asserted by those who seek to elininate the districts residency law our colleague mr parris has stated tie district keep s lowering the requirements and the training standards 1 0 until they get enough bodies in addition the educational requirements have been eroded that is a myth it is misinformation the reality is that hiring standards for police officers are as high or higher than they were prior to enactment of the residency law before the law there was an 80item test today there is a 100item test and the number of applicants who pass now is only slightly higher than the number who passed prior to 1980 and with regard to the training program before the law the police academy consumed 17 weeks today the training program extends over a 22 week period i would suggest to the opponents of the d c residency law that if district residents are not qualified to be police officers and firefighters why is it that surrounding jurisdictions have an aggressive campaign to recruit them for comparable positions in their governments offering in some instances attractive incentives referring to the applicant pool for various d c law enforcement and public safety positions mr paarys has stated if they cannot find anybody to take the job they just exempt them from the residency requirement 9 0 that is a myth the realily is that for police and firefighters over the past 5 years i he district has had at least 10 applicants for every available position mr paiwis has further stated 0 there are 300 different categories of exeml tlons of people who are already exempeh from tle residency requirement that too is a myth ti reality is that there are only four categories of exemptions allowed by the d c residency law and each is very reasonable among the categories of exemptions is one for hardtofill positions a very common exemption anld one for positions in facilities outside the boundaries of washincton dc eighly percent of the exempted persons and 90 percent of the exempt ed positions are for jobs in district facilitles located in virginia or maryland rhoe 4 415 jobs are paid for by district taxl ayers for the benefit of virginia and maryland and none of the persons who fill those positions pay i cent in district income tax and yet the proponents of this amendment wont more the writer cicero would ask to whose profit the reality is that this attemptedl job grab by proponents of this amendmient wholly overlooks the fact that the district has the highest unernployment rate among all jurisdictions in the washington metropolitan area the districts unemployment rate is twice that of prince georges and montgomery counties and three times that of fairfax county prince georges county has seven times more residents working for the d c govern mejnt than there are d c residents working for the prince georges county government in 1987 538 million was paid in wages from the district government to maryland residents while 118 million was paid to virginia residents this matter of residency is a breadandbutter issue going to the very heart of the districts economic base the amendment proposed puts at risk some 14 000 jobs and 300 million in additional income and indirect spending the

chairman of the subcommittee on coast guard and navtgation i am today introducing legislation that will clarify use of the coast guard auxiliary and the commercial towing industry for nonemergency towing of recreational boats in distress joining me as original cosponsors of this legislation are the gentleman from north carolina chairman of the committee on merchant marine and fisheries the gentleman from michigan ranking minority member of both the committee on merchant marine and fisheries and the subcommittee on coast guard and navigation the gentleman from alaska the gentleman from delaware and the gentleman from new york this bill would amend section 88 of title 14 united states code by requiring the commandant to make full use of all available resources including the coast guaid auxiliary and commercial towing firms whose captains are fully licensed by the secretary of transportation in rendering aid in nonemergency cases historically americans are a generous people who are willing to assist others by giving of their time through voluntary organizations since congress authorized establishmont of the coast guard auxiliary in 1939 volunteer members of the auxiliary have been ready and willing to assist fellow boaters in distress in fact in a recent survey of current and former auxiliary members an overwhelming majority of respondents stated that the desire to help others was one of the most important reasons they had joined the auxiliary this desire to help others is the essence of the many successful volunteer organizations in our nation today for nearly 50 years auxiliarists have been doing just thathelping others by teaching boating safety courses providing courtesy marine examinations and of course assisting disabled boaters the coast guard auxiliary is one of the most effective volunteer organizations in our nation and it should be fully utilized to enhance the safety of the estimated 70 million americans who enjoy boating in 1984 the grace commission report on privatization stated that the commercial towing industry should be utilized in nonemergency cases however it also recognized the value of the auxiliary to avoid duplication of effort the grace commission utilized among others the findings of a january 1983 report by the national advisory committee on oceans and atmosphere nacoaj incorporated into the grace commission report is the following statement from the nacoa report in nonemergency cases the coast guard watehbstnnders can send auxiliary vessels when available and otherwise contact private towing interests the administration changed the coast guard towing policy in 1983 by requiring the coast guard to refer calls for assistance in nonemorgency situations to qualified commercial towers when such operators are ready and willing to respond this policy was based on 1982 legislation that required the commandant to review policies and procedures for towing and salvage of disabled vessels in order to further minimize the possibility of coast guard interference with private towing activities when thnt language was approved it was not the intent of the merchant marine and fisheries committee for the auxiliary to be excluded from nonemergency towing however because the coast guard considers the auxiliary to be subject to the same rules as active coast guard units the towing policy has been interpreted to also preclude volunteers in the auxiliary from responding to nonemergency assistance cases when a qualified commercial tower is available many commercial towers are in business because of that policl change i firmly believe that there is enough work out there for everyone and this bill reaches an accommodation that permits use of the auxiliary as well as commercial towers in providing nonomergency assistance to recreational boaters the subcommittee on coast guard and navigation held a hearing on this issue in april that hearing brought to the forefront a number of problems with the coast guard towing policy recreational boaters expressed a deep concern for their safety under this policy disabled boaters are more concerned with the quick appearance of qualified aid than with what form it takes the coast guard should be able to use all available resources including good samaritans commercial towers and the auxiliary to assist distressed boaters on the water the administration recently issued a clarification of the nonemergency towing policy in response to the problems identified at a series of public hearings conducted by the coast guard around the country the many letters received from concerned boaters towers and auxillarists and the concerns of congress this was a good first step however the amended policy gives commercial towing firms priority to respond to nonemergency cases rather than seeking a balance between the private sector and voluntarism i recently received a letter from national commodore william harr ol the auxiliary expressing the auxiliarys deep disappointment in the new policy i ask that commodore harrs letter be submitted for the record i believe this legislation is necessary to clarify in law the responsibilities of the coast guard in the utilization of all resources to properly protect property and lives of american citizens on the water unitedstates coast guard auxiiny lion ear hutto chairnnan subcovinrittee on coast guard ond narigation u s house of represcntotthis washington dc dfar chairman itflito the coast guard auxiliary is decply disappointed that the cowst guard nonemeruericy assistance policy wllo not hanged to remedy either of the two basic problems with the old policy public safety and auxiliary morale the amended policy just issued gives commercial towers the priority to respond to marine assistance radio broadcasts marb by the coast guard in nonemergency cases and gives commercial towers a full hour to reach the distress scene an auxiliary vessel on patrol which is either already on scene or only a few minutes away cannot assist the distressed recreational boater unless the marb is not answered by a commercial tower or until the tower fails to reach the scene one hour later any time a small boat loses propulsion or steering an emergency exists thus the amended policy continues to leave the distressed vessel in a situation which may quickly worsen even though help could be provided sooner by the auxiliary as a practical matter in most areas giving the commercial tower a full hour to reach the scene before dispatching auxiliary assistance is tantamount to giving the coinmercial tower the exclusive right to handle all nonemergency cases this means that our auxiliarists who have trained long and hard and who have committed their time elfort and vessels are effectively deprived of the very mission which they joined the auxiliary to 15rform and the mission which sparks their continuing effort and interest i have discussed the new policy with my district commodores all over the country and they confirm my own opinion which i stated in my previous testimony our people will not continue to commit their time boats and effort when they perceive they arent needed or wanted our leaders have held our operations capabilities together for a long time with promises of relief the amended policy will probably spell the end of our ability to do this i should also emphasize that the people nnd the boats we will lose because they cannot perform nonemergency missions are the same people and boats which perform emergency search and rescue and a whole variety of other important operation tasks for example port security pollution detection logistics for the regular coast guard passive surveillance in support of law enforcement assisting in training regulars for maritime defense etc all of these additional operations capabilities free up regular coast goard facilities to perform higher priority missions which they are stretched to handle under present budgetary rertralnts in summary i appeal to the committee to take the fastest possible effective action to resolve the public safety and auxiliary morale problems

of advising or notifying the american public of what has really happened to this countrys industrial base the book is written by marvin j wolf an author living in los angeles ca and on the front cover it says the plot to dominate industry worldwide and how to deal with it over these several days we have discussed how the japanese ministry of international trade and industry together with the japanese manufacturers had targeted various industries in this in order to destory them one of them being steel the other electronics all of which involve the television sets and how much of it was done by double invoicing and by setting prices by the tenth day group the okura group and the palace kgroup all of whom connived and conspired to set the prices in the united states to dump television sets in thistcountry at very low prices while keeping the prices at home at almost double and how the double invoicing was accomplished to fool the unitedstates customs so that these products could come in here at a much lower price and be sold here in connection with my efforts to keep the american public advised on what has really happened and how the destruction of our industrial base was not as much from lack of productivity or the american worker not being a good worker but on an international conspiracy i received a letter from a company in minnesota i am from maryland and this company is writing to me from minnesota and the name of the company is lake center industries and it is from the president and general manager of that company what he says in this letter really supports what we have read in this book it says dean representative bentley im writing to you as the president of a mediumsized fortyyear old original equipment auto parts manufacturer oem and on behalf of our 1 850 dedicated quality conscious employees in minnesota wisconsin ohio and michigan our problem is that after two years of concerted effort we are unable to generate any interest in our products e g turn signal head lamp and wiper switches and heater and air conditioning controls to the japanese car manufacturers located either in the unitedstates or japan meanwhile approximately 150 transplanted japanese auto parts manufacturers are not only exclusively enjoying all of their countrymens business but an everincreasing portion of the unitedstates auto parts business as well predictions are that by 1190 the japanese will export two and a half million cars to the unitedstates and manufacture another two and a half million in the unitedstates based on a ten million carperyear market this will most certainly lead to the closing of even more unitedstates owned auto plants further eroding our business over the pat two years we have attempted to penetrate the japanese car market both here ard in japan our people recently returned from our second extensive trip to japan and our first to korea and are even more disillusioned and frustrated than before we have made sales calls on the japanese auto manufacturers both in the unitedstates and japan and weve investigated joint ventures with other japanese part suppliers but with no success unitedstates based japanese car manufacturing purchasing people have often treated our people rudely or unprofessionally and were uninterested in what our company could do for them in japan our people were treated somewhat better by members of jama japan automobile manufacturers association however theyre being protected by such groups as miti ministry of international trade and industry and they miti were openly arrogant and abrasive and inferred that american companies and products are inferior unitedstates government assistance and representation on our behalf has proven to be inad equate my suggestion would be to have the unitedstates department of commerce pick someone with extensive automotive manufacturing knowledge to represent the unitedstates in these matters our experience to date suggests the people repeesenting us are inadequately informed to deal with their foreign counterparts i think i can attest to that because when unfortunately the department of commerce people were going to negotiate with the government of japans people last fall on auto part imports it was very obvious that our people the employees of the department of commerce were not very well versed on the auto parts business mr keller goes on to say we are not asking for protectionism but were definitely forced to compete against it abroad and against favoritism shown to japanese automobile parts suppliers by unitedstatesbased japanese car manufacturers it would appear our open arms foreign investment policy is going to cost us ownership of a major portion of our industry many states are offering free land and extensive tax incentives in order to entice the japanese supplior base to locate in their states this is happening at an alarming rate and it is predicated that 200 additional japanese auto parts manufacturers will locate to the unitedstates by 1990 because of the favoritism shown to japanese auto parts suppliers by the japanese car manufacturers they will thrive in the unitedstates and because of size and financial strengths they will soon own a major share of the unitedstates auto parts supply business we realize that our company has little impact on the overall economic well being of the country but we know we are only one of several hundred unitedstates companies that are being similarly affected we can ignore the problem or blame unitedstates industry but the ultimate problem will become a loss of size and strength of unitedstates industry as we know it we would like to know what you as an individual and government in general are doing to address this most serious problem we want to know if anything is being done on our lhalf to ensure the future of americanowned industry and auto parts suppliers in particular i receive countless requests from our employees and the local media as to what we are doing to assure our continued success and i would appreciate a personal response from you to share with them to receive a letter like that at a time when i hear that our conference committee on the trade bill is decimating that bill is literally wiping out any requirements of our trading partners to open up their doors to our people really disturbs me a great deal i have to wonder just where the lobbying dollars that we have heard about that japan is spending in this area 50 million by the government and the industries every year 60 million right now by toshiba apd another 30 million by the unitedstates companies that use toshiba products what is happening how effective has that lobbying money been i am very disurbed when i see and hear about companies like that of mr keller american companies cannot survive because we have opened our doors totally to tinybody who wants to come in but we do not require trade in return open doors in return we do not require fair trade in the book the japanese conspiracy and i have referred to this already but i am going to repeat it in view of mr kellers letter he talks about the auto parts and here is what he had to say japans protectionist policy which insures the basic strength of its domestic industries against fair competition while it assaults foreign markets with its exports is not an ad hoc program it has been carefully orchestrated by miti which by persuasion and arm twisting manipulates japans import and export strategy down to the behavior of customs officials we enable the japanese to bring in everything they want when they dont even give us the right of entry said charles l nicolosi sn analyst in the new york offices of dean witter reynolds as the worlds leading manufacturer of automobiles for example japan sells millions of its cars in the unitedstates and europe but imports few before a car is shipped to the united states each japanese manufacturer certifies that it meets unitedstates product and safety standards america accepts its certifications and freely admits the japanese imports but the japanese view every import into their market as currency lost in the war of trade balances in a guerrilla war of harassment certifications by foreign manufacturers are disregarded by japanese customs every car every baseball bat every foreign product attempting entry to japan is subject to elaborate testing and those not meeting standards must be reworked to meet them before entry is allowed the handful of unitedstates cars imported in japan are sometimes virtually rebuilt in yokohama harbor before leaving the japanese customs area a cost born by the importer this verifies this supports what mr keller was trying to point out is happening to american manufacturers to american goods in the second chapter of the japanese conspiracy i have read three other segments and the second chapter is entitled green tea and dirty tricks in that chapter it points out again and i will repeat how the tenth day group the okura group the palace group got together with miti and targeted the electronics industry and the steel industry and others let us hear about typewriters mr wolf points out that one of the most attractive targets for classic japanese marketing techniques has been the portable typewriter in 1973 there were four american manufacturers of portable electric typewriters employing some 25 000 people shortly after the japanese targeted this market in 1974 unitedstates treasury department officials ruled that japanese portable typewriters were being sold at less than fair market value but the following year the itc ruled that smithcorona which had brought the complaint had not been injured by the dumping between 1976 and 1978 japanesemade portables doubled in annual volume to 500 000 and in 1979 sears roebuck dropped smithcorona as its principal supplier in favor of japanese firms in 1980 the commerce department finally agreed that scm had been injured and set antidumping tariffs of between 36 5 percent and 48 7 percent following that brother and silver seiko two leading japanese typewriter makers appealed the commerce decision claiming to have since raised their prices to competitive levels in august commerce lowered the tariffs to between 4 3 percent and 14 9 percent smithcorona appealed so did japan claiming there should be no dumping tariffs at all annual imports of japanese typewriters into the unitedstates grew from 144 000 in 1971 to 603 00 in 1981 between 1973 and 1980 the western competition olympia royal and underwood were forced were forced mr wolf says to buy or assemble their typewriters in japan taiwan and other countries it had taken the unitedstates government 5 irreplaceable years to decide that scm was being injured but by that time it was too late 21 000 american jobs were permanently lost another chapter in how this conspiracy overseas helped to destroy an american industry i shall

importantly because judge stevens has demonstrated that his legal opinions on womens issues are based on an apparentpersonal philosophy and not on the facts and laws of the cases before him

rights groups against a supremecourt nominee prevailed much to ournations regret in 1930 president hoover nominated chief judge john j parker of the unitedstates court of appeals for the fourth

carolina for many years and an outstanding jurist who fell victim to the sustained opposition of the american federation of labor and the national association for the advancement of colored people parker was rejected by the senate 41 to 39 but abrahams commentary explains the irony of the rejection the n a a c p contended that the nomifnee was generally opposed to black partici pation in politics and especially to black suffrage thus walter white of the n a a c p leadership pointed out that judge parker while stumping north carolina as a gubernatbrial candidate in 1920 had indeed made

order signed by president hoover ina turbulent time the campaign that would lead to roosevelts election was just getting underway the terror of economic dissolution was palpable indeed on the day hoover signed the bill the angry remnants of what had been 17 000 members of the bonus armys world war i veterans were camped in washington the house had passed the patman bonus bill less than a month before only to see it defeated in the senate most of the veterans left washington but on july 22 there were still about 2 000 angry and desperate veterans in washington only 6 days after signing the home loan bank act hoover ordered the army to remove the veterans by force in an infamous act troops led by douglas macarthur in whose train was dwight eisenhower evicted the bonus army and burned its camp that was the climate that existed when this country took its first halting steps toward a national housing policy franklin d roosevelt announced the new deal in his nomination acceptance speech less than a month before hoover signed the law creating the federal home loan bank system interestingly enough his new deal platform did not include specific reference to housing it was a program for economic reform designed to bring some order out of the chaos of banking and securities restore some confidence and encourage states to create what later became the social security system in mid1932 when the new deal speech was written the full magnitude of the great depression was still developing needless to say the home loan bank act could not by itself do what needed to be done to house the poor let alone make home ownership possible for the great majority who were at the time tenants less than 40 percent of americans owned their homes then and many who did lost them in the depression in the chaos of the depression it represented little more than a faint flicker of hope when franklin d roosevelt became president in march 1933 he faced utter chaos nothingnot farms not banks not industrieswas working cities and towns had run out of money to feed and clothe the growing army of desperate people thrown out of work and off their farms you must remember that at that time america was mostly rural in that disastrous time urgent action had to be taken and it was within 100 days an incredible amount of legislation was enacted to restore order and begin finding the way to recovery among those acts was a relief program for homeowners the home owners refinancing act signed june 13 1933 this emergency relief act was the second great step toward a national housing program the refinancing act created a corporation capitalized by 200 million to refinance the mortgages of hardpressed homeowners a few months later in april 1934 an additional 1 billion in capital went into the corporation it did more than refinance mortgages the corporation could advance money to pay back taxes and provide for repairs and maintenance these cash advances could be for as much as 50 percent of the appraised value of the loan the whole thing being secured by the value of the property the home owners loan corporation remained in business for only 4 years but in that time it had made loans covering more than 1 million mortgages and it produced a profit fifty years later with the country in a recession as deep as any seen since 1933 notwithstanding to the contrary what we heard a few minutes ago i offered a bill to provide emergency help to hardpressed homeowmers and we called it that the emergency homeowners assistance act in colorado for instance in the city of pueblo where the steel mill was shutting down the sole source of employment the foreclosure rate on homes was 100 a month at that time i took the floor and asked this house to approve the homeowners emergency assistance act the house did indeed pass it the one and the only what my minority members called a new program that has been approved by the house under the reagan administration that is since 1981 it languished in the senate and it died in the senate a senate that in 6 years never once even had so much as a hearing on housing needs or community development needs of our country the senate proposed to do nothing and my proposal did nothing radically more than essentially what we had seen and i had witnessed during the depression in the homeowners loan corporation in fact did the research work on that bill myself and with the able help of the staff and counsel we reshaped it in terms of modern needs all it would do would be the same thing make loans against home equity to prevent those homes from being foreclosed ironically not too long in fact less than a year and a half after that in my home town of san antonio when i walked the line of about 203 fellow americans destitute homeless waiting to make their entry into the homeless shelter that had been provided them by the city i talked to one young relatively young because i consider anybody under 40 very young homeless father of two who had lost his home in pueblo co and had we enacted that program that i had envisioned he would have been enabled to have been assisted and to have remained under the roof and the shelter of his home instead of having to park his wife and kids with his parents in another state and wander through the south thinking that perhaps in the south he could find employment and come to a city such as san antonio where indeed the need was just as great as the city that he left i have never been able to understand why this simple humane eminently workable ideawas so adamantly opposed by the administration why it was willing to let so many thousands of people needlessly suffer the loss of their homes when hundreds of thousands could have been helped at virtually no real cost or risk to the government why not extend help to people who are suffering economic disaster through no fault of their own as a result of forces they cannot control it made sense in 1933 and it should make sense today a little more than a year after the home owners loan corporation bill was signed the national housing act of 1934 became law this law was truly monumental it brought up the capital of the home owners loan corporation to 3 billion but more than that this was the law establishing the federal housing administration at this point i want to render tribute to a man who passed on just last month on august 9 the great leon keyserling and i want to render testimony that it was his architectural hand his designing hand that devised the basic 1934 and 1937 national housing act and whose friendship and counsel i never dreamed i would be able to enjoy years later after those miserable dim days that i recall vividly because i am a depression kid and i was in school at the time and would enjoy his great wisdom and would have shared his last supper literally because he died 4 days after i had enjoyed an invitation to supper at his home here in washington leon keyserling actually is a man that i hope we can memorialize in a more lasting and meaningful way when the time comes but his real monument has been etched into these great acts of humanitarian legislation for he was the architect and the counsel and lawyer that devised and structured the basic fundamental framework of reference for this noteworthy legislation the fha became the engine of housing and home ownership as a matter of fact the miracle of the world in the 20th century was performed here in america because between 1940 and 1980 we reversed where a minority of american families owned their homes to a percentage increase of the overwhelming majority by 1980 the sad thing is that since 1980 we have had an increase in the emergence of this phenomena of modernday homelessness which is in epidemic proportions and for which this congress has passed emergency legislation just this year and all because there is cause and effect you cannot turn back on the basic commitment to housing and the allocation of national credit for construction of affordable housing affordable to the main mass and stream of our families today the average cost of a new singlefamily dwelling unit in the united states is over 175 000 that means that we have priced out all but 6 percent of americans from the dream of owning a brandnew singlefamily dwelling unit for their loved ones it was the fha through its system of mortgage insurance that made home loans a low risk proposition and made it possible for lenders to extend the longterm fixed rate mortgage that was the cornerstone the inspiration and the motivation of mass home ownership in this country under fha tens of millions of people have obtained home loans it has turned a profit its property standards insured a consistent quality of housing and its operations remain at the heart of home ownership in this country today since the national housing act of 1934 home ownership has become the rule not the exception no longer do twothirds of americans rent though we are in a period of regression and headed back to that twothirds live in their own homes thanks to these programs through fha the affordable mortgage became a reality and with it the affordable home the sensation of 1937 was president roosevelts famous fight to transform the supreme court by increasing the number of justices that is the old supreme court vehemently opposed packing charges the president was accused of trying to pack the supreme court in order to have a patsy supreme court which would give him the opportunity to pack the court with justices he believed would not overturn as the conservative court had his industrial recovery act the court fight made the bork case seem utterly tame it mesmerized the country from february to july but the great court fight was not all that was going on that year on september 1 the capstone national housing act of 1937 became law by 1937 the banking system was stable there was deposit insurance the refinancing programs for homes and farms had stemmed loan losses and the home loan bank system was in place the fha had begun its work what remained was to deal with slum clearance and to try and provide decent housing to the millions who could in no way afford to pay market rents the 1937 housing act created the unitedstates housing authority which was empbwered to make 60year loans to local housing agencies the local agencies had to put up 10 percent of the cost of clearing slums and erecting housing projects the authority had the power to grant operating subsidies so that rents could be geared to the incomes of poor families that basic mechanism remains in place to this very day what an honor to be able to rise at the end of this month to memorialize the congress on the fact that on the first day of this month exactly 50 years ago in this month of september the 1937 basic housing act was approved that in that day and time the congresses and their presidents did in fact have faith and confidence in the average american family in the faith that with just a bit of help it could be tided over in dire circumstances over which it had no control that not only would those loans made then under those conditions be repaid but that they would earn a profit to the treasury of the united states as indeed those programs did within a few years slum clearance could be seen and felt within 4 years the unitedstates housing authority had helped create 511 new housing projects for lowincome families with more than 161 000 units in the 50 years since enactment of the landmark 1937 housing act this government has expanded the assisted housing stock to some 4 million units about half of which are publicly owned today we still have in place in being and in operation the same basic housing tools that were created during the cataclysmic years between mid 1932 and mid1937 those tools were revolutionary in their concept and in their effect before this nation set out on what became a bipartisan commitment to a comprehensive housing policy a full third of our people lived in poor sometimes inhuman conditions today the proportion of people in substandard housing is perhaps 10 percent this reflects a monumental achievement and yet the need should not be that great its 5 percent more than 1980 nor would the need remain so great had not the present administration elected to withdraw from housing as far as it could in 1982 the administration even tried to eliminate mortgage insurance for most people it has managed to virtually stop construction of publicly owned housing units it has managed to prevent enactment of an emergency homeowners assistance program but it has failed to kill housing it has failed to stop enactment of this nations first effective emergency shelter program for homeless people and it has failed to prevent members of its party from joining in this years effort to reassert and begin to revitalize the comprehensive housing program that came into being with the housing act of 1937 the nations commitment to a decent and affordable home for every citizen has been fiercely advocated and honestly administered by a small dedicated extremely proficient corps of public servantsvisionaries and practical administrators innovators and financiers regulators and politicians it has worked it works still and after 50 years the dream is as alive as ever after 50 years we still have not reached the goal of a decent safe and affordable home for every americanbut we have come a long way the nation has been transformed the remaining task can be doneand it will be"], [0.9821552038192749, 0.9821552038192749, 0, "i rise in support of h r 2677 title i of this legislation passed this body earlier this year in nearly the same form as it is before us today differences over the standards by which the secretary may decline to take action have been resolved title ii contains several amendments considered by the house authorizing committees and passed by the senate two of these amendments are of particular importance in my state section 207 of this bill is simllar to h r 4834 legislation which i introduced to authorize alaska native villages and certain oklahoma indian tribes to be eligible for waste treatment grants under the clean water act enactment of this section will allow the necessary waste treatment planning to be done in rural alaska for years to come the amendment would correct a technical error made in the last reauthorization of the clean water act in which alaska native villages were inadvertently omitted from authorization for grants under the act previously both alaska villages and former reservations in oklahoma were eligible for treatment as indian tribes passage of this legislation will correct the error and help to meet the waste treatment needs of these remote communities further section 217 of this bill will provide for a clarification of federal escrow laws pertaining to funds received while lands were being transferred to alaska native corporations pursuant to the alaska native claims settlement act the amendment provides that receipt of proceeds from the sale of wildlife resources is included within the resource categories intended to be deposited into the alaska native escrow fund in july the senate added language to the interior departments appropriations bill that was intended to resolve ambiguity over the longstanding pribilof island alaska native escrow account claim conferees on that measure chose to substitute detailed report language resolving that ambiguity despite their efforts the claim remains unresolved as originally enacted on january 2 1976 the alaska native escrow law provided authority for the government to divert to an escrow account its receipts derived from resources of lands that would pass to natives under the alaska native claims settlement act during the protracted period between the ancsa withdrawals in 1971 and conveyance the government had authority to continue its various revenue generating activities on lands that had been withdrawn for native selection the government was not trespassing at that pointit still owned the land which was in the process of being conveyed to the relevant native corporation the government had authority to collect these receipts under such programs as the mineral leasing act the fur seal act and the laws regarding timber sales in the national forests congress determined that keeping the proceeds was unfair to alaska natives since the government had received its part of the ancsa settlement bargain effective december 18 1971 in fact if the government could have kept the proceeds from withdrawn lands prior to conveyance it would have had a considerable economic incentive to further slow the conveyance process so the escrow account statutes were enacted to direct the proceeds to the native corporation that ultimately received the withdrawn lands much of the land withdrawn for native solection and conveyance had been withdrawn previously for mineral entry wildlife protection forests et cetera congress directed the government to retain in federal ownership within ancsa withdrawals only the smallest practicable tracts necessary for its various purposes the native escrow statutes provide that revenues from lands not so retained would be escrowed various federal agencies over the years have opposed this section 3 e limitation on their interests but in a variety of contexts over the years the department and congress have consistently refused to permit the agencies to limit native property rights arising outside the section 3 e boundaries true in native conveyances federal agencies often retained easements or other access rights over nonsection 3 o lands conveyed but that is irrelevant to the operation of the escrow laws which deal with the period prior to conveyances moreover in cases such as the pribilofs timber sales or the kenai gas field resources were taken extracted or severed a wholly different activity than an access right or easement the escrow fund amendment contained in this legislation definitively states that regardless of any residual access or management rights it may have held reserved or retained pursuant to the fur seal act of 1966 as amended prior to or subsequent to conveyance of lands to the two pribilof village corporations the government did not have authority prior to or subsequent to conveyance to take seals from lands conveyed to the pribilof native village corporation pursuant to ancsa without escrowing the proceeds derived from the harvested seals as enunciated in the statement of managers for the fiscal year 1989 interior appropriations bill the proceeds received by the federal government from its sale of pelts taken from native corporation lands shall be the measure of the principal amount placed in escrow and then distributed h r rep no 100862 100th ong 2d sess 80 1988 it is not just trespass damages which are covered by the escrow statutes the escrow statutes supersede any rights held by the government under the fur seal act to wildlife proceeds from harvests on lands conveyed pursuant to the act in this case of course the act refers to the alaska native claims settlement act the amendment statutorily resolves in the affirmative any possible question as to whether wildlife proceeds are included under the escrow statutes at a minimum for the purposes of the escrow statutes wildlife harvested on lands later conveyed to native corporations pursuant to ancsa is quite simply a resource of land whether it spends time in its life cycle in the air water or ground finally the amendment clarifies any possible ambiguity with regard to the time period within which proceeds received are to be escrowed and distributed to the native corporations the escrow statutes in general provide that the appropriate recipients are to be distributed proceeds derived by the government between the date of withdrawaldecember 18 1971 in most casesand the date of conveyance of ancsa lands decause there might be a time lag between the dale a resource was taken and the date the government received the proceeds from the sale thereof an ambiguity may exist the applicable rules of statutory construction and interpretation as set forth in the statement of managers doi escrow account precedent and the plain meaning of the statutes are all consistent proceeds received during the withdrawaltoconveyance period are to be escrowed and distributed the language in the amendment attached to h r 2677 confirms that position and mandates payments of proceeds received in that period therefore some of the escrow fund proceeds properly due to the pribilof village corporations were derived from seals harvested immediately prior to the passage of ancsa on lands later conveyed to the corporations pursuant to the act at the same time proceeds received after conveyance from seals harvested immediately before conveyance are not subject to escrow i am informed by the secretary of the interior that the governments maximum liability in this claim could exceed 18 million by virtue of this legislation

the gentleman from wisconsin said that it is no wonder that people do not go to the polls and vote when they see action like this i would suggest that perhaps one of the reasons people do not go to the polls and vote is because voters are being told so many things by some members of this body that just are not so i would suggest that the gentleman from nebraska has just accurately summarized what is and is not at stake on this issue let me make matters clear first of all the gentleman from wisconsin indicated that this rule is here because it was brought here by the democrat leadership bending the rules the fact is that this bill is here at the request of thedemocratic and republican leadership it is here at the request of myself among a good many other people because we are trying to support a compromise with a republican administration even though i myself have strong doubts about that compromise this is a body in which you have to try to have 535 men and women work their will in a united way and in a way which does not make the united states look silly in the process that is what we are trying to do by supporting the administrations request for today second it was stated that this vote is a vote pure and simple on the gci that is simply not correct this vote is simply a vote on whether or not we are going to allow a vote on authorizing every item in the bill which is unauthorized to put that in perspective the gci proposition is about 50 million all of the other unauthorized items in this bill are about 14 billion i would say that the vote on the rule is the furthest thing possible from a vote specifically on the gci it is simply a vote on whether or not we are going to do what we have done many times in the past namely authorize legislation which has not been able to make it through the authorization process so that we can avoid a continuing resolution if members want to be on a continuing resolution if we want to be here saturday if we want to be here next week and violate our promise to the president to produce 13 appropriation bills without going to a cr then vote against the motion if you want to enable the house to meet the obligation to pass 13 appropriation bills in a timely way although we may all have disagreements about specific items in the bill then you support the motion of the committee on rules and go on and support the obey motion let me say also that the assertion was also made by the gentleman from kentucky that if members vote for this they will not be able to do anything at all about the gci for the next 6 years is the furthest thing possible from the truth we have limited oci appropriations in the obey amendment to 50 million not 70 million precisely because a good many people on this side of the aisle share a feeling that i think is held on the part of many people on that side of the aisle that at the present time our third world policy the baker policy and the policies of the world bank are in some respects misguided we think that they do not specifically take into account the need for our own agriculture sector to grow and our own manufacturing sector to grow so we have limited the appropriation to 20 million below the amount requested by the administration and i have a letter here which i am sending to the secretary of the treasury today and i would invite anyone to sign it who would like to sign it with me which simply states here that future appropriations for the oci over each of the next 6 years are going to be determined to a very great extent by the manner in which the treasury department and the world bank handle this entire question of third world debt i do not believe that we ought to provide american support for any structural loan if that country is required to devote more than 20 percent of its foreign exchange to repay loans because i think that messes up their ability to buy our own products if any of you are interested in joining with me on that letter i

process by the soviets we met with officials and had an opportunity to evaluate various proposals and possible options concerning our course of action relative to our presence in the soviet union a number of members have asked me for my opinions since returning and for the use of those members and others who may be interested i am inserting in the record today a copy of a special report on this situation it is as follows special report on the moscow complex problems it would be inadvisable and premature to make a final judgment as to the course of action which should be taken relative to the construction problems in the new chancery building in moscow before some additional technical information has been determined also the problem is not merely a construction problem anyway it also involves the attitudes of the unitedstates and the soviet union toward one another and whether internationally accepted conduct in a host country will be observed in the future understandings and guarantees concerning these relationships directly affect which option should be selected relative to the construction problems at the new chancery there is a ceiling of 225 unitedstates personnel for all purposes and all departments in moscow imposed in retaliation for the ceiling we imposed upon the soviets in the unitedstates and they do not permit soviet citizens to work at maintenance secretarial or any other jobs at the unitedstates complex it is not possible for a total of 225 personnel to fulfill normal diplomatic consular support export and other responsibilities and at the same time perform the necessary services to handle a substantial deconstruction and reconstruction project for a new chancery provide support services for 200 or 300 unitedstates construction workers manage and guard a supply center for new construction materials and the repair and maintenance of the old office complex if the new chancery building can be neutralized and sufficiently secured most of the problems can be handled otherwise unless there is a new agreement increasing unitedstates personnel ceilings in moscow a substantial reduction either in the number of people available for normal functions or abandoning the goal of a new chancery building is imperative therefore as the schlesinger report indicated any acceptable solution depends upon cooperation by the soviets as a highest priority unitedstates negotiators should insist upon meaningful cooperation not only in any reconstruction undertaking but also in locating neutralizing and removing surveillance devices although we would not depend upon a bare promise we should also insist upon an agreement at the highest level that such conduct will not be repeated while it is understandable up to a point escalating reciprocity in like kind on both sides is a poor substitute for basic civility when it reaches a point of harassment it is time for either mutual withdrawal of personnel or to agree to some new rules which display greater respect for one another or for both if glasnost is in fact a reality and if policies have really changed this is an opportunity to demonstrate it while it would be premature to make a final determination at this time as to the option to be selected relative to the new chancery and the disposition of the mt alto complex time is very important and both the administration and congress need to be examining the ramifications of several possibilities our moscow complex consists of eight buildings of which seven have been completed at a cost of more than 120 million and are now being occupied while some obvious mistakes were made in architectural design these buildings are far superior to those which were being used prior to their completion the remaining functions to be moved to the new site are those which are performed in the old chancery building the existing old chancery building is not only compromised but also is a dilapidated fire trap which is impossible to maintain in a condition meeting minimum standards for offices in the unitedstates and would be condemned under the ordinances in most any unitedstates city repairing it to the extent necessary to meet reasonable standards would involve an unacceptably high cost estimated at a minimum of 10 million and it could be two or three times that amount and we still would not own the building if the new chancery can be debugged and secured it would eliminate the extremely high cost and the loss of valuable time which would be consumed in repairing the old complex and deconstructing and reconstructing

this is an amendment that i feel very strongly about but i understand that a point of order may rest against the amendment and i would expect to withdraw the amendment but i do wish to introduce the amendment to offer it at this time and explain it to members of the house and explain what we might do as a result of the point of order this morning what we might do to try to pursue it this deals with the drought we have had some discussions today the gentleman from minnesota described what is happening in the part of the country that is suffering from the drought let me say that this s an urgent situation this is not just somebody saying we have not had enough rain so we are not getting the yields on our crops that we would expect we have a very urgent situation in our part of the country we are going to lose about onehalf of our crop according to economists at our land grant college onehalf of our crop is gone even if it rains from today until the end of july we have already lost a substantial amount of our crop this is a devastating economic calamity to a state like north dakota if you lose half of the income from the single largest industry in your state you have very serious problems what does this mean when you lose half your income well it means that you have suffered the kind of drought where we have had less rain in some parts of north dakota than we had in the 1930s that is the kind of conditions we have out there what happens to the agricultural producer the farmer a they lose their crop and then b the target price for wheat corn or barley that they expected to get which represents a price the government would like to see them receive which represents something close to the cost of productionnot quite but something close to itthe target price provides a deficiency payment to the farmer which represents the difference between the target price and the market price the problem is that the drought means less product less wheat less barley and less corn is produced and therefore the market price is increased but that does not help the farmer because most of the farmers do not have any crop so while the market prices increase and the farmer is sitting there without a crop to take advantage of the market price increase the market price increase then reduces the deficiency payment to the farmer because the difference between the market price and the target price represents the deficiency the farmers therefore become double victims here no 1 they lose their crop and no 2 they lose their deficiency payment because the drought incrernses market prices for which they had no crop to market and it depressed their deficiency price what i would like to do is provide some protection for those deficiency prices in order to try to minimize the damage one way to do that is to use the lowyield disaster program that was put in place in the 1985 farm bill i had a resolution to offer and that has now been introduced and this amendment asks the secretary of agriculture to use if necessary the lowyield disaster program for that purpose to try to make whole those farmers on the deficiency payment the gentleman from kansas
