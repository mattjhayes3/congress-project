from the great state of massachusetts mr bill delahunt i am so glad mr delahunt is here we were talking earlier i had to chuckle there for a minute because mr delahunt always takes the opportunity and the privilege to share with us the printed word and it is good to have him here mr ryan will be joining us a little later if i could just take a moment here to let the members know that the great debate took place here on this floor a number of amendments were proposed to make sure that we pass a budget that is just and fair for every american but i must bring to the members attention because i think members do not realize what is happening or if they do realize what is happening i want to make sure that it is in the record that they know we talk about debt a lot in our 30 something working group and talking about debt and doing something about debt are two different things the republican majority continues to spend in a recordbreaking way that is bankrupting this country and changing the philosophy of this country which is payasyougo democrats we are the only party in this house that can say that we balanced the budget we have actually done it we have actually had surpluses as far as the eye can see republicans can only talk about well we would like to cut it in half and we would like to cut it back a quarter or what have you but i just want to make sure that folks understand that there was an article written on tuesday of this week entitled another possible bump to the debt ceiling 2 7 trillion budget plan pending before the house would raise the federal debt ceiling by nearly 10 trillion less than 2 months after the congress last raised the federal debt borrowing limit the provision is buried on page 121 of a 151page blueprint it serves as the backdrop for congressional action this week i think it is important and i usually have my letters here from the secretary of the treasury but i think it is important that the american people and the members of this house understand that what they are doing to this country recordbreaking debt i just want to make sure before we start off and then i am going to be kind of quiet here tonight because i know that we have a lot to share it is almost too much to share but i just want to share this with the members one more time we are talking about who are we borrowing from we are borrowing from japan at 682 8 billion china 249 8 billion the uk 223 2 billion the caribbean 115 3 billion taiwan 71 3 billion opec nations including saudi arabia and a number of nations that we have issues with 67 8 billion germany 65 7 billion korea 66 5 billion canada 53 8 billion and climbing if we do not stop this republican majority from continuing to raise this debt ceiling and burying it within the federal budget on what they believe their members have to vote for and this budget vote has been postponed and postponed and postponed not because the republican majority did not have time to deal with it they just did not want to do to their constituents what the majority wants them to do as long as we are here and we have breath in our bodies we are going to share with the members of this house that we will not allow this to be a back room with the lights off in the middle of the night proposition for the american people that they do not have any choices in but the special interests do i just in closing again history making this is not the kendrick meek report debbie wasserman schultz bill delahunt or tim ryan report this is facts not fiction the unitedstates department of the treasury backs this up 1 01 trillion borrowed in 224 years since 1776 to the year 2000 versus 1 05 trillion that was borrowed from 2001 to 2005 and counting from the president and the republican majority congress we are saying that we want to pay as we go we are saying that we want to make sure that we are fiscally responsible and we are saying that we are not going to allow the republican majority to be able to have these countries look at america in a different way than they were prior to this administration and prior to this republican congress i yield to the gentlewoman from florida ms wasserman"], [0.001028299331665039, 0.998971700668335, 1, "it is an honor to come and address the unitedstates house of representatives i want to thank democratic leader nancy pelosi and our democratic whip mr steny hoyer and also our chairman mr james clyburn and i think it is also mr larson who is our vice chpir and the rest of the ranking members and other members of the democratic caucus an hour ago we were talking about the issues of fiscal responsibility we were talking about trying to make sure that the american taxpayer gets what tfiey deserve out of this government this government that they have elected to cometo washington d c to represent them to make sure that they get the biggest bang for their tax dollar i think it is important to point out that we are having some real financial issues right now some may say on the majority side ahid i do respect the members on the majority side and i know that there are a few members on the majority side that feel the way we feel here on the minority side on the democratic side of the aisle that we have to get our fiscal house in order and we are not there yet i can say here boldly and honestly that we are not there there are a number of thirdparty validators that are talking about the fiscal irresponsibility on the majority side and by this president that has put this country in financial jeopardy you have individuals saying we want to cut the deficit in half but meanwhile back at the ranch they want to borrow from countries like china they want to borrow from countries like saudi arabia and give those countries a piece of the american pie i think it is important that in the last hour when we talked about innovation we talked about putting america first we talked about not cutting student loans to everyday americans we talked about assisting that next generation and the generations that we expect to be able to stand up and make this and continue to make this country free and put us ahead as it relates to inventions as it relates to innovation we are talking about on this side of the aisle that we embrace and we appreciate our troops and our veterans but meanwhile in the presidents budget it talks about cuts in veterans affairs it talks about higher copayments for veterans i must say i am a democrat but guess what i represent republicans indepenlents green party and democrats back in my district and they feel the way that i do r have not had one constituent say congressman i want you to go to washington d c and make sure that you borpow as much money as possible so that i can pay it back with interest congressman i want you to go to washington d c and be irresponsible with my tax dollars and make sure that we do not have accountability as it relates to unbid contracts congressman i want you to look the other way when it comes down to making surethat you have the proper oversight so that we do not have this culture of corruption cronyism and incompetence that we are seeing on the majority side and in the white house right now i think it is very very important the perception that the american people and the reality that they are seeing right now this is not the kendrick meek or the 30something or the tim ryan report this is what is being printed every day in the papers it is not that the congress is taking a bold step to make sure that the children of america have what they need making sure that we have the kinds of innovation that the president spoke about making sure that the veterans do not have to pay a higher copayment for health insurance that we promised them as a country we salute one flag right now not because of coincidence because individuals have died for that opportunity we have individuals that have served and served in many theaters to make sure that we can salute one flag and the bottom line is we should not turn our backs on those individuals what mr ryan and i are going to talk about in this 30something hour is the tax on corruption the corruption tax that the american people have to pay and the american children have to pay and men and women that have worn a uniform have to pay guess what it is not just democrats it is not just republicans it is not just independents it is the american people it is not just the folks that vote it is not just the folks that do not vote it is not the folks who are seeking status that have green cards in this country that are legally here it is happening right now mr speaker and mr ryan i just want to say before i yield i feel good about the fact that we were talking about the k street project 2 years ago night after night week after week we talked about it we were honest and upfront with the american people that something was fundamentally wrong when you have a k street project talk about it put a press release out about it about how we have this relationship with the special interests what about a relationship with the american people mr speaker so now we have a lobbyist here in this town that has admitted to guilt mr ryan that has said i have broken the law we do nothave to have a trial because the evidence is so strong we do not have to have a jury pool we do not have to have pedple come in and waste 6 months of their lives on a jury pool and a jury selection i will admit to guilt days after this particular lobbyist said i am guilty i am willing to help the government in seeking out those members that were part of this"], [0.001059114933013916, 0.9989408850669861, 1, "mr ryan i dont give the president total credit for all of this he couldnt do it by himself you have to have a rubber stamp congress to give you full power full power to be able to take the country down the track it has gone down and the bottom line is that a republican majority from the leadership on down to the newly elected member of the republican conference has to take credit for giving the president the kind of power that he has right now we are fighting wars abroad for democracy when here at home we dont celebrate that very democracy that so many people speak of we have individuals that are on their third and fourth deployment i am on the armed services committee so i get the reports i get the letters from my constituents saying my husband my wife my mother my dad my niece my uncle my nextdoor neighboris on his way back to iraq again abec se we went alone we didnt go with a true coalition so i think it would be hard if i was a part of the republican majority to try to muster up some talking points for the floor right now to be able to say well okay some of this stuff is not believable so lets try to attack some members of the democratic caucus lets try to muster up and embellisha record on possibly being weak on terrorism or being weak on national security thats where the republican majority is now they are gasping for political air right now but you know what is so important about this issue and this discussion about national security is that it is supposed to be nonpolitical and unfortunately it is and that is because the majority hasnt allowed bipartisanship in this house for so many years and so they can hang it around their neck and say it is our war it is our failure as it relates to national security and border security dont act like it is a crisis right now you allowed it to happen under your watch you have been the rubber stamp congress now mr ryan and ms wasserman schultz let me just tell you what the rubber stamp congress has accomplished borrowing 1 05 trillion from foreign nations in 4 years in more than 224 years of this countrys history with 42 presidents 1 01 trillion they were able to borrow in 4 years and this republican congress and the president has allowed that to happen these are the countries here that own a part of the american apple pie japan china the u k the caribbean taiwan germany and opec nations you know this whole oil thing that we will talk about in a minute korea and canada they all have their hands in the pockets of the unitedstates taxpayers not because of the unitedstates taxpayers but because of the republican majoritys outofcontrol spending oil companies oh wow at this time in history when they unearth what happened under this republican majority and this presidency they will see these record breaking profits there was a meeting in the white house i have the article to prove it and i talk about it all time it was a special meeting that took place in the white house and the vice presidents aides and all met and then the policymakers came here to the congress to the rubber stamp congress now let me set this up here because we believe in the 30something working group in thirdparty validators washington post wednesday november 16 2005 white house document shows that executives from big oil companies met with vice president cheneys energy task force in 2001 something long expected by environmentalists but denied as recently as last week by the white house last week industry officials testified before congress document obtained by the post on november 2005 shows that officials from exxon mobil phillips shell oil companies and bp of america met in the white house complex with cheney aides to develop a national energy policy parts of which became law and parts of which are still being debated in congress that was 2001 look what happened 2002 34 billion recordbreaking profits 2003 53 billion 2004 84 billion 2005 113 billion in profits for oil companies meanwhile average americans are spending through the nose and trying to make it to work and to drop their kids off look what happened here this is what happened under the republican majority and a rubber stamp congress so shall it be written and so shall it be done e85 we talk about alternative fuels flex vehicles every magazine i open talks about flex vehicles here is the bottom line the republican congress have allowed these oil companies to be able to do anything they want to do when they want to do it this is an actual pump here at an exxonmobil station it says you cannot use your mobil credit card to buy e85 meanwhile we can continue to feed off the saudi arabian middle east what got us in this thing in the first place policies you can use your oil card there you can buy a bag of chips you can buy a carton cigarettes but e85 that is produced in the midwest versus the middle east you cannot use your mobil credit card for that and on retirement packages and i dont know very much about lee raymond but the bottom line is he is a retired executive from exxonmobil with a 398 million retirement package and a 2 million tax break this is what happens with a republican majority again the republican majority rubber stamp dont worry about balancing the budget democrats we tried to balance the budget we have done it before we have tried to do it under this republican majority not one republican vote to balance the budget on rollcall vote 87 march 17 2005 ranking member spratt and the budget committee put it forth again failed not one republican vote on rollcall vote 91 in 2004 their will and desire is not there the american people deserve balance minimum wage yes there was some bill that came up before we left for the break to talk about minimum wage a bill that the republican majority knew that the senate would not take up and would never make it to the presidents desk but because we were hammering them on it they said lets pass this they added all kinds of stuff it is called the potomac twostep this chart the bottom line is these are not minimum wage increases these are increases for members of congress this is our pay this is what we make oh look at them since 1997 there hasnt been an increase in the minimum wage and you not a minimum wage worker right now and i am not talking to the members of congress i am talking to the american people the bottom line is if the minimum wage goes up and that means if you are a salaried worker then your wages will go up but the bottom line is that it is a fact that the republican congress has said not over our dead body we are going to get our increase but we are not going to give the american people a minimum wage increase it goes on and on and on i am going to close with this the prime minister of iraq and the president of iran mr delahunt brought this picture out last night i dont care whichever way you cut 300 billion of spending over 2 000 troops thousands and thousands of american troops injured here in washington d c stay the course no plan the secretary of defense says if you talk about or say anything about redeployment of troops or withdrawing from iraq you are fired no question from the congress no response from the congress the secretary of defense is not called to the hill immediately the republican congress what are they saying they are saying nothing so accountability is not there they are embracing and guess what this is a la the unitedstates taxpayer through the republican majority because of a lack of diplomacy and a lack of plan and going to a war of choice versus after osama bin laden in afghanistan andgiving those troops in afghanistan the support they need so ms wasserman schultz mr ryan i rest my case the bottom line is that was not a message for democrats or republicans it was not a message for independents or the green party or other party affiliations that is a message for americans the bottom line is whatever you may feel if you are a member of the republican executive committee or you have always voted republican or you always voted independent you have to have issues with what the facts are i yield to ms wasserman schultz"], [0.0010719895362854004, 0.9989280104637146, 1, "this is leader pelosis 30something working group www

the time as you know the 30something working group we come to the floor daily to share not only with the members of the house but also the american people about plans we have that is in holding or in waiting not because of the fact that we are not willing to move forth on behalf of the american people it is because the republican majority has decided not to govern on the side of the american people i feel that this is very very hard core for everyday americans because they are in waiting not only inthe area of minimum wage but also affordable fuel prices and real solutions as relates to protecting our country and also making sure that our veterans who have allowed us to serve who have allowed us to salute one flag will be honored in the area of health care and other areas that we have promised them i am going to start off my comments and i am glad mr delahunt is here and i know others are on their way to the floor to at least talk about this minimum wage conversation that we are having here on the floor of the house of representatives i feel that we should take action we want to take action on this side of the aisle democrats united in making sure that some 6 millionplus americans are able to get a pay increase something that members of congress have enjoyed overa number of years but everyday working americans are not able to receive more minimum wage than what they are receiving right now they are right now making 5 and some change and i mean it is unconscionable for members of the house to be able to walk away with an increase costofliving increase meanwhile those individuals that are punching in and punching out every day are still making the same rate that they were making in 1997 it would be an uproar here in this house if members of congress had not received a pay raise since 1997 one thing that i can say here on this side of the aisle the democratic leadership and the democratic caucus has said we will not stand for an increase for members of congress to make more money if we are not going to raise the level of minimum wage for everyday americans and so again we come with thirdparty validators we come with the facts to share with the american people and we come to let the american people know and members on the majority side that we have the will and the desire to lead and we will if we have the opportunity after november i just wanted to share a few things because there are a lot of folks that are out there saying that they are fighting on behalf of the everyday american so i thought i would just bring a couple of visual aids and also some information this is the source of the college board 2005 as it relates to the census and what americans are dealing with i want to start with this next chart here i want to start with this chart minimum wage and this is real economic change under bush here you have the minimum wage that is at zero starting in 1997 to now since 1997 to now whole milk has gone up 24 percent bread has gone up 25 percent a 4year public college education has gone up 77 percent health care insurance has gone up 97 percent meanwhile americans are still making 5 and change regular gas has gone up 136 percent still no message from the republican majority for everyday working americans that punch in and punch out every day li 2310 here are some other statistics still from 1997 no increase in the minirhum wage for everyday working americans college tuition has gone up in private institutions 40 percent gas prices again as it relates to the middle class has gone up 47 percent and 55 percent for prescription drugs i think it is important that we look at those to go further i think it is important that we share this the facts are hard but they are true in 1998 a member of congress received a raise of 3 100 that was in 1998 in 1998 the minimum wage was zero again in 2000 members of congress received a 4 600 raise that is more money everyday working americans in 2000 minimum wage zero thanks to the republican majority i just said in 2000 mr delahunt members received a pretty substantial raise in 2001 members of congress received a 3 800 raise of course we are not minimumwage workers the american people in 2001 zero nothing the republican majority said they are not going to have it in 2002 again a 4 900 that is a lot of money increase for members of congress the american people in 2002 zero it pays to have a voting card in congress you can give yourself a raise but the folks that elect you just have to suck it up now this is like on a roll here in congress in 2003 a 4 700 increase in members of congress pay the american people guess what zero nothing at alr thanks to the republican majority in 2004 a 3 400 raise for members of congress guess what members american people minimum wage raises zero these are the facts i challenge any member on the republican side the majority to come down and challenge me on these facts in 2005 it continues a 4 000 raise once again you are a member of congress that comes up here who say they are representing you it is a wonderful thing get a raise in 2005 4 000 the american people zero in 2006 members of congress proposed raise 3 100 mr delahunt my 9yearold son and my 11yearold daughter can guess the american people to this date zero now i want to go back to this chart because i think it is very revealing and very accurate i have been in this business for 25 years and i never voted for an increase in the minimum wage and i am opposed to it and i think that a vast majority of our conference is opposed to it that is the leader of the republican congress that is the majority leader now mr delahunt there are members that come to this floor and say the democrats are just demagoguing there are people who come to this floor and say we are for you they are not for leading i think it is important mr delahunt that we come to the floor and share with the american people and the members of congress that we will not rest even though we are in the minority that we are still willing to fight for them now the difference between the republican majority and the democratic minority is the fact that the majority has the power to be able to make things happen here in this house on behalf of the american people as it relates to the minimum wage and it is fair play i went through this list pay increases year after year 4 000 here 4 700 there 3 100 here and zero since 1997 on behalf of the american people who punch in and punch out every day meanwhile health care cost is up meanwhile the cost of bread and milk is up meanwhile gas prices are up by 136 percent but back at the ranch and here in this house the members of congress are being taken care of the special interests are being taken care of but guess what the individuals who woke up early on a tuesday morning for representation are being left behind since 1997 and there are members on the majority side saying over their dead bodies literally will they receive an increase because they are so indebted mr delahunt to their special interests so all we can fight with here is the fact not fiction but fact that we have a republican majority that is willing to govern for the few for those individuals who have the opportunity to come to washington and to be able to gain access through the k street project and other programs that allow them to give politically and have gangs here in the house a former member of this house used to boast about the fact that if they were not on the list of contributors they couldnt come in and see them that is a former member of the house and if anybody wants to challenge me on it from the majority side i will be happy to reveal that former members name i think we all know and it was an active program in the house and i believe there are still some elements of that program now the fact that special interests do not want an individual making 5 and some change to receive a couple dollars increase is very unfortunate and mr delahunt i am very concerned about that let me just take 3 more minutes mr delahunt and then i am going to yield to you because you have some very interesting charts over there let us talk about who is getting what in the past you have heard me read this and i want to read it again because when it comes down to when their constituents want to know whose side they are on i want the members to be armed with the facts i am proud that i am trying to do everything i can do on behalf of my constituents back in the 17th congressional district in dade and broward county but by their sending me to congress and mr delahunt to congress they federalized us to represent the people of the united states of america and i think it is our obligation to share the facts members can follow me they can go on washingtonpost com this was an article november 16 2005 on the front page a white house document shows that executives from big oil companies met with vice president dick cheneys energy task force in 2001 something long suspected by environmentalists but denied as recently as a week ago by industry officials testifying before congress the document obtained this week by the washington post shows that officials from the exxonmobil corporation phillips shell oil company and bp america inc met in the white house complex with the cheney aids who were developing national energy policy parts of which became law and parts of which are still being debated here in the house this is an article it is not from the democratic caucus it is not from my office or mr delahunts office let us see what happened that meeting mr delahunt and members was in 2001 here are the profit margins of big oil companies since that meeting in 2002 i think that was a pretty good meeting to go to 34 billion in profits thanks to the republican majoritys passing policy that would allow oil companies to spend tle taxpayers dollars and to be able to have subsidies and make these profits in 2003 59 billion in profits i think that meeting was worth going to and whoever recommended and got them into the white house complex to meet with the cheney aides i think they got a promotion and possibly a bonus li 2320 in 2004 84 billion oil profits up guess who is paying for it the american people in 2005 113 billion in profits and the numbers are not even in from 2006 i know that these facts have to have some members who may be in their offices right now or sitting up in their beds feel uncomfortable but unfortunately that is not happening because it continues why is this man smiling here it is nothing against him i dont have anything personally against oil companies they are getting what the majority republican conference here in this house has allowed them to have it is one thing for someone to gay i will support you and your political endeavors it is another thing for you to say i am with you all the way even if it costs my constituents more at the pump here is a man that a lot of workers wish they had such a deal a 398 million retirement package and a 2 million tax break ala the republican majority an exxon former executive it is almost unfair someone may say that if i didnt have the thirdparty validators the congressional record and votes by the majority to back up what i am saying some folks would say that is unfair i wouldnt even be able to walk the halls of congress or talk to my colleagues on the republican side if i wasnt telling the truth i think it is important that everyone understands if you are a republican you have to have a problem with what i just presented you have to if you are a democrat you have to have a problem the information i am sharing with you that the republican majority is allowing to happen we on this side have called for an increase in the minimum wage we on this side have called for tough legislation on price gouging we on this side have talked about making ourselves energy independent not investing in the middle east but investing in the midwest as it relates to e85 so i think it is important that everyone understands when we are in the majority if the american people see fit we will put forth policy that will benefit all americans i think it is important if you are an independent you have to have a problem with the fact that members of congress have received thousands upon thousands of dollars of raises since 1997 and still no response from the republican majority as it relates to the minimum wage"], [0.0010794401168823242, 0.9989205598831177, 1, "thank you so very much ms wasserman schultz i am glad that you brought a visual aid down because i think it is important that we break this down for the members because we want to make sure that members dont go back home in november and giving political speeches saying that oh well i didnt know we were doing that or i didnt know that we were breaking a record in borrowing from foreign nations we want to make sure that the congressional record reflects that those of us on this side of the aisle actually brought it to the floor in a form that a middle school or a fifth grader can understand and it is important that we break it down to this point so that no one can say that they misunderstood they didnt quite know what they were voting for i made a mistake or whatever the case may be because now in this day in this congress we are making history in all the wrong places and in all the wrong ways i think it is important that we point this out i want to make sure that i get that washington post article that talked about a special meeting at the white house the innovation agenda i want to make sure that the members go on housedemocrats gov and get a copy of the innovation agenda so that hopefully folks can be enlightened on what we have been talking about and promoting not just yesterday not just last month this has been around and the only reason why it is not implemented now is that the republican majority will not allow legislation to come to the floor outside of the original thoughts of president bush or the republican leaders i think it is important that we understand an innovation agenda we talk about education and creating the workforce for the future making sure that there is math and science education that we work on that and we provide the necessary dollars for it invest in research and also development that promotes publicprivate partnerships where many ceos you will see on housedemocrats gov have already become a part of what we are talking about and encouraging that to happen affordable guaranteed broadband access throughout the country need it be if you are in the heartland of america you are on the east coast you are on the west coast you are down south you are up north you should be able to have an opportunity at this broadband initiative that we have for all americans achieving energy independence we talked about that withir 10 years not maybe one day not counting on the oil companies to do it but the congress setting the stage this house setting the stage for that to happen providing small businesses with the tools that they need to be able to create jobs i am just going to take about 10 minutes here breaking this thing down if not shorter of talking about how we are making history in all the wrong ways the republican majority i must say has done an outstanding job on behalf of president bush you have got to hand it to them if there was an oscar an emmy or a grammy to give out the republican majority would get it as it relates to rubberstamping everything the administration hands down i hold here and this is no secret to many of the members and it should not be a secret to the staff that works here in the house of representatives this chart this chart of the fact that in just 4 years president bush and the republican majority has borrowed 1 05 trillion from foreign nations we have the republican congress right under the presidents picture because he couldnt do it by himself fortytwo united states presidents 224 years were only able to borrow 1 01 trillion from foreign nations how could that be one may say how can you do this in 4 years 1 05 trillion from foreign nations in 224 years 200 years shy of what the president has been able to do 1 01 trillion let me tell you that is staggering that is not something that it happened in the forties or it happened in the thirties once upon a time calculate it fortytwo presidents 224 years we are not just here as the 30 something working group and dreaming up something those numbers are from the unitedstates department of treasury who do we owe who has their hands in the pockets of the american taxpayer i dont care if you are a republican independent you dont vote yet or whatever the case may be a democrat you have to have a problem with these nations owning a piece of the american apple pie japan like it or not i know it is painful for some of the members to hear this but this is the reality under a republican majority japan 682 8 billion that they own of the american apple pie thanks to the republican majority rubberstamping the bush policies china 249 8 billion of the american apple pie that they own right now not because of the american people lack of making the right fiscal decisions but it is because the republican majority has allowed it to happen with the american taxpayer dollar the u k 223 2 billion caribbean nations 115 3 billion taiwan 71 3 billion opec nations oh my goodness opec nations we cant do enough for them but they are buying our debt 67 8 billion germany 65 7 billion korea 66 5 billion and canada 53 8 billion the reason why you see the american flag in silhouette as it relates to the united states of america excluding alaska and hawaii

about many of the issues that we fight for for them here in this unitedstates house of representatives i must say that there are a number of things that we can talk about this evening but i just want to start off because i know that not only the democratic leader but also the entire democratic caucus is looking to hopefully put america in a new direction we want to make sure that we provide the leadership on behalf of all americans as you know i want to start off tonight but as you know we have been sharing it with the members so that hopefully it will have some sort of lift here in the house it has not had thus far but weare willing to provide the leadership even in the minority even though the majority is not willing to pick up the philosophy that we are pushing here on behalf of the american people making sure that we have more affordable health care this is on housedemocrats gov also lower gas prices to achieve energy independence which we have our energy plan on housedemocrats gov and our innovation plan that has been there for some time and filed legislation here in the house that has not been heard we want to talk about homeland security we have a real security plan also on that website that is there for the members they have to have the will and the desire to be able to take up these plans and these initiatives and if we were able to work in a bipartisan way these plans would already be passed not only in the appropriations act but also here on the floor the two other things that i want to mention as it relates to cutting the cost of college cost as you know the cost to go to college has gone up this republicanled congress last not helped in that area they have not helped the everyday average american to be able to meet the increases that they have been asked to pay and also in a new direction for america is making sure that we follow through with fiscal responsibility pay as we go not just on a credit card not just saying because we can give tax cuts to millionaires and we will just puv it off on future generations or we will go to foreign nations and borrow a record number of dollars these nations that i am holding up here they own a part of the american apple pie not because of what the american people have done it is what the republican congress has done and allow these countries to buy our debt

working families in america i salute him for his excellent presentation today today the house is considering the ultimate values debate the question bafore us today is do we want to cut taxes for the ultrasuperrich or instead do we first want to give hardworking americans a raise do we want to live in an aristocracy or do we want to live in a democracy do we want to perpetuate wealth or reward work the estate tax is central to our democracy it is rooted in our commitment to create a strong and vibrant middle class and to give every american the opportunity to achieve the american dream after the gilded age in which the elites of the time held power and wealth that far far far outstripped what the average american had america decided to go in a new direction one of americas great republican presidents theodore roosevelt made the argument for an estate tax saying that the really big fortune the swollen fortune by the mere fact of its size acquires qualities which differentiate it in its kind as well as its degree from what is possessed by men of relatively small means therefore president theodore roosevelt said i believe in a graduated tax on big fortunes properly safeguarded against evasion democrats believe that we must create wealth we recognize that that we must reward entrepreneurship and risk and we must encourage hard work that is why democrats supported a targeted estate tax relief for small businesses and farmers and fami lies that would ensure 99 7 percent of all americans dont pay any estate tax this is in the spirit of theodore roosevelt targeting the vast fortunes that differ not only in the quantity of wealth but in the kind i salute congressman earl pomeroy for his leadership in giving congress an alternative that is morally and fiscally responsible unfortunately once again the republican leadership just as they have blocked a vote on the minimum wage are blocking mr pomeroys option to bring his proposal to the floor which is responsible which is paid for and which is fair to all americans under mr pomeroys proposal only the top 3 percent that means 99 7 percent of americans most people in america would not pay any estate tax but it would leave that 3 percent the very very superwealthy to pay their fair share there are very few people involved but a great deal of money we will have a chance to vote on it in the motion to recommit unfortunately we will not have the time to debate it as an alternative we have these questions that have come before us when we are talking about this we are talking about giving 800 billion to a few families in america democrats stand for fiscal responsibility payasyougo budgets and no new deficit spending republicans instead have put forth the bill that will cost the american people again almost 800 billion 800 billion that we dont have that we are going to have to borrow our national debt is becoming a national security issue countries that now own our debt it is over 1 trillion already and this doesnt include this 800 billion those countries that now own our debt will not only be making our toys our clothes and our computers they will be soon making our foreign policy they have too much leverage over us with this bill today the republicans are giving tax cuts to the wealthy and asking the middle class to pay for it by writing checks to china and japan for the interest payments on the debt and ultimately the payment on principal it isridiculous it is ridiculous let me get this straight we are at war in iraq many of the same people who wanted to support the staythecourse that the president is on in iraq which has around a 400 billion price tag on it that is off budget they dont want to pay for that and that is a huge figure and now the republicans are saying not only that not only are we not paying for the war it is off budget we will just heap that debt on to future generations they are saying we are going to give twice as much as that to a few families in america it is so unfair this same week that we are taking this up as i said earlier this is the ultimate values debate how can a person of conscience say to the congress we do not support an increase in the minimum wage instead we are going to give 800 billion to the wealthiest people in america the minimum wage is 5 15 an hour it hasnt been raised in 9 years this is a shame it is a disgrace it is unfair and what does the leader on the republican side say about the minimum wage mr boehner says i have been in this business for 25 years and i have never voted for an increase in the minimum wage i am opposed to it and i think the vast majority of the republican conference is opposed to it so thank you mr boehner for making a differentiation for us you are for 800 billion for the wealthiest families in america and not an increase of over 5 15 an hour for americas working families so instead of giving 7 millionamericans a raise by increasing the minimum wage again the republicans are proposing 800 billion that is nearly 1 trillion as a gift to the wealthy this is robin hood in reverse we are stealing from the middle class to give to the wealthy pope benedict just recently put out his new encyclical god is love and in his encyclical he quoted saint augustine when he wrote this is in the popes encyclical you can find it there he talked about the role that politicians have and that a government should be just and we should be promoting justice and he goes on pope benedict does to quote saint augustine he says a state that is not governed according to justice would be just a bunch of thieves this is the pope saying this in an encyclical quoting a saint a state which is not governed according to justice would be just a bunch of thieves i ask this congress is it justice to steal from the middle class to give tax cuts to the ultrasuperrich it is not just and it is an injustice we cannot afford americans can no longer afford president bush and

just pointed out in terms of fema in terms of what is happening in the middle east and here lately in terms of those who were asleep at the switch when the deal was cut in terms of the port security

rebuilds confidence in the system among our constituencies i find the lack of any serious effort to reform the current wto culture and structure to fix the flaws with the unsatisfactory there are a host of problems with the wto and the number of problems is only growing the wto completely lacks any degree of transparency hearings are closed to the pub lic and public transcripts are not released where in a very limited manner wto rules permit limited transparency by allowing the assistance and resources of private parties who h4316 are supportive of the unitedstates government position the administration has chosen not to utilize this allowance transparency is not the only problem contributing to the wtos failure to move rulesbased trade forward globally but it is the central factor allowing the wto and its bureaucrats to escape the scrutiny which would quickly eradicate other abuses in geneva through the lack of transparency the wto dispute settlement and appellate bodies are emboldened to disregard the proper standard of review in disputes involving trade laws for example in this way past wto panels have issued rogue decisions against the unitedstates with no basis or standing in the context of previously negotiated agreements this rampant judicial activism is rapidly undermining the support for the wto as the wto is particularly prone to yankeebashing support for the current broken system is perhaps fading fastest here at home a slew of activist decisions against the unitedstates attacking our trade remedy laws and another decision amounting to micromanagement of unitedstates tax policy have come at a steady pace these decisions have been particularly frustrating to many members of congress because of limited opportunity for oversight by congress of the wto

whether congress should withdraw from the wto yet absent a new entity to administer and advance rulesbased trade there is no question that we must remain committed to and engaged in the wto i would submit that instead of debating whether to withdraw from the wto congress should have an active debate on ways we can make the current system work properly as it was designed to do and ways to make it better the unitedstates must move swiftly to put an end to judicial activism in the wto and reorganize the structure and culture of both the appellate body and the dispute settlement body additionally

pointed out yesterday this house took steps to reignite the engines of economic opportunity to deal with job creation and getting help to the people of the gulf coast i would assure this house this is not some sort of abstraction as my friend from mississippi knows brother rex yancey the pastor of first baptist church in pascagoula is my wifes uncle this is not some sort of statistic or abstraction just as brother rex and everyone in mississippi and on the gulf coast are facing challenges we need to work together to make sure the climate of economic opportunity exists for all just as heartfelt as his concern is for his constituents i must correct the record it does this house no service to come to this well no matter the challenges confronted and try to claim either class warfare or crass political opportunism in a quid pro quo it is beneath the dignity of every member of this house to suggest that somehow this has to do with contributions as my friend from mississippi knows the most philanthropic state in the union where people step up to help neighbors in need that example does not fall on deaf ears i will say economic opportunity is important not only for wall street not only for main street but for your street for every street because we understand economic opportunity is not exclusive there may be some who believe that this modern economy is some sort of caste system there may be some who always want to fill in the blank as follows tax breaks for the blank tax breaks for the rich that is their story and they are sticking to it no hope no opportunity when the facts are otherwise we have had solid economic growth revenues to the government have actually increased fl 1230 and not only has there been some 69 billion in immediate hurricane relief given by this

with me to get h r 3721 on the suspension calendar and considered in an expeditious fashion at the request of the national park service i introduced h r 3721 which would extend for 10 years the current authority for commercial vehicle traffic through the delaware water gap national recreation area along route 209 all bordering counties and boroughs are supportive of the bill in supporting the bill the national park service cites the continuing need for commercial vehicle traffic to travel through the park in a manner that protects park resources and visitors while also providing the water gap recreational area the financial means for monitoring and enforcement of commercial use restrictions the bill is needed to continue a program that has worked for the park service and the community surrounding the water gap national recreation area for over 20 years the fee collection system resolved the potential problems raised when the 21mile segment of unitedstates route 209 was transferred to park service control the system allows limited commercial vehicle access and the tolls allow the park service to monitor the road without using regular operation and maintenance budgets authorization for the program was done in 10year increments the most recent 10year increment authorization expired september 30 my bill would extend the authorization to september 30 2015 the current program has been in operation since 1983 and was largely successful until it started running a deficit the main problem with the existing program is the lack of the ability for the park to adjust the fee schedule to cover the expense of operating the contact stations this problem is resolved by authorizing the park superintendent to adjust fees as necessary to cover operating costs a reduction or elimination of commercial traffic is not feasible at this time as the commercial traffic continues to serve local businesses immediately adjacent to the park and concessionaires within the park and is necessary for continued business operation within the area for another decade the management of unitedstates route 209 in accordance with this legislation meets the goals of the park and is supported by the experience of the park public sentiment and economic analysis on behalf of the national park service i ask for your support for this legislation"], [0.0007448196411132812, 0.5007448196411133,

things to come on the floor of the house of representatives and claim with a straight face that we should have a debate about claiming that what is in the bill with regards to the mtbe is an unfunded mandate is one of the biggest whoppers i can imagine with all due respect i want to read some of the language of the bill and i have to put my reading classes qn to do it we specifically authorize in the bill additional funding 50 million to avoid the creation of unfunded mandates it is in the bill a specific allocation of 50 million to avoid the creation of unfunded mandates the leaking underground storage trust fund has a balance right now of 2 billion the bill before us dedicates some of that balance specifically to go out and inspect existing underground storage tanks to enforce if those inspections find that there is a leak and to fund improvements in the operation of these underground storage tank programs it is in the bill that is not an unfunded mandate if anything it is a specific allocation in the bill to enforce the program that we have to put additional funds into it and to make sure that we prevent the problem that is funded that is not unfunded now the real debate is not whether it is an unfunded mandate or not the real debate is what we should do about mtbe and as my good friend the gentleman from texas has already pointed out we can have a legitimate policy debate about that the bill allows states that want to ban mtbe to do it that is not mandating the states that is telling the states you want to use mtbe in your gasoline supply to get cleaner air fine you do not want to use it that is fine too the bill also has a provision in it that over the course of the next i think 10 years depending on some scientific studies and various things there could be a point in time that we have a federal ban on mtbe it may not it may but it could happen people forget in the 1991 clean air amendments we required an oxygen amendment to make the gasoline burn cleaner in nonattainment areas there were two ways to do that at the time use ethanol or use mtbe there was not a mandate to use mtbe but there was a requirement in nonattainment areas you had to do something in terms h2176 cc of putting more oxygen in the gasoline to make it burn cleaner most of the market went to mtbe we then found out and we knew before the fact actually that if the gasoline that had mtbe leaked out into the environment that the mtbe would disassociate a little bit quicker because it was more missable and it would get into the water supply or water table and it causes an odor so there have been a number of lawsuits the gentlewoman mentioned two of them in lake tahoe one in california where there have been outofcourt settlements for several millions of dollars because of that odor that did not establish that mtbe is a defective product this bill does have a safe harbor not just for mtbe but also for ethanol that by definition of the product the chemical composition that it is not defective but if you use it negligently you can be sued upon it if the right warnings are not with it you can be sued there are all kinds of reasons you can sue and win as has been shown but that does not mean that it in and of itself is defective interestingly enough in one of the cases the gentlewoman from california quoted the amount of the settlement was less than the legal fees that the law firm representing the community in california claimed so that community is now suing their law firm saying you ripped us off you are asking for more money tp settle the suit than we got to clean the water up"], [0.0010409355163574219, 0.5010409355163574, 1, "if absolute power corrupts absolutely so does oil and the continued lust the continued rapacious grab for
