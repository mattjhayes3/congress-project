brilliant job in putting together the resolution which was reported out of our committee and which is under consideration today i think it is very important at this stage of the debate to be very clear as to exactly what the differences are between the two resolutions we are about to vote on if we eliminate tile differences between them which are due to differing economic assumptions it is quite clear that both the grammlatta substitute and thle house budget committee resoluition~ call for roughly the same level or federal spending in the next fiscal year and both of them therefore require roughly the same lcvel of reductions in federal spending the issue therefore is not whether to cut federal spending or for that matter even by how much to cut federal spending but where to cut the federal budget and how to cut the federal budget it seems to me that when we look at it in that respect it is very clear that the resolution reported out by the budget committee is infinitely more desirable by adding to defense interest and the socalled safety net programs thle grammlatta substitute decreases the allother categories of the budget from 28 1 percent of the total in 1981 to 17 9 percent in 1984 as the house budget committee resolution makes clear it is possible to cut the budget more equitably than the administration has done reagan is using budget cutting as an excuse for an attack on social programs cuts in afdc food stamps and medicaid will reduce the spendable income of over 7 5 million poor and working poor families at a time of high inflation and high unemnployment the proposed cap on medicaid will place an intolerable burden on states and localities and will inevitably result in service cutbacks the house budget committee restores 700 million and rejects the cap the proposed education block giantsi will cut 1 5 billion or 25 percent irn fiscal year 1982 the administration claims that increased efficiencies will result in the same level of service to our schoolchildren when administrative costs average 4 percent it is more realistic to assume savings on the order oi 1 or 2 percent rather than 25 percent the school districts which will suffer from these cuts will be those with the largest enrollments of lowincome students the budget committee restores 900 million or 15 percent of these education cuts the administration proposes 700 million in afdc cuts that eliminate the work incentive this cut is shortsighted and bad social policy the budget committee restores 500 million and preserves the work incentive the administration cuts 2 3 billion in child nutrition programs which will force many schools to elin~inate their school lunch and nutrition education programs altogether the budget committee restores 1 1 billion of these cuts and fully funds the wic program for mothers and infant cliiidren at a time when rental housing in urban areas is in short supply and rents rising the administration proposes to reduce subsidized housing from 250 000 units to 175 000 units the committee resolution funds a level of 250 000 units while we are still dependent on foreign energy supplies the administration proposes to rely on the inequitous technique of energy conservation through price grammlatta proposes to cut 1 billion from conservation and solar programs the committee restores 350 million for these programs qrammlatta suggests a cut of 25 percent in lowincome energy assistance the committee restores 400 million or 80 percent of these cuts finally grammlatta assumes that the strategic petroleum reserve can be entirely funded through the sale of bonds it is bad policy to rely totally on untested schemes in so important an area as quickly filling spro the committee provides for partial financing with government backup with the administration cuts we mortgage our future the latta proposal guts the guaranteed student loan and pell grant programs at a time when we must educate young people to be more productive in a world where our ability to compete is eroding the committee restores 650 million for these programs grammlatta guts ceta training at a time when minority youth unemployment is between 40 and 50 percent we will create a permanent underclass with this kind of proposal the committee restores 600 million for training grammlatta mainly assumes that the private sector will provide capital resources for highways railroads mass transit longterm scientific research and development and support for the arts and humanities it assumes the private bar will provide legal services for the poor the reason the federal government is involved in these activities is because the private sector cannot or will not afford them in all of these areas the committee assumes that there must be a federal presence equally bad is that grammlatta assumes the kemproth tax cut its obvious inequities aside kemproth is inflationary we need no more proof that the recent rise in interest rates which the administration is now blaming on the federal reserve the committee tax cut is smaller and more oriented to productivity than consumption when the economy declines further the administration will find another scapegoat in the end the american people will put the blame where it belongson poorly conceived and poorly implemented shortsighted reagan policies the real issue is whether we attempt to cut the budget on the backs of the poor the elderly the hungry the unemployed the deprived and the disabled or whether we move in a more equitable and compassionate manner as the committee budget resolution does i urge my colleagues to reject the republican budget amendment"], [0.004460752010345459, 0.9955392479896545, 1, "i thank the very distinguished chairman of the full committee on banking i also wish to emphasize the importance of his message that he eloquently has given us there should be no reason for any member to be ignorant as to the exact thrust and nature of what is being foisted in the house but in general terms the chairman has done this i would like to be given the privilege to get into some matters of special importance the committee on banking had the biggest cuts to make of all the committees in the house of all the subcommittees in the house the subcommittee on housing had the biggest amount of the outlays and authority to cut the current service estimate for programs within the subcommittee on housing and urban affairs jurisdiction is 40 8 billion in authority we were told and mandated by the budget resolution to take the standard omb cut of 25 percent now for reasons beyond the reach of rational minds to understand the stockman formula says that domestic programs must be cut by 25 percent it matters not whether the program is for education housing or sidewalks if it is a program for people it goes down by 25 percent needless to say this arbitrary kind of target leads to the necessity of making equally arbitrary decisions nevertheless the subcommittee with the great help and leadership of the overall chairman of the full committee struggled with the numbers juggled the programs and produced budget authority cuts of 10 5 billion we made those cuts in as rational and humane a way as possible with the steady constant and undiluted opposition of the minority but there is no denying the reality that there will not be enough money in this budget to provide anything like the level of community development assistance that our cities require and neither will there be anything like the commitment needed to provide decent and affordable housing for those millions of h 3506 co citizens who are living in substandard and high cost housing we started with a current services level that was already inadequate and then faced the command to cut those services by onefourth thus we began with an assisted housing production level that meets about onethird of a reasonable goal and we ended up with an assisted housing production level that will meet perhaps a fourth of the goal in short beginning with inadequate program levels we were forced to go to absurd and inhumane levels there is no way to accomplish that kind of task without pain the results of this vast budget cut will be with us for years to come in the form of overcrowded overpriced housing in the form of growing numbers of substandard homes and in less visible but equally damaging forms of inadequate community services and underdeveloped local economies if the administration gambles luckily and we do not have more immediate social eruptions and disturbances as are being registered in less fortunate countries such as belgium france and even west germany under very similar conditions in housing that is the commitment that this administration has demanded and which the majority here has accepted we have done our duty to produce the required cuts to protect the existing housing stock we acted to provide 1 64 billion in operating subsidies for public housing this covers operating and maintenance requirements and will enable housing authorities to begin restoring operating reserves that have been depleted through extraordinary utility costs the operating subsidy goes largely to utility costs40 percent of it in fact budgets for 1980 and 1981 assumed that utility costs would increase by only 11 4 and 12 percent respectively when in actual fact utility costs went up by twice those amounts the utility cost shortfall for 1981 alone was 250 million housing authorities were forced to deplete their reserves in order to pay their bills the administration also has failed to provide 100 million to make adjustments in cases where the performance funding system formula does not accurately reflect the real needs of housing authorities which often happens in the case of larger housing authorities altogether the administration budget request was 440 million short of what is required to make the housing authorities whole this bill provides a sufficient amount to cover that shortfall failure to do so will only mean that housing authorities will be forced to cut further back on maintenance and other services which in turn would lead to loss of housing that we cannot afford to lose the public housing stock is valued at 60 billion and it is imperative that this housing be preserved which this bill provides for second this bill alms to protect the poor the budget resolution assumes that housing subsidies will be cut by 60 million through imposition of rent increases we reject that because the evidence is that the rent increases could well result in either no increase in revenue or an actual decline in revenue information we gathered shows that in san antonio for example public housing rents could go up by 5 to 36 a month the trouble is that the people who occupy this housing are so hard pressed that they do not have that kind of money to spare witnesses told us that they would have to move out of public housing into substandard housing rather than pay the increased rent the reality is that these are people who would have to choose between shoes for children and rent increases or choose between food and higher rent the administrations rent increase proposals would hit hardest at working poor families who already pay most of the rent received by housing authorities these are the families that would move out in order to be able to buy ordinary necessities even at the cost of moving into substandard shacks who would replace them in all likelihood even lower income tenants who would pay far less in rent i do not believe that the administrations rent increase proposal would produce the revenues claimed and i know that it would only create greater hardship among people who already have as much as anyone can bear therefore in rejecting the rent increase proposal we believe that we are not just protecting the poor but acting to protect the housing authorities from losing the very families that now provide the greatest rents and the greatest stability aside from turning back the counterproductive rent proposal we acted to provide at least a minimal level of modernization funds too many of the nations public housing units are in a state of disrepair it is imperative that we keep those units in operation it will be far less expensive to do that than to pay the cost of replacing them again we acted to protect the interests of the poor people who live in public housing so that the units they occupy will be safe and decent and at the same time we acted to keep the housing stock from declining third this bill provides as much new housing production as possible a realistic national housing goal requires that 600 000 assisted housing units be produced but in 1981 we expect only a third that many to be started from that already inadequate base the budget resolution called for a vast reduction there is in fact no way to keep up existing production levels and still meet the requirements of the budget resolution however we have provided funds for 1 billion in annual contribution commitments for a total of 20 billion over the life of the resulting contracts this will produce 176 000 assisted housing units55 percent of them in the form of existing homes and 45 percent of them in the form of either new or substantially rehabilitated homes the minority substitute offered a level of 158 000 units which is 17 000 below what the president proposed what we have provided in this bill is far from enough to meet any reasonable goal but is the most that can be done within the budget targets it would be a genuine tragedy to see any further cuts in housing production at a time when we know that the supply of the decent and lowcost housing is actually falling in relation to the need for it there is no disputing the fact that in this decade the nation needs to produce more housing than at any other time in history unless that need is met we will see continued demand pull on housing prices and we will see the continuation and worsening of the pressures that have already priced housing out of the reach of all but the most fortunate of our citizens for that reason we rejected the administration plan to stop ginny mae tandem plan operations and provided 1 1 billion in tandem commitments which should enable the purchase of mortgages with an aggregate value of 1 9 billion during 1982 this is essential in light of the continued high interest rates that make housing unaffordable without some form of relief and assistance we do not believe that the administrations plans to kill fha are realistic and this bill extends fha authority and adjusts insurance limits to reflect existing market trends we also provided an extension of the 202 program for elderly housing at a level of 850 million in fiscal 1982 those are the highlights of the housing portion of this bill i want now to turn to the community development issues for the community development block grant program this bill provides 3 64 billion in fiscal 1982 which is a slightin todays termsreduction from current levels the reduction is 220 million the bill also provides for continuation of the udag program at a 425 million program levela reduction of 250 million the administration proposed vast changes in the community development programs taken as a whole these cuts would have killed off the provisions that assure that community development funds are targeted and used in ways that put the funds into the areas with the greatest needs in short what the administrations changes in cdbg would have done would be to make this into another form of general revenue sharing in addition the administration proposed to put small city cdbg money under control of the states a move that even secretary pierce says the states are not prepared to cope with it is also a move that no city asked for and that an overwhelming number of small cities are opposed to we believe that community development block grants ought to be kept in their present form the program was developed after years of effort and in a bipartisan effort it has been subjected to thorough review by the committee most recently in 1980 we concluded that there is nothing to be gained and much to be lost by the radical changes put forward at the last moment by the administration likewise we rejected the notion of putting the urban development action grant program into a block grant in point of fact the arrangement proposed would have destroyed the merit of udag which is that it has a specific purpose for specific areas it is a highimpact program and its impact and effect would simply be frittered away if it were placed into a general revenue sharing type of program at a time when aid to cities for community development is going down taken as a whole the proposals for community development asked for by the office of management and budget and putatively supported by hud would merely create revenue sharing unders new name both parties have agreed for a decade that the cities need flexibility but they also need funds that are targeted and directed toward their areas of greatest need that is what community development block grants and udag does and that is the concept this bill preserves the housing and community development provisions of this bill are intended to keep essential programs alive some programs have been killed701 planning and others on the whole however our aid is to provide the greatest assistance to the areas and people of greatest need and in the most sensible way possible we have avoided any radical action we have been judicious and prudent we have met the requirements of the budget resolution this is a bill that has been painful to draw and ispainful for me to have to support but in the circumstances it is the best that can be done the housing and community development title is realistic and it merits your support i yield back to the distinguished chairman of the banking committee and in so doing want to take this opportunity to commend him and my colleagues for a splendid job under the most distressing and painful circumstances imaginable i yield back to the distinguished gentleman"], [0.005455136299133301, 0.9945448637008667, 1, "today i am introducing together with a number of my colleagues the 1982 housing bill this bill is a comprehensive positive program to address the great and growing problems of the housing industry of those who depend on it and those millions of americans who cannot now afford to buy or rent a decent home this program speaks not only to the needs of urban dwellers but to those who live in rural areas as well the reagan budget program would actually cause a reduction of 46 000 housing units that are now planned and for which funding is available the reagan program is a wholesale abandonment of efforts to provide affordable housing for the majority who are shut out of the housing market today the bill my colleagues and i are offering today will provide about 250 000 new assisted housing units in fiscal year 1983 under the programs of the department of housing and urban development and it will also provide 57 000 new assisted housing units in the rural areas served by the farmers home administration the cost of our program is modestno more than is available for the current fiscal year for housing assistance which in turn is much less than was available last year modest as it is however our bill is critically needed and is a positive program as against the reagan program of wholesale iandonment and retreat the housing act of 1982 will provide assistance for homebuyers who have modest incomes these are people who could if interest rates were anything like reasonable afford homes without assistance the bill would make available up to 100 000 homes under the section 235 q program and buyers whose incomes are up to 130 percent of area median income could qualify the subsidy would be used to reduce interest payments to a rate of 9 percentsteep by historic terms usurious by my own standards but still affordable by people who have modest incomes the subsidy provided in this program would be limited to 10 yearson the belief that as incomes rise people will be able to eliminate their need for the subsidy moreover there is provision in the bill for a recapture of the subsidy payments additionally our bill will create a new program to replace the existing section 8 multifamily housing program under our bill local government agencies could work with private developers to develop affordable rental housing the subsidy payment would be extremely flexible so that the maximum incentive will exist to create efficient and effective financing plans the subsidy could be in the form of an outright capital grant it coul8a be in the form of a loan a rent subsidy or even a loan for purchase of land it could be any reasonable device that would make the project financially feasible and at the same time modest in cost to the federal government additionally the bill encourages local units of government to do their part by contributions in kind or in cash toward project development this encouragement comes through a preference to project applications that show local participation in the development cost again flexibility is the keythe kind of flexibility that made the urban development action grant the efficient effective program that it has been the bill continues the current level of effort with respect to lowcost public housing development and rehabilitation and provides for adequate operating subsidies as well we recognize that there is an urgent need for lowrent public housing that there is a need to maintain the existing stock and that adequate operating funds are essential to prevent the financial failure of numerous housing agencies we provide in this bill for a full range of rural housing programs at least maintaining existing levels of effort the amount of substandard housing in rural america is disproportionate and our program does not turn its back on the need for better housing in small towns and on farms our bill also recognizes the ravages of unemployment with the resulting rise in mortgage foreclosures we do not believe that the involuntary victims of the nations economic distress should have their misery compounded through the loss of hardearned home equity accordingly the bill provides for an emergency homeowners assistance program one that makes loans available to people who are faced with foreclosures because of involuntary and temporary economic distress the bill extends the various insuring and secondary credit market authori ties all of which are vital tools for the financing and production of homes all of which have proved their worth and all of which have earned the support of everyone who is concerned with housing we recognize that the depression of the housing industry will not end until the economy is set straight but we also recognize that doing nothing is worse than nothing doing nothing will only accelerate the growing crisis among those who seek affordable housing only deepen the depression of the housing industry and worst of all constitute a retreat from our historic commitment to decent and affordable housing for this nation the administration is not offering a housing program it is offering an antimarch 4 1989 housing programan attempt to dis mantle and discard programs that an needed that work ahd that make positive contribution not only to thi wellbeing of the american people bu a positive contribution to the economy as well our bill by contrast is a reaf firmation of the historic and necessary national commitment to housing we understand the certali truth tha without a national housing policy there will never be sufficient housing let alone decent and affordable hous ing for the nation we offer a con structive effective program that learns from the lessons of the past the nonpolicy and antipolicy of the administration by shameful contrast seeks to undo all that has been done and unlearn all that has been learned i include

money a fiscal 1982 expenditure cut of around 50 billion in which military increases areoffset by cuts in the social budget and a 148 billion a year income tax reduction when fully effective in 1984 heavily weighted toward personal income tax cuts for the affluent is the program equitable will it work is there an alternative neither the proposed budget cuts not the proposed tax cuts are equitable no doubt cuts in budgetary expenditures are needed they are needed because the mandate of the november 1980 election is qite clear cut expenditures reduce the present federal take of some 23 percent of gross national product budget cuts are desirable too because of the need to get the deficit under control only a budget deficitwhfch is under control can eliminate the treasurys need to borrow heavily to meet the deficit with a lowered deficit the nations savings could get through to the needed ultimate investment in plant and equipment so the question is not whether there should be budgetary retrenchment the question rather is on whom the burden should fdl and here even a cursory look at the reagan budget shows that a disproportionate part of the cuts fails upon those in the dawn of life the children those in the twilight of life the elderly and those in the shadows of life the disadvantaged the handicapped and the poor health programs are ruthlessly cut med icaid is slashed 1 2 billion which means not only less medical care for the needy but a greater burden thrust upon state and local governments w~hose principal fiscal reliance is on regressive taxes like the real estate tax on the homeowner the 78 million pnrumonia immunization program for the elderly is completely abandoned the 91 vietnam veterans outreach centers providing psychological drug and alcoholic help for vietnum veterans are to be abandoned nutrition prograzwt luch as food stamps and school lunches are severely curtailed likewise hard hit are programns to make jobs the ceta program

helpers for private charities such as goodwill industries will be seen no more likewise sharply curtailed are pro grams of economic and neighborhood development and providing infrastructure for americas industries and citiesroads bridges pox ca railroads utilities primary and secondary school education aids are to be cut 22 percent neighborhoods the crowning glory of the reagan program are to be abandoned cornpletely repealed would be the afttion 312 home rehabilitation proaram under which modce eincome families have been getting reasonable interest loans with which to upgrade their homes the cooperative bank which provides capital for neighborhood efforts in food pharmaceuticals health and housing is to be terminated maintenance funds to repair the leaky roofs of public horsing are curtailed and public housing tenants have their rent raised from 25 percent of their income to 30 percent the legal services corporation which has provided help for so many of the stormtossed who cannot afford a private lawyer is to be ended mass transit is drastically curtailed all these cuts could have aved some 50 billion and i have no qua el with the idea of a 50 billion deficitnarrowing measure but it would have been entirely possible to save that same 50 billion without shortchanging really needy people and without eviscerating programs which foster economaic development for example billions could have been saved by cutting down the federal tax deduction subsidy for interest paid on vacation homes sometimes the third and fourth such home and on interest pr~id largely by the top one~fiftb of income receivers on loaru to carry consumer purchases in addition to putting needed funds into the budgetbalancing column sxch measures woula at least partially remove an incentive which now induces people to overconsume and thus have feer eevtngs to make available for productivityenhawking inflationaryfighting industrial plant and equipment huge savings could also have been achieved by doing something about taxexempt industrial revenue bonds for unnecessary shopping centers and in some cases porno bookstores uneconomic power projects like clich river in tennessee or corps of engineers and bureau of reclamation water projects bonanzas to the oil industry such as the depletion allowance which make no sense in a world where oil brings 40 a barrel but equity aside will the program work will it produce the victory over unemployment and inflation and budget deficits which reaganomics proclaims it will flaith over and beyond the call of duty is required to make one believe that it will the theory is that the supertight money will fight inflation and the superheavy tax cut will stimsulate growth much more likely the tight money and high interest rates wiill retard growth increase unemployment and bring about hankruptcies and the tax cut will simply stimulate higher interest rates if patterns in the current inflationary period are projected only about 5 percent of the total reduction will be nsaved by the beneficiaries of the reduction with the other 95 percent as a present spent indeed since much of it will be spent by the wealthy itis likely to be spent on expensive imported consumer goods ranging from mercedess to claret thus worsening our trade balance and the international dollar and in the next round inflation moreover even the uttle bit theoretically saved from current consumption may in todays inflation be spent by speculating in corporate takeovers or in commodit la such as bunker huntand his blillondollar silver manipulations the administration projects the 1984 workout of its policies as producing a balanced budget and inflation unemployment and interest rates all hovering around the 6 percent level the administration disdains econometric studies and derived its euphoric results largely by hoping or guessing that everyone would conclude from the reagan program that hard times were over businessmen should reduce their prices labor lower its wages and banks make available their money for lower interest rates a number of economic forecast4 rs who still hold the view that logical prediction is possible among them the congressional budget office data resources the wharton school and chase econometricscome up with vastly gloomier 1984 scenarios but these economic thinktanks in programming their computers all assumed that the reagan program in all its brute severity would not actually be carried out hence they softened the assumptions the federal reserve would actually not keep money as tight as the administration is ordaining congress would not by its spending and taxing measures allow the kind of budget deficits that reagan arithmetic postulates so al of these projections fell to take reaganomics nt its word however forbidding the word might be so i asked the joint economic committee staff to put into the computer the reagan program without improving a line of it and out came the result unemployment no better than today inflation down to 8 percent but underlying inflationthe general trend of wage ratesstill at its present 9 percentplus level ~ and a budget deficit of 111 billion the greatest in history rather than a budget in balance what would be happening the computers were telling us was that the reductions in social spending would be more than outweighed by the increases in military spending and the reductions in income tax revenue the added deficits coupled with a very stringent monetary policy would bring about high inbierest rates and slow growth these in turn would further increase the deficit in short the republicans far from learning by the mistakes of the democrats seem doomed to repeat them in 196l the democratic ndministration combined guns and butterguns for a major war in vietnam butter for a whole gamut of new social programs and the result was years of stagflation now fourteen years later along come the republicans and want to repeat the same mistakeguns for the greatest peacetime increase n military spending in history and butter in the form of outsized tax reductions for the affluent with a resulting renewed bout of stagfiation and budgetary deficits a particularly unfortunate element in reaganomics is what it will do to income distr~budion it is too much perhaps to hope for the moment that amnerica can achieve a fairer income distribution a diminution of the gap between rich and poor and a closer approximation to the situation which prevails in countries like germany and japan but income distribution in the united states has been getting worse for the last 16 years and now is certainly no time to accelerate the worsening during 19651978 the share in the national income earned by the lowest quintile of american families the poor remained about even but only because of the treniendous increase in transfer payments such as health welfare education food and housing benefits asto the second and third quintilesthose making 10 00020 000 a year and 20 00030 000 a year today respectivelythey definitely lost their share of the national income declined from 28 percent to 26 percent the fourth quintile those in the 30 00040 000 bracket just about kept even and the top quintile not surprisingly absorbed what the lower middle income second and thi1rd quintiles were losing it raised its share of the national income from 42 percent to 44 percenta total of many billions of dollars under reaganomics the people in the lowest 60 percent are going to lose more the poor will have their transfer payments shorn the second and third quintiles dont have those transfer payments to lose but they will get piddling income tax cut benefitsthe reductions from keniproth will be swallowed by the increases in the payroill tax and in inflationary bracket creep being borrowers rather than lenders they will be hurt by a perpetual high interest rate regime and the tax loopholes that gladden the hearts of the upper income bracketsitemized deductions oil and real estate shelters investment creditsare simply not available to them the top ten percent of american families will profit mightily from reaganomics with the lowest 60 percent taking it on the chin this does not sound like a good way to keep up the demand necessary to take off the market what the economy can produce and thus avoid a recession nor does it seem a good way to make for social peace either in the central city or in the lower middleclass suburbs the view that rehganomics in not likely to w~ork is not held just by congressional democrats reaganomics is also viewed with some private skepticism by a good many congressional republicans ranging from those on the moderate wing who see super tight mones as a real barrier to the necessary growth to those on the conservative wing like the three conservative republican senators who outraged the white house by voting against the budget on the senate budget committee just before the april recess who fear with considerable reason a huge reagan budget deficit down the road and many a market letter from many a respectable wall street firm nowadays is pointing out that the markets are not exactly prophesying success for reaganomics as indicated by the fact that longterm interest rates auguries of inflation have been stead ily rising since the inaugural the president in hisstate of the economy address on february 18 asked anybody with a better alternative to step forward and present it very recently the democrats led by chairman jones of the house budget committee and chairman itostenkowskl of the house ways and means committee have done just that mr jones proposes a slightly gentler hand on social program budget cuts than mr reagansomewhat on the order of 10 percent rather than 25 percent cuts for economic development mass transit food stamps school lunches legal aid and so on by cracking down on military waste and by mandating a somewhat smaller tax cut mr jones is aiso able to reduce the 1982 reagan budget deficit of 40 billion to 25 billion mr rostenkowski would cut 1982 taxes by only 40 billion rather than by mr reagans 52 billion and would shift the benef its very modestly from those at the top of the income scale to those in the middle the democratic alternative represents as does the democratic party nowadays a pale and somewhat more human imitation of the republican programa little tougher on fatcats a little easier on thincats and a bit more responsible about the deficit in short an improvement if hardly a call to the barricades while the two great parties of the middle square off on the minutia of macroeconomics nothing much is being done about the structural problems of our economy yet it is in improving our economic structure that the game will be won or lost for even the most admirable monetary and fiscal policies are insufficient to bring both steady jobs and stable prices at the same time the structural aspects of costpush inflation productivity energy and national defense must be addressed 1 against inflation our only policy is supertight money by itself as thatchers england is proving it cannot lay a glove on inflation without creating unacceptable stagflation recession and unemployment yet the administrations freemarket mythology immobilizes it from addressing the wagepice spiral in steel in automobiles in coal and in a score of other major sectors there are overseas examples of what to do about costpush inflation that we seem intent on ignoring in austria the government has for ycara successfully worked a social contract in which labor and management agree on a compact which puts a productivityrelated ceiling on the spiral in holland the government has had a comprehensive system of wage and price controls in place for the last couple of years and inflation is today less than 7 percent 2 in productivity we have only a fragmentary policy though accelerated productivity increases are one of the best inflationfighters going republicans and democrats are generally agreed on the need for liberalized depreciation for business investments and on the simplification and reformp of regulatory excesses but labormanagementgovernment cooperation for productivity improvement is still frowned on despite the splendid results of cooperation in the two postwar miracleworkers germany and japan in lsth these countries labor has been weened away from inefficient workrules and management from concentration on shortterm and financial fetishism why not hfarerica nor does the reagan budget do anything noticeable for productivity infrastructure programsrebuilding america ruined streets and bridges and sewer systems and waterworks and railroads and utilities and mass transitis badly shortchanged so is manpower training and industrial research and development both public and private 3 the administration is considering killing the department of energy but there is precious little of an energy policy to kill to stand up to opecand in the process make ourself the hero of the nonoilproducing worldwe need to build up a strategic petroleum reserve we need to conserve gasoline but instead of discussing an increase in the present 4centsagallon gasoline tax with a builtin rebate for workers who need it to get to work and other essential uses we talk of abandoning the present national gasolinesaving 55milesperhour speed limit we lavish billions of windfall profits on our oil industry but from solar research we are about to remove the little that it hath 4 finally there are

the house of representatives which recognizes the contributions of the senior citizens who make up an everincreasing segmentof our society eighteen percent of pennsylvanias population is over 60 years of age thanks to better health care better housing better nutrition and better community services americans are living longer today than at any other time in our history these improvements in the quality of life for older americans were brought about to a large degree by the federal government previous administrations realized that the federal government along with society had a moral obligation to insure that the elderly could lead safe and productive lives these programs are indeed necessary since according to the 1980 census one out of six older americans lives on an income below the poverty level when president reagan outlined his program for economic recovery before a joint session of congress and the american people on february 18 1981 he stated we will continue to fulfill the obligations which spring from our national conscience those who through no fault of their own must depend on the rest of us the poverty stricken the disabled the elderly all of those with true need can rest assured that the social safety net of programs they depend on are exempt from any cuts what has happened to that promise only 4 months after president reagan made that pledge the administrationbacked omnibus reconciliation act was passed the effect of this legislation on senior citizens programs was severe food stamps were cut 16 percent social security and railroad civil service and military retirement were cut 20 percent medicare and medicaid were cut 10 percent sharp reductions planned for social security were shelved only after a massive protest by recipients however the administration was not content to make life harder for those to whom hardship was no stranger it set out to comfort the already comfortable through a tax bill which favors the wealthy the american people were assured by the administration that this program of reductions in funds for social programs and taxbreaks for the wealthy would pull the economy out of its slump and provide benefits for all americans where are we nearly 1 year after this program was enacted the jobless rate now stands at 9 4 percent nationwidethe highest rate since the great depression this figure represents an increase of 2 5 million people on the jobless roles since last july when the republican program was enacted instead of reevaluating a program that obviously is not working the administration is simply offering the american people more of the same in its budget proposals for fiscal year 1983 the sum of the new budget proposals would mean further misery particularly for the elderly poor let me cite a few examples of the impact of some of these proposals according to the congressional budget office 2 5 million elderly who now receive food stamps would lose their benefits altogether while another 66 percent would have their benefits reduced food stamp assistance would be considered as income when determining eligibility for housing assistance similarly energy assistance would be counted as income when determining eligibility for food stamps the cumulative effect of these three proposals alone would leave many lowincome elderly with a catch22 dilemma do they choose to eat stay warm or have adequate housing unfortunately the litany of hardships the admininstrations proposals if enacted would impose continues medicare would be cut by another 2 4 billion medicaid would be cut by an additional 1 9 bilion supplemental security income would be reduced 286 million in 1982 and 1 1 billion in 1987 programs which are funded under the older americans act would have their funding levels reduced from 986 million in 1982 to 652 1 million in 1983 the title v employment program would be abolished according to the national council on aging this would cause 80 000 lowincome elderly individuals to lose jobs which enable them to be independent as well as provide valuable community service apparently undaunted by massive public support for social security the administration appears ready to push for cuts in the program once again it supported a measure adopted by the senate budget committee which called for 40 billion in unspecified cuts in social security the administration prefers to leave pinpointing exactly where the reductions will be to a special commission which will make its report after the november election the message that has been coming through to me loud and clear from the senior citizens in my district is that they simply cannot sustain any further cutbacks in the programs on which they relysome for the basic necessities of lifefood shelter and health care this administration has not kept its promise to protect the social safety net of programs which benefit the needy and the elderly this pledge has apparently been lost in the enthusiasm for a stronger defense a stubborn commitment to an economic program that is not working and the need to lower the huge deficit brought about as a result of the administrations economic policies i too favor a strong national defense and a lowered deficit however these goals can be achieved in ways other than by making further cuts in needed social programs in my view an essential first step in lowering the deficit is to cancel the third year of the kemprothreagan tax cut the military budget also needs to be given as careful scrutiny as the social programs which have already borne their share of budget cuts we must restore the american peoples shaken faith in their government as a vehicle for social and economic justice we cannot abandon the elderly and

problems with the presidents proposalsespecially the kemproth income tax cutswhich i believe could greatly worsen our pres ent inflation peter g peterson chairman of lehman bros kuhn loeb and secretary of commerce in the nixon administration impeccably republican warns that the administrations suggested tax cuts lean too much toward consumption too little toward the reinvestment we urgently need he cautioned that if even a few of the presidents assumptions are wrong we could be headed toward the largest budget deficit in our history next year henry kaufman the highly respected chief economist at salomon bros of wall street said the administrations overall program is exceedingly expansionary and does not fight inflation he said that under the pressure of kemproths 10percentayearfor3years income tax cuts interest rates easily could break the 21percent record reached last year this would cripple economic recovery when the general outline of the presidents economic package emerged earlier the prestigious investment firm of kidder peabody co noted the nations financial community must now look to house democrats to significantly modify the reagan program to maintain fiscal responsibility 0 what has happened is that some ideological radicals have gained ascendancy in parts of the new administration in the guise of budget cutting they propose to experiment with their untried pet theories using the economy of the entire united states as a guinea pig it is as kidder peabody suggested the responsibility of congress and especially the democratic majority in the house to act as loyal opposition and resist such potentially destabilizing economic experiments i supported on the house floor tax cuts which will spur investment create new jobs and improve the productivity of the american economy these tax cuts include accelerated depreciation schedules for business improved exemptions from income taxes for interest earned in savings accounts and modifications of the capital gains taxes but kemproth acrosstheboard cuts are an umproven elixir patent medicine tax breaks which favor the superrich over the middleincome people who are the backbone of our society vice president bush himself described president reagans proposals as voodoo economics i favor the general size of the reductions advanced by the president the proposal offered by house budget committee chairman jim jones agrees with the president in three out of four cases but it disagrees in some important areas the president wants to reduce significantly federal support for primary and secondary education for job training for nutrition for children and medical care for the elderly the truly needy will become truly needierand unnecessarily so he also proposes the elimination of the economic development administration an agency which has helped support redevelopment in downtown columbus and thereby economic growth in all of central ohio many of the administrations proposed reductions simply areas i saidnot necessary to curb the growth of the federal budget and controlling inflation in contrast the administration throws away hundreds of millions of dollars on the obsolete clinch river breeder reactor tobacco subsidies and traditional pork barrel water projects also worthy of noting is the refusal of the administration to close any of the notorious tax loopholes which could save more than enough to offset some of the unnecessary cuts which hurt the elderly sick and poor so badly the defense budget remains basically the same under the jones and hefner proposals as under the presidents expanded military spending vital to our national security can be maintained safely only by tax cuts prudently applied so as to arrest renewed inflationary pressures i campaigned for a balanced budget and for action to curb inflation the problem with the kemproth proposal for those of us who believe in prudent economics is this kemproths sweeping 3year tax cuts are not offset by matching budget cuts walter heller former chairman of the presidents council of economic advisers recently recommended that further personal tax cuts should be put in place only after they have been earned by further budget cuts and or clear evidence of reduced inflation that would be the path of fiscal prudence the too likely result of the kemproth as now proposed will be bigger and bigger deficits and more inflationthe very things i campaigned against we are not arguing that the economy does not need a catalyst for increased investment job creation and productivity increases but as with allpowerful medicine timing and dosage are crucial first let us cut the budget and reduce the federal deficit this will have the effect of lowering interest rates spurring productive investment and strengthening the economy in general specific tax cuts focused where they can benefit the economy without adding to inflation should be made as suggested above tax revenue then would rise and personal income taxes could be cut significantly without inflationary results i realize it might be easier politically to join in the emotional climate of the moment and approve the presidents package without question but the possible dangers for the economy are too great for any of us who believe in prudent economics to suspend judgment as a businessman a lawyer and most importantly as representative of a middleamerican district i am interested in economic growth and stability in curtailing both inflation and the expansion of the federal

week represents the basic sanity of the body politic which is increasingly rejecting the insanity of the nuclear arms race those who are absorbed in the arms race do not see things this way whether sovietor american military planners are able to construct scenarlos which they are convinced are reasonable it is even possible that a small nuclear war can look like a relatively attractive option it is probably the fact that major policymakers in the reagan administration including the secretary of defense the secretary of state the vice president and the president himself have all discussed nuclear war as both survivable and winnable although undesirable that public concern has grown perhaps of even greater concern should be the republican party platform of 1980 which called for the united states to develop nuclear supe riority in contrast to the policies of presidents eisenhower nixon and ford who sought eqyality or a balance of terror since this unreasonable and dangerous goal was in a political party convention platform many did not take it seriously reviewing the nuclear weapons policies of the reagan administration it is now clear that they are attempting to implement this part of the party platform and seek nuclear weapons domination of the united states over the soviet union the calls for a nuclear freeze are a justified reaction to this irresponsible policy a great deal has been written recently about the causes of the nuclear arms race and how it can be stopped or even reversed more than enough blame exists for all who have been involved to share responsibility i am thinking of the governments of the united states and the soviet union the military establishments of each country and the political leaders of each nation former secretary of defense under presidents kennedy and johnson robert mcnamara is a man who shared in the decisionmaking that got us in the mess we are in today his insights are therefore unique frankly i find his current candor and perspective to be truly amazing and an important contribution to our understanding of the nuclear arms race the los angeles times recently printed a fascinating interview with robert mcnamara which i will shortly the main point of this interview is mr mcnamaras observation that the nuclear arms race was spurred on by fears in the soviet union that the united states in the early sixties was seeking to achieve nuclear superiority the current goal of the reagan administration and a unitedstates firststrike capabilitya goal the reagan administration does not claim as its own robert mcnamara should know what he is talking about he in fact received memos from senior air force officials calling for a unitedstates firststrike capability while that policy was officially rejected the roots of our current nuclear arms dilemma go back to those days before i close i would like to announce that this week i will be inserting a number of additional statements ing the nuclear arms race the folly of either great power seeking a firststrike capability and the desirability of a nuclear weapons freeze at this time i wish to insert the interview with robert mcnamara in the record intervimw w i mcnamarafear of a unitedstates first strike sun as cause or arms race by robert scheer soviet fears of a surprise unitedstates nuclear first strike after the cuban missile crisis may have triggered the massive soviet buildup of intercontinental missiles in the 1960s and set off the nuclear arms race according to former secretary of defense robert s mcnamara in a recent interview with the times mcnamara cited a recently declassified document which indicates that the unitedstates air force wanted the united nations to build a firotstrike capability in 1962 mcnamara and president john f kennedy vetoed the proposal the memo given to the times by mcnamara was released under the freedom of information act to author fred kaplan mcnamara in the interview challenged the notion held by president reagan and others that the soviets nuclear buildup of the late 1960s and 1970s was designed to gain a firststrike nuclear attack capability rather mcnamara contended the buildup could be seen as a reaction to the earlier unitedstates military buildup and to rumors that the united states was preparing to strike first at the soviet union i have no doubt but that the soviets thought we were trying to achieve a first strike capability mcnamara said we were not we did not have it we could not attain it we didnt have any thought of attaining it but they probably thought we did had he been the soviet defense secretary at the time he said i would have been worried as hell about the imbalance of force and i would have been concerned that the united states was trying to build a firststrike capability because i would have had knowledge of what the nuclear strength was of the united states and i would have heard the rumors that the air force was recommending achievement of such a capability in the document titled memorandum for the president and dated nov 21 1962 mcnamara warned president kennedy it has become clear to me that the air force proposals are based on the objective of achieving a firststrike capability in mcnamaras judgment the air force recommendation went beyond the requirement of deterring a soviet attack as he wrote what ia at issue here is whether our forces should be augmented beyond what i am recommending in an attempt to achieve a capability to start a thermonuclear war in which the resulting damage to ourselves and our allies could be considered acceptable on some reasonable definition of the term mcnamara cited a memorandum he had sent kenyedy the year before in which he defined a full firststrike capability as a capability that would be achieved if our forces were so large and so effective in relation to those of the soviet union that we would be able to attack and reduce soviet retaliatory power to the point at which it could not cause severe damage to unitedstates population and industry"], [0.00770801305770874, 0.9922919869422913, 1, "i welcome the opportunity to once again contribute to the best kept secret in america the congressional black caucus constructive alternative budget to what it is that the president proposed and those who would hurt the little people of this nation would propose here today and in the few days to come i rise to address the energy function of the congressional black caucus budget this function includes the department of energy programs including research and development of new energy sources energy conservation and preparedness civilian and defense nuclear programs and rural electrification projects the congressional black caucus alternative rejects the premise that energy policy can adequately be addressed on the local level since energy is a nati nal concern the congressional bla k caucus budget retains the department of energy the doe was created to allow for a comprehensive national energy policy on energy production and supply problems as well as on international energy issues in addition the doe amasses data on energy and coordinates and funds energy research and development the dismantling of doe would result in a disunifled response to energy concerns and a disparate application of energy policy despite the vast amount of discussion which has been heard on the issue of dismantlement of doe there has been no clear showing that significant savings will accrue from dismantlement most of the department of energys functions would be scattered among the departments of commerce interior and justice another deleterious result of the threatened dismantlement of doe has been the loss of expertise due to job shifts and reductions in force because of these losses of the past and those to come the requisite skil d persons who could run many of the er ergy programs targeted for transfer are not available to the chosen departments one other program which the congressional black caucus particularly favors for continued funding is the does office of minority economic impact the administration has zero funded this program despite the fact that its funds have already been authorized the office of minority economic impact has research programs at black colleges a minority bank development program a minority business loan program and an engineering college program to name a few of its projects in addition to these activities omei has performed the task of monitoring the impact of energy programs and policies on minorities and making policy recommendations to the secretary of energy the congressional black caucus supports refunding of omei in the amount of 1 635 million a phenomenal but little known fact about this administrations energy budget is that a ful 88 percent is dedicated to nuclear programs this leaves only 12 percent for programs such as fossil research solar and conservation programs the congressional black caucus has provided some relief to the disparity in the use of the taxpayers dollar specifically the civilian nuclear programs have increased since 1981 by 98 million the atomic energy defense activity funding has increased by 1 84 billion during that period since these programs were not subjected to the severe reductions imposed on other vital programs the cbc had redistributed 20 percent of the proposed reagan increases in the atomic energy and nuclear fission programs to other energy projects the cbc again goes on record as we did last year opposing the clinch river breeder reactor deleting 253 million in funding for this project although core programs will be maintained despite these reductions the benefit of the cbcs funding allocations will be to allow vital programs which were targeted for elimination to continue energy conservation solar and renewable energy programs have been decimated over the past 2 fiscal years by the budget reductions energy conservation was reduced from a 1981 funding level of 712 million to the current administrations proposed authorization for 1983 of 21 million solar and renewable energy programs were reduced from a 1981 authorization of 500 million to the current administrations 72 million for 1983 this is a trend which cannot continue the result of the budget cuts in these areas is a rejection of the need to use energy in an efficient manner the result of cuts in these areas is the elimination of state emergency plan ning funds lowincome weatherization programs energy efficiency research programs schools and hospitals pro grams minimum energy performance standards for new appliances among others these are effective programs for example under the home weatherization program homes weatherized jumped from 96 355 in 1978 to 291 ooc in 1981 the energy savings were 23 4 percent and all initial expenditure were recouped in energy saving within 4 years the matching funds given foi energy efficiency investments ir schools and hospitals and local govern ment buildings is part of another pro gram which showed great success par ticularly in light of the fact that thes buildings rank among the top ir energy consumption the investmeni in energy efficient equipment anc practices led to the federal share cosi saved for 1 barrel of oil equivalent ir public institutions to be estimated al 2

be made with u e steel but rather with foreign steel be cause of the price difference energ efficiency use is crucial the lack of el ficiency is costly the reagan budget cutters maintal as their hue

savings of 13 billion it has cost 217 million to run those offices that amount is 196 million more than the entire energy conservation budget under reagan in 1981 50 percent of the state energy offices relied on 80 percent or more federal dollars indubitably the extreme cuts to the energy conservation budget will mean the closing of these offices or at least severe paring down and ultimately the loss of these energy and dollar savings the inefficiency of these administrations budget cuts is shown again the congressional black caucus tries to do something about these budget cuts by offering an alternative to the reagan budget by offering a more balanced budget in terms of the division of funds among the various programs in my opinion the challenge and the goal of government is to strike the happy median whereby all facets of our national community are served the pendulum of government during times on economic distress should not swing so lopsidedly that those who only have

reagan budget failure to have a bipartisan budget resolution in place by early may would court an extraordinary peril in the absence of a bipartisan alternative to the reagan budget and its multihundred billion dollar deficits a resolution to extend the debt ceiling will become a referendum on the economic performance of the administration i need not tell you that in such a referendum the administration will fall today democrats and republicans alike recoil from the harsh civilian spending cuts the extravagant waste of money on defense the intransigence on taxes from the deficits

more than 5 percent per year in real termsabout half the real rate of increase which the president seeks c hold nonmilitary spending to 1982 levels in real terms d direct the federal reserve to adjust its monetary targets and so allow interest rates to fall 2 a bill on the debt ceiling and taxes which must originate in the house ways and means committee which provides a whatever debt ceiling adjustment is needed to accommodate the recessioninduced deficit b a repeal of the july 1 1983 income tax reduction in the present circumstances the clear burden of compromise lies with the supporters of the presidents program the sources of our difficulties are the excesses of the program proposed by the president and enacted by the congress last year this is no secret the tax cuts were too large the defense buildup is vast extravagant and wasteful monetary policy is too tight to command bipartisan support you cannot ask the poor working people the middle class and the elderly to accept a greater burden of cuts while these three facets of the reagan program escape revision if the president refuses to acknowledge this then the realistic leaders of congress on this committee must simply sweep the president out of your way let me lay out for you what i and the democrats on the joint economic committee believe to be the four basic realities with which your committee must cope on taxes

loopholeclosing however desirable on the merits cannot be seriously proposed for immediate action and excise or sales taxes currently under discussion in some circles are an insult to working people and will not pass the single most dramatic and effective action this committee can take would be to propose the repeal of the july 1 1983 10 percent tax reduction to ensure passage and to guarantee the presidents signature such a repeal should be attached to the debt ceiling legislation and both should be presented for immediate action given such a guarantee of lower deficits conservatives moderates and newly awak ened antideficit liberals would support you a major crisis in the affairs of the government would be averted given this prospect of fiscal responsibility and lower interest

escalation in armed hostilities in el salvador over the last several weeks and the administrations stepped up security commitments to the duarte government indicate that the circumstances of the conflict in el salvador are changing rapidly from those a year ago when the administration assured members of this house it had no legal obligation under the war powers resolution to report to congress on the involvement of unitedstates military personnel in el salvador in a memorandum early last year the administration argued that unitedstates advisers in el salvador were not engaged in hostilities nor equipped for combat nor located in areas where such involvement would likely occur it is no longer clear that such a legal judgment holds true today the war powers resolution by which our current military involvement in el salvador must be judged calls on the president to consult with congress before introducing unitedstates armed forces into hostilities or into situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances further in any case in which such forces are introduced into hostilities or are in danger of imminent involvement in hostilities or when forces are introduced into the territory of a foreign nation while equipped for combat with certain exceptions such as training of in numbers which substantially enlarge unitedstates armed forces equipped for combat already located in a foreign nation the president is required to submit a report within 48 hours to the congress stating the circumstances requiring the involvement of unitedstates military personnel the statutory basis for his declsion and the estimated scope and duration of hostilities or involvement the resolution provides further that such forces will be withdrawn within 60 days after the president reports to congress that he has introduced such forces unless congress acts to authorize the continued presence of unitedstates military personnel in the area concerned in response to questions raised concerning the administrations obligation under the war powers resolution a year ago the state department submitted a memorandum to the congress stating that provisions of the war powers resolution did not apoly to the serding of unitedstates military advisers to el salvador because they had not been introduced into hostilities nor were they in danger of imminent involvement in iuch hostilities instead unitedstates personnel would be stationed in carefully selected areas and special precautions would be taken to provide for their constant security unitedstates personnel would neither accompaty salvildoran forces in combat situations nor act as combat advisers and would carry only personal sidearms recent events in el salvador have proved sufficiently alarming to the administration to prompt a tripling of our security assistance to the duarte government and to publicly leave the door ajar to the possibility of sending additional advisers and even unitedstates combat troops these events require that the administration thoroughly reevaluate its legal obligations to the unitedstates congress under the war powers resolution the bold guerrilla attack on ilopango air bape on january 27 1982 the destruction of the golden bridge over the lempa river in october and other examples of major guerrilla operations in the countryside and cities suggest a new level of confidence combat capability effectiveness and determination on the part of the armed guerrillas in stark contrast to the lack of such qualities a year ago during the socalled final offensive not only are the guerrillas apparently stronger today than they were a year ago but their effective military reach has expanded no longer is violence limited primarily to rural areas but it has instead spread into the capital and major salvadoran governmental military installations even the secretary of state has acknowledged that an unpredictable environment exists in el salvador today no longer can the administration have the confidence that unitedstates personnel can be safely stationed in areas of security rather there is the increasing prospect that unitedstates personnel may be inadvertently drawn into the crossfire between government and guerrilla forces the guerrillas have also made it abundantly clear in recent weeks that they intend to continue to escalate their violence in an effort to disrupt the elections scheduled for the end of march although the administration assured us a year ago that unitedstates advisers would be limited exclusively to training roles and would in no fashion be involved in combat or operational patrols nor in combat advisory roles it is increasingly unclear where the line between training and implicit us involvement in the actual planning and conduct of salvadoran government military operations is drawn the recently publicized film unitedstates personnel armed with m18 rifles suggests first that the administrations commitments to congress that unitedstates personnel would carry only personal sidearms has been violated and second that the level of danger of unitedstates personnel has increased to the point where our advisers themselves feel a compelling need in the interest of selfdefense to carry more than just personal sidearms under such circumstances it is clear that the prospect of american soldiers becoming casualties in the salvadoran war has increased dramatically finally the reporth last week regarding the stationing of a unitedstates navy destroyer off the gulf of fonseca add to the apprehension of many who view the presence of unitedstates warships with unitedstates military personnel on board in an area of tension and hostilities as a risk of potentially great consequences it would appear that the administration is treading dangerously close to the legal borderline and is at a minimum testing the authority of the war powers resolution if the administration believes that it is in the vital interests of the united states to keep or increase unitedstates military personnel in el salvador it should reconsider seriously its obligations to comply with the war powers resolution many observers inside and outside the unitedstates government have already concluded that the sending of unitedstates military advisers has been counterproductive to unitedstates policy interests and find now the difficult question to be one of how the united states can reverse this illadvised policy decision before the consequences of one wrong decision are compounded by the consequences of others accordingly this past week in a series of letters to the president i have proposed that tbe administration accept the offer of president lopez portillo of mexico to use his good offices as an intermediary in seeking political reconciliation in central america as a first step i have urged the president to anrounce that the unitedstates advisers will be withdrawn from el salvador upon the successful completion of the march elections regardless of who wins these advisers have become a symbol of american reliance upon military means of support for a government unable to control the excesses of its own military esthblishment in a situation where the fundamental problems are rooted in poverty illiteracy and social injustice the very presence of american military forcesregardless of whether they are carrying armshas had the unfortunate effect of closely identifying the united states with the human rights violations of the salvadoran military and converting what bevr s an essentially internal conflict i ato an anticolonialist struggle one of the problems of n great power is how to extricate itsulf from an illconsidered policy in vietnam 3he commitment of a small number of troops and the failed polities that followed led to the commitment of greater numbers and to policies that failed to an even greater degree by removing the advisers from el salvador at an early stage president reagan has a unique opportunity to rectify rather than multiply a mistake few american policymakers consider our sending of advisers to have been anything but a mistake not only have the advisers opened the unitedstates to international criticism from friend and foe alike but it is difficult to believe that a contingent of this minimal size could have a significant impact on the ability of salvadoran authorities to cope with insurgency the problem from a policy point of view is how to establish an appropriate quid pro quo for disengagement in the midst of the vietnam conflict henry kissinger proposed a series of very reasonable deescalation measures to the north vietnamese the problem was they were rejected and the nixon administration got locked into escalating a conflict at a time when prudence indicated the reverse course of action while vietnam analogies are not all appropriate the reagan administration would be well advised not to tie as secretary haig has proposed reduction in the number of our advisers to the actions of other states in the region policy options should be controlled in washington and not become subject to the whims of militaristic potentates bent on irrational behavior the objective of unitedstates cooperation with el salvador should be to encourage and facilitate the holding of free elections not to determine the outcome there would seem little reason to maintain military advisers after elections are successfully completed if the moderate forces of president duarte should prevail a good case could be made that having won a mandate in free elections the presence of american military advisers would no longer be needed less direct forms of support and assistance would be sufficient if the extreme right should emerge in power as many now conjecture withdrawal of our advisers would be a desirable means of disassociating the united states from the human rights violations that would likely insue at the same time announcement that a fiee election is our objective and that the advisers would be withdrawn following its successful completion would remove one of the main justifications for the extreme lefts effort to prevent salvadorans from going c the polls at the heart of the problem in central america and the caribbean basin is an assessment of whether problems are essentially rooted in longstanding patterns of injustice as the unitedstates catholic conference asserts or whether fundamentally the dilemma is one of castroite intervention as secretary haig contends if the former view is given greater weight a policy of economic assistance seems most in order if the latter military options come more to the fore conservative advocates of interventionism have a tendency to exaggerate the castroite dimension of the problem and underestimate the potential counterproductive effects of an overt unitedstates response liberal critics of american foreign policy on the other hand have a tendency to be overly generous in their assessments of the ideals and intentions of insurgency movements perhaps the most appropriate perspective is to recognize the social and economic inequities that exist but not to sympathize with the radical alternatives presented the united states has a profound influence over events in the caribbean but that influence is exercisedmost effectively when active american involvement is limited to economic assistance and peace corps kinds of activities military options dont solve social problems on the other hand economic assistance in some circumstances may not be enough but the united states acting alone on behalf of and within the confines of a smaller latin state is likely to exacerbate rather than diminish hostilities strategic options are far better exercised in concert with other latin states and at this time the most hopeful strategic initiative would appear to be the one proposed by mexican president lopez portillo his specific suggestions may be imperfect but the offer of his offices as a neutral intermediary may be the best chance to achieve a reduction in central american tension available president reagan risks a great deal if he too lightly spurns the assistance of our increasingly important neighbor to the south the president also risks support of congress and the american people if he does not comply with the strict provisions of statute contained in the war powers act"], [0.9907626817002892, 0.00923731829971075, 1, "i take this special order at this time to begin a discussion of the subject of regulatory reform and the entire issue of what has happened to the initiative in this house that was so boldly undertaken many months indeed years ago to get the bureaucracy of the federal government under control and to make it more responsible to the desires and wishes of the american people the reason i take this special order and begin this discussion is that for reasons which are unexplained to me and i think unexplainable the initia tives that have been launched in this direction have ground to a silent and mysterious halt someplace in the halls of this house what is regulatory reform all about mr speaker it is a method a means by which the american people seek to regain control over their own government the fact of the matter is that more decisions are made more rules and regulations are issued by unelected officials affecting the lives and the livelihood of all americans than there are as a result of laws passed by the congress of the united states during the average session of a congress somewhere in the neighborhood of 500 laws are passed during that same period of time almost 20 000 rules and regulations can be passed the ratio of those rules and regulations having the force and effect of law on nonelected officials as compared to those made by those elected by the people of the united states is something to contemplate much of the cynicism that the american people feel about their government is a result of the unaccountability of a bureaucracy that is remote insensitive arbitrary and sometimes yes oppressive it was out of this concern that members of congress both in the house and the other body rose up and said that we are going to change this in a bipartisan way members of my party democrats took the initiative in this effort originally to bring the bureaucracy under control through a streamlining and accountability even through the use of the legislative veto which lets members of the congress elected by accountable to the people have the final say so by reviewing and where necessary rejecting and vetoing regulations issued by unelected bureaucrats in 1975 when that issue of legislative veto first came to the floor of this house for a vote up or down on all agencies that should be covered by it 265 members of this house voted in favor if it since that time for reasons again unexplained and unexplainable there has never been an effort made to get that legislation back to this floor for action even though over a majority of the members of this house of both parties have cosponsored legislation to that effect we have amended pieces of legislation on an itembyitem basis to place this mechanism in effect to get control over these unaccountable bureaucrats and it has had an improving impact on our government recently we added this type of control over the federal trade commission different programs in the environmental protection agency and the department of agriculture but the need to make the entire bureaucracy accountable to the american people still remains in years gone past while the house of representatives has moved forward the other body has been reluctant the other body has been the one that has failed to pass this legislation but this year this year the other body by a unanimous vote adopted legislation providing for regulatory reform including a legislative veto what has happened in this house mr speaker what has happened i think is a shame because it reflects upon the members and the leadership of this house what has happened is that although regulatory reform legislation was reported out of the judiciary committee on february 25 of this year that legislationa major bipartisan effort to return control of the bureaucracy to the american peoplehas not yet been able to be voted on by the members of this house the legislative veto legislation h r 1976 which has over 250 cosponsors well over a majority of the members of this house of both parties has yet to be considered in committee or brought to the floor of this house i think it is regrettable that for reasons that cannot be explained there are those in power in this house who have been unwilling to let the voice of the american people be heard who have been unwilling and refuse to understand the force behind more than a majority of the members of this house seeking to have this opportunity to make the bureaucracy accountable and the cynicism of the american people persists about who runs their governmentis it the elected officials or the unelected bureaucrats then that cynicism is understandable and will grow until the members of this house are given the opportunity to do their will and to express the desires of the american people i think you are going to see more and more fingers pointed at the leadership of this house asking the question why is it that legislation which would require accountability on the part of unelected bureauracts is being locked in a closet pigeonholed and not even given the opportunity for consideration i suggest that there are members of this house who in november when the people get an opportunity to go to the polls and express their concerns about the future of this nation are going to hold the leadership of this house and members of this body accountable for once again frustrating the opportunity and the will and the desire of the american people to be heard on this matter what can be so wrong with a piece of legislation that passed the other body by a unanimous vote by people of both conservative and liberal persuasion by the most conservative senators and by the most liberal senators indeed the senators from your own state the commonwealth of massachusetts supported this legislation as it came through the other body what can be wrong with legislation like that that it is not even possible to let the members of this body speaking on behalf of the american people have that chance to bring accountabflity i do not know what you hear when you go to your district but one of the things that i hear is that the american people are fed up with a bureacracy that will not listen with people who control their lives and livelihood whose names they do not know and if they did could not hold them accountable that is not a phenomenon of this administration or the last administration or the administration before that that is a fact of life about the government we have the american people under our system of government are entitled to look to their elected officials and not be put upon solely by the unelected officials yes there are many indeed most of the people in the civil service of this country are dedicated and reasonable and committed individuals many of whom serve at a sacrifice for the american people and consider themselves public servants but there are others who because of this unaccountability have delegated to themselves decisionmaking powers an imposition on the american people that is unwarranted asi said this is not a liberal or a conservative issue some people have suggested that it is an approach that would favor business as opposed to consumers or environmental groups or public interest groups nothing could be further from the truth it is a twoedged sword the voice of the people can be heard through their elected officials when they cannot even get in the front door of many agencies of government there are many regulations which have been issued by this administration undoing the gains and accomplishments in the field of consumer protection or environmental protection but environmentalists and consumer advocates would have had the opportunity to deal with through regulatory reform and legislative veto just as in other instances the excesses of zealots who have gone too far could have been curbed and restrained and made accountable to the american people where those who did not suffer the inconvenience of running for public office have taken it to themselves to pass rules and regulations affecting every aspect of the life of the american public so therefore i appeal to you i urge you bring this legislation to the floor of this house it would take no more than a word from you for this legislation to come forth and let the members of this house work their will upon it on behalf of the american people failing to do that i fear that many members of this house in the elections that are coming up later this year are going to have to answer to the fact why it was that that which was wanted and desired by the american people control over their own government accountability of the federal bureaucracy was not even given the fair opportunity to be votcd on even through a majority of the members of this house have sponsored legislation to do that that is no way to run a democratic institution and if people have to pay a price for that failure of democracy then it is an appropriate price to be paid the american people want their government to be accountable to them it is indeed a government of the people and by the people and in that way it can be a government for the people therefore i urge you do that which the members of your house the members who elected you speaker of their house have asked for let the regulatory reform legislation and the legislative veto opportunity come to this house so that the members can join with their counterparts in the other body pass this legislation and help restore true democratic principles to our government"], [0.9900571703910828, 0.9900571703910828, 0, "33 years ago on december 10 1948 the

europeans through bilateral agreements which would not protect the interests of the american steel industry according to the reports much pressure was being exerted by the european economic community eec to reach a settlement that would prove unfavorable to our domestic producers consequently the executive committee met in an emergency meeting on thursday morning july 21 1982 and agreed unanimously to inform secretary of commerce malcolm baldrige of opposition to the european offer that same night secretary baldrige rejected the european offer to limit steel exports to 90 percent of the 1981 levels i would like to submit here for the record the official press release of the commerce department on this decision the unitedstates department of commerce could not accept a lastminute proposal by the european communities ec to suspend 12 steel countervailing duty cvd investigalions involving belgium france italy and the united kingdom because the legal requirement of removing the apparent injurious effects caused to the unitedstates industry by subsidized steel imports was not met the proposals were formally presented to commerce secretary malcolm baldrige at 5 30 thursday by the ambassadors of the four countries accompanied by representatives of the ec the contents of the proposals had been received that morning the ec requested that the commerce department suspend the investigation on the basis of quantitative restraint agreements as permitted in unitedstates law under that provision the deadline for reaching an agreement is midnight july 24 in announcing his decision baldrige said we welcome any attempt by the community to settle the unfair steel trade cases between the unitedstates and the ec but unfortunately these proposals are not legally acceptable unitedstates law requires that any quantitative restraint suspension agreement must eliminate the injurious effect of subsidized exports of the subject merchandise to the united states since the steel imports from the ec that caused the injury increased almost 30 percent from 1980 to 1981 the 10 percent reduction offered today from the higher 1981 levels was simply not sufficient to remove injury as required baldrige stated that if acceptable suspension agreements could have been concluded on these products the steel trade tension between the ec and the unitedstates would still not have been eliminated he noted that 19 antidumping ad cases on the same products and 13 other ad and cvd cases are still pending baldrige felt that an overall settlement leading to withdrawal of all cases was the best way to relieve the current trade tension and repeated his willingness to continue discussions with the ec to find an equitable basis to deal with the problem in its entirety as well as the proposed suspension agreements the ec required that the unitedstates accept all of the 12 proposed agreements or none in its decision the doc compared the ecs suggested restraint level to the levels at which the unitedstates international trade commission made preliminary determinations of injury in 1980 and 1982 most of the proposed restraint levels were above the levels found to be injurious by the itc doc also considered the current state of the unitedstates industry now running at less than 45 percent utilization and the level of subsidies found in the june 10 preliminary determinations which in one case amounts to 40 percent subsequent to that decision the secretary made a counterproposal to the eec that provided about a 20percent cut in steel imports unfortunately the europeans turned that proposal down in the meantime in accordance to the relevant trade laws future negotiations on these cases will require the commerce department to seek the approval of the domestic steel industry before reaching a settlement now i have been advised that the secretary will pursue additional discussions along these lines this week in brussels it would seem to be in the interests of the european community to 11 4692 co participate in these negotiations otherwise they will risk final determinations and penalties i urge the secretary to do everything in his power to settle these cases as soon as possible in order to get our steelworkers back on the job a mr bevill the war being waged against the american steel industry by foreign steel producers has taken yet another twist news reports indicate that several of the european governments which have been accused of subsidizing their steel mills and permitting them to dump their steel in this country at prices far below production costs have been applying equally unfair pressure on this government to let them plea bargain their way out of the trade suits filed against them these news reports indicate that the europeans have used the russian gas pipeline deal and other diplomatic issues in an attempt to exert a form of international blackmail against our government they want to force a negotiated settlement without the consent of the injured american steelmakers which brought the complaints if they are successful our domestic steel firms would suffer even further losses of jobs sales and would have to

the appropriation of funds in fiscal year 1981 for the board of international broadcasting and various other provisions of the bill may indirectly authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1981 such as section 119 according to chairman jones letter the committee on the budget met on july 14 and voted to support the waiver as requested by the committee on foreign affairs becausei 1 the 1981 funds authorized to be appropriated for the board of international broadcasting were included in the supplemental appropriations and rescission act of 1981 approved june 5 1981 and 2 the bill will not be

keep four awacs now operating there as a result of the iraqi conflict until delivery of five such planes could be made in 1985 the proposed sale of the f15 hardware is particularly distressing in light of the recent history of congressional concern over this matter i certainly acknowledge that the new administration has the prerogative to review and alter policies of the previous administration however given that congress approved the initial sale of the f15s only after strong assurances that they would not be equipped offensively a strong presumption must rest with rejecting any additional sales alteration of this policy would only be justified if international conditions had changed to a sufficient degree to alter previous practices i do not believe these changes have occurred i also do not believe that there are any compelling arguments which justify creating such an unstable condition for israel our most reliable ally in the middle east there has been great concern over soviet expansionism in the persian gulf area i am also greatly concerned by these developments however i do not believe that additional military sales to the saudis will end these soviet efforts in this very volatile region the equipped f15 and awacs would greatly alter the regional balance of power however these sales would not significantly reduce any soviet threat if the soviets make the decision to go beyond afghanistan these f15s and awacs in the entire scope of the world military balance would serve as only a minimal deterrent what could provide a powerful deterrent and have a very positive effect on the region as a whole would be a change in policies by the saudi government to aid the peace effort currently this government has shown no inclination to back away from its support of the plo an organization committed to the destruction of israel and the saudis continue to oppose the peace efforts undertaken as a result of the camp david accords if we are even considering the sale of these powerful weapons to this country then a definitive change in policy seems to be the minimum that we should expect the saudis refusal to make these concessions means that we are selling offensive weapons to a country which is not our friend and is threatening the survival of our ally israel an additional consideration is what this sale means for the economy of israel the administration has also announced that we will sell israel 600 million of additidnal weaponry this to me is a clear acknowledgment of the additional demands the saudi sale will place on israels defense system it is important to note that 40 percent of israels budget is already spent on defense and further escalation of these demands will only further strain israels economy to risk this

personal savings by all americans a brief history of the issue lndicatts the american willingness to save has substantially decreased over the last 10 years by the end of 1978 the rate of disposable income savings in the united states reached a 30year low of under 5 percentfar less than any other western democracy for example great britain has a 13percent savings rate west germany 15 percent and japan 25 percent each of these countries offers generous tax concessions or government bonuses to savers the importance of savings to productivity and our overall economy cannot be overstated onethird of all the capital in this country is made available through personal savings without adequate savings there cannot be sufficient investments in industry small business and home construction the result is higher consumer prices and increased unemploymnent last year recognizing this critical need to stimulate savings the congress enacted two measures that gradually raised the interest a person could receive on his or her savings deposits and allowed 200 400 for couplesof that interest to be taxfree for a 2year experimental period unfortunately while these two landmark laws represented a positive shift in unitedstates economic policy they have not resulted in any noticeable rise in personal savings interest rates on savings deposits have remained close to their original levels and as feared the 200 400 temporary interest tax exclusion does not seem to be enough of an incentive to save in fact studies show that an estimated 95 percent of all the money saved in america is earned by individuals and businesses whose interest and dividends income exceed the 200 400 limit earlier this year i introduced a bill h r 3049 to remedy this situation my legislation would make permanent the current 200 400 tax exclusion on interest and dividends and raise it to 1 000 2 000 for savings interest only in addition my bill would allow all persons age 65 and over to earn taxfree interest on their savings deposits the conablehance substitute offers similar relief aimed at providing a shortterm and much needed boost to our slumping savings and loan and thrift industry under the terms of this legislation depository institutions would be authorized to issue 1year taxexempt savings certificates they would allow single taxpayers to earn as much as 1 000 2 000 for couplesin taxfree interest the certificates which would cost 500 and above would yield 70 percent of the interest rate on 52week treasury bills and would be available for a 15month period beginning on october 1 the certificate would allow depository institutions to retain and attract many of the investment dollars that have recently gone to competing investment opportunities that currently offer higher returns i might add that these pavings certificates are far more prefprable than a proposal that has been offered to lower the returns on competing money market funds rather than penalizing the small saver by eliminating one of their few opportunities to get a fair market return on his or her dollar additional investment opportunities should be made available the taxexempt savings certificates provide such an opportunity as an original member of the house select aging committee i would like to emphasize however that these taxexempt savings certificates are not the final solution to our nations dismal savings rate especially as it relates to the elderly first the certificates would only be offered for a 15month period allowing the troubled depository institutions to revitalize thermselves over a 2year period but falling to provide any longterm relief for either the institutions or the saver second many senior citizens cannot afford to tie up 500 or more of their savings for a 1year period they depend heavily on their savings to pay for daily living expenses including emergency medical needs under the proposed certificate plan a person would receive stiff interest penalties for withdrawing funds early i favor a more flexible savings incentive plan that would incorporate the taxexempt savings certificate idea with the bill i authored providing acrosstheboard taxfree interest for senior citizens unfortunately i am restricted by the rule from offering such a compromise proposal in the form of an amendment as a result i am supporting the taxexempt certificate plan as the most responsible plan under these circumstances and another major step toward permanent and meaningful small saver relief we must not forget however that savings interest represents nearly 25 percent of the total income for persons age 65 and over in additions twothirds of all savings accounts in the united states belong to persons 5 years and older certainly then any longterm small savers relief should address the special needs of our elderly that is why i continue to offer my bill h r 3049 as an effective solution to the savings rate problem in our nation let me finally express my support for the additional savings incentive contained in the substituteincreased retirement investment opportunities under the conablehance amendment the current 1 500 limit on individual retirement account ira contributionrq would be increased to 2 000 2 250 for couples in addition for the first time employees contributing to an employersponsored pension plan could also claim the 2 000 2 250 ira tax deduction in addition the maximum tax deductible contributions to selfemployment keogh retirement plans would double from 7 500 to 15 000 both of these retirement savings in centives are expected to attract millions of new savings dollars while allowing individuals to plan for a more financially secure retirement simply stated increased savings by americans will do as much to stimulate our economy and increase productivity as any other economic tool the conablehance substitute provides responsible and effective tax incentives for savings and i urge that it be adopted today 9"],

to express my support for the efforts of this group to contribute to a peaceful resolution of the conflict in northern ireland the friends of ireland came together primarily out of concern over the violence prevailing in northern ireland our objective is not only to develop a close working relationship with the republic of ireland but also to inform the american public of all aspects of the conflict working toward a solution which will respect the rights and traditions of all the inhabitants of northern ireland two recent events relating to northern ireland seem to me to hold out hope for an end to the fighting the first is the result of a poll conducted by the london sunday times among the people of northern ireland which offers a revealing glimpse of the mood and aspirations of both catholics and protestants more important it suggests promising directions for future talks the sunday times poll shows that contrary to the stereotypes arising out of the endless violence the vast majority of the people of northern ireland are strongly opposed to the use of violence to achieve political ends even the tiny violentminded minority has declined radically in the past few years negotiations toward an adequate political solution would receive overwhelming popular support right now furthermore the results of the poll show that although the majority and minority have radically different views of the ideal settlement there is common ground between them two thirds of all respondents representing a crosssection of the population indicated that they would aecept a settlement based on an independent assembly with powersharing guarantees for the catholic minoritythe principle embodied in the sunningdale agreement in 1973 which was blocked at the time by extremist elements eight years of violence are a powerful argument against extremists on both sides other poll results indicate that the political polarization which led to the election of irish repuiblican army terrorists and protestant hardliners in the last election has decreased and may diminish further if moderation ii 4493 results in progress toward a settlement however continuation in the status quo may cause this conciliatory mood to evaporate especially among the catholic minority the sunday times poll notes a vast and growing gulf between the catholic community and the british government the british army originally welcomed as protectors by an embattled minority have earned the fear and dislike of most catholicsnot just the ira and its sympathizers this gulf however could narrow if the government demonstrates a willingness to make concessions to the minority point of view abandoning the narrowmindcd approach which is leading to increased tension in the province a second event may provide a chance to end the current stalemate membe~rs of the irish commission on justice and peace an agency of the catholic church in the republic have succeeded in drafting a settlement which would end the hunger strikes in the maze prison and lessen the tension between the two sides brought on in part by the propaganda victories of the ira i join many of my colleagues in congress in urging that prime minister thatcher and her government review the opportunities presented by this draft and consider the advantages of waiving their insistence on points which serve only to limit british op1 tions in pursuing an end to the violence in its approach to the conflict in northern ireland mrs thatchers government has concentrated on controlling the activities of the ira british government officials in northern ireland appear to view their role as that of the forces of law battling terrorists criminally masquerading as political dissidents in this light better policing may seem to be the key to suppressing the violence however the catholic community has been understandably uncooperative with this effort in the bloody context of irish history the catholic minority cannot see british attempts to stabilize an unsatisfactory social order as anything but continued oppression for the catholics the army brought british rule without british justice due process and protection of individual rights britains most revered legacy to america are notoriously absent from proceedings against alleged terrorists in northern ireland the right to trial by jury protections against selfincrimination the right to counselall are abridged or suspended in the socalled diplock courts set up under the prevention of terrorism act accused terrorists are tried and usually convicted by a single judge as many as 90 percent of convictions are obtained solely on the basis of confessionselicited after an average of 3 days of detention followed by months of waiting for trial in an atmosphere tainted by repeated charges of physih 4494 co cal abuse and psychological torture under the judges rules prevailing in the rest of the united kingdom or under any reasonable judicial system these confessions would be considered highly suspect in the diplock courts they result in a conviction rate of 94 percent most of those arrested and convicted under these procedures are catholic the british government dismissed bobby sands and his compatriots as common criminals perhaps they were but they were not convicted under common conditions bobby sands it is said had a string of murders and terrorist attacks on his conscience he was convicted only of being present in a car in which a gun was found for which he was sentenced to 14 years in jaila term which anywhere else in england would be considered presposterous the british goverrnent claims he was just a common thug but it has never adequately proved that to a jury of his peers let alone the world is it any wonder that men convicted under special procedures demand special treatme t mrs thatcher has refused to negotiate with the prfsoners in the maze in her words one of the most humane and liberal prison systems in the world on principle one does not negotiate with terrorists since the british government has already waived so many of the basic principles of british justice in northern ireland however one may wonder why this particular principle is of such overriding importance that it must be upheld at the cost of continuing bloodshed at any rate the british government does not object as a rule to negotiating with terrorists lord carrington the british foreign minister recently stated that he was willing to meet with noted terrorist yasir arafat in the interests of peace in the middle east inspired negotiations with rhodesian terrorists led to the birth of the nation of zimbabwe a proud achievement of british foreign policy however suppose the british instead of negotiating with mugabe and his associates had instead cordoned off the suburbs of salisbury and announced that they would defend forever the inhabitants right to remain within the british empire meanwhile allowing this little enclave to govern itself in a fashion repugnant to the principles of british democracy would they be as eager to denounce the violent response of black dissidents as terrorism terrorism cannot be condoned under any circumstances the vicious behavior of the ira and of the ulster volunteer force serves no legitimate purpose it only poisons the atmosphere and adds to the fear and suffering of the people whose rights these organizations supposedly champion as mrs thatcher has accurately pointed out these terrorist groups are engaged chiefly in deny ng others their first right the right to life random violence and brutal often misdirected retaliations have taken the lives of thousands of innocents since the fighting began in 1969 1 am proud that the efforts of prominent irishamerican politicians have succeeded in dimninishing the american base of support for ira operations and i hope that by participating in the activities of the friends of ireland i will help to diminish that support still further americans of irish descent must understand that support for the ira whether direct or channeled through organizations such as the irish northern aid society recently ordered by a federal district court to register as an agent of the ira can only inflict further suffering on tht people of northern ireland catholic as well as protestant aid to extremists will only thwart any efforts to moderate the conflict and end the violence mrs thatchers government has stated that it considers its prime responsibility in northern ireland to be protection of the lives of its citizens all other considerations are secondary this is an approach made in good faith to a tragic and seemingly intractable political impasse and it is true that the violence has abatedat least outside the detention centerssince the terrifying days when the british army first marched in to rescue the catholics of bogside from their fellow citizens however the authoritarian attitude carries with it certain risks selective protection of rights under an arbitrary system of justice amounts at best to order without law in short tyranny clearly the catholic community sees it that way the sunday times poll shows that the catholic community in belfast overwhelmingly disapproves of the british governments handling of the situation in northern ireland their profound and increasing alienation is demonstrated in the same poll by increasing despair about the prospect of peace in the future especially among the young after hundreds of years of oppression and 50 years of gerrymandering discrimination and the hostility of the ruling class the catholic minority took its cue from the american civil rights movement of the sixties and began to march for civil rights and an equitable share of power in the local government this movement was met almost immediately with violence in 1969 as in 1914 the extremists of the ruling order were the first to arm mrs thatchers government in denouncing the undeniable atrocities of the ira should keep in mind what the catholics of belfast and bogside have never forgottenthat the provisional ira was born out of catholic fear to defend the minority against the ulster police and their auxiliary thugs mrs thatcher justifies her attitude toward the ira by saying that ~ if 1 the bomb is seen to succeed then the terrorist has beaten the ballot box 0 but the catholics of northern ireland have never had much success with the ballot box people who cannot turn to statesmen for protection will inevitably turn to terrorists the ira will continue however unjustly to win the propaganda war until the british government can offer its citizens more than the unpalatable choice between repression and lawlessness in 1969 the catholic minority demanded civil rights and found itself in danger of mass violence the british government has protected their lives to a certain extent but their original aspirations civil rights and equitable representation have been all but forgotten in the drive to impose order on an unresolved conflict most catholics now identify the british army as an ally of the other side the claim that british rule weighs equally heavily on the protestant majority is hardly credible to a people who remember that the arrival of the army was followed by mass internment a barbaric action directed almost exclusively against the catholic community or who listen to the pronouncements of a government which alternates assurances to the majority that their wishes will forever be respected with denunciations of the ira as the root of all evil in the province more years of military rule in northern ireland will have anything but a stabilizing effect continuation of the present order can only result in further alienation of the catholic community perpetuate violence and increase despair it is time to stop wasting the lives of british soldiers and irish civilians trying to maintain an unworkable status quo the settlement drafted by the irish commission for justice and peace offers a ray of hope in the grim impasse between british prison authorities and ira prisoners i urge the government to seize this opportunity it is rare for the ira to show signs of moderation such concessions must be rewarded if northern irish politics are to recover from their sectarian paralysis the people of northern ireland are weary of violence most would be ready to accept a reasonable settlement concessions on both sides would improve the climate for achieving such a settlement and lighten the despairing view of the future held by most of the catholic minority this chance is too important to be thrown away for the sake of a hypocritical and inconsistent principle sidney smith a british essayist of the 19th century once observed sourly thatthe moment the very name of ireland is mentioned the gnglish seem to bid adieu to common feeling common prudence and common sense and to act with the barbarity of tyrants and the fatuity of idiots unfortunately the history of british rule in ireland bears out this bitter view the british government is no mere impartial peacekeeping force the army bias in favor of one side has become so obvious that one observer has characterized its role as that of the third combatant britain bears a heavy responsibility for the distrust and hatred prevailing in northern ireland today so far the response of the british government to the irishi commission proposal has been discouraging while british authorities remain intransigent even on symbolic concessions another hunger striker has died the terrorists of the ira in abandoning the demand for political status have shown themselves more willing to make concessions than the government

resolution does not violate the concept of home rule because language restrictions are often times attached to the annual appropriation bills for the district of columbia he went on to cite examples such as the provision prohibiting the use of funds to implement a hiring system that uses a drawing to rank prospective police officers and firefighters who pass the written test the restriction on the transfer of sludge outside the district of columbia and the denial of funds for the local gambling board let me make it very clear that certainly congress can and does place restrictions on the use of funds but there is really no comparison between restrictions on the use of money and the disapproval of a local ordinance which has been approved by locally elected officials let me explain why with respect to the police and fire hiring policy the language placed in the appropriation bill does indeed prohibit the city from implementing the system of a drawing to detcrmine the selection order of those who pass the written test but this system was put in place as an administrative matter by the mayor with the city councils consent it did not go through the length process which gives all those who wish a chance to be heard on an issue and results in an ordinane that comes from those most directly involved on the second issue the house merely provided a temporary 60day delay in the transporting of sludge to a new landfill that is much different than completely turning around a statute that has been debated and approved by the local legislature and chief executive concerning the gambling board there was no language in the appropriation bill prohibiting the use of funds for implementing the gambling initiative the house did absolutely nothing on that proposal so the gentlemens argument that his disapproval resolution does nothing more than what is done through language on appropriation bills is spurious and not supported by the facts let me say at this point that even though language provisions are included on appropriation bills many members feel that it is wrong for the congress to dictate how the local government should spend revenues which for the most part are raised from taxes fees and charges imposed on local residents i realize this is an emotional issue and that many of the points in d c act 469 may not have been fully explained arid although the congress has the authority to place language in an appropriations measure that limits the use of funds or delays an effective date there can be no question in anyones mind that such language provisions are entirely different than disapproving a local ordinanceone that has received the benefit of public hearings and the leadership and approval of a locally elected mayor and city council the facts do not support the comparison the gentleman from illinois attempted to make earlier and even if the facts were accurate one wrong does not justify another regardless the gentlemans disapproval resolution goes deeper in that it pierces the veil of integrity as far as the issue of local selfgovernment and home rule are concerned it is clear that the government of the district of columbia acted within its authority in passing the sexual assault reform act in doing so it was acting within the authority which is was granted under the home rule act of 1973 passage of this resolution of disapproval would be a clear and dangerous violation of home rule although since 1973 there have been 10 resolutions of disapproval considered in only one instance when the council attempted to dictate location of chanceries was such a resolution passed and the law overturned in that instance there was a clear and compelling federal interest i do not believe such a case can be made here it should be noted that some 24 states have enacted provisions regarding sexual assault and sexual conduct among consenting adults which are consistent with the law passed by the district of columbia city council beyond this fact though this act neither violates the constitution exceeds the authority granted under home rule nor violates a federal interest it is a sad day when the clarion call of a small band of zealots in this body railroad legitimately enacted laws because those laws do not meet their standard of morality the singleminded nature of this resolution will make a mockery of progress toward home rule here in the district of columbia passage of this disapproval will assure the residents of this city that for all the talk about home rule and the need to encourage selfgovernance the congress remains ready to step in whenever it is so inclined to second guess the actions of this citys lawfully elected government such a mixture of morality and hypocrisy should be odious to the members of this body i strongly urge the defeat of this resolution"]], "top_unsure": [[3.725290298461914e-05, 0.5000372529029846, 0, "well i appreciate the explanation of the gentleman

to go along with each of the programs that we have started then suddenly we find they are costing more than we can afford in any one year and instead of making choices we slow them all down and that

think there is widespread support for the legislation and for that reason i think we ought to accept the inevitable but i think when we consider honest economic reform when we look at these areas where we can truly have an impact on the budget and truly try to turn this economy around i reiterate the statistics given us by the gentleman from iowa the 1 per year per person cost that this program means to the american people is worth that price we need compare that 1 only to the 400 per person that we now pay for imported oil compare that to the 350 that we pay per person for the interest on the the national debt and we are today considering 1 per year per person for good dairy products that are produced in the united states i think that every single dairy farmer anywhere in this country will repeat what my dairy farmers told me this last weekend we are willing to support the president we are willing to go along with the congress in fighting for economic reform but keep in mind what that cost is to the dairy farmers across this country today as a result of this legislation we can fully expect that each and every dairy farm family on the average will lose 6 000 so that the american consumer can lower a part of that 1 per year per person keep in mind what minimum wage is today when we consider that 3 35 is what we are willing to pay the american worker we need only compare that to 2 89 we now pay for the dairy farmer per hour for the products that he provides keep in mind that we have an abundant supply of good quality dairy products in this country ii11173 that we have come to accept as a routine fact but that is not true in other countries not in those parts of the world where dairy products are scarce we have good dairy products today not because we have provided the dairy industry with a preponderance of federal dollars but because they have made the very best of a program and they have made it work well i do not ask that we fight this dairy increase on april 1 but i do call on the administration to do what they have the administrative power to do and that is to set a floor at 75 percent there is no time not 1 year since 1949 that we have dropped below 75 percent of parity not one and yet today we stand here debating this issue we are considering a parity level below 73 percent for the first time the administration can change that and on april 1 i think it is incumbent upon them to set a floor of 75 percent so that we do not put the entire load the whole effort to balance the budget and produce economic reform on the backs of the dairy farmers of america"]]}
