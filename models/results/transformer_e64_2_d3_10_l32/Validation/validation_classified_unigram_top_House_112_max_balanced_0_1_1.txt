beef commercials everybody remembers that well here is the question wheres the jobs wheres the jobs i remember a little over 2 years ago the president promising that if we passed an 800 billion stimulus unemployment would not exceeded 8 percent well where did that get us in fact if you look at the presidents own charts they said that by this time under this stimulus plan unemployment would be about 6 5 percent i will tell you that is compelling when you see that on a chart when you are a country facing a huge economic crisis in a slide that is very compelling but it didnt work it was a waste we wasted 800 billion of hardearned money most of which was borrowed on something that didnt work now americans are still feeling the pain in fact unemployment went up towards 10 percent counties in my district in illinois have unemployment upwards of 11 percent it didnt work at all and now i have actually heard our colleagues on the other side of the aisle float a second stimulus they say well 800 billion wasnt enough it probably needed to be more well why dont we just make it 5 trillion or 10 trillion if we can just print money and borrow it tax borrow and spend our way to prosperity make it 10 trillion that is ludicrous we know that is ludicrous i hail from illinois illinois is the presidents home state illinois has a huge problem with folks looking for work that cant find it illinois used to be a manufacturing economic powerhouse in the united states it is not hard to drive around and see abandoned warehouses or abandoned factories joliet illinois a city in my district knows that all too well they understand that so what do we do well recently illinois came up with a decision well the budget is bad yeah the budget is bad because you are running business out of your state as a result they say we have to raise taxes so in springfield they raised the individual income tax rate and then they raised the corporate tax rate now there has got to be some good news to this right well the state of illinois has had 300 million in increased tax revenues that they have seen from this corporate tax increase oh but if you read the wall street journal just shortly ago you would read that 240 million has already been given away to these corporations to incentivize them to stay in illinois because they were looking at leaving because of this high tax rate i will tell you the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and over again but expecting different results we cannot tax borrow and spend our way to prosperity you talk to any small businessman out there small businesswoman or job creator owner of a factory that is just trying to take their products to market and they will tell you the biggest hindrance one of the biggest hindrances besides a lack of confidence is the government i have talked to a lot of people and said how much better would your life be if you werent forced to sit around day after day and just fill out government paperwork you could take that employee and make them productive they may be able to go out and sell goods they may be able to go out and expand the business nope we have got to tax and regulate in this town this town is really good at taxing and regulating at putting things through a bureaucracy and letting bureaucrats have their way we are going off a cliff and it is time to pump the brakes it is absolutely time for us to get deadly serious about reducing the size of the federal government cutting spending and getting americans back to work our colleagues on the other side of the aisle like to say where is your jobs plan well we have put forward plenty of jobs plans one of them includes drilling for oil here at home which we will get into which my good friend here actually that will be speaking soon sponsored and i commend him for that but there is a fundamental difference between the two parties here the democrats believe that government creates jobs you hear that all the time in what they say listen closely they say we just need a jobs bill we need 800 billion in more spending we need this program what you are going to hear tonight is the republican view the federal government doesnt create jobs the federal government cant make jobs we can take tax money and put it through a bureaucracy and spit out a paycheck jobs are created in the free market we can create an environment for job creation and that is what our freshman class came here to do and we aim to do it"], [0.0012278466019779444, 0.0012278466019779444, 0, "i appreciate your yielding me some time let me go forward with what mr thompson was just saying and what you were just commenting on about prosperity just today i had a businessman in my office relaying to me a conversation he had with one of the liberal democrat senators and he was talking about the issues that concerned him and his business she was arguing over and over again about how government needs to do all the regulatory constraints on business and how businesses need to be taxed higher and its not fair for businesses to be making money at the levels that they are in fact just today we saw some of our democratic colleagues talk about the oil companies and the kind of money that they have been making with increased prices of gasoline finally in frustration this democrat senator said to this businessman all youre concerned about is profit you just want to make a profit well thats what business does it makes a profit for its shareholders if its a corporation it makes a profit for small businesses the policies of this administration the policies that weve seen from our democratic colleagues when nancy pelosi was running the house now with harry reid running the senate and certainly the obama administration theyre trying to destroy profits theyre trying to destroy our economy in my opinion in fact the president himself has said that he doesnt mind seeing gasoline prices go up as long as they go up incrementally he doesnt want to see the massive increases but as long as they keep going up his own energy secretary dr chu fairly recently said somehow we have to find a way to make gasoline in the united states at the same price that it is in europe which is roughly 8 a gallon today the policies of this administration are doing just exactly that today in the science space and technology committee we were talking about fracking the epa scientist that is studying fracking admitted that there has not been one single incidentnot onewhere fracking has been implicated in contaminating drinking water not one but i believe this administration is doing everything it can to try to destroy energy production in this country and to try to destroy the free enterprise system in fact the president himself said that if his policies go into effect to use his own words energy prices will necessarily skyrocket well whos going to be hurt whos going to be hurt when fuel prices go up and food prices go up not only gasoline and diesel fuel i was talking to a manager in a restaurant just last week in athens georgia and was asking him about his food prices in his restaurant and what is going on because of the high cost of gasoline he said his suppliers are adding a fuel surcharge onto the cost of the foods that hes buying and selling in his restaurant and its the policies of this administration that are doing that just yesterday i had a constituent of mine whos an egg producer in georgia come in and talk about some of the issues that he faces i am from georgia im a good southerner and i love my grits and cornbread for folks who are not southerners grits are made from corn cornbread obviously thats selfexplanatory where that comes from i think even yankees will know that cornbread comes from corn too the thing is that i as a good southerner cannot see driving down the road burning up my grits and cornbread in the fuel tank of my gmc yukon that i used as my office actually when i was making house calls as a medical doctor i hear our democratic colleagues talk about we need to remove the subsidies for the oil companies well the american people need to know that those subsidies are actually tax credits theyre not true subsidies as such in fact harry reid was recently wanting a subsidy for gold mining in his own state of nevada he also wanted us to continue funding the cowboy poetry festival in his home state weve got to stop spending these outrageous funds that the federal government has been spending and we need to start creating jobs in a strong economy the best way to do that is to get rid of the policies of this administration that are destroying jobs destroying our economy increasing the cost of gas and diesel fuel for farmers and everybody in this country but back to my egg producer friend ive got a chart here that we made up in our office a dozen eggs in georgia we have the subsidieswhich are really not subsidies for the oil companies theyre just tax credits but we have subsidies for ethanol production which are true subsidies our administration has tried to pick winners and losers one of the winners that they picked is the ethanol production thats been a total failure and what that has done is increase the cost of gasoline its increased the cost of food across this country too in fact the major ingredient in feed for chickens is corn corn when i when i was farming back a number of years ago was 2 50 a bushel now its approaching 8 a bushel in 2005 before this ethanol subsidy the total feed cost per dozen eggsso when a consumer goes out and buys a dozen eggsthe food cost in that dozen eggs was 21 cents per dozen of eggs now 2011 its approximately 52 cents per dozen so who pays for that does the egg producer no its the consumer when you go to the grocery store and buy a dozen eggs youre paying more money for the failed policies of this administration particularly when it has to do with energy if we start drilling for oil tapping into our natural gas supplies start producing coal particularly doing the clean coal technology that we have having an alloftheabove energy policy whats going to be the longterm outcome for the american consumer for every single american its going to lower the cost of eggs and milk and bread because its going to lower the cost of the production of all the foodstuffs every single good and service in this country is affected by these high costs of gasoline and fuel oil diesel fuel et cetera the people who are going to be hurt the most are the poor people those on limited incomes our senior citizens i hear over and over again our democrat colleagues say that republicans are in the back pockets of big oil wrong i would like to see us end all subsidies all of them but particularly the ethanol subsidy which has not made any sense whatsoever and lets start developing our own energy resources which will create jobs here in america just yesterday and today weve been debating three bills that came out of our natural resources committee those three bills will enable us to start tapping into the godgiven energy resources that we have in this country help us to be less dependent upon foreign sources for energy if the president will ever sign those three bills into law the shortterm effect i think its been estimated is that 200 000 new jobs are going to be created so 200 000 new jobs will be created just with those three bills just to be able to open up developing our own energy resources here in america that the president is blocking long term those three bills its estimated will create 1 2 million new jobs here in the united states american jobs and help create a stronger economy the failed energy policies of this administration are hurting job creation they are hurting our economy theyre raising the cost of gasoline theyre raising the cost of diesel fuel theyre raising the cost of fuel oil theyre going to hurt egg producers and thus egg consumers consumers of all goods and services your food costs are going to go up the cost of every good and service in this country is going to go up all because of the failed policies of this administration because we cannot develop our own energy resources our godgiven resources that we have in this country i submit if a nation is not energy independent its not a secure nation and thats where we are today weve got to become energy independent and how is that going to happen former unitedstates senator everett dirksen one time said when he feels the heat he sees the light the most powerful political force in america is embodied in the first three words of the unitedstates constitution we the people when we the people start contacting members of congress particularly the democrat members of the house and the members of the unitedstates senate and demand that we develop our own energy resources here in america that we have an all of the above energy policy that looks at everythingnuclear energy alternative sources clean coal oil gaseverything which we must do and thats what republicans are fighting for if enough people all over this country will contact their senators and their members of congress and say lets develop our own energy resources lets develop american jobs lets develop a strong economy here in america then we can do so but its up to we the people to be able to demand that from your elected representatives thank you mr pearce for yielding to me i appreciate the great job youre doing as chairman of the western caucus and im honored to be a part of that caucus before i close i encourage people to go on my web site broun house gov and they can actually look at all the things on this chart they can look at it in fine detail and understand how high energy costs are creating high prices for eggs in the grocery store thank you mr pearce"], [0.0012589739635586739, 0.0012589739635586739, 0, "i have joined some of my colleagues here tonight to talk about the most pressing issue in this country which is job creation private sector job creation and what we need to do to get our country back on the path to prosperity and job growth i had a jobs conference in the second congressional district my district down in arkansas in little rock a couple of weeks ago we held it at the clinton library it really was an extension of the 25 or so town halls that ive had this year in that we talked a lot about jobs and i thought that a jobs conference would be a good idea because who better to ask about job creation than job creators so we had five panels over 60 panelists and i wanted to hear from the job creators in the second congressional district i asked them two main questions what are the obstacles that you face in creating jobs and what opportunities do you see as i indicated earlier this was really an extension of what ive been talking to constituents about for the 9 months ive been in office and even before that i expected i would hear answers to those questions consistent with what i have heard in town halls in meetings in my office and throughout the year and i wasnt surprised what i heard from the over 60 panelists that gathered at the clinton library in little rock a couple of weeks ago what i heard was uncertainty is the number one obstacle to job creation in this countryuncertainty now ive heard that word used a lot since ive been here i heard it a lot last year when i was traveling around my district before i ever came to congress and it was pretty clear has been pretty clear to me and still is that uncertainty is the biggest problem we face the job creators that gathered in little rock at the jobs conference were from the manufacturing industry energy industry health care retail financial services aerospace infrastructure construction real estate you name it agriculture we had folks from all across the spectrum and they all indicated that uncertainty is the biggest obstacle to job creation what kind of uncertainty were they talking about well the number one type of uncertainty cited by job creators was regulatory uncertainty they indicated at the conference this jobs conference that number one in many instances they know new regulations are coming but they have no idea what theyre going to be so they have no idea whether theyre going to be able to comply with those by spending a little extra money no extra money or a whole lot theyre also concerned about regulations that are floated theyre floated out by the agencies as a potential regulation that may or may not be implemented and those sorts of regulations give these job creators great pause because they dont know whether theyre going to have to comply with them and its not just one agency and its not just one industry i will say that the epas name came up more than any other the job creators made it very clear that there are a number of regulations coming out of the federal agencies that they are concerned about and the epa has issued a number of regulations and some that are yet to be enacted that these job creators were very concerned about i heard from the panelists the common theme that theyre not against regulations weve always had regulations at least since ive been around and were going to continue to have regulations and we need reasonable regulations to keep our water and air clean i have a 4yearold and a 19monthold and i want them to have a clean and safe environment but were not talking about just regulations reasonable regulations were talking about excessive overly burdensome regulations that in some cases require such drastic steps to comply that they just run people out of business weve dealt with a lot of those here in the house trying to reverse some of the stuff coming out of the administration i heard from our energy industry the energy corporations and the electric cooperativessome of the panelists represented those companiesand they indicated if some of the epa rules are implemented as they have been proposed they could result in the shutting down of several power plants in arkansas with a potential impact of raising energy costs 25 percent now these same panelists said look were not necessarily against this sort of regulation the sort of regulation theyre referring to but the time frame for compliance is so short that theres no way its almost humanly impossible for them to comply with some of the epas mandates so we heard a lot about the epa but not just the epa hhs the department of labor many other agencies here in washington put out regulations often with no or little regard to the impact those regulations are going to have on the folks back in my district and around the country so regulatory uncertainty was specifically identified as an obstacle to job creation in this country in addition to regulatory uncertainty theres uncertainty over the health care law is the health care law even going to be implemented or not certainly i voted to repeal the health care law that passed in the last congress i think we need health care reform but not the health care reform we got now the courts are looking at the health care law and theres a good chance in some folks opinion and my opinion that the supreme court might strike the individual mandate portion of the presidents health care law the health care law that we have now so theres a lot of uncertainty surrounding that theres also uncertainty over our fiscal situation the president had a perfect opportunity to lead after his bipartisan debt commission came out with some recommendations i dont agree with all of them but it was a good place to start but instead right after they came out with their recommendations late last year early this year the president came out with his budgetno reform of medicare to save it no reform of social security to save it no reform of medicaid just keep on spending so we missed an opportunity there but the debt is a part of that uncertainty the debt impacts our currency valuation and it impacts our markets you dont have to look far just look at whats going on in europe its sort of like youre looking in a crystal ball and whats going on in europe is potentiallynot identicalbut potentially in some regards our future thats where were headedmore uncertainty so it was very clear after listening to all of these job creators that the problem is not that the federal government hasnt spent enough money weve spent 1 trillion on the last stimulus at a cost of about 300 000 per job discretionary spending has gone up 84 percent under this administration i dont think in fact i know that spending is not the problem its the uncertainty that the job creators addressed so what were going to talk about here tonight is what weve been doing for the last 9 months to address the uncertainty on regulations with regard to the debt and our spending and with regard to our tax code so that we can remain competitive what have we been doing here in this body in the majority in the house to address the uncertainty that i think beyond dispute is the biggest obstacle to job creation in this country and im citing the job creators of my district weve been doing a whole lot over the last 10 months we passed a lot of legislation i think weve had about 800 votes unfortunately a lot of those good ideas are stacking up like cordwood over in the unitedstates senate we pass it send it down to them and they stack it up thats the way its worked for the last 10 months or so i am happy to be joined by my colleagues here i thought wed talk a little bit about the different things that we passed that the american people would have heard a lot more about if they had been acted upon and become law but most folks dont hear a lot about them because they go down to the other end of the building and they just sit there like that little bill sitting on capitol hill that some of us grew up with as a cartoon its just a bill its not a law i am happy to have my friends join me here tonight on the floor to talk about jobs and what weve been doing in the house over the last 10 months i yield to the gentleman from new york"],

and politically expedient to make targets of energy companies these are companies who invest their own capital and resources to increase our countrys energy supply and the security of our nation they want nothing more than to operate in a free market environment without excessive government regulations however in a move to deflect the spotlight from this administrations own failings and the democrat partys own failings and their incompetent policies this administration and many in congress find it easier to attack the success of the energy companies than to actually confront the challenges that we face often espousing policies to increase government interference in the marketplace that do more harm than good recently companies like koch industries which employs more than 10 000 people in my home state of georgia contributing more than 700 million to our states economy along with tens of millions in community and environmental philanthropic efforts have come under attack by several democrats in this body and this administration just because kochs work provides for an easy red meat target to throw to their radical environmental friends its also a sad state of affairs when other energy companies actually post a positive profit report even though most of these profits go back into more energy exploration as well as clean energy development im also sure that you wont hear many attacks on how those profits help boost the retirement accounts of millions of americans and put more into our struggling economy than any government stimulus program has or could according to the new washington post abc news survey out today more than seven in 10 americans are suffering financial hardship from the skyrocketing gas prices in fact weve got a chart here tonight the first one in a series this is the gas price the average retail price in america when barack obama took office the average price at that time was 1 84 per gallon just as recently as january of 2009 a little over 2 years ago look whats happened as of april 25 of this year the average price per gallon was 3 88 the average price 2 years ago was 1 84 now it is 3 88 2 higher over twice its over double in just a 2year period of time gas prices dont just affect the price at the pump i was talking to a member just a few minutes ago she was telling me that she just fueled her pickup truck and it cost her over 100 to fill the gas tank of her pickup truck she and her husband own a ranch they are active ranchers out west never before has she had to pay 100 to fill the tank of her vehicle and i filled the tank of mine and it was almost 90 in my gmc yukon that ive used to make house calls as a medical doctor this is unsustainable our gas prices impact our grocery bills job opportunities travel plans and thousands of other decisions that businesses and families make in fact according to an analyst from cameron hanover every penny increase in the price of gas costs consumers american citizens consumers more than 4 million per day a onepenny increase costs consumers over 4 million per day and folks who are hurt the most by this the people who are hurt the most are poor people and people who are on limited incomes our senior citizens as the cost of fuel and gas and oil go up because of the misplaced policies of this administration this winter fuel prices are going to be out of the roof in fact the president said while we were talking about his capandtrade bill not long ago he said that energy prices to use the presidents words would necessarily skyrocket for his policies necessarily skyrocket under president obama the cost of energy has skyrocketed thats what he has said in a national speech the national average price of gasoline as i just mentioned was 1 84 when president obama took office today it is 3 96 rising gasoline prices are hurting families and small businesses they are costing jobs in fact i just talked to a manager of a restaurant in my hometown of athens georgia just this last weekend he was telling me that when he orders food for his restaurant his suppliers are adding a fuel surcharge a fuel surcharge onto the cost of groceries food for his restaurant thats happening in all the grocery stores and thats happening all across this country its threatening our economy and our economic recovery while the new house majority is taking steps to address gas prices and help create jobs with the american energy initiative the obama administrations antienergy policies are driving up prices and they are threatening our economy by blocking american energy production we have had a 16 percent decrease in american energy production under this administration it is 16 percent lower than it was projected to be future projections show continued decreases in domestic production and more and more reliance upon foreign imports for our energy sources particularly for gas and oil were getting those energy resources from countries that hate us that hate our american free enterprise system that hate the liberty we have here in this country more than a 200 000barrelperday decrease in gulf coast energy production this is according to the energy information administrations march 2011 shortterm energy outlook production from the gulf of mexico is expected to fall by 240 000 barrels per day in 2011 and a further 200 000 barrels per day in 2012 a reduction and 27 billion barrels of oil are under lock and key in alaska according to a recent fox news report the epas refusal to grant permits for energy production in alaskas outer continental shelf has limited access to an estimated 27 billion barrels of oil with alaskan oil production already decreasing by 7 percent annually continued delays could force the transalaska pipeline to shut down whats that going to do to our cost of gasoline heating oil natural gas and all of our other energy sources whats that going to do to the cost of food its all going to skyrocket more than 40 american energy projects have been stalled by this administration as the house natural resources committee notes 10 months after the obama administrations official moratorium on american energy ended over 40 projects remain stalled and people are left without work this administrations energy policy is killing jobs in the gulf coast as well as all over this country were sending american jobs overseas twelve rigs have already left the gulf before we change let me go to this quote here from michael bromwich the chief regulator of unitedstates offshore drilling even if we permitted the hell out of everything tomorrow every pending permit some permits that havent even been filed yet it would not have a material effect on gas prices bromwich said thats the simple clear reality the simple clear truth the simple truth is michael bromwich is absolutely wrong and in fact as soon as the first drill bit starts hitting dirt or ocean floor you will see oil prices plummet in this country in my opinion why because opec will get a message that were going to produce our own energy resources here in america i submit any country that is not energy independent if it cannot produce its own energy resources if it cannot produce its own food and its own clothing is not a secure nation and the american people need to know that we are not a secure nation today and its because of policies of this administration that are making us less secure we need to go in the opposite direction of the direction were going today that this administrations taking us according to james w noe executive director of the shallow water energy security coalition at least 12 offshore rigs have already departed the gulf of mexico resulting in a significant and precipitous reduction in domestic employment and energy production in january the moratorium forced seven oil rigs to abandon the gulf and head overseas costing american jobs and forcing the unitedstates to import more foreign oil these rigs have left you see where theyve gone nigeria egypt the congo brazil french guyana they wont be coming back thousands of american jobs left with them in fact as many as 12 000 american jobs have been lost and more than 36 000 jobs are at risk i hear my democrat colleagues talking about its jobs jobs jobs in fact we heard that just today in the science committee one of my democratic colleagues talked about jobs are the number one issue well shes absolutely right but its her partys policies that are running jobs overseas its this administrations policies that are making these rigs leave the gulf of mexico and go to nigeria and egypt and congo and brazil french guyana according to the study at louisiana state university monetary economist dr joseph mason the obama administrations de facto ban and it is a ban he says hes lifted the moratorium but theyre not putting out the permits its a de facto ban on american energy production could cost as many as 24 532 jobs in the gulf coast and 36 137 jobs nationwide by the administrations own admission the first 6 months of the official moratorium alone has resulted in as many as 12 000 american jobs have been lost theyre gone theyve left the gulf coast theyve gone to other areas theyve gone to produce energy if you look at this chart in the middle east in africa south america and brazil in fact the president just sent billions of dollars to brazil for them to produce their energy and create brazilian jobs at the cost of american energy and american jobs it makes no sense absolutely no sense recently in a trip to brazil in march president obama pledged to help with technology and support to develop the brazilian oil reserves so that america could become one of brazils quoting barack obama himself brazils best customers he wants us to become brazils best customer how about those american jobs that he is killing and his administration is killing his energy secretary dr chu a couple of years ago said we have to find some way to make gasoline prices in america the same as they are in europe well talk about that in a bit and remind the american people that the president himself said that energy prices under his policies that hes promoting would necessarily skyrocket he wants americans energy prices to skyrocket putting people out of jobs costing all these thousands of jobs costing our economy millions and millions and trillions of dollars in all probability eventually certainly billions he just gave a loan to brazil 2 billion to produce jobs and produce oil in brazil instead of producing oil in the gulf coast and off alaska and his epa just denied any production off alaska it makes no sense according to stories from the gulf coast residents shared at a recent natural resources committee hearing the presidents policies already are helping make good on his pledge with one offshore boat company employee reporting that his employer is sending 100 vessels overseas to brazil to keep them working brazilians working with those transfers go many american jobs this administrations policies are destroying jobs the democrat party policies under the former speaker ms pelosi the majority leader in the senate harry reid are destroying jobs destroying our economy and they want more of the same they want more stimulus more government less american jobs in the private sector less american energy production the american people need to know very clearly they need to know the simple truth they deserve the truth that the policies created by this administration the policies created under the leadership of nancy pelosi and harry reid are building a bigger government but destroying our energy theyre building a bigger government even higher prices for housing in washington d c to destroy jobs in the private sector all across the country and their energy policies are going to harm the most vulnerable americans poor people people on limited incomes our senior citizens recently president obama and washington democrats trotted out two blameshifting strategies that democrats have tried unsuccessfully to use in the past to deflect blame for their failed antienergy policies just last month democrats recycled their socalled use it or lose it argument that has already been debunked as nothing more than a hoax it is political fodder that they are utilizing and i have heard it in our natural resources committee i have heard it on the floor of the house american people are sick and tired of this kind of political dialogue americans are demanding all over this country not only in the 10th district in georgia my district not only in the state of georgia but americans all over the country deserve for this nation to be energy independent they are crying out for energy independence the carter administration established the energy department to make us energy independent as a nation the department of energy has failed miserably failed miserably in that task and has failed miserably in that task under both democrat as well as republican administrations now president obama is trying to shift blame to oil speculators just as he did back in 2008 and this is in spite of the fact that as washington posts jennifer rubin notes it is the administrations own policies that are contributing to yet another drain on the wallets of average americans the washington post has not been a particularly conservative newspaper that has promoted conservative policies that is what jennifer rubin said the administrations own policies are contributing to yet another drain on the wallets of average americans and she is absolutely correct in that assessment and i commend her for saying so earlier this month the house passed the energy tax prevention act h r 910 to stop the obama administration from imposing a backdoor national energy tax that will further drive up gas prices president obama says he is going to veto that legislation proving that he wont let skyrocketing gas prices get in the way of his administrations jobcrushing antienergy agenda regardless of the cost to american families and small businesses i have got a small business in the timber industry in lincoln county georgia and the owner of that business recently told me he parked all of his trucks because he cannot afford to put fuel in those trucks and that has cost several jobs in lincoln county lincoln county has an unemployment rate that is way way higher than the national average in fact the state of georgias unemployment rate i think just recently was reported to be over 10 percent this administrations antienergy policies are crushing jobs crushing small businesses crushing family budgets and it is antiamerican house republicans are making strong efforts to create jobs and lower fuel prices in this country recently cnn did a poll they found that seven in ten americans support increased offshore drilling for oil and gasseven in ten i wonder about the other three in those ten fortyfive percent strongly favor here is the question they asked how americans feel about increased drilling for oil and natural gas offshore unitedstates borders and here is how they responded 45 percent said that they strongly favor us doing increased drilling for our own oil and gas in the gulf coast offshore 24 percent mildly favor 16 percent strongly oppose and 15 percent mildly oppose now that 15 percent and 16 percent i wonder if they have looked at their checkbook i wonder if they have looked at the cost of bread and milk cabbage and potatoes in their grocery store because the prices of those goods that we all depend upon when we go to the grocery store are markedly affected by the cost of gas and oil in this country increasing american energy production will help create new jobs and it addresses the rising gas prices and americans know it the house is prepared to vote on legislation to boost offshore energy production as i said seven in ten americans support offshore drilling for our oil and natural gas it belongs to us it belongs to the american people and we are being prohibited from tapping into that by this administration and the democratic party policy implementing a comprehensive plan to build a more stable supply of petroleum from our own north american resources along with reforms that end litigation the endless litigation and reveal policies that artificially inflate cost will provide immediate relief to the price of gasoline the market knows that more energy means lower prices when president bush removed the executive moratorium on offshore drilling in 2008 as a good example crude oil futures by the speculators fell more than 9 almost immediately it is not the speculators that are causing the rising cost of oil it is not the speculators who are causing the rising cost to americans when they go to fill their cars and pickup trucks it is failed policies by the obama administration failed policies by nancy pelosi and harry reid and their cronies here in the house and in the senate we can create good jobs we can insulate the economy from energy price shocks by actively producing our own energy resources here in this country and we can do that we must do that while we are good stewards of our environment repealing federal mandates and the prohibitions that artificially drive up the cost of gasoline and stopping the epas backdoor energy tax they are trying to implement what i call taxandtrade by epa edict in a dictatorial manner when they could not pass that bill through congress in the last congress and by halting the presidents drilling permatorium as some of us call it it has been described and unlocking our own energy resources that god has given us here in america both on and offshore all these will help alleviate the pain at the pump the pain at the grocery store the pain for every good and service even the pain in the doctors office and the pain of all the higher energy costs and the pain of all the increased costs of every good and service in this country through the american energy initiative house republicans are actively working to increase american energy production in order to do a number of things to lower the cost of gasoline to create american jobs to generate revenue to help reduce the debt and this deficit thats unsustainable and to strengthen our national security by decreasing our dependence on foreign energy particularly on foreign oil as i mentioned just a few minutes ago i believe very firmly that if a country is not energy independent it is not a secure nation we are not secure today we must make america energy independent and we do that by developing our own energy resourcesall of our energy resources not only oil and gas but coal we need to develop clean coal technology we need to look at alternative energy resources such as wind and solar and waves and all of those things we need to have research and development on nuclear energy and on all of the things that are critical for us to be energy independent as a nation republican bills would create 250 000 jobs short term and 1 2 million jobs long term according to louisiana state universitys joseph mason weve got to create jobs but the energy policies that this administration and our democratic colleagues are promoting are killing jobs not creating them republican policies want to create jobs under the republican bills that we have introduced one of which is h r 1230 the restarting american offshore leasing now act we would expand american energy production and create jobs by requiring the secretary of the interior to conduct oil and natural gas lease sales in the gulf of mexico as well as offshore of virginia that have been delayed and cancelled by the obama administration h r 1229 putting the gulf of mexico back to work act will end the obama administrations de facto drilling moratorium in a safe responsible and transparent manner and it will put thousands of americans back to work increasing american energy production to help address the rise in gasoline prices that americans are facing every single day every single day we see gas prices jump h r 1231 reversing president obamas offshore moratorium act will lift the presidents ban on new offshore drilling by requiring the administration to move forward on american energy production in areas containing the most oil and natural gas resources many organizations support the three bills i just mentioned the unitedstates chamber of commerce americans for tax reform the national taxpayers union americans for prosperity citizens against government waste americans for limited government the national federation of independent business the 60 plus association the american trucking association i could go on and on and on gulf organizations are supporting the passage of the outer continental shelf legislation and i could list organization after organization i wont continue with those right now because ive been joined by a good friend who is stalwart on this issue and who i think has probably done as much or more than any other republican member of congress to try to help make us energy independent as a nation and to help us create jobs here in america my dear friend john shimkus i yield to you"], [0.0013886482920497656, 0.0013886482920497656, 0, "i thank the gentleman from arkansas for yielding and for talking about these important issues and one thing that i do want to talk about is something you just said kicking the can down the road we can no longer afford to do that because every year we do not address and solve the problems related to our mandatory spending they add close to 10 trillion each year to our unfunded liabilities those are the liabilities that are going to be put on the backs of our children and our grandchildren so kicking the can down the road is no longer an option now i want to get back to something the gentleman from arkansas talked about earlier and that is about making america competitive in the global marketplace we live in a global economy nothing is going to change that but what america has to do and what we have to do here in the house is to make america the most competitive country on the face of the earth we need to make america the best place and the safest place to do business and thats what we were charged to do when we came in in this 112th congress and thats what weve been doing from day one because when we came in here we said we were going to do two things we were going to get the american people back to work by creating jobs and progrowth economic policies and we were going to rein in our outofcontrol federal spending and weve been doing that since day one week by week we have been addressing our problem with outofcontrol government spending sometimes it was millions of dollars here other times its billions and still other times its been trillion dollars of savings to be able to make our country prosperous again that right there is the charge of my generation and our generation to return americas prosperity thats what were doing here in the house thats what the republican house majority has been doing since day one of the 112th congress one of the things that we did just a few weeks ago was we passed a 2012 budget plan that sets our fiscal course on the right path it sets us up so that we will have that prosperity so that the crushing burden of government spending is not passed on to future generations immediately practically before the vote was even cast we heard from our friends on the other side of the aisle that we were starting to end medicare as we know it funny thing how short their memory is because medicare as we know it was actually ended by the previous congress when they passed obamacare and medicare as we know it was ended in two different ways first they took over 500 billion out of medicare to fund their government takeover of health care and the second thing and the most dangerous thing that they did was they established the independent payment advisory board what this is a lot of people dont really know what it is but its a bureaucratic 15person panel that will actually determine how we are going to provide health care to our seniors now these are not elected officials these are appointed by the president and they will be making decisions on how to reduce our medicare costs by actually preventing certain treatments to our patients to our seniors this will get in the middle of the doctorpatient relationship which is one of the most important relationships that there is we need to have the trust between our doctors and patients and not taking dictates from a 15person panel of bureaucrats here in washington d c the great thing is that theres really no oversight now congress can go in and say well we dont agree with the independent advisory board but you know what it takes it takes an act of twothirds majority in the house to override one of their decisions now ive only been here 4 months but i can tell you twothirds majority is almost near impossible so this is what we have to do we have to educate and tell everybody and get the facts out to the american people because like the other gentleman from arkansas said after the 2012 budget was passed i too had a teletown hall and one of my first questions was from a caller in my district who was on medicare and asked are you really getting rid of medicare for me because i rely on it thats when i had to tell her the facts that no absolutely not those who are in or near retirement their benefits will not change because they have planned for those benefits to be there however we are going to save medicare from the implosion that will occur if we do nothing because in 9 years 9 short years medicare will be bankrupt and the 2012 budget that the house republicans passed will save medicare bankruptcy put us on strong fiscal footing going forward and return americas prosperity to

the ones just made by the gentleman from arizona theyre excellent i think they accurately stated along with the other gentleman from arkansas why were here as new members to grow this economy make this in the 21st century the best place on earth to grow a family to grow jobs to grow a business but you cant have that discussion if were also not going to talk about how big this government is how much bigger its going to get and who has to pay for it the who has to pay for it my good friend is not necessarily us its our kids and our grandkids who are simply going to be left with the tab so that some of us can have more on our plates now these were reckless promises made by politicians who came before us on this very floor on that other floor and all around this town the simple fact of the matter is they cant possibly be paid for what id like to do as i continue to work with you on the floor tonight and rise again a little bit later is as a member of the budget committee simply put on the floor some facts and figures so that we understand where we are as we go about talking of solutions we are 14 trillion rounding in debt right nowthis hour this day if you look out into the future and you see our new red menace the tidal wave of debt that is about to come crashing down on us the total bill is nearly 100 trillion the total cost year over year of waiting of kicking that can down the road as weve heard tonight a road thats quickly coming to an end is over 12 trillion its more expensive lets break it down because i will be the first to admit on the floor of the house here tonight sir that i cant count to 1 trillion i cant count that high i cant comprehend what 1 trillion means not to mention 14 trillion not to mention 100 trillion 1 trillion is one thousand billion 1 billion is one thousand million well now maybe were getting somewhere in breaking it down lets break it down by hour in the hour were spending in talking with the american people about this serious problem this country will borrow in this hour over 170 millionjust in this hour for every dollar this federal government spends we are borrowing 42 cents of it lets put it in terms of days weve heard about tax day that day every year when we find that americans can finally keep what they earn keep their own property and start working for themselves but we also have a debt day now debt day this year is july 27 every day this federal government operates on and after july 27 it is operating on borrowed money lets put it in terms of speed lets say were driving down a highway and our historical debt is a car it would be going down that highway at historical speeds of 65 miles an hour and thats probably bad enough if the car is debt but it has gotten a lot worse recently lets say there is another car coming up in our rear view mirror and that we look and its coming up fast maybe the license plate readsbut we may not be able to read it hope and change and its coming up and it zooms right by us how fast sir do we think that car had been going if the debt car that wed historically been riding in had already been going 65 miles an hour would it be 70 100 no that car that just passed us by that new debt car that were currently spending on is going over 7 000 miles an hour thats the challenge were up against and the only help that weve gotten from the other side in tackling this challenge is namecalling and demagoguery its old tactics yet im hopeful sir im hopeful because every day that we get to talk about this and every day over the last couple of years that weve gotten to talk about this we are educating our fellow citizens more we are doing a great job we are winning the argument i think at this time we are ready to tackle this debt problem if we talk honestly and directly with the american people"], [0.0014047955628484488, 0.0014047955628484488, 0, "i was talking to my good friend on the other side of the aisle a democrat greg meeks and greg said that if we would raise taxes put taxes on the table that he would be willing to put cuts and entitlements and other things on the table in an equal measure and i told him that there was no way that we could raise taxes enough to offset the things that really needed to be dealt with we have got to control spending we have got to cut spending we have got to look at the entitlements and the rules and regulations that we have to live by and make dramatic changes in government if were going to balance the budget this year we have reached over 15 trillion in debt 15 trillion that kind of goes right past most people because they cant imagine what a trillion dollars is but 15 trillion just to put it in perspective it took the presidencies of george washington all the way to bill clinton to amass the same amount of debt that president obama has racked up in 32 months now think about that from george washington to bill clinton the amount of money in debt that weve added has been reached in 32 months by president obama we have to get control of spending its absolutely essential otherwise well be in the same shape as many of those countries in europe like greece the presidents solution to the burgeoning problem is to increase taxes as i said so i went through the amount of taxes it would take and what we would have to do to reach the goals that the president talks about now if you raise the taxes on everybody that makes over 250 000 to 100 percentin other words you take every dime that they make 100 percent above 250 000that would yield about 1 4 trillion and that would keep government running for 141 days so if we took all the money that people make over 250 000 you would still only run government for less than half a year if you gave the 400 billion of profits that was reaped by the fortune 500 companies and gave them the same 100 percent tax treatment you could add another 40 days to the amount of time that we could run the government so taxing is not going to solve the problem now herbert hoover when he was president decideda republicanthat the way to help stop the economic tragedy that was about to occur was to raise taxes on businesses and individuals and what happened we ended up with the greatest depression in the history of this country now president obama said the one thing that you dont want to do during a time of recession is raise taxes and yet thats what hes advocating and my democrat colleagues are advocating right now raise taxes during a time of economic recession when people talk about unemployment in this country they say well now its 8 2 percent but if you look at the people who dropped off the unemployment rolls and those who are underemployed the unemployment rate is probably closer to 15 percent so the figures we are getting from the administration are really not that accurate its extremely important that the administration and my democrat colleagues here in the house and especially in the senate take a hard look at where were going the projections are over the next 10 years were going to increase the deficit by at least 1 trillion a year we cannot afford that this country will go completely bankrupt youll see inflation that you wont believe right now the fed is printing money to cover the expenditures that were incurring day after day after day that money theyre using theyre buying bonds with it treasury bonds so that money is not actually being seen in circulation but the fact is that were increasing the debt by printing money at the fed on a daily basis in europe the european central bank is doing the same thing with the euro this country and the rest of the world is heading toward an inflationary problem thats going to be unbelievable now people say in this country right now we havent seen any inflation if you look at the figures that are coming out from the administration inflation last year went up about 1 to 2 percent but theyre including in that figure all the new technologies that are taking place theyre not going to the grocery store i went to the grocery store last week and bought four apples at a cost of almost 5 three tomatoes cost almost 5 if you go to the gas pump todayand my colleague from indiana talked about that just a few minutes ago if you go to the gas pump today its almost 4 for a gallon of gas so the inflation rate on staples on things that we use on a daily basis is probably well over 10 percent maybe even higher than that we dont know but the administration says its only 1 to 2 percent talk to the wives and husbands of people that are really strapped for cash right now and you will find that its costing them a great deal more than that on a daily basis for gasoline food clothes and everything else its extremely important that we get control of spending this is not the time to raise taxes the president has said that himself especially back in 2008 and 2009 yet now they are taking a different tack and saying we need to raise taxes that would be like throwing gasoline on a fire we should not be raising taxes we should be addressing the spending side of the ledger and if we do that we will get this country back on the right track i just got back from europe i took a codel over there to brussels to meet with the finance people in the european union to find out where they are heading and theyre heading in a very difficult direction right now if greece goes belly up its very likely that youre going to see other countries go belly up and we have investments in money market funds and bonds that weve purchased in those countries and if those countries default its going to affect the united states as well so we need to get our house in order so that we dont end up in the same bailiwick that europe is in right now that could cause severe economic problems in this country so ill end by saying its important to get control of spending this is not the time to raise taxes a poll was taken recently by the politico magazine here on capitol hill and 75 percent of the people in this country that were polled said not to raise taxes so the people get it i just hope that the white house will the united states still finds itself in a spending driven debt crisis the national debt has now surpassed an unprecedented 15 trillion dollars house republicans approved a budget that would have put a stop to spending money that we dont have as well as cutting 6 2 trillion dollars more than the presidents budget the democrats blocked it the unitedstates debttogdp ratio is now officially over 100 percent approx 110 percent at the end of 2011 to put the severity of this crisis into perspective it took from the presidencies of george washington to bill clinton to amass the same amount of debt that president obama has racked up in the past 32 months the presidents solution to the burgeoning problem his administrations reckless behavior has caused increase taxes the problem according to the president is simply that the most successful among us simply arent paying their fair share this sentiment has most recently manifested itself in the presidents proposed budget in which he has increased taxes to the tune of 1 5 trillion dollars the simple reality of the situation is that this is nothing more than campaign rhetoric employed in hopes of fomenting class warfare and dividing the american people you cannot tax your way into prosperity we learned this after the 1929 stock market crash when herbert hoover a republican signed legislation to sharply increase taxes on businesses who were seen as the catalyst for the market crash hoovers draconian tax increases fueled by a similar populist outcry heard today ultimately served as the first salvo in a series of policy missteps that would ultimately lead to the great depression of the 1930s keep in mind that even if congress imposed a 100 percent tax taking all earnings above 250 000 per year it would yield 1 4 trillion dollars that would keep the government running for 141 days the problem is there are 224 more days left in the year if we gave the 400 billion dollars of profits reaped by the fortune 500 the 100 percent tax treatment we could fund the government for another 40 days it was not too long ago that president obama himself was quoted as saying you do not raise taxes during a recession if only he had the resolve to heed his own advice the american people also believe that the course of action taken by hoover and endorsed by obama is not the right way forward in a recent poll in the hill newspaper 75 percent of americans polled felt that the most appropriate top tax rate for families earning 250 000 or more is 30 percent or less this would be 5 percent less than what this income group currently pays this is in stark contrast to the 40 percent tax rate that obama and likeminded democrats in the congress have called for to enact in 2013 when one couples this with the expiration of the bush tax cuts we are creating an environment where the entire tax code as we know it will cease to exist if we continue in this vein in 2013 the 8 out of 10 businesses in america that file taxes as individuals will see their tax rate go to 44 8 percent this will effectively kill what little growth our embattled economy has left despite the top marginal tax rate varying between 35 percent and 91 percent since 1960 federal tax collections have been between 15 and 20 percent of the nations gross domestic product every year since 1960 from this we can infer whether taxes are high or low people make adjustments in their economic behavior so as to keep the government tax take at 15 to 20 percent of the gdp history has proven unequivocally that tax rates have always had a greater impact on economic growth than they do on federal revenues it is no longer good enough to kick the can down the road and make this the next congresses or next presidents problem unless we wish to bring the problems of europe to our shores it is incumbent on us to champion responsible spending restraint a repaired safety net reforms that ensure real health and retirement security and a simplified tax code oriented toward economic growth

best way to do that is to explore for energy here to develop our energy resources and thats why i am pleased to be a part of this congress when i hear from folks back home they say jamie we sent you to d c for solutions and thats precisely what this congress has been about with the gentleman you are going to hear from and others i helped launch the house energy action team or heat is what we like to call it its an initiative with my house colleagues that weve started to bring forward energy solutions that put forward jobs for americans and i am a solutionsoriented person solutions are definitely what america needs right now and i see this from the vantage point of my corner of this country in southwest washington state here is a good example just a few weeks ago i met with john leber he is the owner of swanson bark in longview and basically his business moves material for the forest products industry including biomass for energy producers now the first problem we have encountered and he has seen here with regard to some of these regulations is we have very strict boiler mact rules that are on hold but if they are implemented they would cost the forest products industry alone 5 billion to 7 billion to implement and thats not hiring new people thats not expanding their business thats just costs of complying with federal government rules and there is more the second problem is thousands of manufacturing and industrial facilities across this country use incinerators that would be affected meaning they are going to have to spend more money not to hire more people or to grow their business but to comply with federal government rules now instead of stepping on the air hose of employers like john leber i cosponsored legislation and a solution that would allow the epa to make the boiler mact rule more reasonable makes common sense right in turn this would help the promising industry of biomass and the jobs that would come with it now the gentleman from south carolina very rightly pointed out the energy exploration solutions that we passed here off this house floor this is just one solution that i think is going to help and i want to add it to those four we are working on that heat members here tonight are joining together to call on the senate we have passed at least four bills that provide american energy solutions that will promote american energy jobs the senate needs to step up i am going to share for you and reiterate some of those bills that we passed because they are very important this is important to americas energy security and americas energy independence the first one is the jobs and energy permitting act of 2011 this would have simply required the epa to speed up its approvals for energy exploration in alaska thats it speed up your approvals thats pretty simple developing and safely exploring for energy here would have produced a million barrels of oil per day and it would create more than 54 000 american energy jobs now not all of us like the gentleman from north dakota have such low unemployment rates i think it was quoted as about 3 percent i would be doing backflips for 3 percent unemployment in southwest washington we have had doubledigit unemployment now for 3 years 3plus years and its horrible so we need to get these things moving here in america and create those jobs especially when its within our reach to do and one of the other solutions that we worked on as a team was reversing president obamas offshore moratorium this would contribute over 1 2 million new jobs for americans who are hurting across this country 800 million in revenue would have come in if the senate would move this bill now as we are talking about the deficit and deficit reductions and the debt ceilingand i agree with what one of the senators said we dont need new taxes we need new taxpayers so getting more people to work paying taxes is going to help us get out of the debt that this country is facing and its going to create more jobs the third bill that we worked on and passed off of this house one of the solutions that we have already pushed through this chamber is the putting the gulf back to work act and that bill simply reinforces safety measures through permitting inspections while increasing american energy i hope you are sensing a theme here tonight american energy solutions and american jobs and the fourth one that we were pleased to get off this floor a few months ago was the restarting the american offshore leasing now act now this moves us forward with lease sales that were cancelled or postponed by this administration remember i mentioned stepping on that air hose well a lot of the rules that have come out this administration have stepped on the air hose for employers in our nation and it has got to stop we need to increase americas energy supply this would increase thousands of american jobs and its common sense all of these commonsense solutions that increase american energy production make it cheaper for families to fill their car with gas to heat their homes and it would give relief to american employers i am merely asking and my colleagues here tonight we are merely asking the senate to imagine a future in the united states where energy is abundant and affordable and where we arent riding the roller coaster of high gas prices that basically those prices are set by other nations that dont like us very much so i encourage our senate colleagues to join us in passing and pursuing more solutions like these that the people of this country deserve"], [0.0014678555307909846, 0.0014678555307909846, 0, "the amendment that i bring to the desk brings the two agencies eda and commerce back to the pre2008 spending levels and as were focusing on bringing overall spending in this bill the cjs bill to pre2008 levels i wanted to also bring those two agencies in line on their overhead and thats specifically what my amendment deals with i want to first applaud the chairman the gentleman from virginia for the work that he and his committee have done to start the process of reducing spending we recognize that washington has a spending problem and some of us here are willing to do something about it and start forcing washington to live within its means and that means we have to start the process of setting priorities one of the things that was done in the original cjs bill thats been filed is to implement a 52 percent cut to the programs that are implemented for example in eda and again i applaud the gentleman for making those improvements and those reforms in the base of the bill to actually bring the spending in those programs in line with pre2008 levels but one thing that was not done was the spending for the salaries and expenses the overhead of those agencies so as the agencies are being trimmed back their salaries and overheads are not being subsequently trimmed back and so thats what we do in this amendment we actually reduce spending to the point where we will save 18 2 million that will reduce the federal deficit again this is one small step in a large number of steps that we need to take as a body but i want to talk a little bit about what these cuts will mean and what the subsequent corresponding cuts will mean to the cuts that have already been made in the programs themselves i think there have been some good examples that have been shown of these programs what eda does and some of the money thats wasted and when you go and you look through what these agencies have spent money onagain this is money we dont havetheyve spent money on things like building a replica of the great pyramids building a replica of the great wall of china two million dollars was spent giving money that we dont have to a city to build an amphitheater with a wine tasting room im sure there are a lot of people in that amphitheater would like going to a wine tasting room but there are a lot of places you can go in the private sector that already do that without borrowing money from china to go and build these things with money we dont have and so again as the committee did the work of cutting 52 percent of the eda program they did make some cuts in the overhead but not to bring it to the 2008 levels so as the bill currently stands in its base form these two agencies will see a 25 percent increase in their overhead from the 2008 budget so in that 4year period even with the cuts that have already been made these two agencies still have a 25 percent increase in their spending now keep in mind this is coming at a time when states when local govern ments when families in our districts back home have been cutting back have actually been making due with less to live within their means as everyone should when times get tough and yet in washington even though 42 cents of every dollar thats spent here is borrowed money washington still hasnt cut back subsequently to live within its means and weve got to start that process and that means setting priorities these agencies would still have combined 74 million to spend on their overhead but at least it brings them back to their 2008 levels just as the programs that theyre administering have been brought back to 2008 levels so think about it you know were asking people to do more with less if my amendment doesnt pass they would be asked to do less with more the programs that they administer are being cut and yet the salaries and overhead are not being cut subsequently we just had a district work period this last week i go back home and i talk to small businesses throughout my district in southeast louisiana and what they tell me the things that are holding them back from creating jobs are the regulations the red tape and the excessive spending coming out of washington yet if you look at this you know nobody in my district said that they need to see the great wall of china being built with taxpayer money but what they do say is whats holding them back from creating jobs is borrowing money from china to spend on programs that we just cant afford to fund so while i applaud the cutting of those programs because the programs in the base of this bill have been cut what hasnt been cut subsequently is the overhead to go along with it to bring it to those pre2008 levels this is a step we need to take to not only save 18 2 million that will reduce the deficit but to start sending the signal that were living within our means i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.00147464987821877, 0.00147464987821877, 0, "this is my first time down here as a freshman during special orders my first time trying to coordinate charts and talk the talk and walk the walk all at the same time but im excited about it because im down here to talk about the fair tax and if folks dont know what the fair tax is its h r 25 you can find it at www thomas gov that site that everybody should have bookmarked if you care about what goes on here on the house floor because if you dont know everything that goes on here is available in realtime at www thomas gov its done through the library of congress its not a republican thing or a democrat thing its just the real deal whats actually happening down here and if you go and you look up h r 25 its the fair tax what the fair tax is is a bill that repeals all incomebased federal taxes and replaces them with consumptionbased taxes now my friend from texas was just down here on the house floor he was talking about our founding fathers and those things that were happening between 1776 and 1787 and in that time we funded all the federal government with consumption taxesit was not income taxes it was consumption taxesunder the theory that if you had enough resources to go out and buy that silver tea set from england then you had enough resources to help fund the republic and if you spent all your time working on your farm and you just barely had enough money to buy thread at the local fiveanddime then we werent going to tax you as heavily if you look at this poster in 1913 right before the income tax began we had 400 pages of tax code in america just the last century in the 1900s 400 pages of tax code and regulations by world war ii that 400 pages had grown to 8 000 pages 20 times as much tax code by the end of world war ii by the time we were in korea 14 000 pages of code and regulation by the 1970s 19 000 pages of code and regulation and in the 1980s 26 300 pages of tax code and regulation now im a reader i love to sit down and educate myself through the written word but i have to tell you 26 000 pages of tax code and regulation is going to make a criminal out of all of us because you cant possibly understand all of the ramifications of the tax consequences of your decision do you remember 1986 that was the last time we fundamentally overhauled the tax code 1986 in fact if you go to www thomas gov like i suggested and you look at the laws and regulations youll see the tax code of 1986 it was the tax code of 1954 updated tax code to 1986 that was the last time we flattened rates and broadened the basis flattened the rates and broadened the base and where did we end up between 1984 when we had 26 000 pages of tax code and regulation we went through this process of simplifying the income tax and 10 years later in 1995 we have 40 000 pages of tax code by simplifying the income tax we grew it from 26 000 pages to 40 000 pages now if youre like me you go out and you shop around are you going to use the h r block tax software are you going to use the microsoft tax software what kind of tax software are you going to use because you hate paying accountants to do your taxes for you you know i used to just sit down with a pen and paper and do it myself i used to go through with my calculator and do it myself but it has gotten too complicated why because since i have reached the age of majority in 1988 here we have 1995 when im coming out of college between 1995 and 2004 we added another 20 000 pages to the tax code from 40 000 pages to 60 000 pages in 2007 to 67 000 pages 2008 kept it to just a little over 67 000 pages and in 2009 it jumped another 3 000 pages 70 000 pages of tax legislation and to be clear when we talk about tax legislation were talking about the ways in which the government separates you and me and all of the american people from our paycheck thats all there is in the tax code all the tax code is is how do we separate the american people from their productivity it takes 70 000 pages in 2009 to sort that out and 71 000 pages in 2010 and now 72 000 pages of tax code in 2011 folks what the fair tax does h r 25 it asks the question that if we could start from scratchand by scratch i mean from the 72 000 pages that we do today to just a blank sheet of paperif you could start from scratch and draft the tax code that america ought to have instead of the one that has been forced upon us what would you do what would you do well theres a lot of difference of opinion on what to do but simplification seems to be one of those things that we can all agree on you know i didnt come to this house to try to be a good republican i came to this house to try to be a good american and there are lots of opportunities to do that i like to think those things occur simultaneously more often than not but look at what folks are saying about the united states tax code ill quote house minority leader nancy pelosi any tax reform and closing of loopholes which is really important for us to do as a sense of fairness must also reduce the deficit right because if you close the loopholes if you close all of the lobbyistfunded loopholes close all of the special exemptions and exceptions and carveouts by definition it brings in more money did you get the free golf cart in the 2009 tax bill does anyone want to admit to having gotten the free golf cart in 2009 in the name of a good energy bill in the name of green energy we in the wisdom here in the unitedstates house and across the way in the united states senate of course i wasnt here at that time but in our wisdom we created a tax credit a 6 500 tax credit if you would go out and buy an electric vehicle well americans are smart and i love that about america we are ingenious folks and what folks figured out was that the 6 500 that folks were giving them if theyd go out and buy an electric vehicle if you put brake lights seat belts and side view mirrors on your golf cart you could get yourself a free golf cart well it turns out because we produce golf carts in the great state of georgia you couldnt actually get an american golf cart for 6 500 but our friends in china were willing to import a golf cart to america for 6 500 and so in the fall of 2009 and the spring of 2010 the irs had to release guidancehear this mr speakerthe irs had to release guidance that said when we first crafted the free golf cart regulations we said you actually had to have delivery of the cart by december 31 but so many americans are trying to avail themselves of the free golf cart provision that were going to change the rules here in late december and say really all you need is a vin number from the manufacturer and thatll give them several more months to fill all the orders really mr speaker is that what we need in the tax code a tax code that distributes free golf carts to folks who likely didnt even want a golf cart but it was free and so they availed themselves of it nancy pelosi agrees with me that we need to get rid of those loopholes senate majority leader harry reid our tax system is broken and needs to be fixed lets take the poll lets go to the most liberal democrat in the house to the most conservative republican in the house who doesnt agree with majority leader harry reid our tax system is broken and needs to be fixed and we have the ability to start with a blank sheet of paper and make it the way we want to make it listen to our president this is president barack obama youve got too many companies ending up making decisions based on what their tax director says instead of what their engineer designs or factories produce and that puts our entire economy at a disadvantage thats true talk to any small business owner find anybody whos at a cfo or ceo level in a business close to you and ask that question are you making business decisions or are you making tax decisions and every single time they make a tax decision instead of a business decision america loses their shareholders may win in the short term profits may gain in the short term but when we in america decide were going to do something to comply with these ridiculous 75 000 pages of tax code instead of doing whats best for business instead of whats best for customers instead of what makes sense america loses and in these challenging economic times we cannot lose that productivity let me go back to president barack obama he says this we need to make america the best place on earth to do business the tax code is a barrier government can remove a burdensome corporate tax code with one of the highest rates in the world hear that we talk so much about republicans and democrats here common sense coming from the president of the united states we need to make america the best place on earth to do business a barrier government can remove is a burdensome corporate tax code with one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world folks thats agreement i will tell you if i had to characterize him i would tell you that the president sits a little further to the left than i do if i had to characterize my own voting record id say i sit a little further to the right than most folks here in this house but this is common is ground that we can all agree on let me just show you what that tax rate is i hope the colors are showing up for folks back in their offices watching on tv because the red line here is the unitedstates corporate tax rate the blue line is the oecd average excluding the unitedstates now the oecd is that group of developed nations around the world those folks that we would say have free economies and growing economies this chart goes back to 1981 it goes back to the beginning of the reagan era you see americas corporate tax rate higher than the average tax rate in the rest of the world this is that tax reform that i talked about in 1986 where you see the tax rate dramatically dropdramatically dropand for a short period of time we became on the red line more productive and more competitive with the rest of the world as the rest of the world was on the blue line and look at those years do you remember those years1988 1989 1990 do you remember those productive years i think thats when the yuppie label came around and folks were buying all their fancy automobiles and the first of the big houses i was just coming of age in that time but i remember the conspicuous consumption and why because america was creating wealth and then what happened heres the tax increase of the clinton years bumps right up there and you see a flat line of american corporate taxation at about 39 percent that flat red line of corporate taxation fair enough i prefer predictability i think we ought to know the direction things are going and i think we ought to be able to plan to make business decisions here is a very predictable line of corporate taxation but whats the rest of the world doing while america has a very predictable 39 percent tax rate whats the rest of the world doing getting lower and lower and lower lower and lower and lower and lower folks do you know who cant leave america the american worker folks in my district they cant leave capital can leave a click of a mouse and you can take a billion dollars and move it overseas if you have a business in america you can pack up your bags and go i talk to ceos every day who do exactly that they say rob its just not worth it doing business in america why because were not competitive do you want to talk about growing jobs lets talk about keeping the jobs that weve already got i see in the chamber my friend from iowa mr steve king who has struggled with these issues firsthand and who i know understands as a small businessman before he came to this house what it means to be out there trying to make payroll and trying to stay competitive and if the gentleman would indulge me what do you think it would mean for jobs in america if we got this unitedstates corporate tax rate line below that world average if we once again made it competitive to build jobs in america"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.9975899867713451, 0.0024100132286548615, 1, "staff was and appreciate the fact that they took me and part of my staff down there to see the way it is in arizona but here is a map of arizona and the portions of arizona where i was were in the southeastern portion of arizona over here everybody has heard of tombstone but i was a little further south than tombstone all the way to the border and douglas arizona which is in the corner the southwestern corner of arizona and next to new mexico and along that portion of the southern border of the united states visiting primarily with the people that were in charge of border security the border patrol and the ranchers who live along the border let me talk about the ranchers first one of those ranchers mr krentz a year ago was murdered on his ranch apparently by illegals coming into the united states he was gunned down and killed the culprits that committed that crime by the way have not been brought to justice i met with other ranchers in the entire region and just asked them the question tell me what its like to live on the border of the united states and mexico as a ranch owner and they went on forever and forever and told me things that i was just really somewhat surprised about how they feel like the border is wide open that people cross across their ranches people come in they destroy their property they destroy their water lines all of this costs money to the ranchers and of course they have to be the ones that pick up the bill for the destruction on their property and they dont feel safe about the people that cross into the united states across their land they feel like the federal government has really not protected them and their rights and seems to neglect them even though the border patrol who i also met with i believe is doing as good a job as they possibly can do i want to make that clear the border patrol is doing as good a job as they can do as we will let them do as a nation and they are trying to protect the border the best that they possibly can and so i talked to both groups but in reality the people who live there are very concerned about their own safety and the consequences they have to pay for people illegally coming into the united states i heard something that was kind of surprising to me when illegals not all but when some come into the united states and they are captured by border patrol some of them ask the question are they in the 9th court or the 10th court and i said what are they talking about the 9th court or the 10th court well what theyre talking about is the 9th circuit court of appeals or the 10th circuit court of appeals you see the ninth circuit court of appeals that is a federal appellate court has jurisdiction that includes arizona but goes up to the new mexico border and so when illegals cross into the united states near new mexico or arizona some of them ask the question am i in the 9th court which would be in arizona or the 10th circuit court of which the jurisdiction is new mexico and the reason for that in my opinion those two courts have different reputations about enforcing the rule of law on the border and of course those that cross into the united states hope if they are caught the 9th circuit court of appeals would eventually have jurisdiction over their case when in their perception its a much more friendly court to folks who cross in illegally than the 10th circuit so i thought that was somewhat interesting they are also given when they come into the united states if captured their property some of them you will find a whole list of things and places they can go the churches that give them sanctuary places that they can go for medical help and they are given in a very organized way what they can do when they come into the united states that is provided in some cases by the coyotes that make money off those immigrants who come into the united states because immigrants have to pay the coyote money and sometimes the coyotes and the drug cartels all work together because you see drugs and people are going north and money and guns are going south because you see mexico doesnt protect its border any better than the united states does but in any event while i was down there in the corner of arizona i learned firsthand about the seriousness to the ranchers the people who live on the land their concerns about the fact that they believe that the border is not secure in reality they have to worry about their own safety on a daily basis after visiting a corner of the southeastern corner of arizona we moved and traveled across interstate 10 to interstate 8 over here to san luis arizona so that travels goes up to san luis across interstate 10 interstate 10 turns into interstate 8 comes all the way across arizona into california goes into yuma arizona and i went down here into the southwestern corner of the state of new mexico to also see what that border was like now coming across interstate 8 right here interstate 8 we pulled off the side of the road to the sonora national reserve and that is a national reserve that the federal government controls because i wanted to see the sonora national reserve interestingly enough you get about a quarter of a mile almost a halfmile off of interstate 8 right up here by the sonora desert and you come across this sign this sign is facing toward mexico so interstate 8 would be to this direction and mexico would be behind the sign how far behind the sign its 80 miles to the mexican border and here is a big sign that says traveling caution smuggling and illegal immigration may be encountered in this area so it seems to me that the federal governments answer to border security is to warn people that it is a smuggling and illegal immigration area once again this sign is not on the border this sign is 80 miles this side of the border so what is the government saying are they just ceding that entire portion of arizona to the drug cartels saying its a smuggling area and that you need to take care of yourself because we cant protect you i dont know but i was somewhat surprised to see that our federal governments answer to border security was to erect this sign and other signs that are similar to it i dont believe of course thats the answer to border security you wouldnt need these signs if the border were secure in reality not in just political statements that seem to be made by different individuals the texas department of public safety has issued some statistics regarding crossborder crime i have already mentioned about how the 34 5 percent of the people in local county jails on the border are foreign nationals but just since 2010 january 2010 the texas department of public safety has identified 22 murders 24 assaults 15 shootings and 5 kidnappings among other crimes directly related to spillover violence from mexico now sometimes we hear this comment well the violence in mexico isnt coming to the united states the question is is the crime from mexico coming into the united states we have already shown that that is occurring because 34 percent of the people in those local jails are committing crimes and theyre foreign nationals but also the violence is coming into the united states because of the statistics that i just gave you and now we learn of another phenomenon that is taking place you dont hear much about it because the victims of these crimes dont say much about it people who live in border towns the populous border towns in the united states periodically would get somebody who would come to their front door or they would get an email or a text from someone who says we know your cousin who lives in mexico and unless you pay us so much protection money your cousin in mexico is going to disappear something to that effect so we hear reports of that extortion on the american side of the border this is primarily among hispanic americans and what do they do well they may or may not report it what they i think generally do is pay the extortion because they want their relative in mexico on the other side of the border to be safe so we have that extortion racket taking place if the border were secure that certainly would not have occurred so it concerns me that we have that crime on the american side going back to the southern border of arizona i was asking the border patrol which was very gracious and explained a lot of their operations to me how do they bring drugs into the united states and they said every way they can bring them into the united states one of the ways that they are using now is the concept of ultralights an ultralight for lack of a better description is a kite that has a motor on it one person can fly that at very low altitude and they bring in 200 or 300 pounds of drugs into the united states they never land the ultralight into the unitedstates they just fly across from mexico into arizona and they drop their load 200 300 pounds of drugs and then they fly back to mexico then there is someone at a rendezvous point who picks up those drugs i say that because the drug cartels are using every means necessary to exploit the open borders and do everything they can to make sure that they bring in those drugs and they will continue to do so the border patrol is the agency that we have to protect the border of the united states like i said i think they are doing as good a job as we will let them do but primarily the border patrol patrols the border up to 2535 miles inside the united states that is their duty that is their jurisdiction the place that they are supposed to protect the unitedstates past that 35 miles or so they dont patrol that that is somebody elses responsibility now of course the bad guys know that is the duty of the border patrol to patrol that section of the border so when people are smuggled into the united states when drugs are smuggled into the united states the goal is to get past the border patrol demarcation line because once you do that you are pretty much in my opinion home free to get into the united states with people or drugs so that is the area of their primary concern and it is certainly the area of the jurisdiction that they are trying to patrol the best they can i have asked the border patrol tell me how you do this and i think they use as many different means as they can to patrol the border they will have vehicles go up and down the border they will have border patrol agents behind the border they will have some use of the national guard behind the border with the use of electronic equipment to view what takes place on the border so they use the equipment that they can but they obviously dont have enough border patrol agents to be directly on the border so they have some on the border and some behind the border monitoring the activity of the people coming into the united states and then they try to catch those that they can when i was visiting with one of the border patrol agents this is a photograph of one of their vehicles it is a typical border patrol vehicle that patrols near the border of the united states and mexico now you notice that this vehicle has steel mesh on the windshield and on the side windows it has steel mesh even above the lights the red lights on top so i asked the border patrol agent that drives this vehicle explain to me the steel enclosure you have on your vehicle he said here is what happens we will drive close to the border as we drive close to the border there are people on the other side of the border who when they see us start throwing rocks at us they throw them over the fence if we dont have this protectionand they are not little bitty pebbles these are rocksthey throw them over the fence and break the windshield the border patrol agents are injured they do that for various reasons one of those reasons is a diversion they will try to divert the attention of a border patrol agent at one location so that other folks illegally can sneak into the united states now we dont hear much about assaults on border patrol agents unless somebody is murdered which has occurred but in the last couple of years assaults on border patrol agents by people illegally coming into the united states is about 1 000 a year a thousand assaults on border patrol agents a year in the last couple of years and they are by every means necessary including the rock throwers who try to injure border patrol agents so you can see the relentlessness of some people who want to come into the united states they violate the law of course by coming here illegally and they will continue to violate the law and take on our border patrol agents even by assaulting them so they can sneak into the united states so it seems to me maybe we need to refocus on the primary mission of the federal government and its responsibility the federal government does have the responsibility under the constitution to protect the american people and the united states government should do that now the united states protects the borders of other nations we protect the border of afghanistan with pakistan we are protecting the korean border between the two koreas we protect the borders of other nations and we use our military to do it why dont we have the same resolve to protect the american border both borders the southern border and the northern border because in my opinion we dont have the moral will to do so we should make sure that we understand that people and other people should understand you dont come to the united states without permission it is the rule of law you dont come to the united states without permission now we have to solve that immigration issue that is a different issue but you cant solve that issue until you solve the issue of people illegally coming into the united states you know we are getting everybody we are getting the good the bad and the ugly and right now were getting a lot of bad and ugly crossing into the united states so the rule of law must be enforced by the federal government that is their duty now many of us do not believe the federal government has secured the border obviously people in arizona feel that way because they have passed legislation to try to protect their own state using state law enforcement of course the federal governments answer to that was rather than help arizona sue arizona take them to court you know its kind of like this sign their answer to border security is erect a few signs and sue states that try to protect themselves why dont we deal in reality and make sure that the border is secure and make sure that it is an area that is safe on both sides by securing our side we can protect the mexican side as well of course we need to work with the mexican government to do so they are our neighbors to the south while the united states now has decided to go into libya and spend 100 million or 200 million a week i dont know by bombing that country maybe we should come back home and focus on national security in the united states and spend that money on border security and securing the united states at the border because it is not secure in spite of what the secretary of homeland security has said border patrol it seems to me should have the mission to secure the border i will say again they are doing as good a job as we will let them do but they cannot stop people from coming into the united states although they are trying to when they had those vehicles going up and down in front of the border that keeps people from coming across we have fences in some appropriate areas we dont have fences everywhere but we have some fencing also the border patrol knows they cannot stop people from crossing so they try to catch them if you can that is the phrase that i think is our policy catch them if you can in other words they cross into the united states we see them we try to catch them but once we catch them they become our problem and then we have to send them through the entire legal process as we should but they are our problem they become our medical problem they become our prison problem if they go to prison if they have committed a felony then we have to deal with them and we have to try to get them back to the country they belong to in spite of those countries that refuse to take back criminal aliens so it is catch them if you can why dont we rethink that and prevent people from crossing into the united states if our policy was border security not behind the border security but have security on the border then people coming up to the border cant get across why because there are more boots on the ground and i think we should use whatever we have available we certainly should use the border patrol but also maybe we should use the national guard we have a few national guard troops that are down on the border although they are being relieved and their primary purpose is not to be on the border but behind the border looking at cameras watching folks cross now that is great to watch people cross but when they cross and they come into the united states once again they become our problem once they have crossed and we catch them if you can and send them back home if we can so it would seem to me to be a better use of the national guard to put them on the border i have introduced legislation to put 10 000 national guard troops on the 1 957mile border between the united states and mexico and put them on the border to not allow people to cross into the united states it is the federal governments responsibility of national security to protect the people so the federal government should pay for that and get the money out of the department of defense or somewhere reappropriate money to have the national guard paid for but put them under the supervision of the four state governors so that the governors can control their own border and protect them from entering the united states unlawfully no matter who it is i do not believe that we can say our border is secure when the government accountability office by their own statistics say that only 15 percent of the border is airtight that doesnt seem like a winning percentage to me and when they say under the best circumstances 44 percent partially secure what does that mean well it is sort of secure but sort of not but when you have 56 percent of the border is wide open spaces for anybody that wants to come back and forth that is not protecting the dignity and the sovereignty of the united states so it is long past time we quit talking about border security and actually secure the border from people coming into the united states without permission everyone and to say that the crime doesnt occur in the united states well it does not just to mention the border county jails that i mentioned the 27 percent that are in federal penitentiaries that are foreign nationals that are illegally in the united states but all of the drugs that are sold throughout the united states those are all criminal gangs primarily that are working with the drug cartels in mexico and colombia selling those drugs so the crime affects the united states the insecurity of the border is something that all of us pay for we pay for it in every way possible whether its with health care whether its with education we pay for it in the criminal justice system americans pay and legal immigrants pay the united states has the greatest the most liberal immigration policy in the world we let more people into our country legally every year than does any other country on its own so we have to fix that immigration issue but we have to secure the border first because when all is said and done so far more has been said and less has been done i urge my fellow members of the house of representatives that we come back home that we come back to the united states that we think about the security or insecurity of our borders and that we make sure that the federal government under the constitution fulfills its first obligationto protect americans and thats just the way it is"], [0.9960048794746399, 0.9960048794746399, 0, "said i didnt get elected to do small things i want to do big things and president obama to his detriment with his base said i will do something to change social security and medicare and all these things he agreed to do publicly but the republicansjohn boehnercould never go against grover norquist the republicans shake in their boots they will not do anything even though the american people by a more than 70 percent majority say people making more than 1 million a year should contribute to what the problems are in this country so that fell apart then we had the gang of 6 senatorsthree republicans three democratswho had been on the bowlessimpson commission who said we should do something about this they were in the press they had press conferences and this was going down the road and doing all kinds of great things while that was going on there was a decision made and a law was passed to create a supercommittee to which i appointed senator patty murray of washington to run no one in the senate democrat or republican has more respect than patty murray she worked so hard with the other 11 members of congress to come up with something a few days before they were to arrive at a decisionand the gang of 6 members are out here doing all this stuff all the timei get a letter signed by virtually every republican senator saying we are not going to raise revenue for anything the supercommittee didnt work there the gang of 6 is gone so we passed this last august to fund government for 2 years and to say if we dont arrive at another 1 2 trillion in deficit reduction during this year it automatically kicks in at the end of this year or the beginning of next year so that is where we are and the republicans in the house are trying to change that so that is what this little history lesson has been all about i dont like to sequester i wish we didnt have to do it it was a hard pill to swallow but it was the right thing to do if we are ever going to reduce the staggering deficit we are going to have to make some hard decisions so that is what this is all about but that is the point it is hard to do therefore we have to do it to sequesterwhich in effect would take almost 500 billion from domestic programs and almost 500 billion from defense programs they were designed to be tough enough to force two sides to reach a balanced deal it hasnt happened yet as i said earlier with general eisenhowers statement i didnt make that up that is what he said my complaint about the republicans being so unreasonable about everything is something where i am not a lone wolf crying in the wilderness we have two longtime nonpartisan watchers of congress one from the american enterprise institute which is a conservative think tank another from brookings institute that wrote an article saying it is the republicans cant you see what they are doing here is one thing they said we have been studying washington politics in congress for more than 40 years and never have we seen them this dysfunctional in our past writings we have criticized both parties when we believed it was warranted today however we have no choice but to acknowledge that the core of the problem lies with the republican party they further said the gop has become an insurgent outlier in american politics it is ideologically extreme of scornful compromise unmoved by conventional understanding of facts evidence and science and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition what brave men to do that to write these commentswhich are true i have been saying that i dont want to fight about everything republicans insist on balancing the budget on the backs of the middle class seniors students single mothers and those who could least afford it that is what they are doing over there today it is their refusal to compromise that leaves us facing the threat of sequester and it is difficult but it is balanced going back to the august budget agreement now in order to protect wealthy special interests is no solution neither is refighting the battles of last year democrats agree we must reduce our deficits and make hard choices but we believe in a balanced approach that shares the pain as well as the responsibility is the sequester the best way to achieve that balance no but republicans refuse to consider a more reasonable approachone for example that asks every american to pay his fair share while making difficult choices to reduce spending democrats will not agree to a onesided solution that lets the superwealthy off the hook while forcing the middle class and those in greatest need to bear all the hardship democrats believe we can protect americans access to health care create jobs while investing in the future and protect the poor and elderly but we cant do it alone it will take work and compromise and so far republicans have been unwilling to make a serious effort to achieve that result republicans have rejected our balanced approach their onesided solution to acrosstheboard cuts would take away from the many to give to the few here is what the plan would donot all of it but here is what their plan would do remember they are taking it up over there in the house today it would cut medicaid benefits increasing the number of uninsured children parents seniorsand that is in addition to people with disabilitiesby hundreds of thousands just eliminate them it would also put seniors in nursing homes at risk some of them would have to move out of the nursing home i guess it would punish americans who receive tax credits to purchase health insurance when their financial circumstances change causing 350 000 americans to have no coverage this would add to the tens of millions who already exist that way it would weaken wall street reforms protecting big banks at the expense of consumers their legislation would once again target middleclass workers food inspectors air traffic controllers border patrol agents drug enforcement and fbi agents they would have to be laid off it would cut funding for preventive health care programs that fight chronic illnessessuch as heart disease cancer strokes and diabetesthat cause 70 percent of the deaths in america preventive care would be reined in it would slash block grant funding in the united states to help 23 million children seniors and disabled americans live independently and out of poverty no segment of the population is immune from this painful absurd republican planexcept maybe millionaires billionaires and wealthy corporations the republican proposal cuts meals on wheels and reduces food assistance for almost 2 million needy people one of the republican candidates running for president said president obama is the food stamp president there are more poor people our economy has been in bad shape people are struggling the millionaires are doing fine and

sets up the wrong priorities president franklin roosevelt said human kindness has never weakened the stamina or softened the fiber of a free people a nation does not have to be cruel to be tough so

complicated of course we should as soon as we can this suggests that we can leave by the end of the year if we dont well be there for another decade would be my prediction the american people are now with us a group of us here in the congress a bipartisan group for nearly a decade have been talking about this arguing not to expand the war not to be over there not to be in nation building and the american people didnt pay much attention now they are the large majority of the american people now say its time to get out of afghanistan its a fruitless venture too much has been lost the chance of winning since we dont even know what we are going to win doesnt exist so they are tired of it financially theres a good reason to come home as well some argue we have to be there because if we leave under these circumstances well lose face it will look embarrassing to leave so how many more men and women have to die how many more dollars have to be spent to save face that is one of the worst arguments possible we are not there under legal conditions this is a war who says it isnt a war everybody talks about the afghan war was the war declared of course not it wasnt declared there was a resolution passed that said that the president at that time under the emergency of 9 11 could go and deal with al qaeda those who brought upon the 9 11 bombings but al qaeda is not there anymore so we are fighting the taliban the taliban used to be our allies at one time when the soviets were there the talibans main goal is to keep the foreign occupation out they want foreigners out of their country they are not al qaeda yet most americansmaybe less so now but the argument here on the floor is we have got to go after al qaeda this is not a war against al qaeda if anything it gives the incentive for al qaeda to grow in numbers rather than dealing with them the money issue we are talking about a lot of money how much do we spend a year probably about 130 billion up to 1 trillion now in this past decade later on in the day we are going to have two votes we are going to have a vote on doing something sensible making sense out of our foreign policy bringing our troops home and saving hundreds of billions of dollars then we also will have a vote against npr to cut the funding of npr there is a serious question about whether that will even cut one penny but at least the fiscal conservatives are going to be overwhelmingly in support of slashing npr and then go home and brag about how they are such great fiscal conservatives and the very most they might save is 10 million and thats their claim to fame for slashing the budget at the same time they wont consider for a minute cutting a real significant amount of money all empires end for fiscal reasons because they spread themselves too far around the world and thats what we are facing we are in the midst of a military conflict that is contributing to this inevitable crisis and its financial and you would think there would be a message there how did the soviets come down by doing the very same thing that were doing perpetual occupation of a country we dont need to be occupying afghanistan or any other country we dont even need to be considering going into libya or anywhere else fortunately i guess for those of us who would like to see less of this killing we will have to quit because we wont be able to afford it the process that we are going through is following the war powers resolution this is a proper procedure it calls attention to how we slip into these wars i have always claimed that its the way we get into the wars that is the problem if we would be precise and only go to war with a declaration of war with the people behind us knowing who the enemy is and fight win and get it over with that would be more legitimate they dont do it now because the american people wouldnt support it nobody is going to declare war against afghanistan or iraq or libya we now have been so careless for the past 50 or 60 years that as a congress and especially as a house we have reneged on our responsibilities we have avoided our prerogatives of saying that we have the control we have control of the purse we have control of when we are supposed to go to war yet the wars continue they never stop and we are going to be completely brought down to our knees we cant change afghanistan

just in his time as chairman but working with the committee in the previous years and i know that he understands that this is not a republican or a democratic problem because the regulatory burdens on small businesses increased by 30 billion from the years 20012008 and federal regulations now cost americans 1 75 trillion each year which is up 50 percent from the 1 1 trillion in annual costs just in 2005 and last year the federal register contained 80 000 pages in its first year in print the federal register contained 2 355 pages and each year federal agencies continue to release thousands of pages of new regulations and accompanying information and i know that the gentleman understands that and we share the goal of reducing this burden because the burden is detrimental and it affects small businesses in fact studies indicate that adhering to federal rules cost 10 585 per worker for small businesses with 19 or fewer workers but only 78 percent of that amount for businesses with 500plus workers it affects small businesses disproportionately overall on a peremployee basis it costs 2 400 or 45 percent more for small businesses to comply with federal regulations than their larger counterparts small businesses face the greatest disadvantage in complying with environmental and tax regulations compliance with environmental regulations cost 364 percent more in small firms than large and 67 percent more for the cost of corporate tax compliance so we agree on the problem the question is where do we go from here and this is where i have a concern with what chairman graves is putting forward what does h res 72 call for that were not already doing the committee on small business has been reviewing regulations in a bipartisan fashion for years the gentleman has been involved in that and as a result of these examinations its called on federal agencies to modify or alter regulatory requirements that impose costs on small firms this has included regulations pertaining to medical equipment at cms accounting requirements at the sec real estate procedures at hud environmental regulations at the epa and on it goes so the reality is weve already done as a committee what this resolution calls for and i will include in the record the 112th congress small business committees oversight of federal regulatory and paperwork burdens administrative plan what the committee has already passed so my question for the gentleman from missouri to answer during the course of the debate is what exactly does this resolution do for small businesses that were not already doing is there anything in this thats not already being done now does it actually reduce any real regulatory burden on small businesses does it reduce paperwork does it limit government requirements on the small business community i would submit that this particular resolution does not it sets up a bureaucratic process here in the congress with a goal of inventory of regulations a long list of inventory regulations but this list will be submitted as part of an administrative reporting process it does nothing for small businesses so i would suggest in closing that instead of approving this bookkeeping resolution what congress really needs to do is strengthen the tools it already has available to reduce regulatory burdens this includes the regulatory flexibility act which mandates that federal agencies consider the potential economic impact of federal regulations strengthening the requirements and increasing agency reviews and regulations regulatory relief that we passed here in the congress during the 110th congress reported out by the small business committee related to bipartisan regulatory reductions and as we continue to revisit these issues here in the 112th congress we must remember that small businesses are who were trying to help so in closing im concerned that what this legislation does is add an unnecessary step to getting down to the business that we can all agree on which is actually reducing the regulations that we all agree are a problem"], [0.9939809045754373, 0.006019095424562693, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i rise

pennsylvania for their leadership on this issue this resolution expresses the sense of the house of representatives with respect to the establishment of the democratic and prosperous republic of georgia within its internationally recognized borders which includes abkhazia and south ossetia as regions of georgia it is time for russia to remove its occupying forces from abkhazia and south ossetia and comply fully with the august 12 2008 ceasefire agreement it is also time for the russian federation venezuela nicaragua tuvalu and nauru to revoke their recognition of the georgian regions as independent states and respect georgias sovereignty the territorial integrity of georgia has been reaffirmed by the international community multiple times in united nations security council resolutions i commend georgia for its commitment to a peaceful reunification of its territories and its engagement in constructive confidencebuilding measures towards the occupied territories aimed at reconnecting the divided communities georgia has had success in laying the foundation for a liberal democratic state and i urge the government of georgia to consolidate its impressive accomplishments since the 2003 rose revolution the reforms needed to strengthen georgias nascent democracy are wellknown an independent judiciary respect for human rights and the rule of law a vibrant civil society independent media accountable and transparent policymaking and a balance of power between the executive and legislative branches these reforms will be the strongest guarantor of georgias independence and prosperity ahead of us the october 1 parliamentary elections can serve as yet another important benchmark of the deepening democratic process in georgia these will be followed by presidential elections a step backwards would not only be a blow to the development of georgias democracy but ultimately to its independence there have been some disturbing reports concerning efforts to prevent some political leaders from running in the parliamentary election and attempts to intimidate local opposition including denying them access to media these issues must be addressed in order to ensure that georgia has truly free and fair elections with this resolution today we affirm that the united states remains committed to the sanctity of georgias sovereignty and independence and to the inviolability of its federation and its internationally recognized borders we also remind georgia of the opportunity it has next month to solidify georgias democracy by ensuring free and fair elections let me say on a personal note that i am very proud of the relationship between the united states and georgia and i would look forward to a day when georgia is a member of the european union and also a member of nato i think that the west must not overlook its commitments in georgia simply because we may wish to have better relations with russia we can never cast aside democratic principles because they happen to be inconvenient at the time we should stand with the nation of georgia and let the world know including russia that we stand by their democracy and will not allow any

our goal of cleaner air for that reason i have remained hopeful that epas administrative air permitting barriers to exploring alaskas outer continental shelf would be addressed but they havent as such we continue to see air permits for offshore exploration wells perpetually go back and forth between the producer the epa the environmental appeals board with no movement towards a final decision thats why i am an original cosponsor of the jobs and energy permitting act which would rectify several of those process questions so that we can safely and responsibly produce our natural resources in the arctic ocean the epa needs to have a permit approval system in place that is predictable workable and understandable when i hear that in the last 5 years shell has drilled over 400 exploration wells worldwide while waiting for one single permit for alaska somethings definitely wrong with the process while the opponents of this legislation are saying that this bill guts the clean air act thats just not true because all this bill does is match epas outer continental shelf permitting process with the air permitting process employed by the department of the interior in the gulf of mexico a clean air act air permitting process that has been successfully used for decades by doing so we can rest assured that we have a strong offshore air permitting process but that these projects are not left in limbo like we have seen with the environmental appeals board in recent years i also want to remind my colleagues that this bill just addresses permits for exploration wells where activity typically only lasts for a few days not production wells where activities last for months i have long been a supporter of safe and responsible drilling on the outer continental shelf as these resources are a vital source of energy for the united states with skyrocketing fuel costs it is imperative for the unitedstates to diversify our energy sources by exploring this area and this bill is
