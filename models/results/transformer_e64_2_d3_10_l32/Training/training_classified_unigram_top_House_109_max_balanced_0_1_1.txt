the republican budget includes a deficit for 2006 of 372 billion and a deficit for 2007 of 348 billion these deficiti mean that under republican policies the five largest deficits in history will have occurred in five consecutive years over the next five years 20072011 the budget resolution calls for deficits totaling 1 1 trillion since this administration took office it has requested and the congress has provided four increases in the statutory debt ceiling totaling 3 trillion under this budget by 2011 the statutory debt will increase by another 2 3 trillion for a total increase of 5 3 trillion it will leave the statutory debt at a record level of 11 3 trillion the presidents reckless economic policies have doubled our nations debt further i am concerned by the amount of the debt that has been accumulated by foreign bank individuals and governments in 1980 17 percent of the federal debt held by the public was in foreign hands by 2006 45 percent of the debt held by the public was ovned overseas unfortunately this trend seems to be increasing rapidly during the past year approximately 90 percent of the debt we have accumulated has been purchased by foreign banks individuals and governments i support the representative john spratts alternative budget which would reach balance in 2012 the spraft budget also has smaller deficits than the republican budget and accumulates less debt by contrast the republican budget never returns to balance and even refuses to show how big its deficits will be after 2011 the spratt budget backs the twosided payasyougo paygo budget enforcement rules that require that the cost of any new mandatory spending or revenue legislation be fully offset during the 1990s twosided paygo rules played a critical role in turning record deficits to record surpluses the spratt budget also requires a separate vote to increase the debt limit and prohibits using fasttrack reconciliation procedures to make the deficit worse the republican budget cuts appropriations for domestic services by 9 4 billion relative to current services and by 3 2 billion below the level passed by republicans in the senate meanwhile the budget continues medicare subsidies close to 60 billion for managed care providers of medicare even though they are supposed to save medicare money not cost more the resolution also includes 228 billion over five years for additional tax cuts part of a 3 trillion tenyear republican tax cut agenda the republican resolution cuts appropriated funding for education and related programs below current services providing the same inadequate level as provided by the president for 2007 that repub ican level cuts funding for the department of education by 2 2 billion below last years comparable level and eliminates 42 education programs the spratt budget provides 4 6 billion more than the republican budget for education appropriations and over five years provides 45 3 billion more than the republican resolution the spratt budget rejects the deep cuts proposed by the republican budget and preserves programs such as vocational education perkins loans safe and drugfree schools state grants and the gearup college readiness program the spratt budget also makes a down payment on college affordability by cutting student loan interest rates after a temporary one year gain the republican budget after five years cuts funding for veterans health care by 6 0 billion below current services the spratt budget includes 6 0 billion more than the republican budget over five years for veterans health care the spratt budget also rejects the increase on health care fees on military retirees who are enrolled in tricare the republican budget asks additional sacrifices from those who have served and sacrificed for our country the spratt budget rejects the misguided republican policies and keeps our commitment to our veterans the republican budget cuts funding for health by 18 1 billion below current services over five years the same insufficient level provided by the president the republican level means cuts to priorities such as the centers for disease control 18 of 19 institutes at the national institutes of health and rural health activities the spratt budget provides 18 billion more over five years to fund health priorities cut by the republican budget including medical research at nih and graduate medical education for childrens hospitals the spraft budget also takes steps to address the problems with theimplementation of the medicare prescription drug benefit including extending the may 15 signup period through the end of year and protecting seniors from any enrollment penalties the spratt budget also takes steps to help the uninsured and creates a reserve fund to increase medicare payments to physicians which are currently scheduled to be cut for the environment and natural resources this republican budget imposes a 25 0 billion cut relative to current services over the next five years and imposes a 2 9 billion cut for next year alone this is the same level as the presidents budget which cuts funding for the environmental protection agency including the clean water state revolving fund the army corps of engineers and the national park service the house republican budget resolution actually makes the deficit worse offers no plan to bring the budget back to balance and adds to the growing burden of the national debt meanwhile the republican budget makes harmful cuts to critical services for the american people including education veterans services health and environmental protection i ask my colleagues to oppose this budget and support the spratt alternative budget"], [0.0009492021636106074, 0.0009492021636106074, 0, "in april congress passed a responsible budget that called for spending restraint reduction of the deficit and by slowing the unsustainable and automatic growth of mandatory spending programs and extending tax relief to families and small businesses we have successfully accomplished the first two now this rule will provide for consideration of our final commitment to american taxpayers extending numerous important tax relief provisions in 2001 2003 and 2004 congress enacted responsible tax relief to help create new jobs grow americas economy and put more money in the hands of workers families small businesses farms and ranches following this tax relief unemployment dropped a full percentage point to 5 percent and we have experienced 10 uninterrupted quarters of real growth in our economy above 3 percent the longest stretch since the 1980s as was proven by the tax cuts during the kennedy and reagan administrations federal revenues actually increase after taxes are lowered our expanding economy is led by consumer spending job growth and business investment this is a result of allowing workers to keep more of their hardearned money decreasing the tax burden on small businesses so they can expand and hire more workers and providing incentives for families to save and invest unless we take action today many of the important tax provisions that have helped our economy grow strong will expire without passage of this legislation workers families and small businesses will have less of their paycheck to take home each week h r 4297 the tax relief extension reconciliation act not the most eloquent of names but an important one will continue to build on the economic progress we have already made a key part of the american jobs creation act of 2004 was a return to fairness for those who live work and raise families in states with no state income tax the state and local sales tax deduction is particularly important to those in my home state of florida and nine other states because it gives every taxpayer the opportunity to deduct state sales tax from his federal tax bill something that other highertax states have enjoyed for some time this provision is set to expire in 3 weeks while i will continue to work to make the state and local sales tax deduction permanent this bill extends the provision for an additional year which is an important step forward for fairness the bill also extends several tax incentives to enhance the affordability of higher education including taxdeferred education savings accounts and tax credits for postsecondary education it allows all taxpayers to deduct up to 4 000 of higher education expenses which will help more students go to college for teachers the tax bill extends an important abovetheline deduction to help them contain the costs of outofpocket classroom expenses such as books supplies and computer equipment we all know that our hardworking educators are covering for some of our neediest students and this bill lets them keep the tax deductibility of their generosity in an effort to encourage savings and stable retirement security this tax bill allows lowerincome families that contribute to individual retirement accounts and pension plans to continue receiving a federal match in the form of an income tax credit for the first 2 000 of annual contributions this encourages families to save and plan for their own retirement while we were unable as a body to settle on a social security reform plan surely we can all agree that encouraging lowincome families to save for retirement and giving them the tools to do so is a sound economic policy our bill freezes the rate on capital gains and dividends and prevents an increase of the tax burden on 24 million families it is imperative that we extend this tax relief so our economy will continue on its upward track new data released at the start of december show that our economy continues to strengthen and grow the labor department reported that employers added 215 000 jobs in november after adding 44 000 in october and 17 000 in september in the wake of devastating hurricanes the jobless rate remains unchanged at 5 percent the economy grew at an annual rate of 4 3 percent in the third quarter much stronger than expected forecasters outlooks for coming months are upbeat as well novembers increase in payroll the largest since july was broadbased construction employment rose by 37 000 employment in professional and technical services rose by 22 000 health care employment rose by 20 000 jobs manufacturers added 11 000 jobs last month following an increase of 15 000 in october the most recent commerce department report shows overall consumer spending increased at a 4 2 percent annual rate exceeding expectations purchases of nondurable goods surged 3 6 percent exceeding expectations housing spending came in at 8 4 percent business investment spending rose at 8 8 percent exceeding expectations obviously the current tax policy of this congress has encouraged economic growth and to raise taxes now would close the door of opportunity that is open for so many today this rule provides for consideration of a substitute bill while we often hear democrats decry tax relief they have decided to offer a substitute that extends many of the same tax provisions as this underlying bill does but let us look at who they left out the democratic substitute does not extend an income tax credit for lowincome families who contribute toindividual retirement accounts iras and pension plans this hurts lowincome families who are struggling to save for retirement people who are doing the right things to prepare for their future rather than solely depending on the government to do it for them the democratic substitute does not extend enhanced small business depreciation expensing so it increases taxes on small businesses the very engines of innovation and growth and employment in this country the democratic substitute does not include an extension of the reduced rates on capital gains and dividends without this extension 24 million families will see a tax increase including 7 million seniors who have benefited an average of 1 200 annually from that change at a time when concern is growing about foreign investment in the united states the democratic substitute throws up barriers to americans investing in america the democratic substitute does include a tax increase on families and small businesses to pay for the bill many of these individuals are small businesses who do much of the hiring and buying in this economy the democratic substitute bill leaves behind small businesses omits lowincome savers and hurts families and seniors at a time when home heating bills are rising and local property taxes are growing why would the democratic substitute take even more from the wallets and purses and piggy banks of the american taxpayer the republican tax reforms of 2001 2003 and 2004 have created jobs strengthened our economy and increased federal revenues in the process they quantifiably aided in shortening and curtailing the severity of the recession of 2000 and 2001 they buoyed the economy through major terrorist attacks devastating natural disasters and a global war on terrorism now is not the time to increase taxes on the ameriqan people failure to pass this bill would result in higher taxes on seniors savers small businesses and farmers we must continue the policies that grow our economy and keep our tax bills from rising i urge my colleagues to support this resolution and the underlying bill the tax relief extension reconciliation act i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.0009756088256835938, 0.9990243911743164, 1, "we appreciate the opportunity once again to come to the floor of the house of representatives as the 30something working group myself along with kendrick meek mr meek from florida and also ms wasserman schultz from florida we have been coming here now for a couple of years talking about the condition of the united states our fiscal situation our investment situation or lack of investment in the united states of america and also what we believe is the democraticf caucus and leader peloij and steny hoyer and the issues that we are trying to put forward it has been a very interesting week here for the democratic caucus we had a wonderful guest george lucas the famous writer director producer of the great star wars movies and he was here to talk about the innovation agenda that the democratiq party is beginning to put forward and we have an innovation agenda to keep america competitive in the 21st century as we look at what has been happening here in the united states this kind of breaks down into two or three separate categories one if we want to be a strong country we have got to start here at home and we got to start making the investments here in the united statep research and development education health care alternative energy technologies must start here and we must begin to grow our economy here if we are going to be of any good to anyone else here in the world unfortunately our friends across the aisle on the republican side have failed miserably in their attempt to try to balance the budget here in the united states of america we have as citizens of this country regardless of what political party you belong to we have as a country an 8 2 trillion national debt 8 2 trillion dollars each citizen in this country owes 27 000 to our national debt if a baby is born today that baby owes 27 000 to the united states government to help us pay our debt if you are a senior citizen you owe 27 000 to the united states government and if we keep going down the path that we have been on and here it is 8 2 trillion as of valentines day 2006 and your share of the national debt is 27 500 we have a real situation in the united states of america so not only do we owe this not only does each person owe that what do we do so if we are running a 400 billion annual deficit or 300 billion what do we do to fund business in the united states of america we have got to go out and borrow the money and this president in the first 4 years of his term borrowed more money from foreign interests than every single administration prior to his in the last 224 years this president borrowed 1 05 trillion from foreign interests in 4 years more than every other president before him is that making america stronger mr speaker i do not think it is i think it weakens our country and here it is this president in a republican house and a republican senate has borrowed 1 05 trillion from 2001 to 2005 and all of these presidents did not borrow as much from foreign interests as this one has and that puts us that puts us at a position of weakness because guess who we are borrowing the money from to pay the bills we borrow some from unitedstates interests but this is a chart that outlines who else we are borrowing this money from 682 billion we have borrowed from japan 249 billion we have borrowed from china 67 8 billion from opec are you kidding me we are borrowing money from opec to help fund and plug the hole in our annual deficits here meanwhile they are making money hand over fist this is a very dangerous situation that we are in because here is the end result here is where the rubber meets the road as we all take out loans to pay for our homes or our cars or our kids education unfortunately you cannot just borrow the money at zero percent interest you have got to pay interest on the money you borrow so the interest on 8 2 trillion is a lot of money so what does that mean for our annual payments that we have to make just on the interest this chart is the 2007 budget in billions of dollars this big red bar that gets up to 230 billion is what we are going to pay in the 2007 budget projected on interest on the debt just the interest we are not paying it down we are just paying the interest on it and this nice lavender bar that barely gets up over 50 billion is what we are going to spend on education and then homeland security and then veterans the irresponsible policies of this administration put our fiscal house in disorder because we are spending so much money on just paying the interest on the money we owe the chinese and the japanese and the opec countries that is a great deal for those countries great deal for them but what about us a stronger america starts here at home so until we fix this problem there is no issue we can go on addressing because it straps our hands behind our back because we want to make investments in education research and development pell grants to lower the cost of college tuition put research money into figuring out an alternatie energy source so we are not dependent on some of these opec countries but check this out this is the interest on the debt that i just showed this is what we could spend every day in this country if we did not have to pay all this interest on the debt we could invest 1 million a day into every congressional district i represent a district in northeast ohio youngstown ohio akron ohio niles ohio warren ohio portage county kent state university is in my district this is an older area in the northeast of the great state of ohio the great buckeye state 365 million i could have to go back to this area and invest in the schools head start all kinds of other different things just from my district and every other member in here would get 365 million a tremendous difference give it to the chinese banks the chiinese government give it to the japanese banks the japanese government give it to opec or give it to the kids who are trying to go to school in youngstown ohio of which 80 percentlive in poverty that go to youngstown city schools i know what i would like to choose some other things here we could provide health care to 79 925 more veterans if we would not have to pay the interest on the debt like in the late 1990s when we made the very difficult decision here and i am glad the gentleman from florida is joining us for this point a very difficult decision in 1993 when president clinton got into office we were running budget deficit after budget deficit every year and our democratic house and a democratic senate with a democratic president balanced the budget in 1993 without one republican vote i am hot saying some republicans would not vote for it now but at that time when the heat was on without one republican vote and it led to balanced budgets surpluses as far as the eye could see investments into education hope scholarship the whole nine yards and the greatest 6conomic expansion in the history of this country more important the private sector because interest rates were low the private sector was able to go out and create over 20 million new jobs we cannot create jobs here in government that is not our duty that is not our responsibility this is the chart reagan reagan reagan bush bush bush all in the red and clinton in the late 1990s after the 1993 budget was im plemented we started having surpluses in the late 1990s projected out as far as the eye could see because of fiscal discipline that is what our job is here balance the budget keep interest rates low invest in the education and research like this country has always done and the private sector will join and take over some other things if we did not have to pay the interest on the debt we could enroll 60 000 kids into head start you want to talk about being compassionate you want to talk about if you practice the christian faith being a christian i think somewhere that means making sure we can invest into those poor districts those poor children and i am so glad that mr meek is joining us because we started out here and that we being me talking about the impact of the budget deficit and the fiscal situation that we are in right now and the damage that it is causing to the american economy and the lack of investment because we are paying the interest on the debt to many of these countries overseas so thank you very much fot joining us i know you were busy in a homeland security committee hearing and i

everything that the administration hands to them they cant even put the paper on the desk fast enough before they rubber stamp it when you start talking about the fact that by the constitution we are supposed to carry out oversight that is not a value of the republican majority li 1915 oversight of what no see they are too busy taking care of the special interests you would think that some members were more concerned with trying to make sure that special interests got what they needed because we do not want to forget the k street project where you pay to play and you get access into this republican majority house so when you look at the rubberstamping of what has happened here i cannot help but have this stamp here because that is how we got here but what is very very unfortunate is the fact that we have ourselves in a situation in a fiscal situation that is going to take a generation almost to recover from we have ourselves in a situation in iraq we do not know how many years it may take for us to recover from that and i am using the presidents words now we have ourselves in a situation where the white house now wants to invite members over to have tea and cookies right now and trying to be niceynice to say we want to hear from you now but we have men and women caught in the crossfire and we have millions and billions of dollars that have been wasted and stolen in iraq i am going to say stolen because of the rubberstamp republican majority anything that the administration sends down how can we rubberstamp it matter of fact i think the republican majority walks around with a little mini rubber stamp in their pocket saying oversight this is the way you want it and how you want it the american people have to send a very strong message to this republican majority here in the congress that we have three branches of government for a reason not two branches of government that deals with legislation and policy but three branches we have the judicial branch that is separate and aside but when you look at the legislative branch we are supposed to carry out oversight only a couple of members of the republican majority actually gets that and tries to practice it but they are in a superminority and so the reason why we come to the floor is to shed light on the lack of oversight when it was a democratic house and a democratic white house there was oversight cajl bill clinton up and ask him i think we know that republican majority the reason why you are going to see people around here scratching and fighting and begging and trying to do anything and throwing out the sods and trying to get press releases out because the white house is very very concerned that they will no longer be able to send legislation to the unitedstates house of representatives and that it passes through committees that may have a half a meeting on it and come to the floor not allowing democrats to do anything to improve the legislation because they are too busy rubberstamping the process and it will disrupt that it is all about power and influence and i can tell you right now the republican majority has gone too far with this because that is the reason why we are in the situation we are in now and they are known they have to shake it and they know it and they deserve the rubber stamp because that is what they have been doing since the president has been in the white house i am coming to ms jacksonlee i just want to give you a perfect example of what happens in a rubberstamp congress exhibit a how can you borrow 1 05 trillion in 4 years i do not even know how that can be achieved in 4 years the republican majority has handed president bush he cannot do it on his own we have the republican congress right under him from 2001 to 2005 1 05 trillion now here is the other kicker that comes in and with interest fortytwo presidents 224 years 224 years 42 presidents were only able to borrow 1 01 trillion i rest my case on that i rest my case on the fact that the republican majority has given the bush white house everything they wanted on the backs of the american people the special interests got what they wanted the billionaires got what they wanted"], [0.000990748405456543, 0.9990092515945435, 1, "a track record a pattern of those who have made youthful indiscretions in their lives need it be on credit need it be some sort of

to get what they want i want to drive the point on here i want to make sure this is crystal clear it has to be crystal the bottom line is the only way that we will be able to have a paradigm shift not only in thinking but in policy and action on behalf of the american people and unless the american people like you say the majority they do not have to be the majority the american people can make that change they can say that we are willing to allow the democrats to lead so that we can hopefully start taking care of some of these issues that we have to take care of here at home with our troops

closing in rural america and in urban america they are closing some of them are only open on wednesday now but meanwhile we have individuals we have the president every time he gets a chance he is

doing we showed the letter from secretary snow i think we already know this we did not write this letter the guy has said the fifth time the secretary is saying we will not be able to operate the government that is one letter here is the other one here fortytwo presidents this president and republican majority has borrowed 1 05 trillion but better yet saying let us make a bad idea permanent

share what the members and the american people clients reward keeping k street lobbyists thriving i never blame the special interests for what happens here but i am going to tell you right now they have a tax shelter right now where 100 billion in unitedstates taxpayer dollars are not going into the coffers because they have an offshore deal with this administration and with this majority

budget and let me ask my colleagues what better budget to have than the one that saves 27 5 billion more in interest than the republican budget i cannot imagine that my good friend on the floor of the house would not welcome the opportunity of putting that interest into the needs of the american people we need affordable housing we can go to any city any rural community and not see people standing in line to access affordable housing section 8 touchers which allows affordable housing for families of four and five and six hardworking american there are 25 000 people on the list in houston texas alone millions of people are still on the list because they do not have affordable housing f 1245 finally i congratulate the gentleman from virginia and the gentleman from north carolina on this budget because it also invests in homeland security with all of the talk of the republican budget they do not fund immigration and customs officers they do not fund border patrol officers to secure our borders and provide for internal security the cbc budget does the obc budget puts 150 million in for border and customs needs this is a strong budget for the american people vote for the congressional black caucus budget save 27 5 billion in interest i think you will like that in your pocket and in your savings account i rise today to offer another choice to those americans who are disheartened by the current budget proposal being offered by this republican congress today we offer them the choice of accepting the congressional black caucuss cbc alternative budget truly it is the budget of hope and compromise it is the budget that closes the disparities in americas communities the cbc alternative budget provides both social and economic equality for americans instead of allowing the richest americans to pay fewer taxes at the expense of vital programs needed by lower and middle class americans surely this administration and the republican leadership in congress will pay lip service to the needs of these americans but this budget does more it demonstrates in writing that under our current budgetary situation it is possible to maintain necessary social programs while practicing true fiscal responsibility the cbc alternative budget is particularly strong in its support of educational programs the greatest key we possess to close disparities in our society this administration and the majority in this congress promised to leave no child behind but clearly they have reneged on their promise the republican budget eliminates 48 education programs that receive 4 3 billion this year these eliminations include wiping out 1 3 billion for all vocational education programs 522 million for all education technology programs and 29 million for all civic education programs the republican budget eliminates other large programs including the even start family literacy program 225 million and state grants for safe and drugfree schools and communities 437 million in fact the presidents budget cuts 2006 funding for the department of education by 1 3 billion below the amount needed to maintain purchasing power at the current level and by 530 million below the 2005 enacted level of 56 6 billion this is the first time since 1989 that an administration has submitted a budget that cuts the departments funding the cbc alternative budget in stark contrast provides a much needed boost of 23 9 billion to education and training including 2 5 billion for school construction the cbc alternative fully funds the fiscal year 2006 authorization level for no child left behind nclb and provides for an expansion of the head start program in addition the cbc alternative doubles federal funding for historically black colleges and universities and hispanic serving institutions again closing the disparities often witnessed in higher education in that regard the cbc alternative increases the pell grant allotment for college students because as we all know a mind any mind is a terrible thing to waste clearly the cbc alternative emphasizes this ideal more than the republican budget resolution few things are more important to americans than their home and their communities while the president and this republican congress take steps to make it harder for average americans to reach homeownership the cbc alternative invests heavily in this vital sector it funds home ownership initiatives that help families build real wealth in the city of houston alone we have 25 000 people waiting on a list to obtain affordable housing these homes will provide them the stability and equity to build their lives and eventually achieve their own prosperity we shame ourselves when we deny them the opportunity to do so the cbc alternative also restores 1 122 billion for vital community block grants which were gutted in the republican budget resolution without the ability to build up our communities how can we change peoples realities without community development we allow these disparities to continue unabated the cbc alternative budget does not remove any money from the overall defense and homeland security budget instead it takes 7 7 billion out of the ballistic missile defense program which has so far proven to be a failure and redirects the money to additional support for the troops in iraq homeland security needs and veterans programs and benefits among the items of support for the troops in iraq is 75 million of body armor personal support equipment and other protective gear for troops and vehicle armor all of which we know the troops

attack this alternative budget provides 4 65 billion for veterans funding so that when our brave men and women return home from fighting the war on terror they will know that their nation is ready and willing to take care of them the cbc alternative also funds the important sector of immigration as the ranking member of the subcommittee on immigration border security and claims i worked with the cbc to get funding for 150 million for immigration and customs enforcement ice agents and border patrol agents truly we are undermanned in this vital sector in addition as a member of the house

reasonwhy we have reams and reams o f paper about how government is not working now is the fact that we are governing under a culture of corruption cronyism and incompetence one cannot operate a business under a culture of corruption cronyism and incompetence they cad just not do it they cannot do it it is impossible to achieve and it is wrong so when we have historic levels of corruption incompetence and cronyism it is just hard for us to govern in that way people are wondering why am i picking up my newspaper not only seeing indictments but seeing plea agreements by the very people that are elected to come up here to govern on behalf of the american people so why is it even shocking to some members why we have so much corruption in the federal system and we come in here as though let me grab a cup of coffee or a latte like it is another day at the office it is not another day at the office it is not another day here in congress we are concerned but maybe the majority could also get a little concerned about what is g6ing on let me just mention something because mr delahunt just hit a couple of points and i just want to mention something because here in the 30something working group as my colleagues know and others and i am so glad that mr ryan claimed this hour the bottom line is this we have a white house where members of the white house have been indicted or previous members who resigned the day before they were indicted and serious national security breaches in the white house this is not hearsay this is fact we have federal investigators now they are not talking about someone who took a trip somewhere on the governments credit card they are not talking about that you know someone went to lunch with someone and you know the bill was 3 000 and they had eight lobsters they are not talking about that they are talking about outing cia agents they are talking about information being leaked out that is jeopardizing national security they are also talking about issues as it relates to you know the influence of the private sector and corruption and not possible cronyism but cronyism and incompetence that is what is going on here now and even here in the congress unprecedented investigations inquires not by the congress but by other agencies that are policing us so when people start saying well why is all of this happening it is happening because we are not well the congress the majority is not governing the way that they should govern and policing themselves i think it is important as we look at this culture of corruption and cronyism and incompetence that we put it in the right perspective we know that a lot of this is allegations we will just say allegations i want to make sure that we say that but i want to also make sure that members know exactly what is going on this is not regular business in the congress the 109th congress historians will reflect and in the present will say this has never happened before in the historyof the republic so when folks start talking about well you know i do not know what you are talking about i am going to tell you another thing they are coming to the floor the majority tomorrow to pass tax cuts on behalf of billionaires and millionaires meanwhile just before we left here they cut student loans cut medicaid cut child support enforcement somebody please tell me this is a misprint but it is not and going after deadbeat dads so i wonder how the state attorneys and sheriffs are going to feel about that they cut many programs that we need in this country meanwhile back at the ranch we are going to turn our back on what is going on in iraq and what is going on here in washington d c as though it is not a big deal so i think the gentleman from massachusetts is in order when he talks about some of the decisions that are being made and one of any colleagues on this side said just because the republican leadership says it is true does not mean that it is true we

saying that so that individuals who are tuning in who would like to know just what are the blue dogs more than anything else we pride ourselves on being first and foremost good stewards of the taxpayers dollars we provide the sterling leadership in the democratic party for responsible fiscal responsibility for 5 years we in the blue dog coalition have been begging and pleading that this congress develop a plan to pay as you go mr speaker 5 years ago when the clinton administration left office we had a surplus billions and billions and billions of dollars were left in surplus now 5 years later under the bush administration we are trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars in debt make no mistake about it our debt and our deficit is the number one problem and issue facing the survival and the future of our democracy and we are concerned about this national debt but at a time when we are expressly concerned about it and pushing forward for responsible measures onthe democratic side it is the height of hypocrisy it is the height of being insensitive it is the height of indeed smoke and mirrors for this republicanled congress and this republican president to under the guise of giving a tax cut for billionaires and millionaires across this country say he wants to cut spending cut spending of the most vital services the most important needs in this country as a matter of fact in the history of this country in this 20th century we have just been hit with the worst hurricane season in modern times katrina was the worst that anybody can remember billions and billions and billions of dollars worth of damage an entire city entire region almost totally destroyed over 250 000 american citizens without homes we all remember those pictures down in new orleans in the flood our hearts went out to those people well our hearts must continue to go out to those people and the reason it is the height of hypocrisy is here is the president of the united states and this republican controlled congress who says that they want to offset a 70 billion tax cut for the wealthiest people in this country on the backs of those poor victims of this hurricane on the front page of the washington post this morning the answer from fema is to throw 150 000 american citizens who have become homeless on the street the answer from the white house and the answer from this congress has been to cut the very programs that will help these victims the most the most effective programs that have helped them has been the food stamp program and under this budget this republican held congress and this president proposes to cut food stamps by 850 million not only at a time when we have people who are homeless without jobs without hope but according to the agriculture department just this year alone we have added 2 million more citizens to the hunger roles the republicans answer cut the very program that has been designed to help them by 850 billion medicaid under this budget planned by the republicans and president bush they want to cut medicaid by 12 billion when 45 million americans mostly senior elderly citizens are going without any kind of health insurance and our farmers cut them by 2 billion farmers who have been devastated by the flood who have been hurt by the flood now is not the time to cut the farmers and our veterans 3 billion lord knows we have not been doing right by our veterans we have cut them we have cut them we have cut them and the presidents answer is cut the veterans this republican congresss is to cut the veterans is that not a reason why they have had difficulty in getting the votes why they have had to pull the bill last week and the american people need to wake up and understand and put the calls in to your republican congressman to let them know that america does not want to cut the basic services for the needy while trying to add a 70 billion tax cut for the millionaires and the billionaires they do not need the money but the children do this budget will cut childrens nutrition by 2 billion and 5 billion in child support heating oil is cut at a time when the oil companies are getting record profits and their execputives are sitting fast student loans 14 billion at a time when going to college costs so much there will be tens of thousands of american children who will not go to college if this republican budget reconciliation bill passes that is why this is so important that is why it is important listen to me america and if you know other people tell them to tune in we are here to tell you the facts this blue dog coalition is one of the most influential groups on capitol hill and the reason why is because people trust us we have earned that we have earned that distinction folks like charlie stenholm john tanner they have pioneered and set the curve respect across party lines respect across this country the blue dog coalition we are speaking the truth tonight william shakespeare said it well when he wrote that great play julius caesar when he said et tu brutus yours is the meanest cut of all and that is what these republicans are doing in this bill it is mean it

pursued for the last 5 years it is time for a little honesty about where these policies are taking this country since 2001 the federal government has posted record budget deficits year after year during the 1990s democrats and republicans worked together with the clinton administration to cut the red ink and balance the budget for the first time in many years we balanced the budget in 1998 wekept it balanced in 1999 2000 and 2001 indeed we ran budget surpluses during those years and for the first time in a generation actually began to pay down the national debt since the bush administration took office in 2001 weve swung from balanced budgets to massive annual budget deficits in 2002the year after the congress adopted the administrations tax policiesthe federal government posted a 128 billion deficit in 2003 the deficit rose to 378 billion in 2004 the deficit soared to an alltime high of 412 billion in 2005 the deficit was 318 billion as bad as these deficits are they do not tell the whole story since these figures do not include the money the federal government borrows from social security and medicare trust funds each year in 2005 alone the federal government borrowed nearly 175 billion from the trust funds and were on course to borrow even more this year we cannot continue on the course were on it is wrong for this congress and this president tokeep borrowing half a trillion dollars each and every year and then pass this debt along to our children it is wrong for congress and the president to keep borrowing more and more from foreigners to fund tax cuts for the very wealthy china alone owns more than 818 billion of our debt the majoritys budget simply digs the deficit hole deeper the republican budget proposes a 348 billion deficit for 2007 if you add in the borrowing from social security and medicaremoney that by law must be repaidthe total deficit for 2007 soars to 543 billion the hard truth is that under the majoritys budget the federal budget never comes into balance the tide of red ink rises forever this policy is unsustainable and morally indefensible tucked away in this budget is a provision to raise the governments borrowing limit another 653 billion this would be on top of the 3 trillion in debt limit increases already approved since president bush took office at the very least there should be a straight upordown vote on a debt limit of this magnitude but evidently the plan is to try to sneak this through the majoritys budget also contains irresponsible cuts in critical domestic programs in this regard the majority has mirrored the bush administrations budget which included deep cuts in education critical medical research environmental protection veterans health care to name only a few areas there has been an attempt tonight to place a fig leaf over some of these cuts with a vague half promise of perhaps adding an additional 7 1 billion for domestic programs later all this fig leaf does is acknowledge that the funding shortfall exists in the republican budget without taking any action to actually address it i will vote for the democratic budget substitute offered by representative spratr the spratt budget pays down the deficits over the next 5 years and achieves balance in 2012 we restore fiscal discipline by bringing back the payasyougo budgeting rules and we force a degree of accountability by requiring the house to take a separate upordown vote on measures to increase the national debt limit in addition the democratic budget alternative provides 150 billion for future tax cuts and requires that any further tax cuts meet the payasyougo rules lastly our budget alternative rejects yet another round of spending cuts to key domestic programs that have been cut repeatedly in recent years the choice before the house could not be more clear we can vote to continue the failed economic policies of the last 5 yearspolicies that have resulted in massive annual deficits or we can say 3 trillion of debt and borrowing over 5 years is enough and vote for the spratt budget alternative that pays down these deficits and balances the budget i urge all my colleagues to join me in

what is necessary but the first thing you did was get rid of the discipline and payasyougo so now you are stuck but more importantly the nation is stuck and so we see this little plea on the morning that we are going to give away almost 1 trillion to the richest people in the nation you have a plea here that maybe the president will stop the bridge to nowhere how about congress stopping the bridge to nowhere how about doing what you were elected to do you dont need a line item veto this isnt about statutes this isnt about vetoes this is about what the congress is to do you walked in here fresh newly elected and you got handed 5 trillion and now you cant stop yourself you cant stop yourself you can stop yourself from giving the people an increase in the minimum wage that hasnt increased since 1997 you cant give those people 70 cents more an hour but you give it away to the richest estates and then you can plead that but for the line item veto we would somehow get to a

are putting away a rainy day fund on borrowed money i am sure america is delighted that you are putting away the estate tax on their social security earnings on their trust fund you are taking their trust fund that belongs to all americans called the social security trust fund and you are raiding it for the trust fund of the heirs of the richest estates in america what a wonderful example today what a wonderful example for young people to learn about our obligations to future generations this is a theater of the absurd you have run the country into the ditch financially you got a 1 trillion war going that you cant figure out how to stop you have stolen most of the money from social security trust fund every year we have a deficit we have a 8 trillion debt and you want to talk about the line item veto you know the government is spending money like a drunken sailor andronald reagan said well at least the sailor was spending his own money you are spending the publics money at a rapid illegal unconscionable immoral rate and you ought to stop but the line item veto wont do it lots of things have changed since 1997 but the value of the minimum wage isnt one of them because of congress failure to act on behalf of the lowest paid workers in america the minimum wage is still just 5 15 per hour 5 15 per hour think about that at 5 15 per hour you would have to work 11 day just to fill a tank of gas at todays gas prices at 5 15 per hour you would have to work for at least 30 minutes just to afford a single gallon of milk democrats have a simple and reasonable proposal we want to raise the minimum wage to 7 25 per hour over the next two years doing so would directly benefit 6 6 million american workers the vast majority of those workers are adults hundreds of thousands of them are parents with children under the age of 18 we have all heard the wellworn economic arguments against raising the minimum wage and we all know they simply arent true the truth is that raising the minimum wage wont hurt the economy and can even help it but forget about economics thats not what this issue is about this issue is about doing whats right and it is just wrong that in the wealthiest and most advanced country in the history of the world millions of adults work fulltime all year and yet still earn an income that leaves them deep in poverty it is just wrong for the republican leaders of this congress to refuse to allow even a vote on raising the minimum wage but what makes all of this far worse is that today once again as it has done so many times during the past several years the leaders of this house are going to push tax breaks for the wealthiest people in this country you know starting in 2009 only the largest and wealthiest 7 500 estates nationwide

are certainly right about one thing we desperately need a good national energy policy this measure does not pass that test our growing dependence on foreign oil puts us at the mercy of unstable and unfriendly foreign regimes it gives terrorists additional targets and puts money in their hands it weakens the dollar by worsening the balance of trade we would start every day 500 millionplus in the

efficient virtually nothing the federal energy information administration found that last years energy bill would have almost no impact on energy demand and energy prices and that bill if anything made more of an effort to tame consumption the alliance for an energy efficient economy has estimated that this years energy bill would not save a single barrel of oil by 2020 that is both tragedy and farce we know how to treat our oil addiction we can make appliances more energy efficient without inconveniencing anyone we can make our cars more efficient without sacrificing safety my cafe

this bill do instead of trying to make us more energy efficient at a time of fiscal crises and record oil prices the bill provides new mandatory spending that will go directly to the oil industry and it provides mandatory breaks for the oil industry on royalties the bill provides massive tax breaks for profitable oil companies and next to nothing for new technologies that could help wean us from

uranium from niger was this information concocted by those who were overly eager to go to war why was cia reluctance regarding this assessment ignored allow ing it to be presented by the president as a clincher for our need to go to war other reasons used to justify the war deserve equal attention since the results have been so painful for our country if lies were told to justify the invasion of iraq the american people deserve to know the truth congress has a responsibility to seek this truth and change our policies accordingly the sooner this is done the better"], [0.9938461827114224,

today than we had for each social security recipient we also have far fewer dependefits today in many households today there are more workers than there are dependents we are changing but this was part of a plan that was approved by president reagah and democratic speaker tip oneill to change the social security program in 1983 to build up a 1 3 trillion surplus that will continue building up in the future we do not have a problem if we keep the trust in social security and use that surplus for what it is used for rather than spend it on tax cuts for people who do not need it or other

imo to amend the safety of life at sea convention to require voyage data recorders for ships in the international service but doing so for newly built ships those that are under construction is one thing the cost can be absorbed in the construction of the vessels but older vessels that do not have automated engine rooms do not have automated sensors are going to result in a huge cost as much as 300 000 i have heard from vessel owners to retrofit vessels so in accepting the gentlemans amendment we must also have language when we get through conference in the conference report about somehow alleviating the cost on older vessels just as we do in aviation there are ways of phasing in newer technology in aviation tbe flight data recorderthat records up to 150 parameters of operations of an

economic distress and greater job loss than west virginia thousands and thousands of families have migrated to other states to west virginias great loss and to the gain of those other states now weirton west virginia is one of those placesthat has been right on the point of the sphere of this economic distress and job loss as the gentleman from west virginia pointed out it has had serious losses of jobs in the steel industry and its population has declined precipitously precipitously it is very difficult to bring back distressed communities in situationslike that and it is a hard effort to do the planning and to figure out what are the projects that are the greatest chance of success to bring back jobs ej 1230 and there can be no greater purpose it seems to me under the economic development initiative under hud than to provide help in communities exactly like that this project because of the breadth of it and the need in the area meets all the criteria that hud has
