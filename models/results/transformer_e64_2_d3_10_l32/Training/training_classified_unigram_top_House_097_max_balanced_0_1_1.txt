nation neither addresses the colossal mistakes committed last year neither contains any basic difference in its economic content and neither will alter the disastrous course on which the nation is traveling what we have here are two political agendas one by the gentleman from ohio has enough phony numbers and false assumptions to create the fiction that adoption of his resolution would bring the projected deficit down below the magic 100 billion level suddenly a deficit below 100 billion has become the fiscally sound position of my friend from ohio who for many a year has proclaimed that any deficit at all is irresponsible it does not matter what devices are used my friend from ohio wants to be able to claim that he will bring the deficit below the politically magic mark but he knows that the actual result wilt not be so for he knows that the magic mark has been reached only by the use of tricks and mirrors it is bad enougi that the latta program employs fiction to create the desired political illusion what isworse is that in order to eliminate or reducecuts that were thoughttoibe unpalatable he doubles the cuts to the poor the unemployed and the downright desperate it is a crude coarse and morally indefensible thing to lay all the budget cuts on the backs of the economically weak and the politically impotent that is what was done last year and that is what the present latta budget aims to do this year only in a redoubled fashion what is worse he brings this forward at a time when there are millions of newly unemployed at a time when there are hundreds of thousands whose benefits are about to run out he well knows that even now only i out of 5 unemployed workers today is able to draw unemployment benefitsyet his plan will throw hundreds of thousands more of the unemployed onto the welfare rolls at the same time he would reduce by many billions of dollars the help that is available for family assistance for food housing and for medical care even as there are hundreds of thousands of newly poor people created by the program he championed last year he would make more hundreds of thousands suffer new deprivations he wants to make more and more people struggle for less and less in the name of cynical expediency to foster a budget illusion last year it was clear that the republican program is an economic policy that is a rich mans war and a poor mans fight the latta resolution this year makes that even more plain it would make the poor even more poor and it would create more poor to join them in fighting for survival in an evershrinking pond of opportunity fewer jobs less help less hope less everything the proposal put forward by my friend from oklahoma at least has the virtue of not making a bad situation very much worse it does no favors for the poor but at least it avoids the egregious and morally indefensible action of redoubling the burdens that have been thrust upon them it at least recognizes that the truly needy can use some true help it at least does not pretend that there is any way within the reagan framework that the deficit can be held below the magic 100 billion level not even the republican senate nor ronald reagan believes that it simply cannot be done unless mr reagan is willing to make changes that he thus far has refused to make the jones proposal is the better of two bad choices but the shame of it is that nothing the house will do today will make any difference in the economic mess of the country we are in a case of economic policy gridlock nothing we do today will start the traffic moving all that the two proposals hope to do is to stop everybody from honking their horns for a while trusting that something in the next few months will persuade mr reagan to reconsider his stubborn refusal to accept any change in his policy and thereby unlock the policy jam the reagan policy let us remember was supposed to produce a 1982 deficit less than half as big as we will actually experience it is a policy that was supposed to produce a 1083 deficit of less than onefourth of what my republican friends are today fervently embracing it is a policy that was supposed to produce a balanced budget even a surplusbut which now not even mr reagan says can ever happen the reason is simple even under a full employment economy the reagan tax program will riot yield anything close to the revenues needed to support the reagan expenditure proposals mr reagan knows this his budget office admits it and yet he will not june 10 1982 h 3354 accept the responsibility to come forward with any meaningful changes in his tax program this reagan policy let us remember was supposed to create a great boom in economic activity the fact is that the economy is in its weakest state since the great depression it is shrinking going backward and growing more fragile by the hour in its economic effect the reagan program has been precisely the opposite of what was predicted for it this is a uolicy let us remember that was stipposed to reduce unemployment instead we have better than 2 million newly unemployed persons we have a depression in the housing industry a depression in the auto industry our steel industry is working at far below half its capacity onethird of our industrial plants sit idle there is no prospect for a healthy economic recovery brave predictions by one or another of the presidential wise men tell us from time to time that a return to health is just around the laffer curve but the curve turns out to be endless this reagan policy let us remember was supposed to create a dramatic drop in interest rates but that did not happen interest rates for housing are as high or even higher than they were a year ago corporations and not even the federal government are able today to finance long term borrowings the interest rates are choking off the economy killing business killing prospects what is mere not even the secretary of the treasury foresees the kind of drop in interest levels that would be necessary to produce any meaningful economic recovery and the reason for this is simple it is not possible for interest rates to go down if the federal government maintains a fiscal policy that is in direct conflict with a tight monetary policy so interest ratesare destined to remain high no matter what we do here today because the choices laid before us do not change that fundamental and deadly contradiction that brings us to the nub of the issue at a time when we need a statement of economic policy we get political agendasneither of which addresses the economic issue at all one of the agendas the one offered by my friend from oklahoma is a little less unsatisfactory than the other but by no means a prescription for economic recovery nor a guide for the necessary changes that must be made neither proposal before us has aroused huzzahs from wall street nor hosannas from the people both the financial wizards and the citizens on the sidewalk know that neither of these proposals changes the policy mix that constitutes the oozing swamp through which we are walking the truth is that the budget act never was envisioned as a vehicle for development of economic policy it was envisioned as a method through which the congress could set its fiscal priorities it assumed that the world would be a more or less predictable place that the economy would be more or less stable that we would be faced with choices around certain narrow margins last year the act got twisted into a juggernaut of economic policyoverridding all economic judgment overriding all careful legislative process overriding all counsels of caution and moderation the result was tragic and the tragedy continues today because we are persisting in seeing the budget process as a determinant of economic policy the policy has already been determined the budget process as we see it today only reaffirms the bad policy that got embedded into law last year it has become an embarrassment to those who brutally misused it last yearfor having twisted it into something it never was they cannot now return it to the original purposes for which it was intended neither are they able to use it to reverse or even modify the policies that were created through it less than 1 year ago the leacership is now rethinking the budget process and that is all to the good meanwhile ve have a legislative process that is choked and tangled by the wreckage of the budget process this year legislative committees cannot legislate policy because we do not know what the budget will eventually allow appropriations committees cannot mark up their bills because they do not know what the budget will eventally command rhe irony of it all is that for all this stumbling in the dark we know that no economic change will be wrought here today or in the conference that will follow any decisions re reach it might be different if we were in fact faced with a real choice between budgets it might be different if we were given a budget proposal that faced up to the economic realities of todaythat faced up to the need for redressing some of the unfairness in last years tax giveaway that faced up to the need to stand on some kind of principle of fairness for the poor the elderly the sick the disabled the unemployed or that faced up squarely to the growing desperation of unemployment created by a shrinking economy but we have no such proposal before us we are given tokens much like political wooden nickles that will make no economic difference and perhaps little political difference either if we are going to permit the budget process to be the vehicle for deciding all economic policy let us at least have some clear choices between the affirmative and the foolhardy between the just and the unjust last year we had the choice between the foolish and the indifferent the majority chose the foolish this year we have the choice between the hopelessly immoral and the pale nod toward justice neither time have we been given any reason to think that our choice would change the economic result for in each case the choices accepted the premise of the reagan program if we are going to pretend that the budget means a choice between economic policies let us have choices that at least rest on differing premises but i we are not let us have done with this whole weary process raid return to a world in which congress can at least function a world in which its committees can at least act and in which it can make decisions let us not continue pretending that the budget process is something that it never was the budget as it is being used here and as it was used last year is a blind auction we do not know with any precision what the consequences will be if we adopt either one of the proposals we have herewe only have a hazy idea and we are not given time nor the information to gain any meaningful information the budget resolution is a bidding war just as i predicted it would become when the house passed the budget act 8 years ago it is axiomatic that in such bidding wars it is the people who lose the victims of last years bidding war are better than 2 million freshly unemployed people they are the thousands of businesses that have been forced to close down because of high interest rates they are the sick the hungry the old the young searching for jobs the middle class people hoping to buy homes the students trying to finance an education and the autoworkers trapped in a downhill run they are the taxpayers who know how grossly unfair the tax system has become the downtrodden looking for simple justice the victim of last years bidding war is the whole country yet here we are again not talking about the needs of the country not talk~ng about what we can and should be doing to rectify last years mistakes we are simply engaging in another act of a biddinr war that cannot make things better and for which we have only the faint hope the outcome will not make things worse it is a travesty and a tragedy and it sickens all who watch it and all who take part in it e"], [0.0044419169425964355, 0.9955580830574036, 1, "the recent congressional budget problems should serve as a lesson the question is not just whether congress will adopt a budget but whether congress will adopt a realistic and workable 1983 budget that honestly reflects the realities of the american economy and the chief priorities of the american people when the 1982 reagan budget was adopted it forecast a federal deficit of 40 billion today the federal deficit has ballooned to an astounding 120 billion the disparity between what was predicted and the reality of the problem has contributed immeasurably to our economic woes today this year america needs a commonsense federal budget not one that is purely wishful thinking we cannot pretend that everything is just fine and base our crucial budgetary decisions on untenable and overly optimistic projections about the performance of the economy congress must temper reaganomics and ground our budget actions in the reality of the current recession we cannot afford another meaningless budget like the one in effect for 1982 the financial markets and the american worker would be best served if we admit the errors of existing economic and monetary pollcies what is most important is not to identify scapegoats butinsteadto address the basic problems of our economy today one of the most glaring incongruities in the 1982 federal budget is the projections about unemployment the 1982 reagan budget assumed unemployment would be 7 2 percent this year and it is now at a record high 9 5 percent similarly the 1983 budget assumes an unemployment rate of 7 9 percent those figures were inaccurate long before the predictions were made indeed the skyrocketing unemployment is one of the most tragic reminders of the ineffectiveness of the administrations economic policies and the aliceinwonderland spirit of white house budget planning one of the painful truths about todays official unemployment figures is that they hide more than they show pockets of unemployment much higher than the national figures exist in all parts of the country in some industries joblessness is as high as 70 to 80 percent there is also a disturbing increase in the number of workers who are so discouraged so broken in dignity and spirit that they are no longer looking for work minnesota through good fortune has had lower unemployment than the rest of the nation today minnesotas jobless figures trail the national rate and are lower than the doubledigit rate recorded in 20 states but even in minnesota there is great suffering nearly 250 000 people cannot find work unemployment rates that were unacceptable just a few years ago are now the norm in some parts of the state unemployment is far worse than the national average in the twin cities auto workers are facing the severest hardships in years with 54 percent out of work for blue collar workers the jobless rate is 13 7 percent minnesotas iron range has been devastated by the recessions impact on the steel industry some 10 000 steelworkers in the state about 70 percent of the industry will be laid off by summer the actual unemployment for construction workers in minnesota is 35 percent in particular crafts and geographical areas unemployment runs at 50 percent 70 percent and more around international falls woodworkers suffer 50 percent unemployment the rate is nearly as high for paperworkers in cloquet teenagers always have a tough time finding jobs this year with the severe reductions in youth employ ment and training programs under administration budget cuts local officials across the country recognize that teenage unemployment will become alarmingly high the call to the private sector to voluntarily initiate new programs has brought some response and these businesses deserve praise but the poor performance of the over all economy prevents the large scale job creation that is needed the growing number of bankrupt cies especially in small businesses which have traditionally provided the majority of new jobs makes the reliance on private industry even more tenuous the tight monetary policy agreed to by the administration and the federal reserve board has resulted in high interest rates which have forced many small and family owned businesses to go bankrupt in 1980 there were 11 742 bankrupticies the second highest level since world war ii in the first quarter of 1982 the news is even worse over 6 000 small businesses have gone under in the first months of this year and the projected annual level is 23 000 bankruptcies the highest since 1932 the reality of what is happening is heart wrenching small farms and businesses that have been in families for generations are being lost to creditors despite todays recordbreaking unemployment the truth is that fewer people are eligible for less help the department of labor estimates that 3 2 million people would have their unemployment benefits cut or eliminated in fiscal 1983 as a result of changes proposed under the administration budget cuts of all the administrations budget cuts perhaps the most ironic was the firing of state employment counselors who help the unemployed find jobs with 15 million americans out of work the white house wanted to close down state employment offices across the country and take away the valuable job service programs that matched openings with skills and kept people out of the unemployment lines it was only because of the strong public outcry that we were able to force the white house to restore the funds it had cut from employment service programs the shortsightedness of such policies is obvious the president himself has pointed out that a 1percent jump in the unemployment rate raises the federal deficit by more than 25 billion because of lost taxes and additional unemployment benefits yet he and his supporters continue to argue that the only way to solve our economic ills is lo cut unemployment benefits even further if there is to be any relief from unempolyment problems it must come from congress administration officals are not anxious to admit that their economic policies are disaster they stubbornly adhere to their policies of tax cuts for the wealthy exhorbitant pentagon spending and high interest rates they refuse to exert the economic leadership necessary to meet the needs of our recessionriddled economy even with growing evidence that the recession is deepening president reagan is accusing the media of false reporting when they carry stories about the serious and sometimes tragic consequences of his economic policies over the next months even before congress makes the final decisions for fiscal year 1983 we must decide that our central priority is to boost the economy congress must act to address these very real needs of the millions of people who are unemployed no magical recovery is on its way the question today is not when will the hoped for and promised recovery come but how will congress shape public policy to spur

that this nation could or should abide the waste of unemployment the scourge of poverty the numbing blight of ignorance nor the casual inhumanity of injustice lyndon johnson had a vision for his country he believed we could conquer our problems that we could alleviate poverty and indeed his programs did open whole new worlds of opportunity through the vision and unparalleled political skills he commanded president johnson brought decent medical care to the old and the poor he demanded that we no longer tolerate hunger among the people of this the greatest food producing nation in the world he established vast new programs to improve the nations schools to insure that every child got a sound education and to make available a university education to all who could benefit from it he insisted that the poor even the longterm unemployed could be placed into useful jobs through all these and many other efforts he was responsible for a vast reduction in the incidence of poverty in our

that the hungry should go more hungry our leadership is not one with a vision of what our country could be but one that sees a diminishing futurea world with shrinking hopes not one of growing possibilities lyndon johnson was excoriated as a free spender but the leadership of today the current administration will incur deficits that are 60 times as great as any that johnson would even dream of he was called a radical ex perimenter but he never abandoned the basic principle of sticking with programs that were practical that were proven whose results could be measured compare that to the pie in the sky claims that we heard for supplyside economics nonsense that we are paying dearly for today the present administration likes to say that there is no need to produce new housing for the poor or for anybody else because the marketplace will take care of everything but lyndon johnson knew that this was not so and could not be so if there are millions of people who cannot even get into the marketplace the market serves only people who bnve the means it does not serve those who have no means johnson would have wanted to know how many were without housing what could be done to get them into housing and how to get it done compare that to the breezy callousness of todays antihousing administration there is no way for me or for anyone else to describe the whole complex dazzling

and anything in his considerable reach until he was satisfied that the matter had been disposed of it might be civil rights it might be interest rates which today are treated as given from godly writbut which he knew were made and broken by men just like him it might be education or any one of a thousand things whatever it was he believed the problem could be solved and he intended to do it compare that to the casual callousness of today when human needs and human miseries are ignored and when not only is no positive action taken every effort is taken to destroy what little help people have available he would never understand would be terribly grieved to see the sorry spectacle that we have today in which misery is compounded in which inequity is heaped upon unfairness in which shameless dishonor is dismissed as practical politics he would be horrified by policies that are nothing more than warmed over 19th century darwinism nothing less than callous disregard of even so basic a thing as providing for economic growthfar from it policies that destroy even that possibility lyndon johnson reached farther than he could grasp but he drove this country to its greatest

intent on cutting almost in an unthinking fashion that we imposed hurt and pain and insecurity what did we do last year we rammed through cuts in small business programs we had a 37percent cut in direct loan money we had a 27percent cut in bankguaranteed loan money and we jacked the interest rates up to the point that a report comes out now that black businesses in this nation might face extinction by 1990 because a government which made a commitment to those businesses to help develop an extrepreneurial class which over the long haul will help this nation has now abandoned its commitment this is the zenith of stupidity it is the epitome of myopic thinking only one budget deals with this and that is the congressional black caucus budget of all the statutes out there this is the only one and we can argue for hours on end about the details it is so easy to take a man and reduce him to just a little card with all the vital statistics and shove him in a machine and say that is what he is i am not a card nor are all those people out there who are suffering cards the congressional black caucus says give us one chance just one chance to deal with the insecurity that this

continues to worsen last year there were 17 000 business failures the second highest number in 35 years the number of failures continues to esculate this year if this rate continues there will be 5 000 more failures this year than last year according to prof philip shuchman of rutgers university the bulk of business bankruptcies around the country involve very small businesses may 94 1 982 small

financial assistance to the small business communitythe economic backbone of this nation this should be expected particularly from an administration which professes to believe in job creation in the private sector data are plentiful to support the truism that small businesses are the chief employer in this country instead of the administration moving in a direction of rational reasoning it is proposing a fiscal 1983 budget for the small business administration that if enacted would undermine even further the delicate solvency of this nations nearly 14 million small business owners the administration proposed to eliminate sbas direct loans to the handicapped the minorities for energy conservation and to others who are unable to obtain loans from any other source the administration proposes to reduce bankguaranteed loans congress appropriated funds for 4 5 billion in guaranteed loans in 1981 last year as part of the administrations spending reductions this amount was reduced to 3 3 billion for 1982 a cut of 27 percent now the administration wants the level reduced by another 17 percent during the remainder of this year and it proposes to reduce it by another 12 percent in 1983 this 46nercent cut in only 3 years is still not enough even larger cuts are planned by the administration in the future so that by 1987 the annual level would be less than 1 billion this picture is the same in other areas to further exacerbate matters the administration is not even being up front about the extent of the cuts for example they claim they are maintaining minority small business lending at 440 million this is a complete sham included within this amount are economic opportunity loans eol under existing law 60 million is authorized in eol guarantees and the administration proposes to increase this to 100 million this year and to 167 million next year in 1980 banks made only 24 5 million in guaranteed economic opportunity loans and this amount dropped to 20 4 million last year the experience to date this year has been even worse in the first 4 months of fiscal year 1982 eol guarantees have totaled 2 8 milliun if this rate continues the 1982 total would be 8 4 million a far cry from the 100 million projected by the administration it is preposterous however to assert that this program will increase to 100 million in the remaining 8 months an increase of 3 500 percent and that the increased rate would not only be sustained next year but would increase another 67 percent my colleagues and i on the small business committee recognized that the sbas 1983 budget proposal is a far cry from realism it is for this reason that we voted to maintain the direct loan program at a funding level of 169 million we voted to continue funding handicap loans at a level of 4 million we voted to provide 250 million in pollution control guarantees and we voted to fund the guaranteed loan program at a level of 3 5 billion i am pleased that the congressional black

1982 budget i proposed an amendment that would have balanced the budget in 1982 my amendment accepted most of the administrations budget cuts but it omitted the enormous tax cut that the administration advocated and that has contributed to the deficit that we face today my amendment failed in fact i got only four votes later the house adopted the administrations budgetthe grammlatta substitute the administrations budget was based on the radical supplyside theory that you do not have to balance the budget it was based on the theory that an enormous gap between what you spend and what you take in in revenue will somehow send a positive signal to wall street during the budget committeep markup last year my good friend the gentleman from new york who is the architect of the administrations tax cut made a statement that i found shocking and almost incredible at the time however events have proved the accuracy of mr kemps remarks on april 7 1981 the gentleman from new york representative kemp the coauthor of the presidents tax program had this to say about the philosophy underlying the administrations program balanced budget i used to think that i do admit to that whats radical about reagans economics and stockinans economics and republican economics today i we dont any longer worship at the shrine of the balanced budget well mr kemp may not worship at the shrine of the balanced budget mr stockman may not worship at the shrine of the balanced budget mr reagan may not worship at the shrine of the balanced budget and republicans in general may not worship at the shrine of the balanced budget but millions of americans do millions of americansincluding a good number of folks in the the financial marketscontinue to believe that the federal government should balance its own accounts so that it spends no more than it takes in i find myself now in a very difficult situation it is hard to know what is the fiscally sound course to take i voted to report the budget committees recommendation because i believed we needed a vehicle to bring this debate to the floor and that was the fairest and soundest proposal i had seen until that point but we are now in the middle of a debate in which achieving a deficit of 110 billion is considered a great victory for fiscal responsibility last friday the republican senate passed a budget with a deficit of 116 billion the republican alternative that we have before us has a deficit of 110 billion according to the most recent cbo analysis this is the budgdt that president reagan endorses i never thought i would have lived to see the headline republican president endorses 110 billion deficiti how things have changed how did we get to this point where a 110 billion deficit is hailed as a great victory we all know the answer to this question the answerin one wordis reaganomics reaganomics has produced a 1983 projected deficit of 182 billion compared to a reaganomics deficit of 182 billion 116 billion looks good but only in comparison to the outrageous result imposed upon us by reaganomics last year the administration told us we needed a massive military buildup they said we needed to spend 1 5 trillion on the military over 5 years along with this massive increase in military spending they said we needed an enormous tax cut to be more specific they said that the wealthy and big corporations needed a big tax cut the message was the ntion needs this big military buildup but we do not have to pay for it in fact we need to make major cuts in our revenues this illogical combination of spending increases and tax cuts was somehow supposed to instill confidence in the financial markets this has not happened what has happened was what was predictable all along the financial markets saw that reaganomics produces increasing deficits and so they kept interest rates high and stifled recovery in addition to a 182 billion deficit reaganomics has also given us the worst recession since world war ii last month unemployment reached 9 4 percent 10 3 million americans are out of work industries like liousing and autos are in a neardepression state i only wish that this administration would give a greater sign that it is finally realizing what its policies have produced reaganomics has given a tax reduction all right jobless people do not pay taxes this is now day 490 of the reagan administration fourhundred and ninety days ago a president was inaugurated who the american people believed would balance the budget in day 490 of the reagan administration we are further away from a balanced budget than we have ever been in the history of our nation i am running for attorneygeneral of texas i will not be around to remind the administration of its promise to balance the budget i hope that you who remain will do this for me the time has come to reject this folly called reaganomics the time has come to reject the foolish and dangerous idea that we can have a massive increase in military spending without paying for it if we truly need it we shoidd be willing to pay for it the time has come for our republican colleagues to join with us democrats to restore a sound fiscal policy to this nation we need to work together to fashion a budget that is fair to all americans and that is based on accepted standards of fiscal responsibility the latta budget is untair and irresponsible it hurts the elderly it denies educational opportunity to mil lions of americnns and it is a back door attempt to cut social security benefits we cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of

for all of his assistance in bringing this legislation to the floor there is no question that without his able advice and counsel we would not be here today and the george washington half would be but a dream we are all aware of george washington and of the many things that he did to shape our republic in its early days however we tend to view him more as a marble statue to be honored than for what he was a very human person who did his best in trying circumstances and created a republic that is still the hope for freedom of much of the world today it is my hope that the issuance of a commemorative coin for his 250th birthday will cause people to think about his life as that of a man who lived rather than just as a historical subject h r 3484 provides for the striking of a special silver dollar by the mint to honor this important anniversary the coins when issued next year will have a composition of 90 percent silver and 10 percent copper identical to the silver coins struck in this country before 1965 they will be available for 2 years 1982 and 1983 and will be legal tender for half a dollar although they will be sold for more than that h r 3484 provides that a maximum of 10 million of these coins will be struck with the actual number issued being limited to those ordered during 1982 the number 10 million is admittedly arbitrary but was chosen as the number most likely to approximate the actual demand for the coin at its maximum demand for the eisenhower silver dollar ran at close to 7 million and while i believe that the washington half will attract more interest i believe that 10 million is a fair estimate in addition i felt that the mint should have some way to plan its production and that a ceiling would probably heighten the interest in the coin and encourage early orders my legislation provides that the price will cover all costs associated with the coin plus a profit of up to 20 percent the sales will be handled according to regulations issued by the secretary of the treasury and all profits will go into the treasury general fund briefly there are three reasons why h r 3484 should be approved first a commemorative half dollar is a fitting way to honor the 250th birthday of george washington second there is a market for the coin and it will provide an american alternative for the millions of collectors and investors who invest in silver coins yearly and are now limited to foreign coins as sqch it will help our balance of trade to some extent third the sales of these coins will provide a profit to the treasury that will help to reduce the deficit in fiscal year 1982 of these three reasons the first the desire to commemorate george washington on his 250th birthday is the most important in honor of this anniversary a silver coin is particularly appropriate as washington took a special interest in the establishment of our nations first mint and was responsible for our first silver coinage personally the establishment of a mint was one of washingtons main priorities when he became president in 1789 but circumstances delayed it for over 2 years in a speech to congress on september 25 1791 he again urged the establishment of a mint to remove the scarcity of small change a scarcity which is so peculiarly distressing to the poorer classes the congress responded to this plea and not only established a mint but also provided for a national coinage system washington took a personal interest in the establishment of this coinage system and intervened when the senate bill provided for the pieture of the current president on the coins instead he successfully urged that a representation of liberty be placed on the coins the next year 1792 he used 100 of his personal silver plate for the minting of the first unitedstates coins silver 5cent pieces according to old mint documents he had not forgotten his concern about the need of the poor for coins and the coins were promptly released into circulation as shown by the heavy wear that most of them exhibit today the coin that you are considering today will not be the first time that congress has decided that a coin is an appropriate way to commemorate an anniversary of george washingtons birth fifty years ago for the 200th anniversary in 1932 a special commemorative quarter was issued supposedly for 1 year only however it proved to be so popular that it remains in circulation today the second reason for passing this legislation is that not only is there a market for the coin domestically but it will also be the first and only american entry in the worldwide silver commemorative coin market although silver coins have not been struck for circulation in recent years many nations sell them at a premium to collectors and investors and make a profit on them one excellent example is the royal canadian mint which this year will offer a commemorative silver dollar honoring the construction of a transcontinental railroad across canada this coin is part of a regular series that canada issues yearly for sale to collectors with a new design each year the coin will be offered to americans in two finishes for either 18 or 14 depending on which is chosen their efforts to attract large numbers of american buyers are shown by the many ads for the coins that have appeared in major american papers including the new york times and the wall street journal the canadians are not the only ones taking advantage of the market the april 29 issue of coin world a major hobby paper lists new silver issues aimed at collectors and investors from austria egypt gibraltar israel poland sudan switzerland and venezuela in addition it displays a prominent ad from the soviet bank for foreign trade offering that nations silver and gold medals for sale silver coins are issued internationally for a variety of reasons the silver institute states in its april newsletter that many nations issued coins for the international year of the child in 1980 and that up to 24 nations will issue them this year to commemorate the international year of the disabled person modern silver coins are sold in the millions each year many of them to american collectors and investors the profits from their sale then goes abroad to the issuing government and helps their balance of trade while at the same time hurting ours american competition would not drive the others out of the market but it would have a wide appeal with the millions of american collectors and investors in addition it would attract some foreign business and would give all the option of buying an american coin nor is the tradition of commemorative coins foreign to this country beginning in 1892 this country issued commemorative silver halfs on 48 separate occasions gold commemoratives on 6 occasions and silver dollars and quarters once each in addition there was a 40percent silver set of coins commemorating the bicentennial the profits that this coin will provide to the treasury are the third reason to support h r 3133 as written the bill directs the treasury to price the coin so that all costs associated with the production and sale of the coin are covered along with a profit to the government of up to 20 percent of the total the exact percentage was left to the treasury so that the coin could be priced at the nearest quarter dollar or so as i mentioned earlier the profits will go to the general fund of the treasury and will help to reduce the deficit for fiscal year 1982 i cannot closely estimate how large these profits will be but if silver stays at about 11 an ounce it could equal up to 15 million if the entire issue is sold while the details of the sale are left to the secretary i would hope that the coin will be promoted through the media and through other outlets such as the mint mailing list in addition if possible i would like to see volume discounts similar to those offered at one time on bicentennial sets given to financial institutions and others to encourage them to offer the coin to their customers at the original issue price if these steps or similar ones are taken i believe that the entire issue would be sold out in conclusion i believe that this coin will provide a fitting memorial to our first president while at the same time offering an american alternative to those who choose to buy silver coins this is no susan b anthony dollar but rather a profitable venture into a proven market utilizing the mints almost 200 years of expertise ameri can coins are traditionally known for their technical excellence and enjoy a wide popularity in the world now an american silver half dollar will meet the same acceptance this will be a popular coin and will be accepted by the american people as a collectors item that honors a great american h r 3434 has the support of the administration and was unanimously approved by the banking committee i would ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill"], [0.004651010036468506,

important for members of this body from time to time to step away from the pressures of daily debate and reflect more broadly on the issues before us no issue requires that kind of sober reflection more urgently than this crisis in our foreign policy i rise as a critic of current unitedstates policy while proclaiming a commitment to peace and democracy the administration continues to pursue a policy that by its very nature is incapable of securing either of these goals for the administrations policy is essentially a military policy based on a narrow ideological conception of the regions problems and prospects it is a policy that refuses to acknowledge the mistakes of the past and fs thus left without a realistic vision of the future while calling for demilitarization and an end to aggression in central america the administration continues to place arms at the disposal of some of the most ruthless forces in the region the united states has provided hundreds of milions of dollars in military aid to el salvador to a government which even ourown ambassador acknowledges continues flagrant violations of its own citizens human rights todays ap will provide a graphic and all too familiar example la plorida el salvador masita ruiz says the killers came at midnight firing machine guns and swinging machetes as she and her children lay quivering in their clay hovel the gang dragged seven screaming peas ants from neighboring huts stabbed them in the chest and face and hacked them to death in an orgy of blood before departing ms ruiz and about 12 other witnesses told an ap reporter i heard the screams and the shots she said the next day they found their bodies all cut up the heavily armed gang had stormed into the 600acre cooperative farm in la flo ta where ms ruiz and about 300 other peasants lived the date was nov 20 nobody knows who did it and why but the atrocity bore the markings of rightwing paramilitary gangs which terrorize civilians to keep them from associating with leftist rebels after the murders work stopped at la florida in the foothills of santa ana province 52 miles northwest of san salvador frightened villagers began to flee ms ruiz said she gathered her 10 children and went to live with relatives 12 miles away in santa ana city where she was interviewed the victims between 29 and 59 years old appeared to have been felled by a machete whack on the nape of the neck the la florida villagers said the killers slit the throats of three victims repeatedly stabbed them sliced off the nose of another victim and sexually mutilated him stunned negihbors buried the bodies a few days latter in makeshift graves by the road side where the victims died caked pools of blood marked the killing ground an officer at the santa ana army garrison denied the army was involved in the killing police authorities said they had no information and refused to elaborate unitedstates military aid to honduras has multiplied in the last year and threatens to destabilize a country where newly formed democratic institutions are struggling to maintain autonomy from the traditionally overpowering military costa rica a democratic nation that has long foresworn the desire for a large standing army has been pressured by the united states to strengthen its arsenal now president reagan raises the specter of military aid to guatemala a country whose brutal military regimes have earned it the condemnation of the world the folly of this policy can be illustrated by examining some of the events of the past year evidence has been accumulating fot nearly a year showing that the united states is involved in an escalating covert campaign a secret war aimed at nicaragua earlier this year the washington post reported that president reagan authorized 19 million for the cia to advise train and arm paramilitary forces along the honduran nicaraguan border at a minimum and without going beyond what the administration has cnceded the purpose of this operation was to stop the flow of arms across that border and to engage in hit and run raids to sabotage to harrass the nicaraguan government there is reason to fear that the operation has gone far beyond that it has brought the united states into a working arrangement with former members of president somozas national guard who are committed to the violent overthrow of the nicaraguan government this is a sordid alliance with people who promise a massacre in nicaragua and who boast that when they return to power there will be bodies from the border to managua the uprooted the wounded and the dead in nicaragua bear painful witness to the thrust of this campaign scores of nicaraguans have been killed and others have fled the region as guerrilla bands sweep down on isolated villages although still abetted by the united states the actions of these paramilltary forces have gained momentum beyond unitedstates control let us be clear unitedstates support for covert activities against nicaragua endangers not just the security of nicaragua but of the united states it poses issues with respect to the united states actual interest in central america and with respect to the process of forming unitedstates foreign policy to oppose unitedstates support for these covert activities is not to proclaim that the nicaraguan government is without problems and there clearly is a need for that government to encourage economic and political pluralism it is merely to proclaim that unitedstates policy in the region should not be formed through the implications of covert activities these activities commit us to a specific foreign policy that has never been openly defended and supported and whose outcome cannot be guided by our own democractic institutions a few days ago congress voiced vigorous dissent from this policy by voting unanimously to prohibit funding to any paramilitary group for the purpose of overthrowing the government of nicaragua i would like to ex press my admiration to mr harkin and others for thel leadership on this issue and to mr boland chairman of the select committee on intelligence for his clear expressions of concern and his dedication to the vigorous oversight of the consequences both in tended and unintended of unitedstates covert operations this policy is not just an isolated case rather it displays in microcosm the fundamental flaws of unitedstates policy throughout the region the united states may have started with a limited goalto end the alleged flow of cubansupplied arms across the honduran nicaraguan border but to do this required an alliance with groups like the somoscitas who have an agenda of their own we have thus become accomplices to acts of aggression against nicaragua and allies of groups committed to unmitigated cruelties this pattern has been repeated again and again as in the guise of fighting a communist threat the united states stakes its prestige on repressive military regimes whose actions we cannot endorse control or even mnbderate instead of heeding the lessons of past and present errors in unitedstates policy the administration seems determined to repeat them this is nowhere more evident than in president reagans recent embrace of guatemalas gen rios montt if the administration resumes military aid to guatemala it will not on1 be flaunting an explicit agreemenc to obtain congressional approval beforehand it will be ignoring the overwhelming evidence concerning the atrocities committed by the guatemalan government in guatemalas countryside rios montt has adopted a sophisticated and ruthless counterinsurgency campaign including a scorchedearth policy that destroys the base of rural livelihood and forces the peasants to flee the country or to camps under military control amnesty international estimates that 2 600 civilians have died in massacres since rios montt came to power americas watch has charged that by adopting a policy of total war and by abandoning the rule of law the rios montt government has become responsible for the consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights in guatemala on the mere promise that rios montt will announce electoral laws president reagan extols the guatemalan leaders commitment to democracy yet since july 1 guatemala has been under an officially declared state of seige which prohibits political and union activity requires private gatherings to be approved by the defense minister allows military authorities to detain anyone suspected of disturbing public order permits home searches without a warrant places severe restrictions on the press and creates special military tribunals to try those accused of violating the state of siege neither the promise of elections nor elections themselves will guarantee peace or even democracy to guatemala guatemala has had elections before for 30 years these have been controlled by the military and ridden with fraud in the past decade political opponents of the left and center have been mercilessly eliminated to talk of including a broad spectrum of participants in the electoral process is to ignore guatemalas past and present conditions have we forgotten that last march rios montt came to power by deposing a military leader chosen through just such an electoral process have we forgotten that only a year ago the state department assured us these elections would be a democratic solution for guatemala if the united states provides military aid to rios montt now it will only feed the climate of violence and intimidation which poisons the prospects for democracy in guatemala again the guatemalan case is not an isolated one but has broader implications that go to the heart of our understanding of democracy democracy cannot be reduced to a simple formula or to the simple ritual of elections it must rise from the hearts minds and experience of the people themselves it cannot be imposed by fiat from above we in the united states must never fall to recall that our own route to democracy was not without struggle or bloodshed and that the building of our own democratic institutions was not accomplished in a year or even a decade while expressing satisfaction with a mere skeleton of democratic procedures the administration has wasted opportunities for a genuine political solution to the conflicts of the region and has discarded chances to play a role in a concrete peace process last spring when mexican president lopez portillo offered to serve as an intermediary among the conflicting factions throughout the region the reagan administration let the offer die after a few meetings between our secretary of state and the ivexican foreign minister this fall when the presidents of mexico and venezuela made a unique joint appeal to president reagan and the heads of state of honduras and nicaragua the united states showed only rhetorical interest instead the administration quickly used a meeting of central american governments which did not include nicaragua mexico or venezuelato endorse its own conditions for dialog and declared this to be the only future forum for considering peace proposals i have long believed that regional cooperation provides the key to resolving the problems of central america countries such as mexico and venezuela are far better equipped than the united states to understand the particularities of each country and to bring together the forces necessary to secure a lasting peace the events of the last year have underscored this clearly and the administration has yet to provide a convincing rationale for ignoring and undercutting these promising peace initiatives recently there have been some auspicious signs from the administration much was gained from the presidents trip to latin americahis new respect for the individuality of each nation and his emphasis on the overriding importance of economic development i hope these themes will guide unitedstates policy in the future like many of my colleagues i have the deepest respect for george shultz whose habits of careful decisionmaking and consensus planning promise great change in our attitudes to central america secretary shultz needs and deserves time time to slowly move unitedstates policy from the ideological rut plowed by secretary haig time to implement changes of policy in a way that does not produce abrupt and unsettling tilts instead of secure progress nonetheless the administration continues to display a peculiarly onesided ability to see and support progress while mere promises of future elections make the guatemalan regime a friend of democracy fully implemented land reform programs in nicaragua evidently mean nothing while meagerly substantiated accusations of human rights abuses in nicaragua make the sandinistas the regions leading proponent of genocide the continued documented massacres in guatemala are chalked up apparently to reasons of state let us be honest and straightforward few regimes in central america are without their problems the ability of the united states to perceive subtle distinctions and support shades of progress is the key to a mature for eign policy but these subtleties must be carefully defined carefully supported and applied uniformerly or unitedstates policy becomes blind support for any regime cloaked in anticommunism the united states must be able to see and support progress on the left as well as the right and it has to be said on the left perhaps more than the right there is no overlooking the history of the region and given that history there is no mature foreign policy that does not recognize and address the revolutionary potential of the region the mexicans are want to say that each central american country must fact its own revolution and while i might dissent from their determinism their point is valid the history of colonialism repression and poverty in region that will find expression in radical politics democracy is the key to the regions future but the assertion of that ideal has to be wedded to a real program for helping each country on its road to democracy the united states has to find a way to remain close to and to influence countries as they move through rapid programs of social progress this is the fundamental foreign policy task for the united states

congressional black caucus was the first among the reagan nonnonbelievers to accept the reagan challenge to come up with a better budget than the one that he had proposed the caucus not only accepted that challenge but met it fashloning an alternative that was designed to put the 1982 budget in balance while still providing equitable tax relief and without compromising the integrity of essential social programs today we are again debating the budgetthis time for fiscal year 1983 again i believe that it is the fauntroy substitute that stands out as the best alternative to the substitutes that are being offered it is a substitute that will create new jobs and jobcreating programs for highways mass transit and for rebuilding the infrastructures of urban areas it is a substitute which creates hope for millions of poor and unemployed americans by extending and expanding benefits for unemployment and restoring benefits for medicaid food stamps and welfare programs to rational levels it is a substitute which preserves vital social educational job training and medical assistance programs for the millions of americans who are poor and unemployed the fauntroy substitute accomplishes these things while managing to shrink the federal deficit for 1983 and for years beyond but briefly let me deal in particular with two areas covered by the fauntroy substitute which have not been fully highlighted here as a member of the committee on public works and transportation and as a representative for a district whose residents rely heavily on public mass transpnrtation i believe that this countrys long history and commitment to transportation has been a key factor in our nations economic growth and development with skyrocketing interest rates unprecedented high unemployment and increasing deterioration of existing mass transit systems state and local governments cannot possibly now bear an even greater portion of the costs of transportation and mass transit than they have shouldered in the past if federal support for transportation is not continued soon some of our nations citizens will not be able to pay the cost of a bus ride in fact without aid to deteriorating mass transit systems eventually there may be no buses at all now in the area of public worksand economic development specifically as was true last year this year it is only the fauntroy substitute that adequately addresses our nations needs it does this by offering grants loan guarantees and technical assistance to states and localities all of which help create new jobs and improve the quality of life only the pauntroy substitute recognizes that programs such as these serve vital functions of revitalizing areas in which many poor and minority people live and stimulate investments that lead to new jobs the fauntroy substitute retains the 1983 authorization in existing law of 3 7 billion which is a 21 million increase over the administrations request to merely maintain the 1982 level the fauntroy substitute retains the 1983 authorization in existing law of 500 million representing a 70 million increase over the administrations request to merely fund this program at the 1982 level the fauntroy substitute also continues to fund programs such as section 312 of the rehabilitation loan program at the 1982 funding level of 69 million while the administration proposes to eliminate this program altogether furthermore the fauntroy substitute recognizes the wisdom of and necessity for retaining funding at the present level for the economic development administration the governments disaster relief program and the appalachian regional commission it is only the fauntroy substitute that recognizes for a complete economic recovery there must be a strong commitment to funding for housing highways mass transit and other infrastructure programs to create jobs and finally it proposes an 8 billion jobs vocational education and training package essential to the welfare of all americans the fauntroy substitute supports continuation of the federal role in transportation by proposing a 5centagallon increase in the federal gasoline excise tax to be used to provide jobs to rebuild transportation systems all across the country by improving roads highways and bridgesso many of which are badly in need of repairand to expand and upgrade and help to operate mass transit systems in urban areass stems which provide the only means of transportation for millions of americans the fauntroy substitute maintains funding levels for amtrak northeast corridor improvements and for other essential rail systems at congressional budget office current service levels realizing that rail transportation is a vital adjunct to the nations transportation system which needs federal help to become profitable in its own right furthermore the fauntroy subsitute provides rational and fair reductions for several transportation programs to meet the requirements of a balanced budget without compromising the quality of these programs i am certain that each subsitute that is being offered to the fiscal year 1983 budget resolution is being offered in good faith and with the conviction of its sponsors that it is a better alternative nevertheless the fact remains that the fauntroy substitute is the only one being offered today that demonstrates a clear understanding and appreciation for those americans most dependent on the services and programs that the republican substitute and other substitutcm seek to cut once again this year rendering them virtually useless to the millions of americans they were originally designed to aid the fauntroy substitute is the only alternative that heeds the cries of our constituents nationwide to restore these vital social programs and services to serve our economic and transportation needs while still retaining fiscal responsibility therefore i urge all my colleagues to give the fauntroy substitute their support thank you"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.9778156280517578, 0.9778156280517578, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i simply want to commend the distinguished ranking member of the committee on ways and

to power in addition i have issued press releases and made public speeches in which i have indicated that reaganomics was worth while i also speak to you as one who has been chastised and to some extent praised for being independent from time to time beginning during the first few months i was a member of this body when i voted against deregulating natural gas in the commerce committee when the republicans wanted it done and president carter did not and again as late as just a week or so ago when i was the only republican to vote to hold secretary of interior watt in contempt i suggest also and acknowledge that i have been called moderate independent and yes liberal but i have never been called nor do i expect to be called conservative i have had the experience of being criticized by the new right by the old right and by the always right since i came to this body and i would expect that their criticism will continue in candor i have for a long time now been contemplating speaking out and foremost among the reasons for hesitating until now has been my questioning as to whether a threeterm whitehaired republican from western pennsylvania who in his own mind has not made much of an impact on the nation should be the one to speak out besides that very important reason i felt until now that it was politically unwise and of course like so many of you believed this administrations plan should be given a chance to work but the time has come to stop this massacre the time i have taken today is for the purpose of saying to you what is on my mind to you my colleagues and i hope to the american people with the desire that whether you or they agree at least someone will be saying these things and perhaps if nothing else happens our constituencies will begin openly to discuss and debate these issues my colleagues i feel very strongly that the time is now to call out to thinking women and men every whereto raise their voices against this murderous mandate that is being carried out i believe the time has come to try to persuade those who still need persuading that what our vice president perceptively called many months ago voodoo economics should be restrained before it destroys forever a federal government which washington created which lincoln preserved and for which franklin delano roosevelt settled old arguments about its supremacy and the supremacy of its powers the time is now to see to it that what washington lincoln and roosevelt accomplished that is to provide for those who for whatever reasons cannot provide for themselves is not destroyed forever by a president and his cronies whose belief in hooverism has blinded them to the wretchedness and to the suffering they are inflicting through their policies and their refusal to reevaluate those policies on the sick the poor the handicapped the bluecollar and whitecollar workers the small business person the black community the community of minorities generally women of all economic and social backgrounds men and women who desperately need job training families that deserve and desire the right to send their children to college or graduate schoolin fact anyone and everyone other than those who have been fortunate enough to insulate themselves in a corporate suit of armor and even they my colleagues are now beginning to join their brethren on wall street as we saw just last week when the business rountable finally began questioning even though in moderation what is happening to this country as a leading columnist and broadcaster said a few days ago on his pro gram confrontation i quote what has ronald reagan done for the blacks and then he answered he has tried to change the voting rights act gutted the civil rights section of the justice department and ordered the irs to grant tax exemptions to segregated schools and then he asked question no 2 what has he done for women and he answered that by saying why hes opposed the equal rights amendment and supported what you people call the traditional family in other words girls get back in the kitchen where you belong and then he asked question no 3 what has he done for the jewish american and his answer was why he sold the awacs to saudi arabia and proposed selling jordan the p16s and then he asked qustion 4 what has he done for hispanic americans and the answer was the same thing hes done for the blacks and then he asked question 5 what has he done for americas young people and the answer to that was cut back on student loans and finallyif i may continue to quote himhe went on to say now hes a charming man this fellow reagan and he makes a marvelous afterdinner speech full of anecdotes about kids buying vodka with foodstamps but if you think the abovementioned groups containing as they do millions maybe even a majority of americans are going to vote republican this fall youve been spending too much time at the country club bar i say to you my brothers the time is now to wonder out loud whether what senator packwood said in candor about this presidents understanding or his interest in what is happening to our people was not in fact true is it not unfortunate that political restraints caused him to call the president on air force 1 and apologize i think it noteworthy however and commendable that senator packwood at least did not take back his words my own experience during the course of the watt contempt proceedings as a result of the irrational policy follbwed by the white house in forcing for no good reason a constitutional crishs leads me to believe that if this president knows at all about what is taking place throughout this land then he lacks the compassion necessary to be president you have i am sure received letters as i have and spoken to constituents who have told you of very serious personal problems that they are experiencing as a result of this presidents policies permit me to tell you about my experience in my district where the unemployment rate is now approximately 15 percent just a couple of weeks ago on a saturday morning about 7 i sat next to a man who had just the week before lost his job ie leaned over to me and said m marks i lost my job just about a week ago i still have two kids that i have to educate i dont know how i am going to pay my mortgage payment and all the other expenses i have because i havent been able to save very much why me mr marks why did they do this to me hell the only thing i ever took from the federal government was taking off the interest that i paid on my mortgage i have never been in any trouble and i have never given any trouble to anybody else why me mr marks i believe that we owe this man and people like him all over the country not only an explanation but we owe him his job backwe owe him his selfrespect back and he will not get either of these if this president and this administration are not willing to admit that for whatever the reason things have not gone as planned and have caused and will continue to cause more misery than the plan is worthif they do not begin now to make the necessary corrections even the worst of business people when seeing that a business decision that he or she has made is causing havoc in his or her business will not refuse to make the necessary corrections merely to save faceor merely for his or her own ego justice if not mercy calls for this administration to do no less govermnent does things that are worthwhile though excesses will and have always occurred those wordsgovernment of the people by the people and for the people are not merely rhetoric they are meaningfulperhaps more today than ever it is the height of irresponsibility on our part to permit the new right the old right or the alway right to erase those words or at least water down their meaning i like yourselves have watched the reaction to this administrations call for a new federalism interestingly this call has come as the states have attempted to redistrict themselves to accommodate fewer or more of us within their boundaries should we not at least be concerned as we watch one state legislature after another patently and without any apparent shame pay little or no attention to the reason behind all thisone man one woman one vote rule of lawbut rather proceed selfishly to frame membership in this body on parochial and selfish political interests only should we not at the very least ask ourselves why they would react any differently to legislating and or r iministering the most sensitive social programs within our system of governmentprograms that mean life and death to many of our people in the name of all that is holy how can you and i read about what is happening from some of our most distinguished and reputable columnist and economists or hear and see what is being said by some of americas top television journalists and believe that we can do nothing how can we give ourselves tax breaks how can we provide more and more tax loopholes for the corporate world how can we even think of stuffing the defense community with more dollars than they in their wildest dreams could use without vomiting money how can we permit this administration to spit out words of war and indulge in actions that must lead us to battle while at the same time they try to excuse the millions of people that are marching in europe opposed to our nuclear policies opposed to our policies in the middle east our policies in central and south america and in africa by just saying it is all a communistinspired plot my god did the mccarthy era teach us nothing i acknowledged openly and candidly that i say these things knowing that i voted along with many of you to do these things if i can not convince you if my words fall on deaf ears for whatever reason then may i appeal to you at least on political grounds i have the greatest empathy for the dilemma faced by our republican leaders such as our minority leader and the majority leader in the senate and our vice president if i have ever known three men of great stature with concern for not only human rights but human compassion it is those three men yet political realities which we all to some extent must consider dictates that they restrain themselves because of this republican president may i add parenthetically the real heroes are not only they but people like senator dols and senator domenicr who with all the restraints that are upon them political restraints that some of us do not have any longer they have been willing to begin to speak out yet do we their troops not have the right if not the responsibility to our people and to in fact those three men themselves to speak out and say enough is enough no responsible citizen let alone a responsible member of this body would disagree with the statement that the twoparty system is important to our american way of life yet here we are as republicans having won the majority in the senate and looking to do the same in the house of representatives and about to destroy masochistically or at least vastly minimize the advantages the nation and we have gained by our ascendancy to power i do not pose as or pretend to be a political pundit or even a very good politician for that matter however if any republican within the sound of my voice or who may read these words at some point believes that the country will not turn to new leadership with the millions and millions of unemployed people with the black community rightfully indignant and afraid with women who want only their fair share of what this government should give to all its citizens denied those rights with small business people about ready to close up shop voluntarily if not involuntarily with middleincome mothers and fathers unable to look forward to the education of their children for which they have saved all these years with the savings and loan institutions about to go under with interest rates to the point where it is impossible to buy homes and cars and borrow money with farmers on the verge of collapse with the poor elderly and the handicapped among us having to choose between eating or keeping warm with our young people having been traumatized by wars that wiped out thousands of young lives before they had a chance even to begin to live now afraid that this administration by its rhetoric and its irrational approach to selfdefense is placing us on the brink of total annihilationthen they are indulging in selfdeception if present policies persist i predict that the american people will choose new leadership and choose it soonand how can we blame them i remember not too long ago that even our most conservative colleagues from this president on down were saying that the black community and the labor community had finally seen the light and could become a part of the republican partythe party of the people if any of you my republican colleagues still think this might happen may i ask you to think with me about how this president and all the presidents men have carried that program out take a moment with me and count the number of black americans in top positions in this administration have you been listening to the leadership of the naacp the national urban league and the southern christian leadership conference from the reaction of this administration from the very top it appears that they have not been listening and i respectfully suggest that we should be listening to these great americans and begin to try to understand what they are saying are the policies of this administration building a roof under which we as republicans can stand together with labor to avoid the acid rain of economic disasterof raging unemployment and all it portends is there any reason why having asked them to join us we should now close the door in their face and tell organized labor that the door is locked to them and their people forever are we not concerned as members of the party which has in modern times at least been known as the party of the rich and who have tried to disassociate ourselves from that political weight are we not concerned that this president has failed to grasp that perception of this administrations regal image are we not concerned that the china policy and the secondhand dress business image have tarnished the statements made by this president that his administration is one dedicated to helping the people should we not be concerned that our constituents who sweated blood so that we can meet in this magnificent chamber and so that that president can live in that magnificent white home may very well turn on us and even more to the point for some of our members turn them out sweal blood at least they cannot anymore for many of them do not have jobs this house must soon face the guns of political war if winning for the sake of winning is not the only reason for your willingness to face what most people do not realize is a terrible trauma then i would think that you must begin to understand that not now nor has there ever been any truth to the political adages go along to get along or loyalty to the president at any cost i knowi very well know that those words sound presumptuous but i truly do not mean them to be remember i speak as one who though chastised for my socalled independence over the 6 years i will have served in this house am as guilty as anyone else of following those slogans too often let there be no misunderstanding as to the fact that my words today are not only for myself and my republican colleagues but for my democratic friends as wellparticularly those who chose to go along to get along both at home and in washington it strikes me as extraordinary that with few exceptions we see the democrats going to church more than perhaps ever before and looking toward the heavens expecting a message to be telegraphed on a bolt of lightning as to what to do now fortunately the speaker mr oneill who among all of those on the other side of the aisle took more personal abuse during the last election than any speaker should have to bear and took it with the grace of a saint i might add has had the guts to begin to point the finger at the president and suggest that for all of the presidents good humor he the president is the sting that paralyzes the sensibility of a government that should be helping not hurting the people it serves perhaps if there is a message in all of this at least the message that i hope comes through loud and clear it is that our federal government is goodit is worth keepingand it is meant to help not harm our citizens and that the time has come to see that those including ourselves wielding its power now do so once again for the benefit of those who sent us here and who by the way pay this president and us to do it for or to them only hired guns kill anything for moneyand this president and those that surround him pictured more and more these days in western garb were not hired to do us in lastly the first six drafts of these words that i myself wrote started off each time by saying this is a sorrowful task i undertake i have deleted them in this the final draft i

therefore i support the annunzio substitute as potentially yielding more funds to the athletes than does the committee bill and at truly no cost to the taxpayer i urge all of my colleagues to support the annunzio substitute to s 1230 the aim of congress through this legislation is to provide financial assistance to the los angeles olympic organizing committee the unitedstates olympic committee and many local amateur and youth athletic organizations this goal is admirable and should be supported by every member of congress the question we have to address today is what form this aid should take so that we are providing the best assistance we can for these organizations the first concern about s 1230 which must be faced is the lack of enthusiasm for the set of coins to be produced by the coin collectors these are the very people who we have to count on to buy the majority of the coins s 1230 provides for a set of coins that will cost between 3 000 and 5 000 to purchase who can afford to buy such a set of coins if the coin collectors do not support this effort who will a second concern with the bill is the actual amount of money which can be raised by selling the coins under the present bill the marketers who sold coins for both the montreal and moscow olympics will sell the coins for the los angeles olympics the montreal olympics saw 24 million raised to support the olympics this was only 10 percent of the amount that was promised these marketers will not release any figures for what was raised for the moscow olympics however it is generally considered that the efforts were a failure why are we now asking this same group of marketers to sell the coins for the los angeles olympics the annunzio substitute provides for more money to go to the athletes t than does m

department of energy to undertake a focused highlevel radioactive waste research and development program including the construction and operation of a test and evaluation research facility the issue of nuclear waste is one of great importance to our nation and is one which has been neglected for too long a period of time this is a problem which all agree requires a solution now the consensus is clearwe need to build a permanent repository regardless of whether our country continpes to pursue the nuclear option this repository should be built as quickly as possible consistent with environmental requirements and administrative procedure safeguards i stress environmenal considerations because we are all fully aware that our future generations will have to live with the decisions we make on nuclear waste management today the legislation before us is certainly a notable accomplishment many house committees have been involved including the science and technology committee the energy and commerce committee the interior committee the armed services committee the judiciary committee and the merchant marine committee i would like to commend any fellow colleagues on these

amendment would restore funding to the coast guard among other law enforcement agencies to the level of the authorization for the coast guard reported by the merchant marine and fisheries committee this year the driving force behind this years coast guard authorization was to provide for adequate funding and personnel to carry out all essential coast guard programs to permit procurement of needed platforms and facilities and to underwrite research and development to improve the efficiency of this service this commitment of resources is needed and long overdue as the representative from the state of alaska you have heard me repeat over and over that the services of the coast guard are extremely valuable and essential in that region however as all of us here know they are requilred throughout the entire maritime community and ultimately by the nation as a whole we in alaska need both effective fisheries law enforcement and search and rescue coverage to protect both the livelihood and lives of our people other areas of the country depend equally on specific coast guard services i remember when the recent cutbacks were announced and the loud outcry from the members of congress and others across the nation all of us were alarmed at their breadth and depth i began to wonder what would really be left of the coast guard and whether needed services would be provided to the american public without adequate funding lives would go unsaved laws would go unenforced and our national security would be impaired fortunately the administration reconsidered its actions on cutbacks and restored most of what they proposed to eliminate but what that leaves us facing is the need for more funding for this function the administration recognizes this the congress recognizes this and we should act by adopting this amendment to overcome this serious deficiency in funding i and the rest of the members here know the services of the coast guard are extremely valuable and essential not only to the marltime community but to the entire nation i have long been a supporter of fiscal and budgetary restraints but safety of life and property and the security of our nation should not be pawns in the budget process the wellbeing of our country requires that we not stand idly by and let this happen i believe our full efforts should be behind additional funding for the services provided by the coast guard so that search and rescue law enforcement military prepardness drug interdiction as well as other needed responsibilities are preserved therefore i urge all of you to support this amendment"], [0.0001868605613708496, 0.49981313943862915, 0, "in just a moment the last time i recognized the gentleman he was on this side of the aisle oh no that was years ago h 8810 co i would just like to make this point one member questioned the good faith of the secretary i happen to think he has good faith i happen to think he is an amateur when it comes to judging legislative problems and part of the problem we have is the secretarys overeagerness to cooperate with the senate but if we were in his shoes i would probably do the same thing there was a statement that he was afraid of a hearing he is not he makes an excellent witness he has been before our committee and nobody could lay a glove on him and they will not when he comes again in few weeks then the reality of my committee frankly the committee on post office and civil service is this those members who were here when we passed civil service reform and years ago post office reform recall the procedure the committee is slightly unbalanced in its legitimate bias as a result it always produces on a major gut issue like this an imperfect instrument which we then correct on the floor so my expectation was that we would cooperate in the timetable bring an imperfect instrument to the floor correct it and then we would have true reform of the benefits package for air traffic safety employees but that issue did not come quite that way it is here today and if we accept the senate position we are voting for the effectiveness of the safety conditions in the air we are saying that we as a congress understand that the law does not permit federal employees to strike we are saying we knew these people brazenly defied that law thinking they could bring the government and the country
