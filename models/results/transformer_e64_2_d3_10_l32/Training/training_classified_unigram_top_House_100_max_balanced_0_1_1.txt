commitment her friendship i will miss our conversations on the floor of the many moving words said of sala in recent days i think that these words spoken at her memorial service in san francisco by frank kielinger gave the greatest sense of who sala and phil burton were frank kieliger worked with and for the burtons for many years i would like to insert his remarks in the record yesterday as we stood in this rotunda and watched the people of san francisco pay tribute to sala there was a moment of overpowering grief and loss and i said to my son this is the last time we will see sala later as we walked in the dark through the plaza outside this teenager said to me dad your wrong look around you well isee sala every time we see these people only she would notice we had just passed one of the confused and homeless night people and we were in sight of the tents of those seeking help for aids victims by demonstrating at the old federal building in a single sentence he had captured sala he had told me her story elie wiesel in his work souls on fire tells us of the role of story and memory in our lives he writes my father an enlightened spirit believed in man my grandfather a fervant hasid believed in god the one taught me to speak and the other to sing both loved stories and when i tell mine i hear their voices whispering from beyond the silenced storm they are what links the survivor to their memory we are here today to refresh our memories and to renew our commitments to all that sala burton represents in her life we come to share our stories of her i leave to others the task of commenting on her political prowess and her skills as a legislator the sala i knew and loved was larger then the sum of these parts 1 have asked myself over and over what made her so special and how can that specialness be expressed in brief remarks i have searched my thirty year recollection of her and what i find is a woman so secure in the knowledge of her own humanity so secure in knowledge of her own dignity and worth as a person that she would spend her life defending the dignity and worth of others sala was a woman who could talk to me when i was a young man about the worlds indifference to the approaching holocaust and of her own personal experiences of eastern european antisemitism and of fleeing poland she could do so without hate but with a fierce determination that the story be told for sala this bitter lesson of the past must be alive in our memory so that this most heinous crime against humanity can never happen again she told me the story sala was a woman who lived rather than preached the values of her jewish heritage in her struggle for peace in the world for an end to the arms race for a world freed from the threat of nuclear annihilation in her opposition to the immoral practice of hiring mercenaries by funding the contras in nicaragua there can be heard the echoes of the prophet isaiah they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks and nations shall make war no more in salas ceaseless quest for a just and more humane society a society which recognizes its obligations to the poor the aged the infirmed the homeless and all who are dispossessed in this land she made tangible the words of micah you have been told 0 man what is good and what is required of you to live justly to show mercy and to walk humbly with your god for sala accidents of race color creed national origin ancestry gender or sexual orientation could never be excuses for denying the inherent dignity of the human person and her life is summed up in the struggle to make that ideal a reality it was sala who introduced me to the reality of racial discrimination and racism and who educated me and formed my conscience on these issues as she involved me in the struggle for fair employment practices and fair housing in our state so many years ago it was sala who introduced me to the concept that the magnificent document we call the constitution of the united states protects all or it protects none it was sala who opened my eyes to the dangers of mccarthyslm and to its remnants in our society as we stood in union square and listened to phil then in the assembly call for the abolition of the house committee on un american activities some of us can still remember the picture of the hoses being turned on demonstrators and the water cascading down these very stain as dedicated civil libertarians were dragged down them for protesting the presence of that comnittee in our city and sala would feel deep anger at the sight of this injustice for sala was a woman whose conscience was so finely honed whose perceptions of social justice and human rights were so clear that she was truly a woman well ahead of her time she was a pioneer ever pressing forward ever encouraging the more fainthearted of us to follow where phil would move mountains by the shear volume of his knowledge and the weight of his arguments sala would touch the heart would prick the conscience would call us to be what we can and should be concerned and caring human beings when phil might seem preoccupied or distant in his singlemindedness sala was always the embodiment of care and concern they were a unique team their lives were both public and private and it is in the private moments that their great love and respect for one another was most evident and as i say these words i can envision phil even now reaching over and grasping her hand in a gesture which in life spoke volumes they are once again together they are once again an invincible team i have spoken of the sala i know with a very special affection it was she after all who suggested to phil many years ago that he hire me on a six month trial that six months stretched into twenty five rewarding years in which i learned from them that the purpose of public life is service that power is always exercised in behalf of the powerless and that those who possess the platform for public debate have the obligation to eloquently and forcefully express the aspiration of those in our society who are voiceless that is my story of sala burton the sala i will remember every time i see the faces of the people she saw and whose dignity she defended it is my prayer that the god of abraham our god who blessed her and kept her in life who made his continence to shine upon her with a special radiance will now grant her peace sala we loved you we will remember you and we will retell you story for years to come"], [0.001854538917541504, 0.9981454610824585, 1, "i rise in support of the resolution the fiscal year 1988 transportation appropriations act that is incorporated into this resolution contains 10 206 billion in new discretionary budget authority and 9 128 billion in new discretionary outlays these figures are under the budget authority and outlay targets that were set pursuant to the economic summit agreement unfortunately in the process of making the economic summit budget reductions we have had to reduce transportation programs by approximately 3 percent more than i believe was required to meet our targets the coijferees had agreed to add language mandating the sale of railroad redeemable preference share equity instruments held by the federal governmentwhich will yield an outlay savings of 240 million unfortunately while the omb and cbo ruled this to be a legitimate savings they would not credit these savings to the transportation bill this scorekeeping gamesmanship will have important real life consequences for our important transportation programs i find it unfortunate that the economic summit agreement participants chose to leave the final decislonmaking authority to such an improtant task to the unelected officials at

friend sala burton the passing of sala and shortly after the word came that she had passed on and the gentleman from california sought the opportunity for the members to come to the floor under special orders to pay the first tribute to sala burton i came to the floor and i listened to what the others were saying about sala and i know each of us was so taken with our own thoughts one of the things i did i kept looking up to that area of the gallery and remembering so many times that i would look up there if there was one of phils battles on the floor a major piece of legislation that phil would be handling if it was an important moment for this house sala burton before she became a member but as phils partner would be sitting right up there i kept looking up there missing her i have to say that sala was my very dear personal friend when i heard so many members coming from all over that day on such short notice to eulogize sala and to say how much they loved her and how much they would miss her i have to say i was surprised because i thought she was just my special friend i thought that she was a political acquaintance to the other members of the house and she was a colleague to her colleagues from california but that she was my special friend i realize today that that was salas special gift that for each one of us she was our special friend she was a wonderful woman sala burton was a wonderful wife too i was fortunate enought to be a friend of both phil and sala i met phil in the late sixties here and he helped me to get legislation through this house that gave the virgin islands a seat in this house of representatives the relationship between phil and sala was such a beautiful relationship phil the stormy phil burton the great legislator the powerful individual with a heart even bigger than that huge body he had and sala that loved him that was his true partner and how he loved her too at the funeral service in san francisco there were those that recalled how sala would calm the troubled waters that phil had passed by and she had that gift we will all miss sala she was a woman of great conviction as another member just said today she was so proud of her jewishness she cared so much for the poor and for those that needed help and that was why i particularly liked both phil and sala they were legislators that cared and never forgot why they had come here when sala came into this body as an elected representative many thought perhaps that this was just sala burton the devoted wife and partner of phil coming here but she sure showed us she was a very very effective member of this house and legislator in the short period that she was here now we will miss her she was a wonderful woman she was a wonderful wife a great legislator and a great friend the sorrow of losing sala burton will be slow to pass but we can take heart knowing the inspiration of salas life and convictions also will be slow to pass her commitment to peace social justice and equality for all knew no compromise we must keep that commitment before us as we wrestle with the hard decisions that face us in this hall but salas inspiration goes far beyond the political realm as we usually know it her political beliefs crew directly out of her compassionate and caring personality it was wonderfully typical of salawhose political causes spanned continentsthat she found time to lend a hand to the small territory of the virgin islands she and her late husband phil were abiding political allies and personal friends for more than 20 years over the yearseven as they worked tirelessly for peace and civil rights and national parklands for allthey extended their concerns to the virgin islands and other offshore territories thanks to leaders like sala and phil we in the islands have won basic rights to elect our governors and gain representation in congress sala and phil had nothing to gain from this sort of struggle but it fit their

burton mr speaker and my colleagues and those who are watching this memorial sala burton served in this house for 3 years her husband served for close to two decades if you look at that statistic alone it does not really tell you the reality of the contributions of both phil and sala because they both served together during all those years they worked together collaborating together in the mutual objectives that they shared politically they both cared deeply about the role that government could play to help the disadvantaged the dispossessed to try to bring about social and economic justice they cared about the working people and the ability of those people to organize collectively to fight for their rights they always saw the people who were struggling who were having a tough time as the ones who needed their help most they cared about protecting the environment and they cared very deeply about this nation of ours sala burton was a refugee from poland she and her immediate family survived the nazi holocaust in europe those in the immediate family that did not come to this country were all lost in the crematoria of hitlers death camps that fact probably more than any other impressed upon sala the deep commitment to protecting civil liberties civil rights understanding that minority groups that might be discriminated against one day could be hated the next and uncontrolled discrimination and hatred can lead to such enormous evil that she knew we had to act before these kinds of things got out of hand on a personal note i have known sala and phil for close to 30 years when i was a young teenager and belonged to the young democrats in california phil and sai would talk to us when most grownup politicians were not spending any time with the kids about why politics was a noble thing to be involved in why the fights that we were fighting were often so frustrating were important and that we could make a contribution and that we had to keep on trying to make things better when my family and i came to washington the door was always open to us at the burton home 01450 i know that both when i was in sacramento and when we came here our daughter who is now 23 grew up calling sala burton aunt sala there was a very very close bond of friendship between our families on a very personal level they were always there phil and sala to give us some guidance some encouragement some reinvigoration of commitment to try to accomplish in some way the goals they set out for themselves and set as role models for us to try to emulate one of the most touching tributes at the lovely memorial service in san franscisco was given by the speaker of the state assembly another person who has gone back even longer than almost any of us who are involved in public office in his political and personal relationship with phil and sala and that was speaker willy brant he closed his very eloquent remarks by saying that the best memorial tribute to sala burton is to try to act the way saia acted to try to live up to the ideals that she not only personified but urged upon all of us if we in some way could live up to that standard we would be by that example following her example and giving the greatest memorial to her i hope that as we remember fondly the memories of sala burton and the time we have had with her over the years the time that she has been with us in this institution that we will try to live up to the standards that she set for all of us to the goals and ideals that she so strongly and firmly believed in and in that way we will indeed be giving a living memorial to all the work that she has done over the years i do want to indicate that my wife janet had the opportunity to do an interview with sala burton a couple of months ago and i will insert that interview into the record i think it speaks a lot about sala in ways that many people did not know about her particularly her remembrances of the holocaust and very strong feelings

government business and other professional fields and he coordinated the activities of polishamedcan organizations and individuals throughout the united states whose concerns were civic cultural and educational affairs since the presidency of john f kennedy mazewski provided advice and consultation for evey resident of the oval office from its birth america has offered haven and promise to all

introduce legislation to postpone the date on which the second and third installments of contra aid will be made available in order to give the house and senate select committees time to complete their investigations of the iranian arms scandal this is not the first time i have stood on this floor to talk about legality and fiscal accountability in the contra aid program last march i stood here because we did not know where 27 million in contra aid had gone we were reading stories in the newspaper every day about money that may have been lost or diverted to honduras or used to buy weapons instead of food and medicine at that time i introduced a resolution of inquiry to get to the bottom of the matter as a result of my resolution and the investigations which followed we learned that onehalf of the 27 million appropriation is missing we may never know where that money went we may never know whether money the congress appropriated for humanitarian aid was used to buy weapons and ammunition lastfall i stood here again when we were debating whether we should give another 100 million to the contras but i did not think we should spend another dime for the contras until weknew where the previous appropiation had gone so i introduced an amendment to prohibit any aid for the contras until we knew where the 27 million had gone my amendment lost and the house sent the unfortunate message that legality and fiscal accountability did not matter in the contra aid program one month later we learned that the united states had secretly sold weapons to iran and then diverted the profits from those arms sales to the contras and we found out that these diversions were made at a time when congress had specifically prohibited aid to the contras i had written to attorney general meese just 1 day before these disclosures were made to request the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate the arms shipments to iran and united states involvement with the contras at that time my concerns were based on news reports linking the administration to the hasenfus affair and on continuing evidence that the united states had been providing aid to the contras the very next day we learned how deeply involved the united states may actually have been with the contras according to attorney general meese between 10 million and 30 million in profits from these sales had been diverted to bank accounts held by the contras these diver sions had been made at a time when the boland amendment specifically prohibited aid to the contras in any form so i am standing here again and the questions are the same how much money was given to the contras where did the money come from was it done in violation of the law what was the money used for these are important questions and they demand answers but before we even have a chance to learn the answers the house may again face the issue of providing aid to the contras under the provisions of the aid law congress passed last year the 100 million appropriation for the contras was split into three installments a first installment of 40 million a second installment of 20 million and a final 40 million installment the first in stallment was released immediately but the second and third were delayed under the aid law the second installment is now available anytime the president wants to make use of it the third installment which is subject to a congressional resolution of disapproval is available after february 15less than 1 month from now the administration has not announced its intention to make use of the second installment and the third is not available until the middle of next month that means that 60 million in contra aid is waiting to be spent next month if the president decides he wants to apply the last installment of contra aid congress may pass a resolution of disapproval and try to prevent him from applying the aid but i do not think that we will have any clearer picture of the diversion issue in 3 weeks than we have right now we need more time and the american people need more time to learn the facts for this reason i am introducing legislation to push back the date on which the third installment becomes available from february 15 to november 15 the house investigating committee is expected to issue its final report on october 30 which would give the house 2 weeks to consider the results of that investigation before considering the release of funds for the contras in addition my legislation would place the second installment in escrow until november 15 as well my legislation allows for the changeover in fiscal years so that the money would still be earmarked for aid to the contras but it would not become available until we know more about the diversion issue after november 15 the president could report to congress on his intention to apply the remaining 60 million in appropriated funds for aid to the contras congress could still as under the original aid law pass a resolution of disapproval but instead of voting to disapprove of the third installment only the congress could vote to disapprove of the second installment as well let me make clear that my legislation would not alter the purpose of the original aid law if after november 15 the president wanted to use the 60 million for the contras and if there were no evidence at that time that a diversion might have taken place then the aid could be applied just as under the original aid law congress would however reserve the right to disapprove of the release of funds the main goal of my legislation is to give us more time to make what will be a very important decision all my legislation does is give 2 the reference in that section to on the congress and the american people the and after february 15 1987 shall be time they need to know the facts before deemed to read after november 15 1987 facing this issue once again and 3 section 206 c of the act shall be i voted against the 100 mil deemed to read as follows lion aid appropriation but it was the will of c funds transferred under subsection the unitedstates congress that the aid be approved i a shall remain available until may 31 do not question that decision although i do 1988 not agree with it but when the congress sec 3 description of act referred to made that decision last year we did not know as used in this act the term the act all the facts we did not kow that the united means the act making appropriations for states may have been violating laws by pro military construction for the department of viding aid to the contras at a time when the defense for the fiscal year ending septemcongress had prohibited that aid and we did ber 30 1987 and for other purposes as connot know that officials of the unitedstates government tained in section 101 k of the joint resolumay have been pursuing their own foreign tion making continuing appropriations for policy agendas in direct opposition to the will the fiscal year 1987 and for other purposes house joint resolution 738 public law 99of the unitedstates congress 500 as supplemented by public law 99now we have reason to suspect that this 591 may have happened if we knew then what we suspect now would the congress have approved aid to the contras maybe yes but whitfield b east jr a maybe no the drafters of the aid law had lifetime of service enough foresight to know that the situation might change before the final installment was the speaker pro tempore under made available that is why the resolution of a previous order of the house the

charges hit top harian officer by e a wayne wasingtonm united states attorneys in miami are preparing to indict a senior haitian military figure on drug trafficking charges according to unitedstates and haitian exile sources col jeanclaude paul commander of the powerful dessaline battalion in haitis capital has been under suspicion of drug smuggling since 1986 sources say but only recently have investigators compiled enough evidence to proceed with grandjury activity and possible indictment ile would apparently be charged with aiding the flow of colombian cocaine to the unitedstates and of arms from the unitedstates to colombia sources say some sources say an indictment is imminent but given secrecy of the process others are unsure if colonel paul is indicted the case will severely challenge haitian president leslie manigat who has pledged a crackdown on drug smugglers though unitedstates officials were unwilling to discuss the judicial investigation they said an indictment could call into question the arrangements by which mr manigat came to power if he tries to fire paul unitedstates congressional sources say that will view this as a serious litmus test of civilian control in haiti and of how the unitedstates should deal with the new regime pauls unit is viewed as the most important in the country and his troops are fiercely loyal to him unitedstates officials say this makes it very difficult for haitis president or pauls nominal military superiors to move against him wellinformed haitians say paul has warned that he will not go down alone if others try to remove him paul allegedly played a major role in directing violence that upset the november elections in haiti because of close ties to the tonton macoutes the secret police created during the duvalier dictatorship the violence and killing paved the way for manigats election last month paul is seen as very close to the gen william regala who was no 2 man in haitis transitional junta and may be named defense minister he is the muscle and regala is the brain says a haitian opposition source but paul has an independent power base since becoming commander of the dessaline barracks in early 1986 he has assiduously wooed his troopsdining with them wearing fatigues like theirs supplementing their pay with bonuses allegedly funded from drug trafficking washington sources say they will kill at his command a haitian opposition source says paul has also reportedly incorporated several thousand tonton macoutes into his unit making it even more formidable us officials say hes got all the guns one us specialist says washington first raised reports of pauls activities in the transitional haitian government in 1986 but received no satisfactory reply officials say after the initial us complaints an internal haitian military investigation was launched haitian exile sources say the final report reportedly confirmed the charges and included aerial photos of pauls farm with a private landing strip but after the army chief of staff presented it to gen henri namphy the thenacting head of government the investigating officers were reportedly transferred and accused of plotting a coup the army chief of staff and the colonel in charge of the investigation were subsequently forced to retire us officials could not confirm the haltians charges while stressing their lack of knowledge of the us judicial investigation they say earlier us intelligence indicates paul is alleged to have taken over parts of the drugtrafficking ring once reportedly run by the fatherinlaw of mr duvalier pauls brother alexander former haitian consul in miami is reported to have been in that earlier operation and the current one they say colombian cocaine and marijuana were reportedly the staples of this trade informed haitians here say that paul is well tied into the tonton macoutes in part because his father was in the personal entourage of franqois duvalier who founded the group to keep the military and opponents in line pauls reported ill deeds go beyond drugs a reuter dispatch from haiti reports that he and his two brothers arranged to receive the 4 000 tons of waste from the city of philadelphia dumped on the haitian coast line near the port of gonaives in january haiti opposition sources have provided the monitcr with what appears to be an import authorization from haitis minister of commerce for the paul brothers to import 20 million kilograms of usorigin ash free of inspection unloading of the ash stopped after local residents vigorously complained news reports from haiti indicate the waste may contain high levels of dioxin press reports say the paul brothers reportedly received 200 a ton to accept the ash washington will be watching carefully how the haitian government reacts if the indictments are issued the us has cut off all but humanitarian aid and antidrug cooperation with haiti until democratic elections are held senior us officials have made clear that they will judge the new government by its acts us officials believe manigat was elected after striking a deal with the military reports from haiti sources say indicate general namphy who headed the transitional government will be named chief of staff and general regala who was namphys no 2 will become defense minister martial celestine an associate of manigat was named prime minister tuesday us officials an congressional activists doubt that manig can move against paul alone they also wonder if namphy and regaia have the will or courage to act against their powerful colleague but if the

of the trade and international economic policy reform act of 1987 i believe that the enactment of this legislation is essential to the revitalization of american industry and the economic wellbeing of many of this countrys working men and women the trade deficit in this country has dramatically increased since the reagan administration took office rising from 40 billion in 1981 to over 170 billion in 1986 the administration has demonstrated that it is unable to respond satisfactorily to our evergrowing trade problem leaving congress no option but to step in with a legislative remedy h r 3 is such a remedy and is an appropriate and long overdue answer to our astounding trade deficit of special importance to my home state of west virginia are the provisions in the bill which deal with trade adjustment assistance worker benefits and other worker retraining and assistance programs the rate of unemployment in west virginia remains one of the highest in the nation and the state has the additional dubious distinction of having the highest rate of job loss due to plant closings in the country h r 3 modifies the trade adjustment assistance program in a manner which will be very beneficial to west virginia the bill specifies that all workers certified for assistance under taa would be entitled to up to 4 000 in training and remedial education benefits if the cost of the services provided is less than 4 000 the remainder could be used to pay relocation expenses presenilty workers receiving taa assisance apply for specific training and education programs and the amount of services provided to individual workers varies depending on the programs and their availability by creating an entitlement program the bill would ensure that all workers will receive an adequate level of service the bill creates a new option of supplemental wage payments under taa for workers who take a new job that pays less than their previous job specifically workers would be entitled to receive a supplemental wages 50 percent of their taa unemployment allowances subject to the limit that their new wages and supplement combined could not exceed 80 percent of their previous wage the typical supplement would be about 2 per hour and could continue for up to 1 year under the bill workers eligible for taa would be permitted to choose between undergoing retraining or taking a lesser paying job this option is especially important to older workers who may not wish to undergo retraining and begin a new career new badly needed funding sources for taa are established in h r 3 language in the bill specifies that any tariff revenues collected as a result of import relief or unfair trade actions are to be deposited in a special adjustment industry trust fund within the treasury to be used to help support taa or any other federal program that might be established for communities in which a substantial number of workers or firms are certified for ta expenditures from the trust fund would still be subject to annual appropriations title v of the bill establishes a new program of great importance to west virginia entitled worker readjustment which would provide comprehensive services to dislocated workers who have lost their jobs due to plant closings layoffs or other major disruptions this includes but is not limited to workers directly affected by increased imports h r 3 authorizes a total of 980 million for the new worker readjustment program for fiscal year 1988 the bill directs each state to establish a tripartite council to oversee the operation of the new program the councils would be composed of equal numbers of representatives from labor management and public and nonprofit organizations in addition the bill requires each state to designate a rapid response team or office within the state government which can respond immediately to major plant closings these teams would assist workers with reemployment employee buyouts enrollment in training progams and early retirement planning and would provide other social services under the bill 30 percent of the funds for the adjustment program would be allocated to basic readjustment servicesservices to meet the immediate needs of workers following a plant closing these services include job placement assistance counseling and job clerks up to 15 percent of funds for basic services could be used for supplemental income and supportive services for displaced workers no more than 15 percent of the funds could be used for administrative costs onehalf of the funds under the new adjustment program would be used for retraining and longterm adjustment assistance to displaced workers including classroom training literacy workshop onthejob training and remedial education the bill specifies that to the maximum extent possible workers should be given training certificates or vouchers so that they can select and arrange their own retraining up to 30 percent of this category of funds could be used for supplementary income and supportive services for displaced workers who otherwise could not afford to enter such retraining funds would be distributed among the states based on a weighted formula which takes into account each states unemployment rate its unemployment rate relative to other states and its longterm unemployment rate as a state with chronically high unemployment rates west virginia would receive a fair share of these funds finally the remaining 20 percent of the adjustment funds would be allocated at the discretion of the secretary of labor for special projects of national or regional concern these projects could include industrywide activities technical assistance responses to mass layoffs or demonstration projects to reiterate while h r 3 is a highly complex piece of legislation which deals with many aspects of this countrys trade policy i am especially supportive of the worker retraining provisions in the bill these provisions will go a long way toward alleviating the hardship and stress brought about by the unfair trading practices of many of this countrys trading partners the people of west virginia and the country desperately

man who left the alamo we are standing right outside those doors in 1986 when you did not know whether you would be the next speaker third in line to the presidency of the united states cod forbid something should happen of a fatal nature to both the president and the vice president you would be the president and you stood out there and told me that you were being hammered on by the far left forces of your party and that your votesthose were the days when you had to vote as speaker you only have to vote when you feel like it or to break a tieyou said that your votes were not reflective of your true feelings on national security and defense i said i am going to remember this conversation jim and i am going to remember this moment and right where we are standing because i expect you to start acting like a texan who loves his country once you are the speaker and i think you are going to make it and you did but coming from the shadow of that alamo which does not stretch with any difficulty from san antonio up to fort worth the great district you represent i cannot believe that you feel as did the 183 texans and tennesseans under davy crockett who died in the alamo i am now getting this constant image of the frenchman who when colonel travis drew a line in the sand with his saber and said if any body wants to leave because it looks like we are all going to die step across that line that one frenchmanand i am going to find out from the library of congress if he was an american citizen by thenstepped forward and said colonel mr travis i was at the battle of waterloo in 1815 i have seen enough killing for one lifetime and ill take the story out to the world and he left the alamo if that man is your hero that you want to opt from this slaughter that is going on right now of these boys and girls i said this morning before the mikes were cut off on meand that is a first in the history of the housethat i saw these boys and girls down there whose eyes i looked into with my 28yearold son just a few weeks ago and told them i would never forget them and i said i would never stand by and see them slaughtered well those boys and girls are dying for freedom just as certainly as those tennesseans and texans did at the alamo when patrick buchanan wrote that the liberal leadership of the house had become the indispensable arm of the communist expansion in this hemisphere i sent a message to patrick that i thought those words were too harsh i do not know whether it was 1 year ago or 6 months ago but i do not think those words were too harsh right now the leadership of this house has become the indispensable arm of the soviet unions intent to lock in and consolidate a colony for all the world a mere image of one of the east bloc nations

real people men and women who want freedom who thought they were getting it under the sandinistas but not under ortega these are the people that the president calls freedom fighters they are outnumbered with the military strength of the sandinistas but they are still fighting for freedom i wonder why we have become so sophisticated that we cannot recognize it that it was free dom fighters who made our own united states possible have we gone so far from our roots that we have forgotten the men and women who cre ated this great country of ours what about these americans who dumped tea into boston harbor in defiance of the british rulers what of those who fought and died at saratoga and at valley forge these were no fancy military experts but they knew if they could get their freedom they had to fight for it and that is what the contras are doing the individuals that we are proposing to cut off with this legislation what a travesty that so many members of this body should be opposing the men and women who seek freedom and who hate a cruel and ruthless dictatorship have we forgotten how our country was built the brave men and women who crossed the river delaware with general washington to put to rout the british enemy whom they had opposed they were also contras they were contra england how can we justify a vote in opposition to these nicaraguan freedom fighters how can we turn our backs to those who seek freedom who are even willing to give their lives in freedom let us remember that nicaragua is in desparate straits its inflation rate is at an astounding 13 000 percent and as the eloquent columnist of the washington post mr krauthammer said if the united states stops helping the contras she will have managed the most extraordinary self inflicted strategic surrender in memory our decline will be well earned certainly no redblooded american would want to be present at that consummation this afternoon we are debating the future of tile contras but the basic issue in this debate is what america itself is all about the opportunity of freedom over the years america has stood for freedom and thousands of people from other lands have come to america because they hated oppression one of the very first actions of the new united states of america was a proposal sponsored by our fourth president james lonroethe monroe doctrineand its impact was sweeping that we would tot permit any foreign government to eatablish itself in our hemisphere we wanted only governments that were free as we in america the issue before this free american congress today is freedom itself the nicaraguan government as everybody knows has violated that monroe doctrine a native leftwing groupthe sandinistasforcefully took over the somoza government but they only did so by promising the organization of american states that they would establish a free democratic government that would include other parties that free elections would be held and that would include persons representing all groups in the nation but those promises were quickly shoved aside and the government of the ortega boys promptly forgot their promises to the nicaraguan peopleabout freedom within a short time nicaragua has become a totalitarian communist regimea total violation of the monroe doctrine in a continent reserved especially for freedom the leader of

period can reduce crime by stopping many criminals from acquiring handguns of course some sophisticated criminals will always be able to acquire handguns however this legislation can prevent many common criminals from acquiring handguns for instance the superintendent of the new jersey state police reports that in the 19 years that new jersey has required a background check for handgun purchases 10 000 convicted felons have been caught trying to buy handguns a waiting period can also help to reduce the use of handguns in personal disputes the department of justice reports that 57 percent of all murders committed with handguns involve acquaintances or family members by establishing a 7day waiting period before the purchase of a handgun this law will allow individuals anger to
