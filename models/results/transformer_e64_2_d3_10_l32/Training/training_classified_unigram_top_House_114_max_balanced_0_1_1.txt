american people saw what liberals would pass when given free rein and a blank check with doddfrank democrats deemed it necessary to punish small community banks with burdensome regulations they cannot afford to comply with doddfrank created a new unaccountable bureaucracy called the cfpb which is funded in a way that obscures its transparency and prevents congress direct oversight of the agency the lack of accountability like that seen with the cfpb and the heavy hand of agencies like the epa and the irs have become hallmarks of this administration with the stimulus bill democrats gave handouts to their union and socalled green energy friends taxpayers were on the hook for loan guarantees to companies like solyndra which used its political connections in the white house to push through irresponsible loan approvals when solyndra went bankrupt it was at the cost of the american people many other smaller boondoggles came out of the stimulus silly studies on ducks over 1 million on road signs that promote the stimulus and over 3 million for a tunnel for turtles in florida this leaves obamacare too many americans have felt the negative consequences of what boils down to a government takeover of the healthcare industry the president claimed this law would decrease premiums by 2 500 per year instead they have risen since obamacare has been enacted to go with the increase in cost many americans have seen a sharp decrease in their choices there are fewer plans available restricting the ability of hardworking families to choose coverage that is appropriate for their circumstances taken together this trio of liberal policies is adding layers of bureaucratic red tape forcing americans to pay more for health care and putting taxpayers on the hook in 2009 democrats used the blank check to add 1 5 trillion in discretionary spending when republicans gained control of the house of representatives in 2011 we put discretionary spending on a downward trend discretionary spending funds our federal agencies such as the epa and the irs as well as the department of defense we have made real cuts in spending not slowdowns in growth and not projected cuts down the roadhonesttogod cuts in spending since i took office in 2011 discretionary spending has been cut significantly by 434 billion but this does not address mandatory spending which is the real driver of our national debt this includes programs like food assistance welfare medicare medicaid social security and interest on our debt reforms are needed to ensure these programs work efficiently and are sustainable because of the way obamacare was written and enacted mandatory spending also includes large portions of obamacare funding mandatory spending is on autopilot and will continue with or without congress annual appropriations process the fact is we have to change the law that means both chambers of congress have to pass reforms and the president has to sign them or we have to override a veto mandatory spending accounts for threequarters of all money spent by the federal government this is a 180degree change from when i was a teenager when in 1970 mandatory spending was only about a third of government spending realistically there is only one path to a balanced budget and shrinking our national debt that path is to pass a budget and use a process called reconciliation a budget facilitates reconciliation which only requires a 51vote majority in the united states senate and avoids a filibuster by liberals who want to continue running up americas credit card not doing a budget forfeits the opportunity to do reconciliation reconciliation with mandatory spending program reforms coupled with real tax and regulatory reforms will send a strong signal to our entrepreneurs and businesses which will unleash innovation and the american spirit and will thus grow our economy and provide for our national defense a vibrant economy will provide for our national security and priorities without raising taxes we have an opportunity with a new president next year to send two reconciliation bills to his deskone for this fiscal year and another for the next fiscal year elections do matter and this one has historic implicationsone being a path to a stronger america and opportunity for every american or a path on a downward spiral of economic disaster

today this body will vote on h r 36 the paincapable unborn child protection act this legislation should not be controversial it simply protects unborn babies that a preponderance of scientific evidence has proven can feel pain we are talking about the sixth month of pregnancy this bill is an important step in protecting the unborn i am a proud cosponsor i look forward to casting my vote in favor of the legislation later today recently a group of students at west virginia university made news for courageously speaking out in defense of life at an abortion clinic near morgantown i know firsthand that it is not always politically correct to stand for your values but we should never back down from protecting the unborn i applaud these brave wvu students for their actions their willingness to stand for life reminds me of my days at dartmouth college when i served as the president of the dartmouth coalition for life i remember standing in the cafeteria and handing out educational materials about protecting the unborn and the development of life while i may not have won any popularity contest by standing up for my beliefs that life is precious and abortion is wrong i sure got my fellow students thinking about the prolife issue my prolife commitment was cemented even further when i became a father i have three children and actually today my youngest daughter turns 7 months old i am pleased to represent the state of west virginia where the prolife movement is thriving and the rights of the unborn are being restored in fact just this past february our west virginia state legislature passed our own paincapable unborn protection act by wide bipartisan margins in the state senate of west virginia the exact same bill banning abortion after 20 weeks passed the state senate of west virginia by a vote of 295 with 11 of 16 democrat state senators in my statethat is 68 percent of the democratsvoting for the bill in the west virginia state house of delegates the vote was 8812 again with twothirds of state house members that are democrats voting for the bill this is a bipartisan issue i am hopeful today that a strong bipartisan majority in this chamber will follow the example of my home state of west virginia and pass the paincapable unborn child protection act so these protections are extended to unborn babies in every state in the united states i am honored to also be the lead cosponsor of the life at conception act which simply clarifies that human life begins at conception there is no question that we in the prolife community have our work cut out for us president obama and most democrats in congress refuse to protect life at any stage one of the best examples of how out of touch the other side on this abortion issue came just a few weeks ago across the aisle in the senate where democrats were willing to block a bill aimed at protecting victims of human trafficking simply because it included a provision that prohibited taxpayer funding of abortion they are the extremists on this issue look at president obama himself in 2008 when he was running for president and he was in a debate against john mccain in the saddleback church forum moderated by rick warren the moderator asked president obama when life began and the presidents response was whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade the president of the united states said it is above his pay grade to say when human life begins that is a shame when i ran for congress i made the commitment to the people of the second district of west virginia that i would do everything in my power to defend the unborn i continue to be guided by my faith my values

rule provides for the consideration of h r 427 the regulations from the executive in need of scrutiny act of 2015 the committee on rules met on this measure yesterday evening and heard testimony from both the chairman and the ranking member of the subcommittee on regulatory reform commercial and antitrust law of the committee on the judiciary in addition to receiving amendment testimony this rule brought forward by the committee is a structured rule there were 18 amendments total submitted to the committee on rules of those submitted i am pleased to say that the full house will debate and vote on 10 of those amendments this legislation also went through regular order in the committee during the committee markup eight amendments were debated and voted on including one i offered and that the committee had actually agreed to this rule provides for 1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and the ranking member of the committee on the judiciary i appreciate the hard work of the committee on the judiciary chairman bob goodlatte and his full committee and subcommittee staff in bringing forward h r 427 i strongly support this rule and the underlying legislation because when we reform our nations regulatory system we will jumpstart the engine of our economy and when our economy gets up and going our families flourish what does this administration produce more than 60 of every day here is a hint it is not jobs the answer lies in the heart of many woes facing small businesses and established industries what they produce every day is regulations the goal of any regulation should be to achieve a benefit that would not be possible without it designed in such a fashion that the achieved benefit far outweighs the cost but our administration has lost sight of this goal and americas economic engine is paying the price our current federal government designs regulations that are often unnecessary and achieve little to no benefit but at very high cost the rules have become so skewed that this administrations regulators are at war with american businesses industries such as manufacturing and technology are fighting to compete in a global market but first they must survive the regulatory beast that is strangling innovation and growth this administration is legislating through regulation yet decries the reins act and calls it an unprecedented requirement when you circumvent congress and exploit the rulemaking process in order to one make law and two make law in contradiction to the wishes and needs of the american people you should expect unprecedented responses in just the first 7 days of 2015just the first 7 days of 2015the administration unveiled 300 new rules over the memorial day weekend the administration quietly published the spring 2015 unified agenda of federal regulations what it contained was so disheartening to the american people and so destructive to small business that it didnt go unnoticed the agenda showed that the federal departments and agencies have 3 260 rules in the midst right now of the rulemaking process unfortunately it is not just the sheer number of regulations that is astounding it is also the oppressive cost one of these 3 260 rules i mentioned is predicted to be one of the costliest regulations ever put forward the epas national ozone standard a recent analysis found the cost of this one regulation to be upwards of 140 billion it will cost my home state of georgia over 11 000 jobs to add insult to injury the first line of h r 427 statement of administration policy states the administration is committed to ensuring that regulations are smart and effective and tailored to further the statutory goals in the most costeffective and efficient manner this is the statement from the administration on why they oppose h r i cannot believe that a single regulation promulgated by this administration with 140 billion of cost was put forward in the most costeffective manner and a regulation costing 11 000 jobs in georgia alone is hardly smart the statement of administration policy also claims that the underlying legislation would create business uncertainty i encourage this administration to use the infamous pen and phone to actually ask businesses what creates uncertainty for them because when small businesses across the country came to congress last week as part of national federation of independent business lobbying day their top legislative priority was regulatory relief these are smallbusiness owners who sat with us and said here is what we are facing in trying to get people jobs the 3 000plus regulations in the works by this administration create the uncertainty not this bodys effort to require agencies to submit the most costly regulations to congress for approval the underlying bill applies only to regulations with a 100 million impact or greater the american people do not elect this administrations regulatorsor any administrations regulators for that matter they elect us in this body to represent them this bill allows us to do so properly the system is broken the system has failed the american people the reins act is the first step toward restoring proper order and even sanity toward our regulatory framework the administration states that executive order no 13563 requires careful costbenefit analysis but they dont explain why only 7 rules out of the thousands had costbenefit analysis in 2013 and only 14 rules had that in 2012 this administrations regulators have stated publicly that they are not going to sit around and wait for congressso much for respecting the powers enshrined in our constitution and thus the reason that we need this legislation and why this rule should be approved i reserve the balance of my

these matters that come before the house and the house members that are in attendance observing in their office and all the staff people around it is important that we carry these messages out i come to the floor tonight to raise a topic that is important to all americans especially the americans who take our constitution seriously and even more importantly those americans who have taken an oath to support and defend the constitution and that would include all of our servicemen and women along with many law enforcement officers and officers of the article iii courts the entire house of representatives the entire united states senate and to my knowledge the entire body of legislators across the country and the state legislators i have many timesa number of timestaken an oath to support and defend our united states constitution but in the state senate also the constitution of the state of iowa our founding fathers structured our constitution so that we would have three branches of government and some say three equal branches of government i do not completely agree with that assessment instead i contend that the three branches of government were separate and they are separate but the judicial branch of government was designed to be the weakest of the three our founding fathers understood that there would be competition between the branches of government so as part of this discussion i would like to announce into the record here that our chairman of the judiciary committee chairman goodlatte has initiated a task forcea task forcethat is designed to address the article i overreach of the president of the united states and the executive branchnot only this president but previous administrations as well i appreciate and compliment chairman goodlatte for his insight and foresight for taking this initiative i thank him for suggesting and then ratifying today that i will be chairing the task force on executive overreach it will be comprised of members of the judiciary committee republicans and democrats it will be bipartisan i had hoped that it would be nonpartisan judging from some of the tone in the debate today there could be a little flavor of partisanship in there that is fine because that is how we bring about our disagreements in any case a task force has been set up and it will function for 6 months some time in august its authorization will either expire or it will be reauthorized and extended for another period of time the theme is again restoring the article i authority of our congress and to address the executive overreach the circumstances that bring us to this point are myriad the objectives of the task force as i would design them and the object of a chair of a committee is to bring out the will of the group i would point out that the object the plan and the strategy is this first it is my intention to intake all of the input that we get from democrats and republicans from the bipartisan side in the committee and to build a rather expansive list of the executive overreach that we have seen from the article ii branch of government i say it that way so that we bring everything into our consideration then once that expansive list is made then we will pare it down to those things that can be sustained as the authority of this congress versus the authority of the executive branch of government i would point out that the executive overreach isnt only about the unconstitutional overreaches that have taken place especially recently within this administration but it is also about the constitutional overreach when a president will act under authority that maybe has been granted to the executive branch of government by the legislative branch of government or an authority that has been expanded off of an authority that was granted by the united states congress a big piece of this will be the rules and the regulations that are the authority that we have granted to the executive branch of government over the administrative procedures act we know that when the executive branch publishes rules we have been getting more and more rules that are published once they are published for the prescribed amount of time and the comment periods for the prescribed amount of time are allowed and the american public is allowed to weigh in at a certain point they have complied with the requirements of the administrative procedures act and then the rules go into effect often the rules that are written by the executive branch of government are without the purview of congress but they have the full force and effect of law that is troubling to me our founding fathers envisioned this they gave us the republican form of government and a constitutional republic this constitutional republic is designed to be a limited government they didnt envision that the federal government would grow to the expansive lengths that it has they thought that they would be able to keep it in a narrow limited form and that the states would be dealing with the more detailed issues that the federal government was not the benefit of we have the enumerated powers they intended for us to stay within the enumerated powers the definitions that have come forward here by congress they reached out and stretched the limits of the enumerated powers they didnt imagine that there would be speed limits on the dirt trails that had horses and buggies on them and they didnt imagine that the federal government would be subsidizing roads in a way that would allow the federal government to set speed limits across this country that is an example of events that have given the federal governmentthis congresssome authority tied to the dollars that our founding fathers didnt envision and it is one that i think simply we can understand there is a proper role for the federal government there is a proper role in requiring conditions that go along with federal dollars i illustrate that point though to illustrate how far we have diverged from the intent of our founding fathers as our founding fathers framed the constitution and established that all laws would be passed here in the united states congress and not by the executive branch of government and not by the judicial branch of government that separation of powers was envisioned to be this congress has the legislative authority it is article i it is article i for a reason because the voice and the power of the people is vested in this congress our founding fathers envisioned that the policy would come forth here from the various populations of the thirteen original colonies and the states that later joined today if we applied the vision of the founding fathers we would look at 50 states and the territories and we would imagine that there areand this is simply close to a fact320 million people across those 50 states and the territories out of those 320 million people would be generated ideas there would be grievances that would be brought forward and brought to the representatives of congress and there would be ideas generated to solve the various problems that we have in our country there might be a consensus that might be formed what the tax rates should be what the debt burden should be allowed to be what the size of government should be allowed to be and what kind of policies might come out of this congress our founding fathers envisioned that they envisioned then that the voice of the people would be transferred and translated up through and out of the population into the mind and the heart any activity of their elected representative they envisioned also that out of the corners of the country the thirteen original coloniesand now from as far away as guam to washington d c the corners of the united states alaska to hawaii to florida to maine and down to california certainlythat all of the ideas within that would have to compete with other ideas and that their elected representatives in this republican form of government that is guaranteed in our constitution would bring the best of those ideas not all of them not the clutter of bad ideas but sort the clutter of the ideas so that just the cream of the crop the best ideas would come from the corners of the united states and be brought here into this congress that an individual member of congress one of the 435 would bring those ideas into the competition of the ideas of the marketplace here the ideas of the marketplace here would have to compete against each other of the now 435 members there would be various ideas that would compete with other ideas the best ideas that could develop the consensus out of the voice of the people would be sorted here in this congress and we would advance those ideas that reflected the will of we the people that is the vision of this republican form of government that is the vision that required that the congress be established by article i the vision for article ii was that the executive branch would be headed by a president of the united states who is the commander in chief of our armed forces we wouldnt have any armed forces if it werent for congress having the enumerated power to establish a militaryan army a navy and subsequent to that an air force so the founding fathers envisioned the executive branch and the president of the united statesthe president specifically the commander in chief of our armed forcesand that his oath is to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united statesthat is the oath so help him god today as is in his oath although it wasnt in the original oathand that he take care that the laws be faithfully executed that is the take care clause some of us say somewhat facetiously that the president of the united states took that wrong and decided to execute the constitution instead of taking care that the laws be faithfully executed that is something that we will debate and discuss in the task force that addresses the executive overreach our founding fathers also established article iii which is the courts i will speak to that briefly in this segment because most of the focus of this task force is on the executive overreach we do need to look into the judicial overreach as well i believe that there is an effort to give that a review as well but the constitution requires that there be a supreme court that they establish a supreme court and then the various other courts are at the discretion of congress i have made this argument to justice scalia in somewhat a semiformal settingi might say an informal settinga few years ago i would argue that under the constitution if you read article iii the only court that is required by the constitution is the supreme court it is required that it be led and headed by a chief justice as you look at the language in the constitution i argued that the supreme court is not required to bewell first of all there are no other federal courts that are required the authority to establish them is granted in article iii to congress congress could develop all the federal courts that they choose to or they could decide to essentially abolish any of the federal districts in theory at least they could abolish all the federal districts the only federal court that is required under the constitution is the supreme court under constitutional authority congress could eliminate and reduce the federal court system all the way down to the supreme court there is no requirement that there be nine justices or seven or five or three there is a requirement that there be a chief justice in the end if congress wanted to control the judicial branch they could reduce their judicial branch down to the chief justice and he is not required to have a supreme court building or a budget they could reduce the chief justice down to himself or herself as the case may be with his own card table with his own candle and no staff that is how narrow and small the judicial branch of government could be if congress decided to utilize its constitutional authority of course we dont do that but there is a history of two judicial federal districts being abolished by this congress back in about 1802 it was debated in the house and the senate and successfully eliminated a couple of federal districtsi dont suggest that we do that at all for those who would get on their twitter accountillustrating the function of the constitution itself but the judicial branch of government has now defined it down to that it explains that the third branch article iii the third branch of government was not designed to be a coequal branch of government it was designed to be the weakest of the three branches of government then marbury v madison came along that established judicial review and off we are to the races and the growth of the judicial branch of government that can be shrunk or it can be allowed to grow and its influence can be allowed to grow or it could be shrunk but i would make the point that it isnt only the supreme court that weighs in on what the constitution says it is each one of us here in this chamber and each senator down at the other end of the united states capitol building we all have our obligation to interpret the constitution because we all take an oath to uphold it we are not taking an oath to uphold it the way the supreme court would amend it in fact the nine justices of the supreme courtor five as the case may beare the last people on the planet who should be amending the constitution of the united states whether it is a literal amendment or whether it is a de facto amendment is what has taken place with regard to the obergefell case for example the judicial branch of government article iii is designed to be the weakest of the three branches of government if it stayed that way or if it becomes that again we still have the conflict the struggle for power that is going on between article i the congress article ii the president and the executive branch article iii the courts and that static balance that is there between the three branches of government there is a little tugofwar going on for the balance between each of those branches of government our founding fathers envisioned that it would be impossible to precisely define the differences the power structure among the three branches of government they did i think a really good job given the limits of language and imagination and also the limits of not having a complete crystal ball on what would happen here in this country but they understood that even though they defined it as precisely as i think was humanly possible in that period of time or even now today they understood that each branch of government would jealously protect the authority granted to it within its particular article within the constitution for a long time that is what happened even now we have debates about what authority the congress has versus what authority the president has that is the heart of the executive overreach task force that was established today in the judiciary committee i would say the brainchild of chairman goodlatte i dont believe that the congress has done a very good job of defending and jealously protecting its constitutional authority it started a long time agosomeone today said 100 years agoas congress began delegating authority to the executive branch of government it was accelerated with the passage of the administrative procedures act which sets out the parameters for the executive branch of government to write the rules and regulations that have the full force and effect of law that came about i think because this congress was overwhelmed with all of the functions of a growing federal government the various committees and the various task forces that are established here in this congress grew and emerged out of the duties that this congress recognized but at a certain point congress was bogged down with the details of governing willingly to take some of that workload off of their back they delegated it to the executive branch of government in doing so they had to delegate authority to the executive branch of government too not only was it the workload in my opinion but it also was sometimes the political heat that is required to do the right thing i have seen this in the state legislature and i have seen this in congress multiple times issues come up you cant reach agreement one side or the other is scoring political points sometimes it is both sides scoring political points and the heat of that gets so great sometimes it brings about a decision here but also the heat of that might cause the legislative branch of government to pass that responsibility over to the executive branch take the heat off and let them make the decision the result of executive decisions taking authority might belet me pick an examplethe waters of the united states rule where this executive branch during the terms of this president president obama decided that they wanted to regulate a lot more of the real estate in the united states of america i looked back at a time in about 1992 when i saw another effort to do the same thing as there was a designation in my state that was driven by the epa to designate 115 streams in iowa as protected streams looking at that list of protected streams i began wondering why would they call some drainage ditches protected streams i read down through the rule in there it said in order to preserve the natural riparian beauty these streams according to their geographically defined boundaries in the rulewhich i never actually saw the geographically defined boundaries they just said they were there i dont know that they were but according to their geographically defined boundaries these streams shall be protected streams and these streams and waters hydrologically connected to them i will put that in quotes and waters hydrologically connected to them e 1845 when i read the language and i saw that that was the rule that was published i began to go and deliver the public comment i asked the representatives of the rule writers what does hydrologically connected to mean their answer was we dont know and i said then take it out of the rule no we cant do you mean you are representing something and you do not know what it means but you just know you cant take it out thats right we cant take it out this is the published rule and now we have to get this rule passed in any case that brought about a battle within the state of iowa eventually they got the rule in that said these streams and waters hydrologically connected to them will be regulated by the regulators and that they will decide what practices the rightful property owner can implement on that real estate that they have now defined to be within the regulation of the government the phrase waters hydrologically connected to thereby became the target of years and years of litigationof perhaps nearly 20 years of litigation or of maybe even more than 20 years of litigation i guess we would be at 25 or so years of litigation finally the courts concluded that the phrase hydrologically connected to was too vague to be able to enforce it and the collectionthe menagerieof the article iii courts ruling on an initiative that was brought forward by the executive branch of government that was not the intention of the legislative branch of government tied all three branches of government together in confusion that eroded the property rights of people who were guaranteed those property rights under the fifth amendment all of that was being litigated through that period of time when we saw the kelo decision when the court decided they could amend the constitution and the minority opinion was written by justice sandra day oconnor i stood on this floor and almost unknowingly quoted her minority opinion because we had come to the same conclusion independently that the court had taken three words out of the fifth amendment and those three words were for public use so now effectively the fifth amendment reads nor shall private property be taken without just compensation we know a little about that debate taking place in the presidential race because we have a candidate who believes that that is the right thingto take peoples private property for private use if you can convince the government that would be confiscating it that it is of better use if it pays more taxes i disagree with that and i believe that the kelo decision will be reversed one day when we appoint constitutionalists to the judicial branch of government i believe also in the result of that over a period of time if we get the right president who will make the right appointments to the supreme court what i have illustrated here is how the three branches of government can get involved in a convoluted conflict and in that convoluted conflict the tension between the three branches of government was designed to get sorted out so that we would be back to the constitution itself and that the constitution would rule but when the supreme court effectively strikes three words out of the fifth amendment to our constitution then we have the courts ruling without the will of the people and the will of the people is going to be reflected through especially and first the house of representativesthe quick reaction strike force there is a reason we all take the oath to uphold the constitution it is so we understand it and we define it we take our oath seriously and we defend it in the other two parts of that when you had an executive branch that initiated a policyprotected streamsthat wasnt the initiative of the legislature then you have a superlegislature outside the purview of the legislative body my detractors will turn around and say but any rule that is passed can be nullified by the united states congress so why do you worry about that why dont you just do your job in congress and nullify the rules if you dont like them it works a little bit differently than that of course especially when you have a president of the united states who will veto that legislation that would be nullifying the rule so we are back into the circle again if the president initiates a rule without regard to whether there is a court ruling on that rule the legislature then would be obligated to nullify the rule the difficulty of that is it takes a supermajority here then to undo something that appointedbut not electedexecutive branch officials have initiated often without the knowledge of the president of the united states himself that is an upsidedown way to get things done it is supposed to be and is designed to be the will of the peoplethe voice of the peopleof the united states they initiate the policy they send that policy up through congress congress is to bring it before our committees it evaluates the various ideas competes and debates those ideas it votes them through the various subcommittees and committees after having hearings so that the public can see what is going onall out in the open all out in the sunlight we bring it here to the floor of the congress and vote on it and if the senate agrees it becomes law there was not designed to be a superlegislature within the executive branch but that is what we have today we have thousands and thousands of pages of regulations that are initiated by a robust executive branch of government i expect that in the duration of this administration as we have heard from the president of the united states he intends to make his days count as we count down to the end of his presidency i take him at his word he has had a robust approach to stretching the limits of the executive branch of government throughout all of his time in office now he is sitting in a place where he has the appropriations he needs for the functioning of the federal government all the way up until september 30 by september 30 this congress is going to be in a place where they are seeing the last weeks of a presidential campaign play themselves out in october and then in early november so we are probably right at 5 weeks lets see five weeks from the end of the fiscal year will be the vote for the presidency and absentee balloting will be taking place at the same time the president of the united states has all of the levers that he needs he has got all of the tools that he needs and he has got the funding that he needs he also has the robust idea that the executive branch of government should be stronger not weaker and that it should do more not less if we wonder about that we can look around at some of the presidents actions and those of the executive branch of government that i take great issue with many of them are tied up in the development in the implementation of obamacare obamacare itself was legislation that was passed by hook by crook by legislative shenanigan march 22 2010 was the final passage and it was a sad day for america because the will of the people was not reflected in this congress that day it was a dramatic time to be here those who will argue will say oh the house passed this legislation and the senate passed this legislation and it actually was a function of the legislative body i repeat againhook crook legislative shenanigan it is not only i who says that there have been democrats who have voiced the same thing but there are far fewer of them these days as a result of forcefeeding obamacare to the united states congress as the president began implementing obamacare he began changing the law he made some changes along the way for example the employer mandate was delayed the individual mandate was delayed some of it was litigated over to the supreme court some of these changes were not he decided which components of the law he wanted to ignore and which ones he wanted to enforce he took an oath though to take care that the laws be faithfully executed that is all of them that is not part of them yet as we went through obamacare time after time after time there were changes made along the way in the implementation and enforcement of obamacare and that brought about a great deal of confusion in this country and it upset a lot of people it disadvantaged a lot of people and it advantaged some people he granted waiver after waiver for his favorite groups and entities that were i will say people who were typically considered to be his supporters i didnt see much relief for the people who were typically not considered to be his supporters such as the little sisters of the poor for example they are in the business of having to litigate their religious freedom versus an imposition of the federal governments that under all of their health insurance policies they are now commanded to fund contraceptives which violates their religious freedom by the way it violates my religious convictions as well so we have a very robust president who has laid out a whole series of demands not only through obamacare legislation but also we have seen this happen with immigration the president has said publicly 22 times i dont have the constitutional authority to do what you want me to do when he has been talking to illegal immigrants who are in america and are pressing this government to change the policy to accommodate them in the form of amnesty which i have described on this floor many times the president said 22 times i dont have the constitutional authority to do this after he was well vented in his position of explaining the constitution right out here at a high school in washington d c the president answered a question from one of the students at the high school he said i used to teach the constitution which he did for 10 years as an adjunct professor at the university of chicago he taught constitutional law he said that the job of congress is to write the laws that the job of the president and of the executive branch is to enforce the laws and that the job of the judicial branch of government is to interpret the laws i would bring this back to chief justice roberts who said clearly in his confirmation hearing some years ago that his job as a justice is to call the balls and strikes i agreed with that and it was very encouraging to hear that and i certainly supported his confirmation yet i see that on june 24 of last yearthat would be a thursdayin the opinion on obamacare that was written by chief justice roberts in a narrow majority opinion where chief justice roberts joined with four other justices they decided they could write words into obamacare itself or federal government would be the three words maybe the three words they took out of the fifth amendment for public use they get to put in a bank somewhere and when they need to add some words into law they can just borrow them from that little word bank if they strike them out of the constitution maybe the three words would be left in the word bank and the supreme court could then pull three words out by choice and say or federal government now obamacare reads an exchange established by the state insert or federal government now that is what happened as to that decision on obamacare on june 24 thursday the following day the supreme court announced that they had created a new command in the constitution it is not just a new right remember i said the justices of the supreme court should be the last people on the planet to amend the constitution or to discover any new language in it they are to call the balls and strikes that is what i agree with and that is part of my oath to defend the constitution in that fashion the supreme court instead inserted those words into obamacare or federal government the following day they created a command that says not just that there is a new right to samesex marriage but that there is a command that if the states are to conduct or to honor civil marriage they shall conduct and honor also samesex marriages without regard to the convictions of their people who no longer enjoy the 10th amendment authority to establish that policy on marriage within the states the federal government took that onto themselves and they issued not just a right to samesex marriage but a command that everyone especially the states and the political subdivisions thereof shall honor samesex marriage that is a breathtaking overreach of the supreme court it would be worse than the worst nightmare that any of our founding fathers ever would have had with regard to the limitations of this government so we are sitting here today with a federal government that has been distorted beyond what would be the belief of our founding fathers and they had their share of fears this congress needs to reassert itself it needs to reestablish its constitutional authority it needs to take a good hard look at the article i authority that is vested to it in the constitution itself and recognize that all legislative powers exist here in the house and in the senate the overreach of the executive branch takes place sometimes because congress wanted to take the heat off of us and we gave that responsibility over to the executive branch of government sometimes the president decides he wants to do things outside the bounds of his constitutional authority sometimes it is a mix of the two and sometimes it is the president who enjoys the majority support of his party in the house and or in the senate it is more likely that in this congress that the members of his party will accept an overreach of a president of their own party than they will an overreach of a president of the opposite party it is also true that we have different views on what is executive overreach and what the constitution says in fact in some of the debate today i said that the constitution has to mean what it says the very literal words that are in the constitution have to mean what they say and they have to mean to all of us what they were understood to mean at the time of ratification of the base document of the constitution and also of the various amendments as we move along through the amendments in the constitution we need to have enough history to understand what those amendments and what the constitution meant to the people that ratified it and then we need to recognize that the constitution itself is an intergenerational guarantee an intergenerational document signed off on by our founding fathers with their hand and agreed to in an oath to that constitution by millions of americans over time many of them pledged their lives their fortunes and their sacred honor to preserve support and defend the constitution of the united states it is a document that is fixed into the letter of the words that are there in the constitution and the understanding of those words not living and breathing but an intergenerational contractual guarantee from our founding fathers down to our descendants as far as they shall go to the end of the republic should it ever end i pray it does never end as long as this earth exists so the multiple generational great great great many times greatgrandfathers all the way to the founding fathers said here is a contract and i am going to pass this contract on to the next generation the next generation has to preserve protect and defend it and then pass it to the next generation and the next generation and the next generation as ronald reagan said freedom is not something that you inherited it is something that has to be preserved and fought for each generation and defended each generation so if we lose the understanding of what the constitution means we also have lost our constitution itself this task that we have is to preserve this language all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a congress of the united states it is simple pure beautiful worth preserving protecting fighting for bleeding for and if need be dying for that is why our honorable and noble military men and women take an oath to support this constitution because it is worth defending they are not defending the president of the united states specifically they are defending this constitution when they go into battle we need to defend it here in the house of representatives we have a task force now to address the executive overreach and will be defining the unconstitutional overreach i am willing to accept the presidents definition on the constitutional limitations with regard to immigration when the president said he doesnt have the authority to establish and pass amnesty legislation i agree with him it is an enumerated power here in this constitution that is preserved for the congress to establish a uniform naturalization and that has been defined by the courts to mean the immigration policies of the united states if we get this right we will have a congress that is empowered more but also an empowered congress that is more accountable to we the people as congress steps up and says lets claw that executive overreach power back into the house of representatives and back into the united states senate what we are really saying is lets claw that executive overreach power and authority back here and hand it back to we the people now lets go back and turn our ear to we the people so that this republican form of government that is guaranteed to us in this constitution can gather the best ideas from all across this land and bring those ideas here to washington d c where the ideas compete with each other the best ideas float to the top like the cream rises to the top and the public can look in and they can weigh in additionally we need more oversight into the executive branch of government i have drafted and introduced legislation that addresses some of this in a way i will put out here to perhaps be a little provocative to start some ideas then the competition of ideas the best ones as i said need to float to the top that would be legislation that does this it requires of this mountain and myriad of regulations that we have that go on in perpetuity that cant be practically reduced or shrunk down or nullified by this congressas long as the president is willing to veto a nullification bill and push it back at us the legislation that i am proposing that sunsets all of the regulations over a period of 10 years sunsets any new regulation at the end of 10 years and it requires congress to have an affirmative vote before any regulation can have a force and effect of law we have passed out of the floor of the house here once perhaps more than that what we call the reins act this comes from a retired member of congress a friend a former ranger jeff davis of kentucky who initiated the legislation that there would be a requirement of an affirmative vote of congress before a regulation that had more than 100 million of impact on our economy could take effect that addresses this it addresses this going forward with new regulation it doesnt go backward to other regulations all of the old regulations are essentially de facto grandfathered by the reins act the legislation that i had put together before he introduced the reins act was more detailed this legislation is called the sunset act it sunsets all regulations but it sunsets them in increments of 10 percent of the regulations from each department each year for 10 years the departments have to offer up their regulations they can sort which ones they want to expose to congress for a vote over a period of 10 years but over 10 years they have to offer up their regulations here to congress congress then evaluates those regulations any member of congress can come in and offer an amendment to those regulations maybe an amendment to strike maybe an amendment to add maybe there are people in this congress that want more regulations not less and they would like to write them into law and affirmatively vote them in well that idea of sunsetting all regulations10 percent a year for 10 years incrementallyis coupled with the idea of sunsetting any new regulation also at the end of 10 years and requiring an affirmative vote on any regulation before all new regulations of any kind doing so then restrains the executive branch of government and makes the legislative branch of government responsible to the people our regulators that are writing these rules will know that if they write a rule that is egregious to the people the people that have not been heard from the executive branch of government when they go into the office of say the epa and they press their case to gina mccarthy for example and her people they dont have a motive to listen because they are insulated from the accountability to the people if they knew that those same individuals that are aggrieved by the proposed regulation can come to visit their member of congress and press their demand on their member of congress they have to know that that member of congress will come forward come down here to the floor of the house of representatives and offer an amendment to strike those regulations or amend those regulations so that it is acceptable to we the people that is a vision to restrain an overgrowth of the executive branch of government i advocate that as one of the things to consider but neither do i think that i have all the good ideas there are 435 members of the house of representatives and 100 members of the senate there are good ideas that come into every one of our offices from the 750 000 or so people that each of us represent with the ideas that come from the public if we sort them in the fashion envisioned by our founding fathers if we limit the overgrowth of the executive branch of government we take the responsibility back to us it will press on us the kind of changes that are good for the people in this republic that are good for the responsibilities of the members of the house and of the senate we can take america and we can take america onwards and upwards to the next level of our ascending destiny i appreciate your indulgence and your attention i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0030437372624874115, 0.0030437372624874115, 0, "i thank the speaker for the recognition and the opportunity to address the house on this the final hour of the final day of the final week of the final month of this year in congress it has been a remarkable year the congressthe house especiallyhas seen some remarkable changes i would like to share with you a little perspective on where we find ourselves now from a budgetary standpoint for the last year i have had the privilege of chairing the budget committee in the house of representatives that is the committee that deals with all of the spending that occurs in our nation from the federal government standpoint i would like to start by saying what is it defining the goal that we have at the budget committee and in the republican conference here in the house of representatives that goal is broadly to create the greatest amount of opportunity and the greatest amount of success for the greatest number of people so that the greatest number of american dreams can be realized in a fair and a compassionate system that is kind of the 60 000foot view that we have here in the house of representatives at the budget committee among republicans who have allowed me the privilege of chairing the budget committee so from that point of view in terms of the perspective of where we find ourselves and what our goal is what does that have to do with the budget what does that have to do with the numbers that get crunched in this town all the time and that we just finished a remarkable week talking about how to get the progrowth policies that are so necessary to get our economy growing and how do we move forward from a spending standpoint folks all across the country have differing views about how that ought to be done but i think it is helpful to kind of step back and to look at the overall picture the big picture from a spending standpoint the nation understands and appreciates that washington spends a lot 3 8 trillion is the amount of money that your federal government will spend in this fiscal year that is 3 8 with too many zeros after it it is hard to get your arms around the amount of money that that is but it is important for all americans to appreciate kind of how that breaks down the point i want to begin with is this point about mandatory spending and discretionary spending folks tend to think mostly if they dont know how washington works that this 3 8 trillion is the money that congress deals with every single year right it is the spending that goes out the door here in washington every single year and that continues to grow and grow and grow we will go over some of those numbers the fact of the matter is that this spending is broken down into two major categories one is called mandatory i prefer the word automatic because it really isnt mandatory that is the spending that has occurred and continues to occur because congress along with the president at some point in the past has defined a certain amount of spending or certain programs that need to be continued year after year after year regardless of what congress does or until and unless congress changes those programs these are programs like social security medicare and medicaid there are a lot of other mandatory programs these are important programs there is no doubt about it the money that goes to those programs goes to them based upon an individual in this country qualifying for those programs based upon either their income or their age or some other circumstance the amount of money to be spent on those programs doesnt change at all unless the house the senate and the president agree to change it that is the mandatory side or the automatic side i prefer again to call it automatic because it is automatic spending that occurs it is only mandatory in that congress in the past decided that that is what ought to be done it doesnt bind us to it but we have to come to some agreement as a congress and president the legislative and the executive branch in order to change that when you look at this chart here what we see is that the mandatory programsor the mandatory spending automatic spending is in red all other spending which is the discretionary spending is in blue this is 1965 2014 and 2040 the three different pie charts we see that in 1965 50 years ago the amount of mandatory spendingthat is the automatic spending that occurs year after year after year unless congress and the president agree to change somethingthe amount of mandatory spending as a percent of spending was about a third about a third of all spending for the federal government 50 years ago was mandatory spending so twothirds was discretionary now what is discretionary spending if you think about all of the spending that occurs in washington everything that occurs in washington that people like and want and desire some people want to change some of it and some people want to raise some things and lower other things but if you think about everything that washington does with the exception of medicare medicaid social security and some other more minor mandatory programsthose are the ones on the automatic sideif you think about what washington does all of the rest of that is the blue that is the discretionary spending what is that you can just march through the agencies of the federal government and define what those are it is transportation it is commerce it is justice it is the court system it is roads it is highways it is infrastructure it is education it is energy it is all of the things it is defense it is a remarkable amount and needed amount that we spend in the defense arena all of those thingsall of those thingsare the discretionary money 1115 that is the blue on this graph remember that in 196550 years agothat was twothirds of the federal budget now fast forward to 2014 they are essentially the same numbers as today although the blue has decreased a little more the mandatory side the automatic side is now twothirdsnot onethird but twothirdsof the spending that comes out of the federal government which means those programs have continued to grow again those are important programsmedicare medicaid and social securityand we will address the challenges that they have in a moment the spending there has grown to twothirds of federal spending which means that the blue portion the discretionary portionthat portion that people think about when they think about what the federal government spends money on which is again defense and infrastructure and education and energy and all of the things that the federal government doeshas been squeezed if you will to onethird of overall spending at the federal level what does that mean that is the genesis is this important to anybody out there across this great land it is the genesis for the battles that we have had on the level of spending for defenseyesor for highways or for infrastructure or for education or for anything that we debate and discuss so as to try our best to represent the american people in a positive way about what kind of money and the number of resourceshardworking taxpayer moneyought to go for those programs that money is getting decreased the federal governments challenge is to be able to figure out how to turn this around because in a few short years the mandatory side will be threequarters of the spending out of washington which means that that discretionary partthat part that people count on to try to grow the economy and make it so that again the greatest number of american dreams can be realized by the greatest number of folks in a fair and a compassionate systemwill get further and further and further diminished so there is the challenge that we have and the difficulty is getting folks to address the mandatory side now someone might say well those programs are important and they are medicare medicaid and social securitythose programsare important so why not just leave them as they are people are doing just fine they think things are rolling along relatively well why not just leave them where they are here is the dirty little secret about those programs they are all going broke medicare medicaid and social securityall of themare running out of resources over a period of time what does that mean that means that the promises that the federal government has madeto seniors regarding health care to individuals who take utilization of the medicaid system to seniors who have access to social security resources to try to make it so that their retirement years are more securewill not be there all of those benefits to those individuals that the nation has promised to them will not be there they will not be there at the level that has been promised you get some folks who say well the length of time that it will take for us to have any real challenge in that arena is just too long you dont have to worry about it we have got more than enough time to take care of it the fact of the matter is it is right around the corner from social securitys standpoint the disability program was destined to become insolvent next year what did we do recently we plugged the hole we didnt solve the problem we plugged the hole but that doesnt make it so that it is any less likely that it will be a greater problem as the years go on medicare as a physician i can tell you that the medicare system is incredibly important to seniors across this great land the medicare system will run out of resources in 2030 to cover the services that have been promised that is 14 15 short years away when you think that 15 years is too far in the future just think about the challenge that we had during y2k when the millennium turned over that was just 15 years ago most folks remember that most folks remember the challenge that we had during that period of time the fact of the matter is that 15 years is not a long time so medicares going broke in 15 years is something that we ought not ignore social security when does social security go broke in 2034 which is 4 years after thata very short period of time again what does it mean if social security goes broke it means that the benefits that have been assured and promised by your federal government are not going to be able to be provided to seniors we think that is wrong we think that is reckless and immoral to not do anything to fix that we think it is important to save and strengthen and secure medicare medicaid and social security you ask what does that have to do with the budget that gets us to what the budget committee did this past year and i cant tell you how proud i am of the work that was done on behalf of the republican majority here in this house of representatives what did we do we put in place adopted a budget that would solve the challenges that we have in a way that gets us to a balanced budget that gets us on a path to paying off the debt that puts us on a path to solving saving strengthening and securing medicare medicaid and social security and that defines what the role of the federal government ought to be for all of the discretionary programs in that blue area where does the spending occur from the federal government level this is a pie chart that defines again the mandatory side and the discretionary side of our spending remember about twothirds of spending at the federal level is the automatic side what are those programs it includes social security in 2014 which is the last full year that we had full numbers there was 845 billion for social security medicare 505 billion for medicare medicaid 301 billion for medicaid other mandatory programswhich are the others that i have talked about which are things like food stamps and the likeare at 448 billion interest on the debt which is this one is about 221 billion lets talk about interest on the debt for a moment this is money that is spent to cover the interest on the debt that we already have the united states has a debt of about 18 2 trillion so the interest that we pay on that annually now is about 221 billion it is destined to increase enormously over the next few years and that has huge consequences again on trying to find the greatest amount of opportunity and the greatest amount of success for the greatest number of folks so that the greatest number of american dreams may be realized how much is it going to increase this is looking at just 10 years the amount of interestand that is if interest rates stay relatively reasonableon the national debt on the federal debt will be 800 billion it will be close to 1 trillion that is going to be spent just on interest that is more than on defense that is more than on medicaid that is more than on medicare that is more than on education that is more than on transportation that is more than on science and space and technology again all of those things that the american people say that they want and desire are going to be crowded because of the mandatory spendingthe automatic spending yesbut the interest on the debt is approaching 1 trillion a year what we are trying to do on the budget committee is to say to our colleagues and to say to the american people that that is an irresponsible use of hardearned taxpayer dollars to have that level of debt it means that 1 trillion a year of that hardearned money by the american people who send it to washington and expect that it is going to be used in a responsible way is going to go toward interest on the debt that doesnt do a thing to send a kid to college to buy a house to pay the rent to start a business any of the kinds of things again that the american people say they want are harmed by that level of spending on interest on the national debt that is why this is so important these numbers mean that the amount of opportunity and the amount of growth in our economy that will be available to make it so that those american dreams can be realized get lessened and that is why it is so imperative that we address the challenges that we have from an economic standpoint some people would say well that really isnt a problem all we need to do is to raise taxesright to take more money from the american people that is how you solve this problem as you know the level of revenuethe amount of moneycoming into the federal government now is at its greatest point ever in real dollars there is more money being sent to washington by the american people and by businesses and folks all across this great land to fund the governmentmore money than everthan in the history of our society that is a phenomenal statement because what that means is that if one believes that one just ought to raise taxes on people and take more hardearned money then what is the limit what is the goal our goal again is to create the greatest amount of opportunity for the greatest number of individuals and to create the greatest amount of success so that the greatest number of american dreams can be realized in a fair and a compassionate system that is our goal we dont believe that that goal is furthered by taking more money from hardearned american taxpayers the challenge is how you solve that how do you make it so that you dont get to a point at which 1 trillion a year is going to cover interest on the federal debt here is a depiction of how that is solved this is what i call the smile chart you can see the smile the fact however is that the smile is the blue line there and not the red line this axis here is the level of debt held as a percent of the gross domestic product on the lower axis on the x axis it goes from 1940 to 2040 then the dark color here is the graph of what level of debt we had as a nation from 1940 which was at the beginning of world war ii until now you see that it goes up and down the largest amount of debt that we had in this area was just after world war ii which was when we covered the expenses for the war it tended to tamp down and it got into the 20 to 30 percent range of the gross domestic product that is kind of the range at which economists tell you is the sweet spot for how you get the economy growing and rolling and expanding and creating jobs and opportunities you see over there just after 2010 the incredible increase that was this president and the federal governments response to the economic challenge that we had what did they do they printed a lot of money and increased the amount of debta huge increase in the amount of debt now the red line is where their projections go it is where the president and his partys projections go with current programs again those are the programs that we have discussed that is where their line goes on debt which expands incredibly we dont get to that point on that line because the economy wont tolerate that it wont accommodate that in a way that makes it so that people are going to be able to even find a job because you cant take that much money out of the economy and expect the economy to work 1130 so what we did was put in place our budget adopt a budget along with the senate that is the blue line and that means that what we would do is figure out how to solve these challenges get us on a path to paying off the debt you have got to have a surplus before you can begin to pay off the debt but we have got to get on that path to paying off the debt so that we arent utilizing the incredibly hardearned taxpayer money simply for the kind of things that dont benefit anybody at all and that is interest on the debt you cannot continue to have this level of spending we are incredibly excited about the opportunities that we have we have got a lot of challenges in terms of having our colleagues come onboard and the american people recognizing that these problems are real and they are real right now we began a program in the committee on the budget called restoring the trust for all generations if you had an interest you could go to our web site at www budget house gov and look up the program that we have restoring the trust for all generations an effort to try to build the critical mass of individuals necessary to say yes we want that greatest amount of opportunity and success for folks so that american dreams can be realized in a fair and compassionate system we recognize that in order for that to occur we simply must address the mandatory the automatic spending issues that are so challenging for us in order to do that we have got to make certain that we save and strengthen and secure medicare medicaid social security and other mandatory programs in a way that makes sense to the american people and put us on a path to being able to solve these challenges i am extremely excited about the opportunities available to us i am frustrated that we havent been able to get to them sooner than now but i want to assure you that your committee on the budget and the individuals on that committee and the individuals in this conference i believe recognize the challenges that we have and are looking forward with great anticipation to 2016 to the leadership from speaker ryan and the admonition that he has provided for us to say look we have got to make certain that we define what the legislation is that solves and saves and strengthens and secures these programs we have got to get ourselves on that path to make it so

of our federal government could get a good grasp of i also would like to thank the ranking member for her remarks and the gentleman from oregon for his remarks we do have a national treasure in our forests the unitedstates forest service manages over 193 million acres of forests and grasslands from maine to alaska the forest service was formed by president teddy roosevelt and his friend gifford pinchot who was the first chief of the forest service these men were true conservationists and naturalists they understood the science of the forest they understood the value of the forest and they understood its contribution to society so they worked to conserve that for future generations roosevelt and pinchot hold a special place in my heart i grew up by the forests that were established by roosevelt and i studied at the yale school of forestry that was founded by pinchot teddy roosevelt once said about our natural resources he said that our nation behaves well if it treats its natural resources as assets which it must turn over to the next generation increased and not impaired in value we are not behaving well as a nation we are decreasing and impairing the value of our forests our forests are not just an asset they are a treasure a treasure that provides beauty makes clean air purifies our water provides wildlife habitat and a variety of recreational activities and opportunities our forests store carbon and provide many of the products that we live in that we learn from and that we use to survive every day this is not a republican failure and it is not a democratic failure it is a congressional and an agency failure that we have the power to correct wildfires continue to sweep across the country they are burning hotter and faster than in years past more than 9 million acres of federal land burned this year alone costs to fight fires and the number of fires burning grows every year as has been mentioned so many times before the forest services biggest expense is firefighting the costs of it have ballooned over the years it is not just the cost of fighting fires as the gentleman from oregon said that is the cost we are destroying a valuable asset 9 million acres of federal land and timber that goes up in smoke these products could be used they have value to them we are not only spending the money to fight the fires we are losing valuable assets every year this year congress had to appropriate an extra 700 million to land management agencies to cover the cost of fire borrowing the forest service is becoming a firefighting agency unable to meet its mission of caring for the land and serving people fire borrowing is not the only problem and i submit that it is actually not even the problem it is the symptom of a problem it is the result of our current management choice that each year is becoming less and less management unfortunately we do not have the luxury of choosing not to manage forests are dynamic living organisms they dont pay attention to what we say here in washington dc or what we write in laws the only thing forests know is to grow and fill their growing space and to absorb the sunlight they fill the growing space and they quit growing then they become weakened they are subject to insect and disease attack they die we get debris on the forest floor lightning strikes and the forest burns if we choose not to manage the forests then nature continues to manage we dont have that luxury of saying that we are just not going to manage the forest our land management policies have changed for the worse simply and mainly because we have not been able to manage red tape and lawsuits are harming our landscapes forests are overgrown and they are unhealthy healthy forests will lead to smaller fires that can be contained a healthy forest puts less carbon in the atmosphere and in fact it sequesters more carbon through new tree growth and reforestation simply by the biological growth curve younger organisms grow faster so they are pulling more carbon out of the atmosphere they are storing it in their trunks in their leaves and in their roots the good news is the house has been behaving well the house produced and passed a good piece of legislation in h r 2647 the resilient federal forests act now this isnt the endall to fix the problems with our forests but it is a great first step h r 2647 simultaneously ends fire borrowing in a fiscally responsible manner but it also gives the forest service the tools it needs to create healthy forests healthy forests are a winning situation everybody wins with a healthy forest wildlife wins and sports and outdoor recreation enthusiasts win we all win with cleaner air and we all win with cleaner water our rural communities win with an economic benefit there is not a downside to having a healthy forest it is good for america to have healthy forests it is time for us to put the policy in place so that we can have healthy forests it is time

something that is good for our environment and good for our citizens what i am talking about is the passage of the resilient federal forests act of 2015 this bill is good for trees when we have healthy trees and when we have a healthy forest then we also have better air quality we have better water quality we have better wildlife habitat we have less fire danger we protect private property and public property and it is a winwinwin situation for our treasured natural resource of our federal forest it is a winning situation for america as we are good stewards and we conserve this valuable resource that we have now what this bill does is it allows us to actively manage our forests we have qualified personnel in our forest service people who are trained as foresters people who have the expertise and the experience to manage these forests in a sustainable way yet our forest managers hands have been tied in previous years they have been working hard with local constituents local stakeholders in these collaborative efforts to come up with forest plans forest management plans so that they can manage the forests in a way that is good for the local economy in a way that is good for the wildlife in the forest in a way that is good for the health of the forest yet these forest management plans have been held up through frivolous lawsuits from outside groups sometimes as far as a thousand miles away that file a suit against these plans they hold them up in court and at the end of the day the forest is not managed properly because of this we have seen an increasing amount of forest fires over the past several decades because of these increased forest fires we are destroying our valuable natural resource not only are we destroying our resource we are destroying our budget for the forest service currently the single greatest cost to the forest service is fire suppression and the next cost is litigation and where the cost should be in the management and health of the forest comes in third what the resilient federal forests act of 2015 would do it would take the focus off of fire suppression and put that focus on fire prevention these are forestry practices that i have seen carried out in my home state of arkansas in my district the fourth district i have approximately 2 5 million acres of federal forest inside my district on the ouachita national forest on the ozark national forest and also in four different unitedstates fish and wildlife service areas fortunately in arkansas we have been able to manage these forests in a way that is good for the forest a lot of this was done in an effort to protect an endangered species the redcockaded woodpecker what our forest service employees have done is they have gone into the forests they have assessed it and they determined what would create the best habitat for this endangered species they found that a habitat with an open understory one which has large nesting trees for the woodpecker is great habitat for the woodpecker they implemented a plan to go in and thin the forestnot clearcut it but thin itand then develop a fire regime to keep the underbrush out you might think that thinning the forest and burning the forest would cause a decrease in biodiversity but our foresters saw something quite the opposite our forests in arkansas were much like the ones across the country many forests out west they had been cut as much as a century ago and allowed just to grow back with the only management being putting the fires out when they start what happens in a situation like this is forests are dynamic they continue to grow until they fill up all the growing space and then they start competing with one another when they compete with one another they get weak they are subject to insect and disease attack you get more fuel that falls on to the forest floor creating a fuel load you get dead and weakened timber and you get a lightning strike and it burns the whole forest down when you manage the forest when you thin it and you use controlled burns you open up the canopy you open up the forest floor and you see a flush of fauna and you see biodiversity increase tremendously at the same time as the biodiversity and plant life increases you get a flush in wildlife on these plots in arkansas not only did we see an increase in numbers in redcockaded woodpecker we saw an increase in the bobwhite quail in wild turkeys in deer in several other songbird species this management scheme is good for the forest it is good for the wildlife it creates cleaner air it creates cleaner water again it is a winwin situation by applying these management practicesand they will be different as you go across the country in different regions as we let the local professionals and the local stakeholders manage the forests the way it was intended to be managed we will create a healthy forest which is good for all the local communities where these forests are located another thing that we have done in this bill is we strengthened the secure rural schools provisions we stipulate that 25 percent of funding has to go into local counties to provide emergency services to fund schools this is critical for these local communities where forest activities around the national forests have greatly decreased over the past several decades we used to cut nearly 12 billion board feet of timber off of the forests now we are down to less than 3 billion board feet per year many of these local economies depended on those forests as we quit cutting timber and the infrastructure to process the timber left these communities suffered all across our country where these natural forests are located this bill will allow funding to go to these communities so that they continue to provide emergency services so they can continue to provide funds for education and help to grow the communities another provision in this bill is it allows the salvaging of timber after a catastrophic event now a clear cut actually mimics a wildfire in the forest so when you have a wildfire that is a standreplacing fire it causes the damage when the fire occurs in forestry terms the land is essentially being clearcut when the fire happens but you will still have dead standing trees these trees need to be salvaged they have value value that can be extracted and used to reforest the land value that not only creates value in reforestation it also cleans up the land so you can reforest it and prevent future fire dangers what has happened in the past is the salvage cuts have been held up in court again and you get standing dead timber that the next time a fire comes through it makes it dangerous for our firefighters to go in and fight the fire what this bill does is it still requires an environmental assessment of the area but it speeds the process in that and it prevents injunctions from allowing these salvage cuts so that this timber can be salvaged and the revenue is used to go back into the forest service to reforest these lands and again provide the management practices to have healthy forests what happens now is we see after a catastrophic event we get only 3 percent of regeneration or reforestation of the land this bill requires that after the catastrophic event we have to have 75 percent reforestation after a period of 5 years the 5year timeframe gives foresters time to come in and assess the efforts that they put forth and to correct any problems that they have had in restoring these forests this bill again is very critical and very much needed it has the support of i believe 117 different organizations from wildlife groups from environmental groups many tribes across the country many county governments people recognize the benefits of this bill and the benefits that can come to our country if we enact this legislation unfortunately the bill is held up in the senate right now and as the fire season increases out west and we see more and more of our natural treasure and our federal forests going up in flames it should become more imperative for the senate to take up this bill and pass it and for the president to sign it into law as i have stated in committee hearings when we were pushing this bill through the forests dont really pay attention to what we legislate here in washington d c they are dynamic living organisms they continue to grow they continue to fill up the growing space they are more reactive to what happens in nature we need to be proactive in managing these forestsmanaging them to be healthy managing them to be more resistant to wildfire and inspects and diseases i call on the senate and the president to take up this legislation to pass it and to move america forward with healthy forests i yield to the gentleman from

this house with what i call a sunset memorial because you see before the sun sets today in america almost 4 000 more defenseless unborn children will be killed by abortion on demand in the land of the free and the home of the brave that is more than the number of innocent lives lost on september 11 in this country by a multitude of thousands and it happens every day it has now been 42 years since the tragedy called roe v wade was first handed down since then the very foundation of this nation has been stained by the blood of almost 56 million of its own unborn children some of them cried and screamed as they died but because it was amniotic fluid going over the vocal cords instead of air we couldnt hear them all of them had at least four things in common first they were just little babies who had never done anything wrong to anyone each one of them died a nameless and lonely death and each one of their mothers whether she realizes it or not will never quite be the same all the gifts that these children might have brought for humanity and to humanity are now lost forever yet even in the glare of such tragedy this generation still clings to this blind invincible ignorance while history repeats itself over and over again and our silent genocide mercilessly annihilates the most helpless of all victimsthose yet unborn we should remember the quotes of president abraham lincoln when he said those who deny freedom to others deserve it not themselves and under a just god cannot long retain it mr lincoln called upon all of us to remember americas founding fathers when he said their enlightened belief was that nothing stamped with the divine image and likeness was sent into the world to be trodden on or degraded and imbruted by its fellows he reminded those he called posterityand that is us mr speaker when in the distant future some man some factions some interests should set up a doctrine that some were not entitled to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that their posterity again that is usmight look up again to the declaration of independence and take courage to renew the battle which their fathers began when authorities entered the clinic of dr kermit gosnell they found a torture chamber for little babies that defies description within the constraints of the english language according to the grand jury report dr kermit gosnell had a simple solution for unwanted babies he killed them now he didnt call it that he called it ensuring fetal demise and the way he ensured fetal demise was by sticking scissors in the back of the babys neck and cutting the spinal cord he called it snipping over the years there were hundreds of snippings ashley baldwin one of dr gosnells employees said she saw babies breathing and she described one as 2 feet long that no longer had eyes or a mouth but in her words was making like this screeching noise she said it sounded like a little alien for gods sake is this who we really are kermit gosnell now rightfully sits in prison for killing a mother and murdering innocent paincapable children like the one i just described yet if he had killed them only 5 minutes earlier and before they had passed through the birth canal it would have all been perfectly legal in many of the united states of america including here in the district of columbia if there is one thing we must not miss about this unspeakably evil episode it is that kermit gosnell is not an anomaly he is just the visible face of this lucrative enterprise of murdering paincapable unborn children in america more than 18 000 very lateterm abortions are occurring in america every year placing the mothers at exponentially greater risk and subjecting their paincapable unborn babies to torture and death without anesthesia it is the worst atrocity in america today and this in the land of the free and the home of the brave throughout history there has often been great intensity surrounding the debates of protecting the innocent lives of those who through no fault of their own find themselves obscured in the shadows of humanity it encourages me greatly that in nearly all of those cases the collective conscience was finally moved in favor of the victims the same thing is beginning to happen in this debate related to innocent unborn children especially those that are pain capable we are beginning to ask ourselves the real question does abortion take the life of a child we are especially asking the question recently does very lateterm abortion torture and take the life of a paincapable baby and we are finally beginning to realize as human beings that it does ultrasound technology now demonstrates to all reasonable observers both the humanity of the victim and the inhumanity of what is being done to them and we are beginning to realize as americans that taking brutally the lives of the innocent unborn does not liberate anyone and that 56 million children is enough ironically i have heard barack obama speak such poignant words that whether he knows it or not apply so profoundly to the tragedy of abortion on demand in america let me quote excerpted portions of his comments he said this is our first task caring for our children it is our first job if we dont get that right we dont get anything right that is how as a society we will be judged he went on to say and by that measure can we truly say as a nation that we are meeting our obligations can we honestly say that we are doing enough to keep our childrenall of them safe from harm can we say that we are truly doing enough to give all the children of this country the chance they deserve to live out their lives with happiness and purpose the president went on to say i have been reflecting on this the last few days and if we are honest with ourselves the answer is no we are not doing enough and we will have to change oh how true the presidents words are the president also said we cant tolerate this anymore these tragedies must end and to end them we must change and then the president asked are we really prepared to say that we are powerless in the face of such carnage that the politics are too hard are we prepared to say that such violence visited on our children year after year after year is somehow the price of freedom is this not the most relevant of questions we should all be asking in the midst of this genocidal murder of thousands of unborn babies in america every day the president has said our journey is not complete until all our children are cared for and cherished and always safe from harm finally he said that is our generations taskto make these words these rights these values of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness real for every american never have i so deeply agreed with any words ever spoken by president barack obama as those i have just quoted and yet this president in the most merciless distortion of logic and reason and humanity itself refuses to apply these majestic words to helpless unborn babies oh how i wish somehow that mr obama and all of us could open our hearts and our ears to his words and ask ourselves in the core of our own soul why his words that should apply to all children cannot apply to the most helpless of all children we honor abraham lincoln most because he found the courage as president of the united states in the days of slavery and he found the humanity within himself to recognize the image of god stamped on the soul of slaves that the supreme court said were not human and that the tide of public opinion didnt recognize as protectable under the law could it still be that president barack obama might consider that perspective as well as his own legacy and even eternity itself and recognize that those little unborn children look so desperately to him now for help could it be that the president might finally remember that on the pages of the bible on which he laid his hands were the words written in red inasmuch as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren you have done it unto me whether he does or not it is time for those of us in this chamber to remind ourselves of why we are really all here thomas jefferson said the care of human life and its happiness and not its destruction is the chief and only object of good government the phrase in the 14th amendment capsulizes our entire constitution it says no state shall deprive any person of life liberty or property without the due process of law the 14th amendment tells us that we should have equal protection of the laws for all protecting the lives of all americans and their constitutional rights is why we are all here the bedrock foundation of this republic is that clarion declaration of the selfevident truth that all human beings are created equal and endowed by their creator with unalienable rights the rights of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness every conflict and battle our nation has ever faced can be traced to our commitment to this core selfevident truth it has made us the beacon of hope for the entire world it is truly who we are yet today another day has passed as so many sunset memorials that i have given another day has passed and we in this body have failed again to honor that foundational commitment we have failed our sworn oath and our godgiven responsibility as we broke faith with nearly 4 000 more innocent unborn babies who died today without the protection we should have given them so let me conclude this sunset memorial in the hope that perhaps someone new who heard it will finally embrace the truth that abortion really does kill little babies that it hurts mothers in ways that we can never express and that it is time we stood up together again and looked up to the declaration of independence and that we remember that we are the same america that rejected human slavery and marched into europe to arrest the nazi holocaust and we are still the courageous and compassionate nation that can find a better way for mothers and their unborn children than abortion on demand it is still not too late for us to make a better world and for america to be the one that leads the rest of the planet just as we did in the days of slavery from this tragic genocide of murdering nearly 4 000 of our own children every day so now as we consider the thousands the hundreds of thousands out on the mall marching to protect these little babies as we consider the plight of the unborn for 42 years under roe v wade maybe we can each remind ourselves that our own days in this sunshine of life are all numbered and that we too each one shall walk from these chambers one day for the very last time if it should be that congress is allowed to convene on yet another day may that be the day when we finally hear the cries when we finally hear the cries of innocent unborn children may that be the day when we find the humanity and the constitutional duty to protect these the least of our tiny little american brothers and sisters from this murderous scourge upon our nation called abortion on demand it is now 42 years to the day since roe v wade first stained the foundation of this nation

by 4210 in 2010 of course and thereafter we stopped passing resolutions on the floor of the house although we may still present them and talk about them on the floor of the house so tonight this is what we will do i would like to mention the mission of the naacp which is to ensure the political educational social and economic equality of all personsnot just of black people not just of people of color but of all people the naacp also desires to eliminate racial hatred and racial discrimination these are lofty and noble goals because we understand that we have had much racial hatred and much racial discrimination in this country and the naacp took it upon itself to eliminate as much of it as possible it has done a good job i might add lets look at a little bit of the history of the naacp back on february 12 1909 a group of people decided that it was going to do something about the lynchings that were taking place in this country literally in this country between 1889 and 1918 thousands of african americans were lynchedthousands lynching was done with mob violence people were taken to trees and they were lynched it was done a good many times with impunity no one was ever prosecuted it was a grave injustice and there were people in this country who decided that they were going to do something about this injustice among the people who met initially were mary white ovington oswald garrison villard william english walling and ida wellsbarnett these persons met and issued a clarion call some 60 persons answered that call hence the naacp was born the naacp did not have its first african american as an executive secretary until 1920 it is important for us to note that many of the founders of the naacpin fact most of themwere not of african ancestry the first executive secretaries of the organization were all persons who were of european ancestry in fact the first five executive secretaries were white they were not black in 1934 the naacp had its first black board chairpersonlouis t wright dr wright became chairperson after the naacp had had a good number of white chairpersons so the naacp has never been and is not now an organization for blacks only the naacp has always stood for an integrated society and has been an integrated organization since its inception in 1954 the naacp under the leadership and counsel of the honorable thurgood marshall who became a justice of the supreme court won the lawsuit of brown v board of education this was a giant leap forward for us because this lawsuit integrated to a certain extent schools throughout the country the word that was appropriately used at the time was desegregated these schools were ordered to be desegregated with all deliberate speed and all deliberate speed can sometimes take a lot longer than one might expect a good many years later there are still those who would contend that we have not fully integrated our school systems across the length and breadth of the country in 1955 an naacp member the honorable rosa parks an african american lady decided that she was going to take a stand and she took that stand by taking a seat she took a seat on a bus in so doing she ignited a spark that started a civil rights movement by the way there are many people who contend that she did this because she was tired well she may have been tired but she did it because she wanted to take a stand she was tired of societys relegating her to the back of the bus and she took a stand against it hence we had the montgomery bus boycott which lasted more than a year at the end of that boycott the bus linethe transportation systemwas integrated in alabama and of course later on throughout the country an interesting note on this point about the integration and desegregation of bus lines there was a threejudge panel that actually heard the litigation associated with this transportation issue on that threejudge panel there were judges who had a great debate about this but there was one frank m johnson a federal district court judge who took the position that we could apply the brown decision to public transportation this was the very first time it was done was under the leadership of that threejudge panel and by the honorable frank m johnson again i point these things out because it is important to note that there were others who were there with the naacp to help us along the way frank m johnson by the way was a republican appointee who was appointed by president eisenhower and he went on to help us to integrate schools throughout the south and integrate the department of public safety he went on to help us with the facilitation of voting rights acts and with the implementation of laws that prohibited persons from discriminating against persons in workplace environments he really played a significant role as did many other persons who were associated with the naacp in a vicarious way because i dont have evidence of his having been a member i want to move forward if i may next to 2008 i move forward to 2008 because this is when the naacp supported the passage of the emmett till unsolved civil rights crime act of 2007 there are many unsolved cases in the history of this country with reference to things that happened to african americans the naacp pushed for and supported legislation such that we can have the opportunity to bring some of the dastards to justice who have caused great harm to people who were doing no harm to anyone the naacp has fought for this in 2009 the naacp celebrated its centennial anniversary and the theme at that time was bold dreams and big victories obviously a good theme because the naacp has won many big victories in 2012 the naacp supported the smart and safe campaign which brought attention to the overpopulated prisons and mass incarceration in this country people who study these issues are well aware that in this country we have an overpopulation of persons who are incarcerated much of this has to do with mandatory sentencing laws much of it has to do with laws that allow persons who are convicted of one type of offense with drugs to receive a harsher penaltycocaine for example then if you have crack cocaine you will get a stiffer penalty as opposed to its being some other type of cocaine the point is that these harsh sentencing laws have caused a good many people to be incarcerated who quite frankly should not be incarcerated for as long as they are incarcerated some of these three strikes and you are out laws have also caused persons to go to prison for a minor offense because it happened to be the third offense so the naacp is fighting against this"], [0.985068142414093, 0.985068142414093, 0, "to address that in committee i bring that up specifically because i know mr leader you made the observation and i think you are quoted as saying you believe the two parties can achieve consensus on that legislation but we may not be able to move it forward this year excuse me that speaks to criminal justice system reform not to voting rights i think we can reach consensus on the criminal justice reform i think both parties believe that there are substantial areas that need to be addressed in criminal justice reform senator cornyn has certainly indicated that republicans and democrats in this house have indicated that my question to you is with respect to the issues that i think we have all discussed and that the speaker has discussed such as jobs and economic growth health care poverty and opportunity which we believe is a very important issue criminal justice reform job creation longterm fiscal agreements so that we can replace the sequester with a permanent rather than an every2year resolution comprehensive tax reform which almost all of us have said we are formr camp brought a bill forward on thatcomprehensive immigration reform restoring voting rights which i mentioned taking action to address gun violence which we are in favor of and i think clearly your side has indicated that mental health is very much a component of that and you want to address that and addressing our national security challenges which i agree with the speaker that is a primary responsibility and concern of i think everybody on the floor of this house my question therefore mr leader is do you expect any substantive legislation rather than simply ideas that both parties might express and put out to the public that would be transparent specific and on which we could have debates on alternative policies do you expect in the

agency has made a good faith effort to improve the performance of the hov lane the secretary may require the public authority to take additional actions to improve the hov lane the current hov degradation standard requires hov lanes to maintain an average speed above 45 miles per hour 90 percent of the time during peak hours i repeat during peak hours this arbitrary standard does not take into consideration or account the specific transportation concerns of each state over 60 percent of californias highways are noncompliant by this federal degradation standard which means that california will be forced to spend limited resources on transportation projects that do not meet the needs of the general public california will also have to reduce the amount of energyefficient vehicles that it allows in the hov lane in california we have studied the issue and have found that they do not meet the minimum driving speed standard because of accidents weather events and other unpredictable events the degradation standard is supposed to address manageable recurring congestion but california is noncompliant in the standard based on manageable traffic events this amendment would allow the dot to recognize that there are special circumstances in each state that lead to lane degradation and that they do not always include recurring congestion the amendment would allow the
