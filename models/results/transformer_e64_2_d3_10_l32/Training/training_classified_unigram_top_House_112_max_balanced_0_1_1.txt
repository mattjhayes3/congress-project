health fund and rescinds any unobligated funds republicans are on the floor today to fulfill part of our pledge to america that we would cut spending and we would repeal the democrats health care bill passed a year ago on january 19 this house passed h r 2 to repeal obamacare completely the ruling liberal democrats in the senate however have so far refused to consider h r 2 but house republicans remain undeterred we will repeal obamacare piece by piece if that is what it takes because the liberal elites knew their government takeover of health care was unpopular and would likely have consequences at the ballot box they included 105 billion in mandatory taxpayer spending in the law itself to protect their favorite programs let me take a moment to explain the difference between discretionary and mandatory government spending first its important to remember that the federal government does not have any money of its own as it has only what it takes in taxes from hardworking americans or money that it borrows from foreign creditors and our future generations we are currently borrowing 43 cents of every dollar that the federal government spends discretionary spending is appropriated by congress annually and therefore subject to congressional oversight and review discretionary spending allows congress to be wise stewards of the taxpayers money by not funding ineffective or duplicative programs however what is called mandatory spending funds programs for people who meet certain criteria and occurs irrespective of congressional appropriations and must be spent whether we have the money or not the most recognized mandatory spending programs are medicare medicaid and social security which operate on autopilot and have not been subject to congressional oversight from yeartoyear as funds automatically stream from the treasury to anyone who qualifies that is meets the criteria for a particular benefit the bill before us today h r 1217 would repeal a portion of mandatory obamacare spending and eliminate a slush fund established for health and human services secretary kathleen sebelius this slush fund known as the prevention and public health fund will automatically receive 1 billion when fiscal year 2012 begins in october of this year with automatic increases every year until it reaches 2 billion annually in fiscal year 2015 however theres a very important distinction between this funding and that for medicare and social security in that this funding does not state eligibility criteria the liberal elites in washington think they know how to spend the taxpayers money better than individual taxpayers and gives secretary sebelius 2 billion a year until congress acts to repeal her authority to spend without accountability republicans are rejecting this slush fund by considering this bill which would repeal the fund and take back any money that has not already been spent this year the slush fund is not subject to the annual appropriations process and therefore would not be subject to yearly congressional oversight the money will be made available to the secretary regardless of how she chooses to spend it and whether or not the programs being funded are actually effective again this is not like medicare and social security there are no criteria for the spending of this money its important to point out that this bill does not cut any specific program because the slush fund is used by the secretary to increase spending above congressionally appropriated levels for whatever program the secretary chooses my colleagues across the aisle will argue that this money is being used to train primary care physicians to prevent obesity and to encourage healthy lifestyles what they wont tell you is that they have absolutely no idea how the money is being used because they abdicated the authority of congress to an unelected bureaucrat the simple truth is that the money is just as likely to be spent on elective abortion as it is for any other purpose in the democrats dissenting views from the house energy and commerce committee report they say without mandatory spending for this slush fund the programs will not be adequately funded well thats what the whole process for appropriations is all about if the programs need more money its up to them to come and justify that however they sang a different tune when liberal house democrats rammed through a government takeover of health care in november of 2009 they created this slush fund but made it subject to the regular appropriations process that meant it was subject to yearly congressional oversight and direction for how the money would be spent but when the ruling liberal democrats in the senate sent over their version of the health care bill which became law the slush fund had been made mandatory the liberal elites claim they put in a safeguard because part of the section creating this slush fund states that congress has the authority to direct how this funding is spent well as any high school junior civics student could tell you congress always has the authority to direct redirect repeal or increase funding congress can always pass a new law to change the direction of any funding stream thats our job as legislators the need to state explicitly that we have the authority to direct spending in a slush fund is pointless the simple truth is that we have a spending crisis in this town in large part due to mandatory spending that operates on autopilot instead of working to address our unsustainable spending habits the ruling democrats refused even to offer a budget resolution last year or pass a single appropriations bill the liberal elites failed to lead despite having unchecked control of all levers of power in washington i brought a chart with me today to help illustrate the fact that mandatory spending is out of control in washington let me show you that because of mandatory spending being on autopilot by the year 2050 the mandatory spending will absorb all revenue coming into the federal government all tax revenue coming into the federal government that simply is unsustainable we cannot operate our country when we let three programs take up all of the money that comes into the federal government something has to be done and yet the democrats want to add another program to this which would speed up this process we dont need that as washington liberals ignored the growing autopilot spending crisis adding more unaccountable mandatory spending in the hands of unelected bureaucrats house republicans are now working hard to protect the future for our children and grandchildren by restoring congressional oversight of spending now i am sure many americans are wondering how a slush fund with a clever title would be spent and why it must be put on autopilot let me give you an example pitt county in my home state of north carolina received funding from this fund to fix prices at convenience stores so that healthy foods would be less expensive and therefore supposedly more attractive to the consumer in addition the pitt county health department now plans to use some of this money to put up signs indicating the location of public parks bike lanes and alternate transportation although i am certainly not opposed to parks or healthy eating habits it seems quite clear that the founders of this country did not intend the federal department of health and human services in washington dc to use taxpayer money to subsidize granola bars or purchase signs for bike lanes or parks the federal government has no business paying for local and community initiatives such as these especially when we are borrowing 43 cents of every dollar the federal government spends to pay for it the new house republican majority is ready to lead this country out of our debt crisis and it starts with voting for this rule and the underlying bill which will save taxpayers 16 billion with that

and pipelines out there that people talk about apparently when it comes to jobs maybe the pipeline is apparently a pipe dream we have an opportunity in this country to secure our energy future with north american energy to create american jobs on a project that is a 1 700milelong pipeline you know i hear all the time from constituents in colorado about hey whats the deal with this pipeline why cant we get forward moving creating jobs american energy independence using north americas great resources to help our country create jobs and a more secure energy future and the conversation then really revolves around commonsense ideas heres a president who the president has said in the past that we need to support shovelready projects that the stimulus bill that passed in 2009 was all about shovelready projects and if you go back to last summer i believe the president had said well i guess shovelready wasnt as shovelready as we thought it was well heres a shovelready project here is a pipeline a privately funded pipeline thats ready to be built 1 700 miles 20 000 american jobs we could get started on that today its been years since this pipeline was actually firstthe permit process first started and yet here we are waiting once again this isnt a surprise to anybody it shouldnt shock anybody that the issue of the pipeline came up the bill that we passed in december said youve got to make a decision the president has said he would make a decision and yet we still have no decision i find it difficult to understand what is really the tough part of this decision we can create jobs right now with a truly shovelready project earlier this year back in february actually back in february of last year we had testimony before the energy and commerce committee that talked about the development of the alberta oil sands and what it would mean to jobs in the united states now the keystone pipeline is part of that according to the testimony we received in that committee between 2011 and 2015 6 000 jobs could be created in colorado alone because of the development of the alberta oil sands the fourth congressional district of colorado that i represent has two counties when you look at the true unemployment rates the unemployment rates that take into account people who have just given up workwhove given up looking for work who have just decided that they cant find work so theyve stopped looking two counties in my district have over 19 percent unemployment when you look at it through the lens of people who have stopped looking for work a project like the keystone pipeline 20 000 direct jobs 100 000 jobs indirectly created development of the alberta oil sands creating 6 000 jobs in colorado over the next 3 years next 4 years these are goodpaying american jobs with north american energy that we could be putting to the benefit of this country we know there are willing partners out there we know there are other people who have said go ahead well take the business well partner with you were not afraid china has more than once said that this is something that they would look at canada has made it very clear that they wont just stop if we say no shovelready projects here it is our opportunity to create american jobs three years ago the application was filed to build the pipeline most americans at town meetings that i attend they all know about this pipeline they know where its going they know whats happening with it its been our goal in this 112th congress to look out for the economy to advance projects that make sense when it comes to american energy and north american energy and american job creation that ought to be the goal of every single one of us in this congress every action we take should be looked at through the same lens that we look at the keystone pipelinecreating jobs im continuously awed at the energy resources that we have in north america and how simple it would be to advance policies that would make us more energy independent and yet we still cant move forward because no decision has been made im baffled at how difficult this administration has made it when it comes to weaning ourselves off of overseas oil while at the same time creating more jobs right here at home the administration has done everything it can to stand in the way of a project that can help americans get back to work a 7 billion private sector infrastructure project when construction jobs around colorado around this country have been some of the hardest hit by the recession this project provides a lifeline to thousands of construction workers seeking ways to get back on their feet but the inaction of this administration has led us down a path of insecurity and dependence on other countries that have great animosity towards us its simply unacceptable not only do we have the resources in our own backyard in north america but we have the ability to utilize friendly and willing neighbors like canada to import that oil our unemployment rate as a nation has hovered around 9 percent for far too long theres no reason that the federal government should not be supporting a private sector solution done with private capital at a time like this with rising gas prices the threat of the strait of hormuz being blocked and unemployment hovering so high we simply cannot afford not to act the president has had plenty of time to make a decision the studies have been submitted the conversations have taken place the debate has occurred but whats winning this debate is the fact that the american people understand how many jobs would be created with the north american energy project i yield back my time and thank you for the opportunity tonight"], [0.0010559678776189685, 0.0010559678776189685, 0, "most americans remember 1 year ago tomorrow president obama and vice president biden launched what the white house enthusiastically called the recovery summer this was supposed to be a 6weeklong push to highlight what the obama administration said would be jobs created last summer by a surge in federal stimulus spending across the country senior adviser to the president david axelrod said this summer will be the most active recovery act season yet with thousands of highly visible road bridge water and other infrastructure projects breaking ground across the country giving the american people a firsthand look at the recovery act in their own backyards and making it crystal clear what the cost would have been of doing nothing yet the only thing that is crystal clear to the majority of americans is that there is nothing to show from the democrats failed economic policies that have set our country on a road to ruin since president obama has taken office he has done absolutely nothing to promote american energy production he has done nothing to reduce the regulatory burdens on small business owners he has done nothing to fix the tax code to help job creators he has done nothing to increase competitiveness for american manufacturers and he has done nothing to pay down americas unsustainable debt burden and bring back confidence among investors and entrepreneurs by supporting longterm american economic growth and now president obama is selling the sequel to last years recovery summer sales pitch and kicking off this summer by trying to convince the american people that 28 consecutive months of unemployment above 8 percent is just a bump in the road to recovery in addition a number of democrats are calling for billions more in taxpayer dollars to be spent on yet another wasteful stimulus to create jobs but americans arent buying it unemployment is nowhere near the 6 8 percent level at which the administration claimed it would be today if the stimulus was signed into law when americas promise prosperity and security for future generations are at stake this cannot be brushed off as just a bump in the road it is a mountain of constraint put in place by a litany of failed democrat policies and unfulfilled promises and whats worse is that president obama recently laughed off the fact that his stimulus projects which are costing taxpayers trillions of dollars have failed to live up to their promise to create new jobs democrats promised this would be the summer of recovery but their conflicting assessment of the economy and their doubletalk has left american families wondering is this a joke well most economists and the american people are not laughing their concern is growing and confidence in president obamas economic policies is plunging more and more every day and the idea of another stimulus bill is dead on arrival in the house in the face of the greatest economic crisis since the great depression this administration and the democrats in congress are choosing to play politics with economic recovery and continue with another round of empty rhetoric and unfulfilled promises in their desperate sales pitch again this summer house republicans are serious about creating real american jobs and were making it our mission to put americans back to work we know that what we need are commonsense policies that will create jobs in this country immediately we cannot let this administration have another frivolous shot at the wasteful spending of taxpayers hardearned dollars or be given more regulatory power or allowed to spin its way out of the catastrophic economy the democrats have created with empty phrases like recovery summer house republicans have produced a progrowth projob creation budget as well as a real plan for americas job creators both plans will put the nation on a fiscally sustainable path to restore confidence lower tax rates and allow america to remain competitive in the global economy we want to take the burden of regulation off of our job creators and produce more american energy so that americans can start receiving the paychecks that they need and deserve and we want to reduce the hostility of the federal governments regulators toward american business both small and large we cannot allow this outoftouch administration to continue with their failed experiments and silly punchlines we cannot allow washington democrats to tax and spend away the futures of our children and our grandchildren we cannot continue down the road to ruin coming from the private sector to congress i know that america can and will become prosperous beyond imagination and millions of new private sector jobs will be created if we would just get back to our founding free market principles and end big government and wasteful spending it is time we take a different road this summer we cannot continue on the misguided and irresponsible path endorsed by the other side of the aisle of higher taxes reckless spending bigger government explosive debt crippling regulation higher deficits and unacceptably high unemployment eightyone percent of americans know somebody without a job as a matter of fact if youd look at the unemployment rate that includes underemployed and unemployed almost one out of every five americans is unemployed or underemployed today under president obamas watch almost 40 000 jobs have been lost every 2 weeks president obamas socalled stimulus was signed into law 28 months ago and there are nearly 2 million fewer americans with jobs today they have had their chance to make things right last summer and it has not worked now it is our turn these are undoubtedly tough times and i want to continue the great american legacy of leaving our children better off than we ourselves are it pains me to know that only 17 percent of the mothers in this country believe that their children will be better off in the future it doesnt have to be this way there has not been a more important time in our nations history to realign our principles and policies in light of current economic reality as the son of a hardworking rancher in the texas panhandle i always reflect back to those tough decisions and sacrifices that my family made around the kitchen table we had no choice but to live within our means every day i remember these life lessons whether im balancing my family budget or

for an open rule providing for consideration of h r 2112 a bill which makes appropriations for agriculture rural development food and drug administration and related agencies programs for the fiscal year ending september 30 2012 and for other purposes republicans have offered yet another open rule on this legislation something we did not see when democrats were in the majority for 4 years house republicans are keeping their promise to the american people by submitting a bill that contains no earmarks house republicans are keeping their promise to reduce spending and rein in the federal deficit which threatens our very existence as a free country this bill addresses many of the glaring inefficiencies of washington by reducing wasteful and redundant programs this is a bill that under the control of the liberal democrats kept growing and growing in fiscal year 2008 this same bill had a price tag of 90 8 billion one year later fiscal year 2009 the liberal democrats increased spending by 14 percent to 103 3 billion and for fiscal year 2010 yet another liberal hike in the cost of appropriations to the taxpayer to the tune of 125 billion representing a whopping 21 percent increase in spending the liberals claim that any cuts in spending for any program covered by this bill drives more people into hunger strange that they did not say that last year when these very same liberal democrats cut 562 million from wic so that they could spend it in unrelated matters that is only one example of the lack of leadership courtesy of our friends across the aisle lest we forget it was their failed policies that ruined the economy when they were in charge of the power of the purse their habitual and unending spending increases have not helped the economy as they had promised but rather have saddled our children and grandchildren with outrageous debt to pay off with better fiscal stewardship our economy would be stronger and our countrys job creators would be able to provide the jobs that our nations workforce is hungry for according to the bureau of labor statistics in january 2007the month that the democrats took over congressunemployment was at 4 6 percent let me repeat that according to the bureau of labor statistics in january 2007 the month the democrats took over congress with a republican president unemployment was at 4 6 percent that number has nearly doubled under the eyes of the liberal democrats and the obama administration last year the democrats failed to pass a budget or any appropriations bill there has been a complete lack of leadership on their side of the aisle and at the white house while it got very little publicity from the lame stream media the senate this year overwhelmingly rejected president obamas budget proposal on a unanimous vote of 970 unanimous opposition to the presidents budget and nothing said about it in the press the republican house budget that we sent to the senate faired much better than the presidents budget again weve seen nothing but a lack of leadership from the administration and the liberal democrats in congress the bottom line is that if we do not make sound and responsible fiscal decisions that focus on reducing spending and making the government leaner and more efficient we risk forfeiting control of our own purse to debtor nations the simple truth is that we are currently borrowing 43 cents for every dollar spent at the federal level to have foreign nations provide funds for so much of what our country spends is simply negligent and irresponsible even the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff admiral mike mullen has stated that the national debt is the single biggest threat to our national security taxpayers will be paying around 600 billion in interest on the national debt by 2012 to put that figure in perspective the fiscal year 2011 defense budget is 685 billion in order to grow the economy and provide an environment in which americans can prosper we need to end expensive and ineffective government programs and remove the barriers of uncertainty that prevent employers from hiring many liberal elites are calling for higher taxeshigher taxes mr speakeron hardworking americans in order to pay for their irresponsible spending and fiscal decisions the democrat plan is to continue to borrow spend and tax taking money out of the pockets of hardworking americans a clear difference between liberal democrats and republicans is that republicans do not claim ownership of the salaries of hardworking americans and businesses that create jobs elite democrats believe that they are entitled to take money from americans and small businesses in order to carry out their liberal agenda and job creators are left with whatever the liberal elites deem is necessary for them you cannot help the job seeker by punishing the job creator with higher taxes and more government red tape american businesses need a clear perspective of what the future holds in order to create american jobs and strengthen our economy the uncertainty and mixed messages that the obama administration provide are completely counterproductive to achieving any kind of economic prosperity president obamas economic policies have consisted of bullying businesses to help union allies such as the case in south carolina where the nlrb is telling a private company where to do business for the benefit of big labor bosses at the expense of 1 000 jobs in south carolina when americans needed a jobs agenda president obama and the elite democratcontrolled congress gave them a spending agenda from the presidents first day in office in january 2009 through april 30 2011 the economy has lost 2 5 million jobs an average of 3 044 jobs lost every day according to the bureau of labor statistics 150 000 new jobs are needed to be created each month just to keep up with population growth the economy is not growing fast enough or strong enough to employ the 13 7 million americans looking for work but the liberal elites seem content on sitting back and watching agencies expand the bureaucracy by coming out with an unending stream of jobkilling regulations this in no way helps create confidence in american business jobs or economic prosperity the democrat elites indeed have made history the result of their liberal agenda has been trilliondollar deficits historic debt and historic unemployment we must empower americas job creators small businesses families and entrepreneurs to lead us to real job growth more wasteful washington spending isnt the solution thats

h r 1230 the restarting american offshore leasing now act both under a structured rule with many amendments all of which are democrat amendments having been made in order this is a very fair rule i commend the sponsor of the two bills the chairman of the natural resources committee mr hastings of washington for his leadership in bringing both of these bills to the house h r 1229 is a bill that goes to the heart of the bureaucratic delays which are preventing the approval of drilling permits within the gulf of mexico and it modifies the standards and procedures governing federal leases and permits in order to streamline the process making the development of these domestic resources a reality instead of the status quo of paying lip service to drilling and then stifling drilling through bureaucratic inaction h r 1230 is a bill that would direct the sale of oil and gas leases within the outer continental shelf reversing a failed administration policy of canceling and delaying those processes over the last 2 years many republicans have come to this floor and have sung the same refrain of show us the jobs it was indeed a nice song and a catchy tuneso catchy that the minority of today seems to have been picking up on that kind of song as well i dont expect to hear that today or at least we ought not to hear it today because the two bills before us under this rule are real bills that create real jobs for people unlike the bills we have seen over the past couple of years which have led us to a situation where today there are twice as many workers in the government as there are in all of manufacturing in this nation which is an exact reverse of the situation this nation was in in 1960 these are not going to be government jobs which attack the taxpayers and suck the money out of their wallets to fund them these are going to be real jobs that grow the private sector that expand the economy that provide wealth and that will provide actually millions of new government revenues coming into this country the situation we find ourselves in today with regard to energy is one that is detrimental to everybody everyone who goes to the pump to fill their cars recognizes the cost is increasing and will continue to increase they recognize that the situation we are in puts all our jobs in jeopardy and it is because of the inaction of this particular administration the president has continually said that he wants to do action to move forward to develop american energy but the actions of his administration have quite frankly failed to meet the rhetoric of the administration the problem has always been a fundamental flaw in our nations energy plan last may the deepwater horizon accident occurred which was a tragedy and we must thank all of those who helped to solve that particular problem but unfortunately the administrations response to that tragedy has turned it into a catastrophe and one which destroys jobs immediately a moratorium on all sorts of development was put into place prior to that moratorium being put into place there were 52 approved and pending permits and that moratorium was lifted in october but of those 52 only 10 permits have been issued since that time two of them are new in deepwater and are eight of the 52 that were originally done that means there are over 40 still approved and still stalled in what has become a de facto moratorium caused by a footdragging of this administration that what one columnist said is moving at a glacial pace more rigs have left our shore12to go to other places in the world where they are welcomed and where they are developing energy sources where they dont have to face the red tape and the footdragging than have actually been approved by this administration a perfect example is seahawk drilling a company that had over 500 jobs and 20 rigs that went into chapter 11 bankruptcy the president of that company stated only one reason for that bankruptcy and that loss of jobs which was the de facto moratorium of inaction done by this administration in this area in 2008 in a response to an arbitrary drilling ban that was lifted by both the president and congress it created a 5year plan virginia was supposed to start the exploration process in 2011 but the secretary of the interior delayed that until 2012 and then later delayed all exploration on the atlantic coast until after 2017 in the gulf of mexico two other sales were canceled and moved out from this year which was when they were supposed to begin once again into next year it became so bad that a judge in new orleans gave the administration 30 days to start moving on these projects saying that what was happening by this administration was increasingly inexcusable and that not acting at all is not a lawful action the result of this has simply been catastrophic for jobs in america the obama administration has admitted in its official memorandum that for those days of its official moratorium 12 000 jobs were lost but what is more significant is the de facto moratorium there an lsu study simply said if this were sustained for 18 months in the gulf area there would be 24 532 jobs lost and in the nation 36 137 jobs lost simply because of what we are not doing in the gulf of mexico it is very simple to understand how this works each platform that is out there drilling has 90 to 150 employees if you add the production team as well as the exploration team you can multiply that by a factor of four so you have almost per every drilling up to 1 400 jobs that are tied to that particular project with 1 800 a week as the average wage that means for every one of those drills that is not put back into production it is 5 million to 10 million per month per platform that is lost to this economy and the ripple effect within the economy for our energy uses as well as jobs is once again staggering as this administration is indeed going at a glacial pace in virginia alone 2 000 jobs will be estimated to be lost if the de facto moratorium that pushes everything to 2017 is allowed to take place now this action or inaction by the administration costs every american it costs us at the gas pump as we see the cost of running our cars increasing almost daily and this hurts the poor worse than anyone else it is estimated that every american will pay 700 more this year for gasoline than least year obviously those at the lower end of the economic scale are the ones who are hurt the most for every cent that is increased in gas at the pump that is 1 billion that is taken out of household incomes in this country and it makes sure that americans are then put at the mercy of foreign oil development and foreign energy sources which may not necessarily like us and sometimes theyre just flat out bad guys it also has other areas in which it has affected everyoneonce again those at the lower end of the income scale the most for every dime that diesel goes up that is 400 million that is added to the agricultural industry which is what we eat which is tacked onto our food prices you have to have oil for fertilizer as that goes up the cost of fertilizer goes up the cost of running machinery goes up the cost of food goes up the cost of pharmaceuticals plastics if you go into the emergency room everything that is not metal has some element of oil that developed it and all of those are increasing now there are only two ways that we can handle this situation first you can go with the old concept of supply and demand and simply increase production which is what these two bills are trying to do or you can go to the approach that this administration seems to be asking us to do which is to cut our standard of living accept gasoline prices at the european level and beg saudi arabia to be nice to usto put our futures in the hands of opec and then amazingly say we can also solve these problems simply by taxing oil companies at a higher rate since 2010 the domestic production of energy in this country has decreased 16 percent in this year next year and the year after that we estimate unless we make changes that a quarter of a million barrels of oil will be decreased in our production rate in each of those years the only area in which any energy production has been increasing is on private property unfortunately for this country almost all of the energy that we have most of the energy that we can develop is on public lands which is controlled by the government which is doing nothing now to help develop that this is a time where pragmatism is much better than a failed ideology of restrictions now what these two bills do is to simply reverse the jobkilling delays that have been taking place in h r 1229 it reforms the law to require leaseholders to receive permits to drill before they start drilling and it will do it for the first time by law not simply by a regulation it demands that the secretary of the interior conduct and approve safety revenues once again for the first time in history more importantly it ends the de facto moratorium by demanding prompt guidelines and action it says that the secretary of the interior will have 30 days in which to deal with these issues and then can have up to two 15day extensionsa total of 60 days to do the review now while that may seem to some as a quick path its not when you look at the history of what has been done before the moratorium went into effect it was taking 5 to 15 days to do the drilling leases and permits one company was done in nine days just recently what the problem is is that most of these are simply not being done simply because of inaction it also says for those that were approved prior to the may 27 moratorium youve got 30 days to get them going again this is plenty of time to do the work it also does something else for the first time it provides an expedited hearing process so that legal rights are not lostthey are protectedbut you will not go back into a concept of a neverending lawsuit moratorium in 1230 the bill recognizes that this year will be the first time since 1958 that we have a possibility of no offshore lease sales and it wants to reverse that action to proceed promptly with the 5year plan so that things for example in virginia will be in effect within 1 year and those that were scheduled in the gulf can be done within 1 year of the passage of this bill this bill simply will create billions in federal reserve revenues coming in and it will create billions in our economy and it will create jobs i hate to say this but under president obama the cost of energy has skyrocketed the administration has actively blocked and delayed energy production its cost jobs its raised energy prices its made the united states more reliant on unstable foreign countries for our energy through the american energy initiative this house is actively working to increase american energy production to lower gas prices to create american jobs to generate revenue to help reduce the deficit and to decrease our dependence on foreign energy the united states government has had a long history of sporadic attempts to respond to oil and gas prices usually we have missed the mark but unfortunately oil is still the lifeblood of the world and will be for most of our lives that is why 70 countries and 31 states in the united states are involved in the process prices are influenced by the signals that are given by worldwide circumstances and also by government policy these two bills are the first of

not an energypoor nation and we need to be developing the resources in every way possible including in the gulf including in the outer continental shelf and including on our land sources that is our future if we want to do anything to create jobs and help the american people that is specifically what these two bills are aimed to do with such this is a good rule and a fair rule and the underlying piece of legislation is entirely worthy of our support i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.0010915976017713547, 0.0010915976017713547, 0, "house resolution 269 provides for a modified open rule providing for consideration of h r 1216 which amends the public health service act to convert funding for graduate medical education in qualified teaching health centers from mandatory spending to an authorization of appropriations h r 1540 the national defense authorization act and sameday consideration of a rule to consider extending certain provisions of the usa patriot act this is the seventh modified open rule that the house republican majority has offered this congress compared to the liberal democrats one modified open rule during the entire 111th congress the first underlying bill today h r 1216 continues the fulfillment of the republican pledge to america and illustrates that once again republicans are keeping our promises to the american people to cut federal spending the american people want transparency of washingtons spending of hardearned taxpayer dollars in an act of gross irresponsibility the federal government is spending 1 out of 4 of gross domestic product we hear the term federal money as though it is manna from heaven let me dispel that misconception the federal government has only the money it takes away from hardworking american families through taxes or the money it borrows as a nation we are currently borrowing 43 cents for every dollar spent at the federal level some argue that to balance the federal government and pay down our debt we should raise taxes as a fiscal conservative i have to disagree raising taxes on hardworking americans and job creators is simply a way to pass the blame we must rein in outofcontrol washington spending and put an end to it the american people are sick and tired of reckless government spending and washingtons disregard for basic budgeting principles of living within its means this is one of the many reasons i urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying bill before us today h r 1216 restores congressional oversight to federal spending by ending the autopilot spending for physician residency programs at teaching health centers and restoring it to the annual appropriations process when a program is put on autopilot congress abdicates its authority to unelected bureaucrats and takes a handsoff approach house republicans are committed to ending that approach to federal spending and ensuring that government programs are accountable for how they are spending money no longer will we accept politically popular excuses each program must prove that it is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars if congress will not address outofcontrol spending now we are passing the buck to our children and grandchildren therefore i commend my republican colleagues at the house energy and commerce committee for seeking to end mandatory or autopilot funding for programs in the liberal democrats government takeover of health care because the liberal elites knew their government takeover of health care was unpopular and would likely have consequences at the ballot box they included 105 billion in mandatory taxpayer spending in the law itself to protect their favorite programs let me take a moment to explain the difference between discretionary and mandatory government spending discretionary spending is appropriated by congress annually and therefore subject to congressional oversight and review discretionary spending allows members of congress the opportunity to be wise stewards of the taxpayers money by not funding ineffective or duplicative programs on the contrary mandatory spending operates irrespective of congressional appropriations and must be spent whether we have the money or not the most recognized mandatory spending programs are medicare medicaid and social security which operate on autopilot and have not been subject to congressional oversight from year to year as funds automatically stream from the treasury to anyone who qualifies for a particular benefit it cannot be emphasized enough that the liberal elites in washington chose to hastily ram through their government takeover of health care with no regard for the staunch opposition of the american people the audacity of an elected official or worse an unelected bureaucrat basically saying to a taxpayer that he or she knows how to spend the taxpayers money better than the individual taxpayer is appalling that is what the ruling liberal elites in washington did when they chose to forgo the annual appropriations also known as oversight process by putting their favorite programs on autopilot under obamacare it is my firm belief that washington should not be in the business of picking winners and losers during committee consideration of the underlying bill my republican colleagues rightly pointed out that the liberal democrats in control last congress put the funding for residencies at teaching health centers on autopilot but left residency programs at childrens hospitals to fend for themselves in the annual appropriations process in fact president obamas fy 2012 budget proposes eliminating funding for residency programs at childrens hospitals it is hard to understand why residencies at teaching health centers should receive special treatment why were these residency programs protected while others languished and were eventually proposed to be eliminated this is a classic example of washington bureaucrats deciding which programs will win and which will lose as i said earlier every program should be properly scrutinized by congress through the appropriations process and be accountable for how it is spending taxpayer money while this accountability should always be important its even more critical because were facing the third straight year of trillion dollar deficits this fiscal year our deficit will be 1 6 trillion remember the figure i mentioned earlier about our nations borrowing habits were borrowing 43 cents of every dollar the federal government spends this translates to a national debt that has now reached more than 14 trillion and has gotten the attention of the american people if youre having a hard time visualizing 14 trillion let me put it this way if america was required to pay back its national debt right now each citizenman woman and childwould owe more than 46 000 the simple truth is that we have a spending crisis in this town due in large part to mandatory spending that operates on autopilot house republicans are committed to bringing government spending under control and were continuing to build on our pledge to america by restoring congressional oversight and accountability for government programs again i urge my colleagues to vote for this rule and the underlying bills i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.0011051117908209562, 0.0011051117908209562, 0, "i actually didnt intend to do this this evening but i got so frustrated with a number of the things ive been watching both on television and from our brothers and sisters in this body it became time to actually bring some of the slides we actually do in our town halls back in arizona i like to refer to it as a combination of truth on the numbers and also dispelling some of the political folklore that is rampant both in this town im going to say a number of things this evening that i promise you will offend all sorts of members all sorts of this washington d c but look im a freshman ive been here 140some days and washington d c has systemically not told the truth to the american people i dont know if theyre fearful of looking the american people in the eyes and saying look heres what weve done to your future your kids future your grandkids future is so scary that they dont get reelected well i got elected to come here and do the numbers and so my goal is very very simple the numbers are straight up the numbers come from 2010 on a lot of the charts so we know exactly what was actually spent on a number of charts outside that were also going to use the presidents numbers but lets run through this we were just watching judge carter a couple of minutes ago walk through some of the economic impacts of what happens with drilling im going to even touch through this on the folklore of well lets go tax big oil and what it actually produces first of all the slide right next to me this one we put together just to make it simple and visual imagine a country that borrows 42 pennies 42 pennies out of every dollar we spend we all know thats not sustainable we cant do this you couldnt do it in your family budget think of it over the last couple of years its been tough out there your family my family we all cinched our belts the american families got tough and did what was necessary what did the congress do what did this government do what did washington d c do they just kept spending but the way they spent is they found people who were willing to buy unitedstates sovereign debt and they kept borrowing and today we now borrow 42 cents out of every dollar now why is that so terrifying well its terrifying because you start to realize the speed the debt is growing and then you start to understand some of the other drivers in that debt one of the things that happened january 1 this year you know what was the big change baby boomers every 8 seconds someone turns 65 in this country for the next 18 years so think of that ten thousand a day for the next 18 years thats why you see many of us around here saying we need to tell the truth how devastatingly ugly these numbers are and that if we step up and deal with it now we can fix it but you cant deal with it with a bunch of silly rhetoric so lets walk through some more of these slides right here is the 2010 and you see this blue the blue is well call it mandatory spending entitlements medicare medicaid social security interest on the debt but look when you step up when you step up to what is functionally four budget years from now because we just did the 2012 budget looking at 2016 you start to realize the growth in the spending the growth in the entitlements one of the things that keeps not being shared with the american people is when you look at our 2010 and the 2011 number here would be out a little bit further we dont take in enough revenue today to even cover the mandatory spending if you see our revenue line it cuts through right about here so think of that every dime of defense is borrowed every single dime of discretionary is borrowed and were about 100 billion short on even coyering the entitlements the mandatory spending we borrow a little piece of those dollars that go into the entitlements and it continues to explode in the future years i know these are a lot of slides but when we get down to the ending part i think youre going to find some of them sort of fun but we first have to walk through sort of an understanding of the pie chart this is 2010 2010 the mandatory spending was sitting about 63 percent 62 percent of all the spending in government defense department other discretionary and when i said all the spending in government understand things like fannie mae freddie mac arent even part of this theyre off the books on this now when you look at this line here that blue look how fast it starts to move up in 2016 it goes from here where were about 63 percent and now we hit 72 percent think of that we just did what the 2012 budget 2016 four budget cycles from now the mandatory spending the entitlements are consuming 72 percent of our budget the amazing thing is in that cycle the money that is going to discretionary actually we predict to go down in those 4 years so you start to understand the mandatory is consuming what we are you get folks who start to raise their hands at some of the town halls and say well why not just raise the marginal tax rates lets go out and tax everyone a little bit more theres some fascinating math on that and weve got 60 years of history looking at it this is one of my favorite charts for someone that wants to follow this you can actually goand i have a tough last nameits schweikert house gov youll see these charts on there this is when we had very high marginal tax rates back in the forties fifties early sixties very high marginal tax rates over here is where we have very low marginal tax rates and theres this normalizing effect theres actually a couple of ph d s whove written very detailed papers on this normalizing effect or even during times of very high marginal tax rates and very low marginal tax rates guess what happens we take in about 18 2 percent of gross domestic product i dont know maybe in the math out there maybe in the logic out there maybe in the human nature there when you tax people a lot they find other ways to take their income maybe when you tax them low they are willing to work more hours but somehow high marginal tax rates low marginal tax rates we basically take in the same percentage of gross domestic product of gdp it hits that 18 2 percent so when folks look at you in the eye and say oh just raise marginal tax rateswere going to tax the rich more were going to tax everyone moreit doesnt do it it doesnt take care of this massive debt that is consuming us as a people what you have to do is you have to grow that line which is the size of the economy you must grow this economy because as you start to look through these numbers you come to the realization yeah we have a huge spending problem but we can never cut enough we have to grow because its two sides of this pendulum and both of them have to be in motion we have to grow we have to cut the spending and we have to deal with the reality that the mandatory spending the entitlements are eating us alive lets actually start to walk on some of what i would like to refer to as political folklore when we hold many of our town halls back in my district and i am blessed to represent arizonas fifth district it is an amazingly wonderful place it is scottsdale and tempe fountain hills ahwatukee and mesa and we will often get hands that will pop up in the back of the room and say mr schweikert or david why dont we do this if we go out there and tax big oil we could balance the budget right they mean well i believe the participants at our town halls really mean well when they raise that hand because they have seen members of this body tell them that and they havent been told the truth when you look at the numbers here is 2011 hard dollars you can call them subsidies you can call them depletion allowances you can call them incentives to drill and produce more petroleum products but the gray here is fossil fuels and just for comparison we also put the 8 72 billion of the subsidies that go into green energy but for the fun of it lets just talk about this part right here the 2 44 billion that is in 2011 well think about this if you are borrowing about 4 7 billion every single day how can a member of congress look in the camera look at you and say well if we would just tax big oil more maybe that would help solve the debt problem it doesnt even make a drop in the bucket we can have a little fun with this because i have been trying to find a way to talk about big numbers i was blessed in my previous life i lived in a world of big numbers but how do you visualize 1 trillion how do you visualize 1 billion how do you visualize 1 million for many people so we have been playing with the idea of lets make it time so your government right now is borrowing about 4 7 billion every single day every single day so lets just think about it 4 7 billion every single day those taxes on big oillets make it this lets make it taxes on all lets just remove those depletion allowances those tax credits which are also tied to depreciation that all other businesses get but lets just wipe them all out guess what it buys you it buys you about 2 2 minutes of borrowing a day now how many of you feel like you have been told that you know once again we are engaging often around this place in political theater instead of math thats been one of my greatest frustrations in my short time here i wish i saw more members carrying around their financial calculators so they could look the american people in the eye and tell them the truth but think about that the whole we will call it fossil fuels subsidies tax credits depreciation allowances incentives to drill would buy you about 2 2 minutes a day oh come on and thats just assuming that every dollar came in and you didnt slow the economy down and didnt slow energy drilling down or energy production down so this is just throwing your hands up and saying lets just pretend for a moment that we got rid of those and it becomes pure income lets actually go to the next level because theres always that other person that raises their hands and says well david i have heard that if we would go out and we would tax the rich more remember that lame duck congress last december extended what a lot of folks call the bush tax cuts now around here we often call them the bushobama tax cuts because president obama is the one who signed them in december but they extended those tax cuts and werent those tax cuts for the rich and wouldnt that balance the budget well back to that small problem called math lets pretend for a moment that they hadnt happened and lets pretend that it didnt slow down the economy and lets pretend every dime that some folks have predicted came in a lot of this place operates in a fantasy world why cant we so we never had the tax extensions that happened in december what would it buy you well we once again borrow 4 7 billion every single day it would buy you about 28 minutes think of that 28 minutes so now im at my town hall ive had two hands go up the first one saying well david if we would tax big oil then that would balance the budget well what did we learn on the last slide that was about 2 2 minutes of borrowing every day and then the other hand goes up saying if we would tax the rich more as a matter of fact why dont we do in this slide that tax extenders never happened so everyone rich poor middle class didnt get the benefit of that extension of the tax cuts last december well guess what that buys you 28 minutes so think about it we are doing really well here we are up to 28 minutes plus 2 2 minutes so now lets see what if we do this because theres always the other hand that goes up and says david i bet you we could balance the budget and wouldnt have this debt and deficit if we did this we tax big oil and those bushobama tax extenders that happened last december in the lame duck session we never had that because those help the rich oh and by the way if we had never had the wars you know if we didnt have afghanistan if we didnt have iraqand i believe actually in our number here it didnt even have libyawe could balance the budget then couldnt we so we actually literally a couple hours ago sat down and said lets add it up and lets make it on a per hour basis so the american people can understand the crazy spending thats going on around this place and how fast the numbers are eroding on us back again to our math we borrow 4 7 billion every single day and lets go back to our pretend world every dime of those oil subsidies and depreciation allowances and tax credits come in and it doesnt actually slow down jobs or the economy and every dime of those taxes were to come in even though probably if you did that you would slow down the economy and people would work less and you would have less dollars but we are living in our fantasy world here and because we didnt have the wars none of that money would be going out the door even though certain portions of that are actually already built into the defense budget but every dime that is equated to iraq afghanistan and now libya what would it buy us well we are borrowing that 4 7 billion a day guess what it buys you 3 hours of borrowing think about what you have heard around here and how many people you have seen walk up in front of a microphone and a camera look you in the eye and say well if we did these things we wouldnt have this debt they are not telling you the truth all those together are only 3 hours of borrowing and lets see if i remember correctly theres like what 24 hours in a day im looking for some honest discussion about the other 21 hours a day youve got to go back to those first boards that i put up and have an honest discussion about entitlements about the mandatory spending because they are what are exploding on us they are what are consuming us as a people we can do this we can save the future for our kids and our grandkids we can make sure that these programs exist but we have to do it rationally and we have to for once do it honestly factbased maybe someone actually holding a calculator because the rhetoric around here the political folklore around here when they are willing to look you in the eyes and base their whole world on something that only buys you 3 hours of borrowing a day you are not being told the truth we try to add literally two to four slides a week we are engaging in a little project we are a freshman office but we have some very smart young people who are very good with their calculators and we are trying very hard to find a way to make these gigantic numbers digestible so we can all understand them so we can have a rational conversation of how we save our country if you will go to schweikert house gov you are going to find a number of these slides as a matter of fact all of them are on there and every week i promise you there are going to be more coming and maybe if we all start to tell each other the truth about the math we can actually tell the truth about how we are going to save the country with that i yield back

in our other states particularly our state to the south being from the state of kansas i would like to talk a little bit about the coal industry you might say kansas and the coal industry what does that have to do with kansas i am a farmer by trade and we produce a lot of corn and wheat and soybeans and many other things but in order to produce those we need a lot of electricity a number of decades ago we built a coalfired electrical power plant in western kansas it generates electricity that covers six to seven states about 5 or 6 or 7 years ago we said we need more electricity our economy continues to grow and we need more electricity we began the process in western kansas to expand our electrical production we need more electricity if the economy is going to growand im sorry to say now the economy is not growing very quickly under this administration and let me tell you why it is called overregulation it is called litigation it is called the attempt by this administration and others outside that are working together with this administration to stop the generation of more electricity more energy of various types we need more energy we need more american energy and we can produce that we are trying to do that right now in western kansas we are trying to produce more jobs this administration and folks close to this administrationand this is hard to believethey have said that you want 1 900 construction jobs you want to create 1 900 jobs in western kansas to grow your ability to produce american electricity you know what the answer is from this administration you know what the answer is from environmental groups you know what the answer is they said no we dont want your jobs we dont want 1 900 jobs in western kansas we have rural communities all across western kansas and they depend on this power actually if they dont have more electricity we will begin to see brownouts in less than a decade in a rural area we are trying to grow our production of energy of coalfired electrical power and this administration says no were going to sue you and the epa says no were going to stop you with new regulations various outside groups are throwing lawsuits it is death by litigation and that is not only stopping our power plants they are stopping power plants all across the country now it is hard to understand i talk to my constituents and they say why cant we have more electricity who is opposed to this who is opposed to jobs somebody in washington is opposed to jobs there are regulators all over this country particularly in our nations capital who say no i would rather you pay for 5 gasoline no i would rather you have higher electricity rates if we dont generate more electricity in my state in western kansas they anticipate a 40 to 50 percent increase in electricity rates but by the time that would happen 4 or 5 years from now theyll say why didnt you do something about it that is why i am here tonight we have to do something about it now our competitors across the way in china i believe they have figured it out they recognize that you need more energy in whatever form we need more energy we need to produce more electricity we need to produce more diesel fuel and more gasoline we need an alloftheabove strategy but when you have an administration and a culture in washington that is dedicated to eliminating access to energy when you have an energy secretary that suggests that americans need to pay 5 a gallon on gasoline our energy secretary suggests that we need to pay 5 a gallon on our gasoline what is going on we need to pay more no we need to pay less and the way we do that is not having a brandnew policy a new program in washington no we need to let american entrepreneurs continue to do what they have been doing for years and that is producing a needed product called energy and we can produce it in many ways in kansas and all throughout the midwest and all throughout the nation but when you have this narrow agenda of those in washington that have dedicated their lives to make certain that our electrical prices go up our energy prices in all forms go up that is going to cost us more unless we can turn on the entrepreneurs actually there was a report from our unitedstates chamber of commerceand there are folks in this town who get upset when you talk about people who create jobs because it is actually the private sector that creates jobs it estimates there are 351 stalled energy projects across america and the one in western kansas sunflower electric cooperative is just one of those but there are 350 others they estimate that if those stalled energy projects would move forward that they would create 2 million jobs in the short term just in construction but in the long term they would create affordable energy to allow us to compete across the world frankly as our energy prices increase our ability to compete and export and to compete with china and many other countries is incredibly diminished so we needwe mustand are responsible here in this chamber for freeing up entrepreneurs we are responsible for forcing the unitedstates senate to come to the table and actually do what they talked about doing i dont think there is a member of congress in the house or senate who went home and said do you know what i like i like high energy prices nobody said that no they went home and said were doing everything we can theyre not doing everything they can the unitedstates senate is not doing a single thing to help this along and the administration is doing everything it can to make sure our energy prices go up thats so frustrating to me because we do have an easy answer lets let american entrepreneurs american energy companiesbasically small businessesmove forward in my district we are heavily dependent on agriculture but the second largest industry is the oil and gas industry and we must continue to encourage them to move forward i appreciate the opportunity to visit about this tonight its something i am very passionate about because the people in this house who are working for it cannot be blamed for high energy prices in the future because we are doing what we can do

that there are too many government programs that do not work and actually make things worse these government programs are paid for by the american people you can say that its not from the treasury or that its from the treasury that its from tarp its not from tarp but the fact remains that it is from the american taxpayer in fact the gentleman at one time said it comes out of the treasury then he said it comes from tarp but the promise in 2008 was that it would go back to the american people it would go back in the national treasury in fact it does not i will address where it goes and i think the american people when they find out where it goes under this program theyre going to be even more upset i dont think theyll be surprised because i think theyve come to realize that theres not a lot of will in washington to protect them the taxpayers the american people already know that there are too many ineffective government programs that cost too much and this is a poster child for those programs if you cant cut this program im not sure you can cut any and when we find such programs we as the representatives of the people have a duty and a responsibility to the taxpayers to end these programs thats what we are doing this morning were going to end this program thats what were here for in this legislation by the gentleman from texas we stop a 1 billion failed spending program now its a wellintentioned program but just as the road to hell is paved with good intentions so is the road to higher deficits and recordbreaking debt a debt that our children and our grandchildren will have to pay you know when we talk about the taxpayers ultimately fund this program when we borrow at 42 cents out of every dollar its our children and our grandchildren that will have to pay for these programs were charging something and were telling them to pay the bill today we have an unthinkable debt of 14 trillion a debt that imposes a birth tax on every child born in america its 45 000 today just last year it was 35 000 its grown by 10 000 even worse this debt or birth tax is growing every day because our government is spending some days 5 billion some days 8 billion more than it takes in and adding to what our children and grandchildren will have to pay one question that the american people often confront is are they better off than their parents and will their children be better off than they are and their grandchildren its interesting that in survey after survey or poll after poll the american people say were better off than our parents our parents fought for our freedom they preserved it in numerous wars they saved their money they watched their money they worked hard and they left us in good shape but when that same question is a little different question do you think your children or grandchildren will be better off the american people know they instinctively know no is the answer sadly and thats because of our national debt and our deficit in fact both the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and secretary robert gates have said that its a national security problem our debt threatens our very existence as a country this washington spending binge is driving our country right off a cliff weve seen the effect of overspending on our economy today the government absorbs so much money from our citizens that its hard to create private jobs each dollar out of the economy is a job that the private sector cant create now actually president reagan and president clinton both realized this and they grew the economy those were the only two years with a growing economy and government spending either level or going down thats the only time in our country we had a surplus they both realized that it was the private sector that would see us out of this this growth in the federal government and in its spending is hampering job creation and thats what these homeowners need they need a job lets look at this program this is from the obama administration this is their budget that was just filed here is what the american people need to know what does this program do it offers a loan of up to 50 000 to pay all arrearages to homeowners on their first mortgage fifty thousand dollars and then to pay up to 24 consecutive months of mortgage payments 24 months of their mortgage payment both the gentleman from texas and the gentleman from massachusetts kept talking about the large financial institutions thats who is owed the money in fact were not getting this money from the large financial institutions just the contrary were paying them because theyre the ones that hold this mortgage so when the taxpayers write a 50 000 check under this program to pay arrearages on the mortgage who do you think it goes to it goes to bank of america it goes to morgan chase it goes to citigroup its shocking that the gentleman from massachusetts would actually say that this money is coming from the very institutions that are going to receive this money this billion dollars is not going to homeowners its going to these large financial institutions he says theyre the ones that ought to be paying this not the homeowners or not the taxpayers we always thought the homeowners were supposed to pay their mortgages but i think we could all agree that its not the taxpayer its just an astounding thing he says that if flip wilson told us to vote for something we would but it wasnt flip wilson it was ron kirk and what did he tell us if i were chairman frank i would talk about anything but this failed program i think thats why theyve talked about everything but this failed program it was ron kirk that told us that our automobile sector would suffer that our pharmaceutical sector would suffer he said that this would cost jobs in medical equipment electronics textiles wheat fruit nuts cotton he did include cotton he said 60 billion worth of exports were at risk well do the math 7 000 jobs for each 1 billion worth of exports thats 420 000 jobs so do you want to vote against something that would put 420 000 americans out of jobs and then they would all line up for another government program that the minority would design the other thingand this is the last thing ill say they keep saying that the taxpayers will get paid back well let me introduce this this is from the obama administration this is their same budget for fiscal year 2012 it estimates the losses on this program and they have accused us of making up these figures 97 72 thats the loss on this program 98 cents out of every dollar its time to end this failed

also asked what worries me i worry about unemployment and about the uncertainty facing our families in our district i am worried that more is not being done to create an environment of certainty that promotes longterm growth in our jobs sector government does not create jobs we need to be clear about that government creates an environment for job creation by the private sector folks simply will not be put back to work if government continues villainizing our job creators and enacting policies that keep workers on the unemployment lines and drive us deeper into debt as a small business owner myself i understand how this hinders the ability to create jobs back in august i invited local business owners throughout our area to participate in a business roundtable where we discussed what government can do to empower the private sector spur job creation and grow our economy these business owners are the people we are asking to lead us into economic recovery and to put americans back to work i was pleased to see folks from all sorts of industries present eager and great ideas and thoughts on issues that basically are causing them to struggle in this economy they shared with me that

regulations agencies frequently fail to consider alternative ways to achieve the regulatory goals without imposing unnecessary burdens on americas job creators this bill increases the ability of small businesses to provide input to federal agencies as they consider government regulations and it gives the small business administration new authority to ensure agencies comply with a law that requires flexibility in taking regulatory action against small business it takes president obamas regulatory review executive order one step further giving the small business administration the ability to ensure new regulations are in compliance with the law while verifying that small businesses will be able to comply without hurting their ability to create jobs business owners need the certainty that government will get out of the way so that they can do what they do best which is to grow their businesses and create jobs and the american people need real bipartisan solutions to our jobs crisis lets put politics and partisanship aside and help the private sector create the jobs that americans throughout the country so desperately need the time has come to empower small businesses and to reduce government barriers by helping our small businesses by fixing the tax code to help our job creators by boosting competitiveness for american manufacturers by encouraging entrepreneurship and growth by maximizing american energy production by paying down americas unsustainable debt burden and by starting to live within our means"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.9971502423286438,

came up i think mr mulvaney came up with a budget proposal they put the presidentsa very very watered down and inaccurate version of the presidents budget up there and weve been talking budget when we talk about the budget what were talking about is the values and priorities of america its important to keep this in mind what shows up in your budget is what you care about what does not show up in your budget is what you dont care about now i always caution people not to just take their family budget and the united states budget and assume theyre basically the same thing one just is bigger than the other thats not exactly accurate there are important differences and we shouldnt mix up the two but in this way they are similar in that they reflect what it is that people value if you have a family and their budget you can look at their budget they spend a lot of money on entertainment you can pretty much figure they value that if they put a lot of money into food you can figure they definitely think that is a priority for them you can go through the family budget and see what people spend their money on see what people dont have in their budget and then you can pretty much figure well maybe thats not a priority for them of course they may not be able to afford it at this time but if you talk about reasonably middle class people their budget reflects what they care about what matters and what doesnt and for our nation that certainly is true if our nation puts more money into warfare than it does into social uplift jobs and the economy and infrastructure that says something about who we are if our national budget puts more money into infrastructure and jobs and putting people back to work then that says something about who we are the various budgets that have come up reflect what the various caucuses think is important and project a vision for our country i want to talk about that today i want to start by talking about paul ryans budget paul ryan is the republican budget committee chair hes a nice guy i dont have anything bad to say about him personally because he is actually a nice person but the fact is we disagree in a significant way about what the priorities of america should be for example the republican budget 20 children will lose access to head start to pay for one millionaires tax cut thats their budget just if you want to understand what their tax cuts represent it means 20 kids dont get to go to head start so that a millionaire can get a tax cut150 000 equals 20 times 7 500 so if you look at this tax cut a millionaires tax cut which will amount to about 150 000 these little guys dont get to go to head start now what is head start head start is a great program for lowincome kids to make sure that they have a chance at getting a quality education and dont fall behind in school and so this is a great program it has great results these head start kids 20 of them going to head start versus what a millionaires tax cut would be which is 150 000 now this is the choice were making we should not act like were not making choices we are making choices we are deciding my friends on the republican side of the aisle like to say oh we shouldnt pick winners and losers were always doing it they just pick the rich people and weipick the kids in head start also if you just want to get a sense of what the republican budget what it does and what the tax cuts that its calling for mean republican budget 150 college students will have their pell grants cut by 1 000 to pay for one millionaires tax cut so one millionaires tax cut 150 000 but 150 times 1 000 all these kids these college kids trying to make something of themselves their pell grant is going to get whacked by 1 000 bucks so again choices do we want to make sure the country club set is doing even better or do we want to make sure that these aspiring engineers these aspiring doctors and teachers these aspiring police officers these aspiring workers of tomorrow will have a shot at an affordable college education this is what were talking about these are the choices that were making and i think its very important that americans know it its critical that we know it now lets just not stop there lets talk about other critical choices being made because i think it is so critical that as were talking budget week and all the budget decisions that we are making that we make it real clear to the american people what it is were choosing republican budget 216 pregnant or postpartum women infants and children would lose access to wicthats the women infants and children program and it provides food for poor women and their kidsto pay for one millionaires tax cut so 150 000 tax cut for a millionaireagain this is the country club setequals about 216 pregnant women or postpartum women and the amount of money that americans give them so that they can have good nutrition for their kids these are poor women these are women who are struggling economically but just because theyre struggling economically we dont want their kids to go without good nutritious food so as americans we have the wic program well theyre going to get slashed out of the program because a millionaire needs a tax cut thats the choice that were making i want to talk about why were making that choice in a minute but i want to give one more example republican budget 25 seniors paying 6 000 or more for medicare to pay for one millionaires tax cut so if youre a millionaire and you get a tax cut under what the republicans want to give youyoure already doing good but they want you to even do betterthat will mean that youve got about 25 seniors who have to pay 6 000 a piece more for their medicare so mom dadif youre my age mom and dad are senior citizens if youre younger theyre not but if your parents or grandparents are on medicare and theyre doing all they can on their fixed income to make it theyre going to need a little extra help because weve got to make sure that that millionaire gets his 150 000 tax cut these are the choices that were making now my friends in the republican caucusgod bless themits not like they dont like poor people many of them are very charitable they give in their different walks of life maybe their faith community or whatever they just dont think government should do it this is what they say they think that government needs to get out of that and let churches mosques synagogues and other folks do it of course that would mean that it wouldnt get done because even though churches mosques and synagogues do great work they can never possibly come up to meet the need thats out there what theyre really believing isthis is what they really believe they believe in something called trickledown economics they believe that if you give this millionaire 150 000 more dollars than he already has he will maybe hopefully perhaps invest it in plant and equipment and maybe somebody will get a job because of it or maybe not or maybe he will invest in china hell improve jobs but just not in america nobody knows what they will do with this tax cut but this is what the republicans believe they think that if you give rich people more money they will invest in plant and equipment create more economic activity and it will trickle down to the rest of us the only problem is that it has never worked it doesnt stop them from saying it but its never worked in fact the gop budget will destroy more than 4 million american jobs in the next 2 years according to the economic policy institute the economic policy institute estimates that the shock to aggregate demand from nearterm spending cuts would result in roughly 1 3 million jobs lost in 2013 and 2 8 million jobs lost in 2014 or 4 1 million jobs through so a little bit more than 4 million jobs over the next 2 years now people might think well keith is that right well yeah its right and ill tell you why its right its right because when republicans say we need to cut government waste we need to cut government cut government cut government they act as if theres just some big government thing over there like its a big giant piece of styrofoam and they can just cut it and it doesnt change anything what theyre talking about cutting are federal workers theyre talking about laying off federal workers and theyre very derisive about government jobs and act like people who work for the government dont do anything of valueof course this is not true at all but if you look on this chart right here it says i earn less than 45 000 a year explain to me gop how cutting my pay creates jobs this particular person is named paul and he is an army depot worker i think we need army depot workers teresa is a nurseand this is her right here she lives in my district and she says twelve percent of the salary i earn caring for veterans goes to my retirement explain to me gop how cutting my retirement puts people to work well one of the things that they do in the ryan budget is cut into federal workers retirement they act like oh the government no the government is people the government is nurses the government is army depot workers and what about federal prisons that keep dangerous criminals behind bars i pay more than 9 000 a year for my familys health insurance explain to me gop how cutting my takehome pay lowers unemployment this guy is a corrections officer and thank goodness for correction officers or the streets that we live on wouldnt be so nice the bottom line is when republicans say oh were going to shrink the size of government what they mean is theyre going to lay off and cut the pay and cut the employment benefits of federal workers people who work in prisons at risk to themselves nurses who care for our veterans people who are army depot workers and people who work in our parks and people who fix our roads and a whole lot of other people heres a chart for you if you look at the ryan budget if you look at the gop proposal if you look at it and it could do what they want it to do it could cause a loss of up to 7 million jobs by 2016 because it would cut federal workers and then they wouldnt be able to have the money to spend in the neighborhoods they live in anymore that would then have a ripple effect in their neighborhoods because theyre buying less for example if that young nurse at the va in minnesota if she doesnt have the same pay as she had before then she cant buy as much as she bought before then the company she shops at doesnt sell her as much as they have before you do that enough multiply it times enough people and that company then needs to start laying off people so its a ripple effect what the republicans are asking for but if you look at what they wantedand im talking about going all the way back to h r 1 which is their proposalyou would see repealing health care reform that would cut about 2 million the gop budget that would cut about 3 million cuts to the federal workforce that would cut about 285 000 the socalled jobs act that would cut a lot the fair tax that would cut and they would just cut on down the line what theyre basically proposing is by shrinking government and by doing all that stuff theyre getting rid of people now i just want to be on the record because your words do get twisted if there is a federal program that is not justifiable and its so poorly run that its of no value to anyone im okay with cutting it i just want to say that on the record on the house floor im all right with cutting programs that dont work but when youre talking about va nurses and youre talking about corrections workers in federal prisons we need these people they do good stuff and i believe that we should stand by them as they stand by us the gop budgetnow going back to the budget we addressed todaywill shift costs to seniors for the medicare guarantee according to the aarp and whats aarp thats the leading organization representing retired persons and the cbowhats the cbo that is the congressional budget office and for folks who like to watch cspan id just say you need to know what cbo is because this is very important congressional budget office theyre the nonpartisan group that says whats really going on with the numbers at the same time it is raising the seniors cost this gop budget gives those making more than a million a year an average tax cut of about 394 000 so i put 150 up there a moment ago that was the generic millionaire the actual number is about 394 for the average millionaire per year on the average tax cut and also the tax breaks for big oil companies you know they get about 4 billion a year im talking about if you look at conoco exxonmobil and all the big oil companies they get about 4 billion a year now how much did you pay for gasoline im not saying that theyre not good people im not saying that they dont run a good business and supply an important product im just asking you this does exxonmobil really need your money through a tax subsidy do they i think that they dont need your money i think their 4 a gallon is taking care of them just fine and i think its outrageous that the republican budget that we dealt with does not eliminate that tax break in short the big oil companies who are gouging americans at the pump and the wealthiest americans win while middle class and working class families get the short end of the stick last year oil profitsand this is an exact number or close to it last year big oil profits totaled about 137 billion but you dont need to remember 137 billion all you need to remember is big oil profits were the biggest ever that the oil industry ever had and yet were forking it over to them through our tax money not through the pumps some people might think well of course were paying them keith through the pump they give us gas weve got to get to work so we need to buy the gas im not talking about that im saying they getthey can apply for grants and subsidies and it all adds up to about 4 billion a year with soaring gasoline prices big oils 2012 profits will even be bigger yet republicans want to give big oil more money in our tax dollars and it just doesnt make any sense now of course you shouldnt expect the big oil companies like exxonmobil to say we dont want the money of course they want the money who doesnt want money everybody does including them but the people who have a public responsibility to look out for the american people should be willing to say no to public subsidies for the exxonmobils of this world and again if you work for exxonmobil im not running you down im just saying that youre doing well enough and you dont need the help of the american people you can do fine on your own now those kids on head start need help they need help those college kids need help but not exxonmobil executives the major consequence for medicare and medicaid the ryan budget the republican budget has big consequences for medicaid and medicare many seniors will be forced to pay sharply higher premiums to stay in traditional medicare and keep their current choice of doctors new medicare beneficiaries would pay more than 1 200 more by 2030 and more than 6 000 by 2050 before more seniors would gradually shift to private health insurance plans over time increasing privatization of medicare more than 47 million americans would lose health care insurance over 10 years because they would get rid of obamacare now my friends in the republican aisle when they say obamacare they dont mean it in a nice way its an insult but you know what obama does care so i dont mind them saying obamacare i hope they keep saying it because theyre just reminding americans that obama cares about them and that the people the republicans want to look out for apparently do not states under the republican plan would be forced to slash medicaid eligibility benefits and payments to health care providers their budget shreds the medicaid safety net and shifts health care costs to states and beneficiaries blocking medicaid this shifts all risks including future recessions health care cost increases and disasters to states and beneficiaries so heres the thing this ryan budget this republican ryan budget it helps and takes care of the rich it ignores everyone else and it hurts the middle class the republican budget would weaken the middle class in important ways first and foremost their plan ends the medicare guarantee of decent health insurance in retirement it also slashes critical middle class investments such as education and infrastructure by 45 percent and 24 percent respectivelyeducation by 45 percent infrastructure by 24 percent now look the american society of civil engineers has told us that we have crumbling infrastructure in this country to the tune of about 2 2 to 3 trillion a lot of money and if you are living in any city across this country you can drive over 75yearold bridges you can drive over potholes our sewage systems need upgrade i am from minneapolis minnesota a city i love so much but back a few years ago we had a bridge fall into the mississippi river because the gusset plates which are those plates that hold up the bridge gave way because the adequate maintenance just wasnt maintained over time now it happened to us but it could happen anywhere there are many structurally deficient bridges across this nation literally thousands we could put people back to work if we put the money into taking care of them and not only would we have people working wed have to save bridges to go over but the republican majority to use their phrase kicks the can down the road and doesnt deal with this looming infrastructure crisis so let me just say this ive talked a little bit about the socalled ryan republican budget i dont want to spend all my time talking about it but i do think its important for americans to know that this is a budget for the 1 percent this is a budget for people whove got it well who are doing fine now let me just tell you i swear i am a big fan of welltodo people i wish i were one of them but my point is that you dont need to help people who already have a lot of help on their own but you do need to help schoolkids head start kids pregnant moms pregnant lowincome moms seniors these people we should help people who are doing fine they dont need our help they should do the helping in my opinion and yet the ryan budget says were just going to help the country club set and i think thats not any way to have a budget im going to talk about the progressive caucus budget but i just want you to know first that the ryan republican budget is no good budget for america in fact its premised on the theory that rich people dont have enough money and poor people have too much really thats the animating organizing feature of their budget that if we gave rich people more money then they might invest it in plant and equipment and then itll trickle down to the rest of us and poor people have too much stuff we cant afford it we cant afford head start cant afford wic cant afford home heating oil for seniors cant afford medicare cant afford medicaid the poor folks are just theyre getting treated too well and thats basically what the theory is of the republican budget and so thats fine and i respect them for being real honest about what they believe in because a budget is a reflection of our values so now that weve talked about what theyre talking about lets talk about a real budget not for the 1 percent but a budget for all the progressive caucus budget has a name the name of the progressive caucus budget is the budget for all thats the name of the progressive caucus budget because unlike the republicans budget which is a budget for the 1 percent this is a budget for all let me tell you what it does it creates 3 3 million jobs in the first 2 years it cuts the deficit by nearly 7 trillion 6 8 trillion no benefit cuts to medicare medicaid and social security the budget for all makes the american dream a reality again for the vast majority of americans by putting americans back to work the budget for all enhances our economic competitiveness by rebuilding the middle class and investing in innovation and education our budget protects medicare and medicaid social security invests in americas future and asks those who have benefited the most from our economy to pay their fair share now as i said you cant have a budgetyou can have a budget that cuts taxes for rich people if you then cut services for poor people and you can have a budget that pays for infrastructure and education but the money has to come from somewhere and we ask people who already have lots of it to do a little more for their fellow americans were not hiding that fact yes we would raise taxes on the wealthiest americans not to punish them because we dont think taxes are punishment but because its necessary to meet the needs of the nation and any selfrespecting patriot would do so if they could in fact there is a group out thereand i would urge you to check them out mr speakercalled patriotic millionaires who understand that they may need to pay higher taxes if you already are making a million dollars a year would you pay a little extra just to make sure that lowincome pregnant women got some food for their kids if you are already making a million or more a year would you pay a little extra to make sure that little kids had head start to go to if youre already making a million dollars a year would you pay a little extra just to make sure that the federal workers dont have their pensions cut to pay for your tax cut thats just my thinking i dont want anybody to think the republicans are mean they do charitable work in their individual lives and thats a fact and i think people ought to know that but they dont think government has any role in helping people i disagree with that and call on americans to look carefully at the choices that they offer the budget for all is not a budget for the 1 percent its not a budget for the 99 percent but a budget for all because we care about the 1 percent too we want even the 1 percent to live in a good nation with fairness with economic opportunity with economic mobility with good roads good bridges good education clean water clean air we want this for everyone the budget for all attacks americas persistently high unemployment levels with more than 2 4 trillion over 10 years in jobcreating investment this plan utilizes every tool at the governments disposal to get our economy moving again including directhire programs that create school improvement corps park improvement corps student jobs corps and others targeted tax incentives that spur clean energy manufacturing cuttingedge technological investment in the private sector widespread domestic investment including an infrastructure bank a 556 billion surface transportation unlike this thing that they tried to pass today which is a 3month extension by the way can you believe it the republican caucus is always going on and on about uncertainty what did they do they created uncertainty by passing some 3month transportation bill my goodness it boggles the mind actually back to the budget for all there is approximately 1 7 trillion in widespread domestic investment unlike the republican budget the budget for all substantially reduces the deficit and does so in a way that does not devastate what americans value we achieve these notable benchmarks by focusing on the true drivers of our deficit unsustainable tax policy wars overseas and the policies that helped cause the recent recession rather than putting the middle class and the social safety net on the chopping block the budget creates a fairer america it ends tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of americans on schedule at the years end extends tax relief for middle class households and the vast majority of americans creates new tax brackets for millionaires and billionaires in line with the buffett rule principle eliminates tax code preferential treatment for capital gains and dividends abolishes corporate welfare for oil gas and coal companies eliminates loopholes that allow businesses to dodge their true tax liability creates a publicly funded federal election system that gets corporate money out of politics for good it responsibly and expeditiously ends our military presence in afghanistan leaving america more secure at home and abroad it also adapts our military to address 21st century threats through modernization the department of defense will spend less and stop contributing to the deficit but they will have what they need to keep america strong which is very important to all of us it provides a makingworkpay tax credit for families struggling with high gas and food costs extends an earned income tax credit and child dependent care credit invests in programs to stave off further foreclosure invests in childrens education by increasing education training and social services the budget for all is a budget for all i know that sounds repetitive but its important to note that the name of our budget reflects the reality of our budget and the reality of our budget is that we want to see rich poor and everybody in the middle do well in america that means a budget for all as i begin to wind down i just want to say that it is an honor to come before you to talk about the budget for all but its also an honor to talk about the ryan republican budget because the ryan republican budget offers a very different vision of america than the budget for all the ryan vision says that if we just could get rich people more money they might create some plants and equipment that will hire the rest of us the budget for all says no were in this together and were going to ask the wealthiest to pay more to invest in health education transportation and infrastructure so that we can have a stronger better greater america two visions of a nation one says austerity for the middle and working class and the poor and one says investment one says if you are out of luck youre on your own and one says as americans were all in this together i want to thank you for allowing me to be here and offer these contrasts these choices for americans as we close out what i call budget week i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.9968327879905701, 0.9968327879905701, 0, "says that his children are old enough that they should be able to take care of themselves even though they are under 26 years old bravo for you but thats not the way it is for many young people across the country even if they do have a job you say they dont have insurance because they dont have a job it may be news to you but there are many many many working americans who do not have health insurance but they will under the affordable care act if this amendment were to pass if it were to become law immediately all of those children who can now be on their parents policy if their parents are willing would lose their health insurance with a job or without a job these young people coming out of school are idealistic and ambitious they want to follow their passions and their pursuits that is what our founders told them they could dolife liberty and pursuit of happiness these young people want a healthier life to pursue their happiness to choose a job not based on the health benefits it may or may not provide but to choose an occupation which addresses their aspirationsnot ours theirs so i just want to repeat back to our colleagues something i heard them say over and over again they said we didnt read the bill well we did but clearly you did not and i urge you to read the bill because if you did you would see that the bill puts medical decisions in the hands of patients and doctors not your favorite insurance company you would see that it brings down the cost of prescription drugs for seniors you would see that it ends the days of discrimination based on preexisting conditions and lifetime caps on the care of children and families you would see that under this bill no longer would being a woman be a preexisting medical condition as it is now as women are discriminated against in terms of price and access to insurance you would see that it offers tax credits to millions of small businesses who choose to do right by their employees and offer insurance benefits it was for all of these americans that we acted it is for them that we stand here today to oppose this amendment and if you read the bill you will see contrarycontrary to misrepresentations that were set forth by those who do the bidding of the health insurance industry in our country you would see what the bill does you would see that it is about innovation its about prevention its about a healthier america not just health care in america its about using the technologies of the future its about bringing health care closer to people where they live to lower the cost to improve the quality and to expand the access you would see that it is a bill about the future instead of the misrepresentations about this that and the other thing which i dont even want to repeat here you would see that this is transformative for our country because it gives people the liberty again to pursue their lives so i would like to know how many of you read the bill we read it over and over again to each other drilling down on different parts of it so we know of what we speak when we come to this floor and maybe if you knew more about it you wouldnt be so quick to saywe do not want to allow children to stay on their parents policies we do not want to end discrimination on the basis of preexisting conditions for our children we do not want to begin to close the doughnut hole we do not want to have preventive medicines without cost and copay for our seniors and the list goes on and on so thats whats happening here today this is again yet again another example of our friends standing up for the insurance companies at the expense of the american people standing up for the insurance companies at the expense of the health and wellbeing of our country it is again an example of washington d c holding on to the special interest status quo it is again this congress saying to the american people we are here for the special interest we are not here for the peoples interest to stacie we are not here for your two daughters for vernal we are not here for women and having being a woman being a preexisting condition to claudette and richard to say to them too bad about your mortgage if you cant pay your mortgage because you have to pay your medical bills so be it i urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment

for several months now in the energy and commerce committee and as weve heard from the bills supporters the bill is intended to address the boiler mact rule that was proposed by epa in april of 2010 and finalized in february of 2011 many of us here know that when the boiler mact regulation was finalized epa asked for 15 months to issue a reproposal the courts rejected that request and thus epa was forced to issue the rule on time in february of 2011 however epa immediately instituted an administrative stay on several major rules within the regulation saying that they would begin reconsideration with new information that had been made available in the last few months ive met with many industries and companies that expressed concern with the provisions in this final rule ive listened and even helped foster ongoing conversations between those industries and epa as they worked toward a reproposal of the boiler mact rule then we were offered this bill the epa regulatory relief act we were told that this bill would simply give epa the time that they had already asked for to work on the rule and repropose a new final rule after the conversations i had had with companies in my district i thought this would be a good solution the problem is when you dig a little deeper ive said for a long time this epa boiler mact rule is far from perfect but the trouble is the bill we have before us today is even further from perfect because it doesnt just give epa time to reconsider the rule it tells epa they cant issue a new rule for at least 15 months but theres no deadline for final action further it practically rewrites sections 112 and 129 of the clean air act by eliminating the need for numeric emission limits for mact standards but perhaps the most egregious to me was section 3 of the bill it once again rewrites the clean air act the clean air act provides for 3 years for compliance with mact standards with the possibility of a 4th section 3 of this bill tells us to throw that out it tells us that for the boiler mact rule compliance cannot be required for at least 5 years however it then says to the epa administrator it gives the administrator the ability to establish compliance dates so depending on who the administrator is at the time these rules are finalized compliance could be required in 5 years in 10 years in 50 years in 105 years thats just unacceptable and thats why im offering this amendment today i support many of the things in this bill and i recognize the need for a reproposal of this rule but i dont support 5 years to infinity for compliance and so this amendment will simply require that we go back to the established compliance time lines in the clean air act it even gives the possibility for an additional year of compliance if a compelling reason is found i urge my colleagues to support this amendment and make this a bill that we can all support when it comes for final passage i yield back

all if this were just talking about how we can reduce the deficit the best way to do that is job creation we know that if we want to talk about what happened in the nineties we have to reference the fact that under president bill clinton the reaganbush deficit that he inherited he turned around and five of his last budgets the clinton budgets were in balance or were in surplus he put us on a trajectory he and the growth of jobs in our country in the public and largely in the private sector took us to a path a trajectory of 5 6 trillion in surplus along comes president george w bush and in record time he reversed that it was the biggest fiscal turnaround in our nations history taking us to a trajectory of over 5 trillion in deficit an 11 trillion turnaround two unpaidfor wars said the cbo the nonpartisan congressional budget office that was because of two unpaidfor wars the bush tax cuts particularly at the high end which did not create jobs and a giveaway pharmaceutical bill to the pharmaceutical industry those were the three main reasons for the big fiscal turnaround and how we got deeply in debt i dont remember a lot of complaints coming from the republican side of the aisle while president bush was taking us down this path mr goodlatte referenced two paths well this is one path that president bush took us down so now we have to deal with that because the deficit is a concern to all of us we believe that the best way to deal with that is what president clinton did which was to have a great economic agenda to generate jobs yet here we are nearly 320 days into the republican majority and they have taken no action on any serious jobcreating bills here we go again debating legislation that will not create jobs in fact according to experts the enactment of this proposed amendment to our constitution would destroy 15 million jobs double the unemployment rate and cause the economy to shrink by 17 percent as bruce bartlett said recently former economic adviser to president ronald reagan and to president george herbert walker bush even if we were not in an economic crisis and fighting two wars a rapid cut in spending of that magnitude would unquestionably throw the economy into recession just as it did in 1937 this legislation is an attack on our economy and it is an attack on our seniors according to the nonpartisan center on budget and policy priorities it could result in cuts over 10 years of 750 billion to medicare and 1 2 trillion in cuts to social security these cuts would be devastating to the 40 million seniors who rely on medicare and social security every day they are even more draconian than the cuts in the republican budget which would effectively repeal the medicare guarantee and just one week after our nation celebrated veterans day we are debating potentially cutting 85 billion over the next 10 years from veterans benefits my colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim this is a clean balanced budget amendment it is not because this proposed amendment to our constitution will require a supermajority in both chambers of congress to raise the debt limit it puts the full faith and credit of the united states of america in the hands of a minoritythis after we went through all of the stress and strain and uncertainty and downgrading of our credit rating when we couldnt even get a majority and now were thinking of a supermajority vote for the debt limit increase again that was never a requirement when president bush was president that there would be a supermajority to raise the debt limit this amendment promotes further brinkmanship and uncertainty enshrining extreme ideology into the constitution at a time when americans have been very clear that they expect us to set differences aside and to get to work it is our duty as members of congressindeed we take the oath of officeto be the elected guardians of our constitution to protect and defend it and to do no harm to our founding documents yet if this proposed amendment is adopted it will have farreaching and adverse consequences i repeat that it was a democratic president president clinton who balanced the budget in the nineties five of his budgets were in balance or in surplus we can do it again without harming our constitution our economy our seniors or our veterans we must start by creating jobs and strengthening our economic growtha key to reducing the deficit it was interesting to me to hear others on the other side of the aisle talk about our children and our responsibility to them yes thats what we said when president bush was amassing his deficit but i didnt hear anyone on the other side of the aisle talking about that this is about our constitution we owe it to the vision of our founders to the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform and to the aspirations of our children to get our economic and fiscal houses in order this is the exact wrong way to do it we must reignite the american dream and we have work to do on that so lets get to work to create jobs so that many more people can achieve the american dream i urge my colleagues to vote no"], [0.9951502680778503, 0.9951502680778503, 0,

from massachusetts is in opposition but it shows that there are differences in the fisheries i guarantee you that the fishermen in my state would say this is not to circumvent the law this is a law that is now working in our state and highly successful this amendment would block the use of catch shares from managing our nations fisheries by superseding the regional fishery management council process set up by congress i live in the heart of a district where people have lost a tremendous amount of fish and are looking for ways to make sure that they have a fisheries industry to pass along to their children and grandchildren the sectors management system in maine has done that it has allowed innovative fishermen like members of the maine coast fishermens association to manage their small business in a way that works best for them in their own way of managing it by having an allocation and the flexibility to fish on their own schedulewhich i can tell you is far safer and far more profitablefishermen can enter into contracts with processors and avoid the race to fish improving their bottom line and their safety and its been proven over and over again some maine fishermen have even developed communitysupported fisheries coops which bring local fish to the tables of local consumers strengthening our communities while getting fishermen a better price for their catch it is critical for coastal communities and working waterfronts that fishermen are allowed to utilize the best management tools for their particular fishery catch shares may not be the best option for every fishery but that decision should be left to the industry the management experts and the scientists in their region where the fishery occurs in order to help our fishermen we should be focused on improving the stock assessments implementing cooperative research programs addressing monitoring challenges and ensuring fair enforcement this amendment would do none of these things instead it would take a critical management tool out of the toolbox to keep our fishermen on the water i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting fishermen by keeping all options available for wise fisheries management by opposing this amendment and sticking with the fishermen in the state of maine who have found this highly successfulfar more safe for the industry and much more profitable for them any other argument is just plain wrong"], [0.9950986504554749, 0.9950986504554749, 0, "as a staff person so he has a long history of knowledge of legislation in the congress said this was the worst transportation bill he had seen in his 35 years of public serviceand again this is a field in which he is an expert he said the bill loses jobs the bill republicans want to put forth h r 7 and it also diminishes safety that is not a formula for a good transportation billless safety fewer jobs losing jobs and so we have an opportunity to support a bipartisan bill that has come from the senate threequarters of the senate in a bipartisan way passed it out march 31 is the deadline when all of this will expire unless congress acts and congress is not acting because the republican majority does not have its act together their our way or the highway attitude means no highway bill that creates jobs and promotes public safety its really so sad because in the tradition of our country from the start from the very start thomas jefferson understood the need for building the infrastructure of america he tasked his secretary of the treasury gallatin to come up with a project that would expand into america the louisiana purchase and the lewis and clark expeditions and out of that initiative came the cumberland road the erie canal and other things like that over time and in that tradition the transcontinental railroad and the rest that would come later then in our century a republican president president eisenhower at a time of bad economic times bad economic times he went forward and took the initiative for the interstate highway initiative which was so important to our country it was a security issue to unite america it was a jobs initiative to build that interstate highway system and it was about promoting commerce connecting people and improving the quality of life it was a great initiative and it too was a bipartisan initiative in fact in the senate our friend senator gore vice president gore his father took the lead on that legislation the distinguished gentleman from tennessee as we heard earlier from the gentlemen from tennessee so this has all been a bipartisan initiative its about rebuilding america which is part of our reigniting the american dream to build ladders of opportunities so people who work hard play by the rules and take responsibility can have a ladder of success to climb and then put down for others to do and part of that is a make it in america so that people can make it in america and b and i get to this point build america build america build the infrastructure of america and that means everything from the highways with mass transit rapid transit highspeed rail and all kinds of technological infrastructure that we need with broadband and the rest it doesnt have any political or partisan cast to it at all it never hasuntil now and until now for reasons that are very hard to explain to the american people while we have a solution we have a challenge the authorization expires march 31 we have a bill that can be sent to the president in a matter of hours from this house of representatives this day and instead of smoothing the way the road to jobs we have the republicans putting up yet again another obstacle because they have not been able to get unity in their caucus on a bill that promotes commerce builds america promotes safety and creates jobs jobs jobs jobs so what are we doing wasting the publics time with a 60day extension i support the leadership of our ranking member mr rahall when he talks about why we have to do something better something more important something more worthy of the concerns of the american people than a parliamentary maneuver that isnt going to produce anything it doesnt even have anything attached to it that says lets do this now so that we can do something better later it has a bill that they cannot even pass on the house floor their own h r 7 if they could pass that they would their own caucus doesnt support what theyre putting forth so they expect the rest of us to cover for them well that is a real disservice to the american people it is a real disservice to the hundreds of thousands of construction workers who are out of work this job in its totality and the jobs it would save and the jobs it would create over 2 million jobs and yet instead of doing that we have a tactical maneuver for god knows what reason everything we do is about time its about time shortening the time in which people have to wait for jobs shortening the times in which people get to and from their jobs and its about time that we put the american people back to work by passing the biggest jobs bill that congress can ever pass and that is a transportation bill we have it right at our disposal mr bishop introduced it as h r 14 we brought it up earlier today and the republicans resoundingly voted against the senate bill and i understand it was a procedural vote now in a substantive vote why dont you bring that bill to the floor why dont you bring that bill to the floor and i ask the question again to my republican colleagues why dont you bring the bill to the floor that threequarters of the united states senate in a bipartisan way passed out we all want a longer bill this is the bill they can pass this is the bill we should pass so that the president can sign it into law anything else is just a conversation taking action taking the votes that is what the american people expect us to do so we can talk all we want what the american people want us to do is to act and

important one that i agree with and one that i would hope that our colleagues here in congress would take up this issue in a very strong and determined way to bring this afghanistan war to an end i thank the president for bringing the iraq war to an end and now theres yet another task for all of us to do and that is to end this continued use and abuse of the american soldiers they endure much and its time for us to bring them home we thank them for their service we see them as they return some of my colleagues and i are working on a major effort to try to deal with more than 365 000 of those men and women that have returned that are suffering from posttraumatic stress syndrome dealing with everything from suicides to depression and other issues as they return home and many of them still in the military dealing with those issues we also have the traumatic brain issues and so theres much to be done and there will be much more to be done for those that are currently suffering and the longer this war in afghanistan continues the more men and women will be suffering from all sorts of medical physical and mental issues so walter thank you so very much for what youre doing here on the floor day in and day out and reminding us that its time for us to end this war what i want to spend some time on today is really talking about americas middle class the middle class in america has suffered for the last 25 years the american middle classs circumstances have stagnated and in the last 5 yearsactually 6 yearshave seriously declined weve seen this in the statistics weve seen them in the economic statistics the only way the american middle class has been able to sustain its economic position has been for both husband and wife or children to join in providing the income for the family its no longer a singleperson income sustaining the american middle class it is about our policies here on the floor of congress and the senate that has led to the decline of the american middle class specific policies have been enacted over the last two decades that have hollowed out the opportunities that the american middle class has counted on specifically manufacturing in america once 20 million americans and their families were in the manufacturing sector they enjoyed a good salary a good hourly wage was available to them such that one individual in that family working in the manufacturing sector was able to support the family own a home take a vacation buy a boat provide for the college education that is not the case today only 11 million and a few thousand beyond that are actually engaged in manufacturing in america today so what happened to the 9 million they lost their jobs those jobs disappeared not from the earth but disappeared from america they went overseas they were outsourced american jobs were outsourced why well theyd like to say its simply the nature of the free market system and indeed thats part of it but thats not all of it a major part of it had to do with specific tax policies and other manufacturing industrial policies that were enacted by congress and remained on the books for some 20 years or more we need to address that issue because if in fact it is the policies of this congress and previous congresses that have led to the great outsourcing and decline of the american manufacturing sector and along with it the american middle class then theres something that we can do about it we make laws we establish policies and if we find that there are policies that are contrary to the good ability of the american economy to prosper and the middle class to prosper along with it then we ought to change those policies thats what the make it in america agenda is all about the make it in america agenda is specifically designed to rebuild the american manufacturing sector this is an issue thats been taken up by the democratic caucus led by our minority whip mr hoyer and carried on by my colleagues and i so were going to talk a little bit about that i notice that my colleague from new york has joined us mr tonko we were going to start out on health care but we kind of morphed into the issue of the american manufacturing industry and the role of the middle class now the middle class i went off on manufacturing and the need to rebuild that and the make it in america agenda but also a key part of the inability of the american middle class to sustain itself is health care and the affordable health care act which the supreme court recently confirmed was constitutional is constitutional is a major effort on the part of the democratic congress and president obama to provide not only health care but to lift up the american middle class so lets hold for a moment the issue of make it in america well come back to it in the latter half of this hour but lets take up the health care agenda which i know you wanted to speak to initially while youre doing that im going to run and get a couple of placards that show what it is
