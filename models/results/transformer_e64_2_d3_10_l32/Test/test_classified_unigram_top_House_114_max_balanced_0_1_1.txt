the searching for and cutting regulations that are unnecessarily burdensome act of 2016 or the scrub act this is a bipartisan measure that provides a fair and reasonable way to find and repeal outdated and inefficient regulations that are still on the books it doesnt target any particular type of regulation or industry but it prioritizes older expensive rules that are ripe for improvement or may no longer be necessary the needs of our economy small businesses and american families arent the same today as they were 15 or 20 years ago thus we should ensure that the rules governing the way we live and work reflect what is best for our country today not what agencies thought best decades ago i thank my colleague from missouri for introducing this bipartisan solution and his staff for their hard work on this measure if you put a piece of paper in the hand of every single person who lives in my hometown of gainesville georgia it still wouldnt equal the number of pages in the 2015 federal register in fact it comes in at a recordsetting 82 036 pages that means there were over 82 000 pages of new rules and regulations proposed just last year the code of federal regulations is 235 volumes long containing 175 000 pages of federal regulations knowing this it should come as no surprise that federal regulations impose an estimated burden of 1 86 trillion that is roughly 15 000 per unitedstates household and is higher than combined individual and corporate federal income taxes it is difficult to imagine a scenario where there is nothing in those thousands upon thousands of pages that cant be improved streamlined or retired unfortunately american businesses and families bear the burden of compliance even when a regulation is outdated ineffective or just plain unnecessary the scrub act is a commonsense step toward reducing unnecessary costs for families and businesses leading to more economic growth and job creation if you walked into a grocery store and found hundreds of expired and moldy food on the shelves you would be shocked you would be even more horrified if you were forced to purchase and eat them in the same way my constituents in northeast georgia and men and women all across this nation are appalled that we dont have an existing process in place to clear duplicative unnecessary or ineffective regulations off the pages of the code of federal regulations also this rule provides for consideration of h r 712 the sunshine for regulatory decrees and settlements act of 2015 this legislative package contains the text of h r 712 in title 1 h r 1759 the alert act in title ii and h r 690 providing accountability through transparency act of 2015 in title iii each of these measures were considered and marked up by the judiciary committee and are brought to the floor as reported by the committee americas small businesses and job creators need relief from the flood of new regulations and red tape from washington small business owners often cite government regulations as the single most important problem they face today a heavy contributor to the burden of new regulation is the use of consent decrees and settlement agreements to bind federal agencies to issue new rules regulators often cooperate with proregulatory organizations to advance their mutual agendas in this way the device agencies use is simple an organization that wants new regulations alleges that an agency has violated a duty to declare new rules the agency and the plaintiff work out a deal under the cover of litigation the deal puts the agency under judicially backed deadlines to issue the rules these deadlines often give the public little opportunity to comment on proposed rules and the white house limited ability to review them deals can even require agencies to propose specific regulatory language negotiated by the agency and its regulationfriendly plaintiff those who will be regulated by the new deal typically do not know about these deals until the plaintiffs complaints and the proposed decrees or settlements are filed in court by then it is too late frankly it is just also unfair regulated businesses and individuals are unlikely to be able to intervene in the litigation the court usually approves the deals before regulated parties have an opportunity to affect whether new regulatory costs will be imposed upon them these regulated parties could be families small businesses farmers ranchers or even local governments i introduced h r 712 to restore transparency public participation and judicial review protections to shine a light on one of the worst regulatory abuses in our system today these sue and settle agreements the sunshine for regulatory consent decrees and settlements act of 2015 puts an end to the abuse of this practice and ensures that those to be regulated have a fair opportunity to participate in the resolution of litigation that affects them the bill respects the basic rights of plaintiffs and defendants to manage litigation between them as a result the bill offers an effective and balanced remedy we must ensure more transparency and scrutiny of consent decrees and settlement agreements that require new regulations these commonsense reforms are needed to help control the tide of excessive and costly rules it is time we get rid of the welcome mat outside the door of regulatory agencies for these suits under which they can more easily issue expensive and controversial new regulationspolicies that oftentimes could never pass congressclaiming that the court made me do it again bypassing our constitutional system it is not a good idea h r 712 addresses the weaknesses in the current system while preserving consent decrees as an important mechanism for settling legal disputes it accomplishes this by increasing participation of affected regulated entities and coregulators in the negotiation in the consideration of decrees and settlements the ability of citizens to hold government accountable is an important part of administrative law but it must be appropriately carried out with transparency and full public participation importantly h r 712 puts an end to a practice that uses taxpayer dollars to allow special interests to abuse the system and force regulators to put out even more regulations title ii of h r 712 the alert act continues our work to relieve the regulatory burden on american families by requiring agencies to publicly provide information on planned regulations estimated compliance costs and other updates so that those impacted by the new regulations have the information they need to make financial decisions and plan for the future title iii of h r 712 the providing accountability through transparency act is another good governing measure that demonstrates this bodys commitment to making life better for all americans it requires agencies to publish a brief summary of each proposed regulation online and in plain language agencies do not have the right to conduct their business behind closed doors and hide behind an overly complex regulatory system every regulation impacts every american directly or indirectly and agencies should be held accountable for the regulations they produce and how they communicate the new requirements to those who will be forced to abide by them the rules committee met yesterday evening on these measures and heard testimony from the chairman and ranking member of the judiciary subcommittee on regulatory reform the chairman of oversight and government reform and the government operations subcommittee ranking member this combined rule makes every amendment submitted to the rules committee in order seven amendments to h r 712 will be debated on the house floor and 11 amendments to h r 1155 will be considered for h r 712 the rule provides 1 hour of general debate with 40 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the committee on the judiciary and 20 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the committee on oversight and government reform for h r 1155 this rule provides for 1 hour of general debate equally divided among and controlled by the chairs and ranking minority members of the committee on the judiciary and committee on oversight and government reform this rule and the underlying legislation represents regular order at its finest i am proud to see the leadership of chairman sessions and speaker ryan are reflected in this robust and open process i

that planned parenthood is harvesting and selling the body parts of little babies they have so repeatedly proven themselves blind to the dignity of humanity they have always been at the forefront of the greatest human genocide in human history and planned parenthood is the number one advocate of killing more than 3 000 little unborn american babies every day these recent revelations are just one more heartbreaking reminder that the nations largest abortion provider has always had a legendary disregard for the sanctity of innocent human life it beggars incredulity that this congress continues to give hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer moneyagainst the taxpayers wishes mr speakerto a heartless organization like planned parenthood that goes to such grotesque lengths to promote the killing of innocent unborn babies through abortion on demand at any time throughout the 9 months of pregnancy for any reason or for no reason this body recently passed the paincapable unborn child protection act that would except in rare circumstances protect both mothers and their little paincapable unborn babies entering their sixth month of gestation from the unspeakable cruelty of planned parenthood and evil monsters like kermit gosnell if the paincapable unborn child protection act had already been law it would have saved the lives of thousands of lateterm paincapable babies every year and it would have made it much harder for planned parenthood to harvest and sell the organs and body parts of unborn children since they simply would not have had as many of the more mature organs and body parts of the older babies to choose from there is no question whatsoever that planned parenthood brazenly and repeatedly violated the law in the selling of these little body parts it is an unspeakable disgrace that the obama justice department will likely never launch a criminal investigation to look into these unconscionable acts but if this congress and the american people now also look the other way and ignore this kind of insidious evil we do so at our moral peril if the conscience of this nation is to survive it is now vital for the paincapable unborn child protection act to become law the house has already passed this critically important and timely legislation it is now time for the senate to do the same we must not let the continuous and repeated manifestations of this unspeakable evil of killing lateterm paincapable babies and selling their body parts go unanswered supporters of abortion on demand have tried for decades to deny that unborn babies ever feel paineven those they say at the beginning of the sixth month of pregnancyas if somehow the ability to feel pain magically develops the very second the child is born almost every other civilized nation on this earth protects paincapable babies at this stage and at this age and every credible poll of the american people shows that they are overwhelmingly in favor of protecting these children yet we have given these little babies less legal protection from unnecessary pain and cruelty than the protection we have given farm animals under the federal humane slaughter act it is a tragedy that beggars expression the voices who have long hailed the merciless killing of these little ones as freedom of choice especially the ones who profit from it will be very shrill and loud but when we hear those voices we should all remember the words of president abraham lincoln when he said those who deny freedom to others deserve not for themselves and under a just god can not long retain it for the sake of all of those who founded and built this nation and dreamed of what america could someday be and for the sake of all those who since then have died in darkness so americans can walk in the light of freedom it is so very important that those of us who are privileged to be members of this congress pause from time to time and remind ourselves of why we are really all here do we still hold these truths to be selfevident mr lincoln called upon all of us to remember that magnificent declaration of independence by americas founding fathers and their enlightened belief that nothing stamped with the divine image and likeness was sent into the world to be trodden on and degraded and imbruted by its fellows he reminded those he called posteritythat is us mr speakerthat when in some distant future some man some factions some interest should set up the doctrine that some were not entitled to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that their posterity that is us might look up again to the declaration of independence and take courage to renew the battle which their fathers began thomas jefferson whose words marked the beginning of this nation said the care of human life and its happiness and not its destruction is the chief and only object of good government the phrase in the fifth amendment capsulizes our entire constitution it says no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law the 14th amendment says no state shall deny any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws protecting the lives of all americans and their constitutional rights especially those who cannot protect themselves is why we are really all here not long ago i heard barack obama speak very noble and poignant words that whether he realizes it or not apply so profoundly to this subject let me quote excerpted portions of his comments he said this is our first task caring for our children it is our first job if we dont get that right we dont get anything right that is how as a society we will be judged president obama asked are we really prepared to say that we are powerless in the face of such carnage that the politics are too hard are we prepared to say that such violence visited on our children year after year after year is somehow the price of freedom the president also said our journey is not complete until all our children are cared for and cherished and always safe from harm that is our generations task he said to make these words these rights these values of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness real for every american never have i so deeply agreed with any words ever spoken by president barack obama as those i have just quoted how i wish mr obama and the rest of us could somehow open our hearts and our ears to his incontrovertible words and ask ourselves in the core of our souls why these words that should apply to all children cannot include the most helpless and vulnerable of all children are there any children more vulnerable than little paincapable babies before they are even born it seems that somehow we are never quite so eloquent as when we decry the crimes of past generations but oh how we often become so staggeringly blind when it comes to facing and rejecting the worst of atrocities in our own time as americans in the land of the free and the home of brave we now live in a day when monsters like kermit gosnell snip the spinal cords of born babies and planned parenthood that for financial gain uses partialbirth abortions to deliberately harvest intact body parts of innocent babies whom they have deprived of the chance to even be born what we are doing to these little children the least of these our little brothers and sisters is real the president knows that and all of us here know that in our hearts medical science regarding the development of unborn babies beginning at the sixth month of pregnancy now demonstrates irrefutably that they do in fact experience pain many of them cry and scream as they are killed but because it is amniotic fluid going over the vocal cords instead of air we cant hear them it is the greatest human rights atrocity in the united states today and for us to now stand by and allow it all to continue unabated while planned parenthood sells the body parts of these little murdered children is to desecrate everything that america was meant to be and for those noble americans who died to make it come to be abraham lincoln gave his contemporaries such wise counsel and it so desperately applies to all of us in this moment he said fellow citizens we cannot escape history we of this congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves no personal significance or insignificance can spare one or another of us the fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the last generation these are indeed days that will be considered in the annals of history and i believe in the councils of eternity itself this bloody shadow has loomed over america for too long it is time for the senate to pass the paincapable unborn child protection act because in spite of all the political noise protecting little paincapable unborn children and their mothers is not a republican issue it is not a democrat issue it is a test of our basic humanity and who we are as a human family it is time to open our eyes and allow our consciences to catch up with our technology it is time for members of the united states congress to open our eyes and our souls and remember that protecting those who cannot protect themselves is why we are really all here it is time for all americans to open our eyes and our hearts to the humanity of these little unborn children of god and the inhumanity of what planned parenthood is doing to them i yield to the gentleman from california"], [0.003676176071166992, 0.996323823928833, 1, "first let me thank congresswoman kelly for those very generous remarks but also for your tremendous leadership and for staying the course and making sure that we are here really speaking truth to power each and every week on behalf of the black caucus also to you congressman don payne thank you very much for your leadership and for really rising to the occasion on so many issues in the very short time that you have been here you have hit the ground running and really have made a tremendous difference i want to just speak for a few minutes as it relates to the review of the congressional black caucus for the last year or 2 years i have to just say that our leader mr butterfield has been a very bold and tremendous leader we have accomplished quite a bit and we have a lot more to do while 2015 has been very challenging i believe that the congressional black caucus has really stepped up and made a huge difference not only for the african american community and communities of color but for the entire country it has also been an inspiring year we have seen the birth and growth of the vital black lives matter movement we have also witnessed powerful and moving protests across the country in places like missouri new york and even in my district in oakland and in berkeley california with people of all backgrounds and ages coming together to demand justice to petition their government to exercise their democratic rights i am so proud of the young activists who are standing up and demanding an end to racism and injustice in many of our communities they are truly bringing the civil rights movement into the 21st century i want them to know that they have allies here in the peoples house for too long congress has ignored or brushed aside issues affecting the african american community and other communities of color it is past time that everyone steps up and does the good work that we were sent to washington to do that the congressional black caucus has done for many many decades we need to start by talking about and looking at what has happened with the voting rights act as you know this year marks the 50th anniversary of this landmark legislation the voting rights act was gutted by the supreme court in its shelby v holder decision and of course republican state legislators have fallen all over to restrict voting rights across the country everywhere these dangerous restrictions come in the form of voter id requirements elimination of sameday voter registration and really severe reduction in early voting efforts we must call these efforts for what they are republican attempts to take away one of our most fundamental rights but we will not let this happen i am so proud of the congressional black caucuscongresswoman terri sewell and john lewis and mr clyburn the entire congressional black caucus our bill h r 2867 the voting rights advancement act sponsored by congresswoman sewell who represents selma alabama would restore the preclearance provisions of the voting rights act for any state that has had 15 or more voting rights violations in the last 25 years in the preclearance process as dr king once said give us the ballot and we will fill our legislative halls with menand of course womenwith goodwill we can fill this body with those who really want to see democracy fulfilled so we need our young people to keep up the street heat and demand that congress act it is past time that we get serious about restoring the voting rights act and ensuring that all americansand that means all americanshave free and unobstructed access to the ballot box also the serious economic disparities that persist in the african american community are very very evident according to a report released earlier this year by the joint economic committee led by ranking member congresswoman carolyn maloney and the congressional black caucus we learned and it is very glaring that more than one in three black children are born into poverty and the african american poverty rate is three times that of white americans the cycle of poverty and inequality starts in our school systems where black students account for 42 percent of preschool student expulsions despite accounting for only 18 percent of enrollment now that is preschool expulsion every time i remember this and say this it really makes me very terrified about what is taking place with young black kids especially with young black boys because there is no way anybody no kids should be expelled from preschool that is ages 1 to 4 that is outrageous i am the mother yes of two fabulous great black men and i am the grandmother of two black boys and i find statistics like that very very troubling for african americans we have allowed our school system to be turned into a pipeline to prison we must act now to address systemic issues facing our education and our criminal justice systems i want to applaud congressman bobby scott and congressman conyers because they have worked for decades on criminal justice reform and we are beginning to see some progress as a result of their very diligent work our criminal justice system is broken it needs to be rebuilt from the ground up so alongside of our cbc colleagues once again we are calling for comprehensive criminal justice reform also i want to mention our effort which i cochair with chairman butterfield our tech 2020 initiative silicon valley is right next to my district in california there are great opportunities there for everyone however the tech industry has not been inclusive of hiring and contracting with and working with communities of color especially the african american community so i am very pleased that the tech 2020 of the congressional black caucus has been initiated we are working with our great leader reverend jesse jackson with an insideoutside strategy many of the tech companies understand what is taking place and that they need to be an industry that is inclusive of everyone so the black caucus along with rainbow push along with the tech industry are working on a variety of strategies to make sure that this industry which provides goodpaying jobs and opportunities is an industry that is inclusive that does not discriminate and that includes the diversity of this great country so i have to just say to congresswoman kelly and congressman payne thank you for giving us a chance to talk about so many of the issues that we have been working on when you look at the issue of poverty cutting poverty in half in 10 years we know how to do it we have legislation the half in ten act h r 258 to do that and the pathways out of poverty act h r 2721 we know how to provide opportunities the congressional black caucus once again is leading on all of these fronts it is a big agenda but it is an agenda that makes our country stronger so thank you congresswoman kelly and thank you congressman payne for the chance to be with you tonight"], [0.0038610100746154785, 0.9961389899253845, 1, "first let me thank congresswoman robin kelly and congressman donald payne jr for hosting this important special order i appreciate your leadership in organizing this important discussion on the state of black health in america every april we observe national minority health awareness month this year is particularly significant as we mark 30 years since the groundbreaking health and human services task force on black and minority health report this report sparked the first serious discussion in washington on addressing the deep racial health disparities that exist in this country this year also marks 50 years since the creation of medicare and medicaidprograms that have kept and continue to keep americans healthy we are also celebrating the fifth year anniversary of the passage of the affordable care actthe most significant legislation to improve the health of all americans in more than a generation these legislative achievements continue moving us closer to health equity for allhowever major health disparities still exist the zip code in which you are born still determines your likely life expectancy gross disparities exist from zip code to zip codeeven within the same city or county so today i rise to join my colleagues in the congressional black caucus to bring to light the state of black health in america and call for more action to address persistent and lingering disparities in health access treatment and care since the passage of the affordable care act access to care has dramatically expanded in communities of color the uninsured rate has declined 7 3 percent in the african american community and more people have access to affordable quality healthcareall thanks to the affordable care act when we were crafting the affordable care act i had the privilege of serving as chair of the congressional black caucus and let me tell you we worked day and night with our colleagues in the congressional hispanic caucus and congressional asian pacific american caucus to push congress and the administration to craft the best possible bill since its passage the affordable care act has improved the american health care system healthcare is now more affordable and accessible than ever women can no longer be discriminated against because they are a woman have a preexisting conditionsuch as hiv aidsor have been the victim of domestic violence young people can stay on their parents health insurance until they are 26 and people with serious conditions like cancer no longer face the real fear of hitting their lifetime cap and being denied lifesaving treatment the aca also expands the capacity of the healthcare delivery system to better serve those at risk for and living with hiv aids these are the facts the affordable care act has dramatically increased access to preventative care for women lowincome communities and people of color despite rabblerousing and grandstanding from the right this law is saving livesevery day in communities across americafrom maine to my district in the east bay during the last enrollment period 16 4 million americans obtained health insurance and more than half a million came from my home state of california make no mistakethe affordable care act is working african americans and latinos historically underinsured or uninsured groups have seen the greatest declines in their uninsured rates this is especially good news for african americans who are living with hiv where the key to halting the epidemic is access to affordable and quality care with this increase in coverage we are beginning to close the gap in racial and ethnic health disparities and access to care however much work remains to truly realize health equity in america right nowin america the richest and most powerful country in the worldafrican americans still suffer from disproportionately high numbers of preventable deaths disparities in access to quality health care and underrepresentation within the medical community african americans have the highest mortality rate of any racial and ethnic group from cancer furthermore africanamericans are 40 more likely to die from a stroke than whites and 30 more likely to die from heart disease than whites and while african americans are only 13 of the unitedstates population they account for nearly half of all new hiv infections african americans also account for the highest hivrelated deaths and hiv death rates madam speakerthis is unacceptable in an age where technology and innovation are paving the way to new medical breakthroughs these persistent disparities in healthcare cannot be allowed to continue that is why today i urge my colleagues lets work together and commit ourselves to passing legislation that will end racial and ethnic disparities and achieve health equity the affordable care act was a good start but more is needed for years the congressional tricaucus has championed this effort by introducing the health equity and accountability act heaa congresswoman robin kelly will have the honor in introducing this important legislation this congress and i am proud to colead this effort as cochair of the capac health task force this important legislation builds on the affordable care act and puts us on track to eliminate health disparities in our country the health equity and accountability act would address incidences of terminal and chronic diseases that disproportionally affect communities of color including cancer diabetes heart disease and hiv aids so in recognition of national minority health awareness month i urge my colleagues to support this important bill in order to truly achieve health equity for all the state of black health in america is improving but much work remains before us as our drum major for justice dr king told us of all the forms of inequality injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane i urge my colleagues to join us in securing health equity for all"],

condolences to the families and the victims of the horrific terrorist attacks in paris lebanon nigeria and also in egypt know that we join in this quest for global peace and security throughout the world now tonights special order is an important part of our work to address the discrimination and racism that still plagues our nation specifically as it relates to african americans but we know that it impacts all communities of color it is manifested in many ways and it affects our entire country as congressman payne said so eloquently we are the united states so when one is affected all are affected all across the country at universities like mizzou and yale in places like baltimore and ferguson and in high schools like spring valley high in columbia south carolina we are witnessing the painful impact of institutional racism in our communities very recently we saw this in my home district at berkley high school in one of the most progressive and enlightened cities in the country black students were subjected to threatening messages on campus but i am so proud of the students at berkley they walked offit was not only black students it was all studentsand marched out peacefully through the city to protest these terrible despicable messages this is unacceptable all students have a right to learn free from violence and from threats as long as black students and any student of color feels unsafe in their classrooms our work for justice remains incomplete this crisis isnt limited to our schools tragically people of color face institutional racism from the moment they are born according to a report released earlier this year by the joint economic committee and the congressional black caucus more than one in three black children are born into poverty this cycle of poverty and inequality continues in our school system where black students account for 42 percent of preschool student expulsions mind you now that is preschool that is students from about 2 years old to 4 years old black students account for 42 percent of preschool student expulsions despite accounting for only 18 percent of enrollment i cant figure out how any student aged 2 to 4 is expelled from school that is outrageous yet 42 percent of preschool student expulsions are african american babies these kids dont even get a start let alone a head start outside of the classroom african americans are overpoliced overcriminalized and underemployed a report published by the new york times in april found that there are an estimated 1 5 million black men between the ages of 24 to 54 who are missing from civic life just missing it these missing men who account for one in every six black men have been victims of mass incarceration or premature death and this crisis of inequality extends to the structures of the community and have persisted from generations over the past four decades the average unemployment rate for blacks has been double the rate for white americans for many black families it feels like this is a permanent recession this must be our call to action that is why i am so proud of our young people throughout the country and students who are standing up to racism and injustice in their communities it is time for congress to listen to the young people saying that black lives matter and black students matter earlier this month i held a forum on racial justice in my district to address these issues more than 300 east bay residents from all backgrounds attended and raised their voices for justice this was the second forum that i have held throughout the last 3 months now i have been able to reach over 1 000 east bay residents so tonight in this dialogue which congressman payne and congresswoman kelly have talked about this dialogue leads to action hopefully our colleagues would think about hosting these types of forums and listen to what people are saying listen to what the impact of some of our policies are on their daily lives we must be part of the conversation and the solution but we must listen we must hear the pain and the suffering that people are experiencing as a result of discrimination and racial injustice now the congress must act to start addressing the systemic racism that degrades our institutions and threatens our communities it is past time for us to get serious about us addressing the lack of opportunity for black and minority families in this country right now today in this chamber there is legislation that can start moving the needle forward we need to empower our communities to build greater trust between law enforcement and communities of color and we need to address chronic recidivism which would be a huge step toward returning some of our missing men to their families and communities to do this congress should pass the safe justice act sponsored by congressman sensenbrenner and congressman scott congress should also pass the stop militarizing law enforcement act h r 1232 to stop the militarization of our nations police forces we also should pass the police accountability act h r 1102 and the grand jury reform act h r 429 so we can ensure that deadly force cases are heard by a judge and that there is more accountability for police officers as we reform our broken criminal justice system and work to help repair those families hurt by mass incarceration we will be strengthening america we will have people who really can make a contribution not only to their families and their communities but to the entire country the federal government shouldnt continue to put up barriers to work for those trying to rebuild their lives after making a mistake and should ban the box totally by federal contractors and by federal agencies we also need to repeal the lifetime ban on pell grants for those formerly incarcerated as it relates to drug felonies the ineligibility for public assistance and food stamps we need to remove these barriers so that people of color primarily african american men and latino men can get back into society get a job and take care of their families once again this is an example of public policy that racism wreaks its ugly head in our own institutions and policies finally we must address the poverty that plagues communities of color all across the country we have the whips task force on poverty income inequality and opportunity which i am proud to chair with our whip mr hoyer we are working with more than 100 of our colleagues now to advance policies that give all families including african american families living below the poverty line both in urban communities and in rural communities a fair shot this effort includes our half in ten act h r 258 which calls for a national strategy to cut poverty in half in the next decade that is more than 22 million americans lifted out of poverty into the middle class in just the next 10 years by being strategic and coordinating our existing programs our pathway out of poverty act h r 2721 would create goodpaying jobs it would lift families out of poverty into the middle class while strengthening our safety net for those who are still struggling ultimately the only way to end institutional racism is to give african americans and people of color a seat at the table and we need to pass legislation and policies that begin to remove these barriers my mentor the honorable congresswoman shirley chisholm used to say if they dont give you a seat at the table bring in a folding chair that is what our young people are doing around the country so i want to thank all of the people across our country who are bringing in folding chairs and ensuring that these important conversations happen we hear you we support you and we will keep fighting for you for ensuring liberty and justice for all which means just that it means for all in doing so we will make the united states a stronger country i thank congresswoman kelly and congressman payne for organizing this very important special order

the city is just 24 834 a year no one can raise a family on that many of these courageous and resilient families struggle to find highquality child care access healthcare services and afford healthy food and now the costs of this crisis are mounting for families the schools and the entire community we can and we must do more for our fellow americans in their time of need two years since this tragedy began families are still relying on bottled water for daily life imagine using bottled water for everything from brushing your teeth to making a bottle for a hungry baby we can do better by these families they need support including health care nutrition specialized education and developmental care and we need to fix the root of the problem the degraded dangerous pipes and infrastructure that caused this tragedy the shortsighted dangerous actions of michigan officials have already caused unimaginable pain for these families we cannot allow congress to betray these families as well let me just say that i was part of a congressional delegation that traveled to flint michigan to listen to the residents regarding the horrendous impact of these government decisions that led to the poisoning of those children and families the environmental injustice in flint is an example of how many lowincome communities of color throughout our country not just in flint throughout the united states an example of how they are treated differently than affluent communities congressman dan kildee and members of the michigan delegation have introduced legislation that would help these families rebuild their lives and get the care they need for their children the families of flint act h r 4479 is a comprehensive plan to address their most urgent needs it would provide for critical investment in flints water system to replace the lead pipes that poisoned these families this legislation would also provide essential support services to the families of flint to help these children mitigate and overcome lead exposure these are simple commonsense measures for the people of flint addressing this tragedy really shouldnt be a partisan issue every member of this chamber should understand the need for urgent action it could happen in any of our communities yet congressional republicans have not held one single vote or even a hearing on this bill that is just simply outrageous and let me just say that flint is not the only public health crisis that congressional republicans have ignored there are 17 000 americansincluding almost 1 600 pregnant womenwho have contracted the zika virus the president submitted an emergency request of 1 9 billion for zika funding more than 6 months ago and the republicans have failed to act on it now if we dont act soon the cdc will be out of money to combat zika in a matter of weeks congressional republicans also failed to do their job on gun violence every day more than 90 million people die from gun violence this too is a public health crisis but congressional republicans once again have refused to take up any commonsense gun legislation even though 91 percent of americans support background checks to keep guns out of the hands of

action by the congressional black caucus to eliminate racial health disparities i would like to thank my colleagues congressman hakeem jeffries and congresswoman joyce beatty for hosting this timely special order historically racial and ethnic minorities are likely to have the highest uninsured rates and are less likely to receive preventive and quality health care while the affordable care act has helped minorities afford health insurance and access quality care there is still a need to eliminate existing disparities for example the department of health and human services is currently working to expand access end racial and ethnic discrimination perform outreach to underserved communities improve workforce diversity and expand data collection and reporting while this is an ambitious plan it is one that is extremely necessary unfortunately coverage access and outreach may not be the only keys to eliminating disparities demographic characteristics contribute heavily to racial and ethnic health status for example research shows that privately insured african american and hispanic adults fare worse than privately insured white adults along measures to access and use of care unfortunately african americans and hispanics are less likely to have a regular provider than their white counterparts the same research also showed that privately insured african americans and hispanics had less confidence in their ability to pay for medical costs since social determinants like economic stability education and environment play such a large role in how we each view and access health care many of the changes necessary to eliminate racial and ethnic disparities require a much larger plan than just a focus on healthrelated programs reducing disparities in health truly entails addressing racial and ethnic social determinants such as availability of safe housing affordable food access to education job opportunities communitybased resources public safety public

ambulance and i was rushed to a hospital doctors did not expect me to live i did i was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy which was caused by a lack of oxygen to my brain while surviving the abortion i was never supposed to hold my head up or walk i do and cerebral palsy is a great gift to me gianna asked the committee if abortion is about womens rights then what were mine you continuously use the argument if the baby is disabled we need to terminate the pregnancy as if you can determine the quality of someones life is my life less valuable due to my cerebral palsy you have failed in your

leadership and drawing attention to this issue and for helping to bring attention to this story of injustice the story of the port chicago 50 isnt in most textbooks or histories of world war ii but perhaps it should be while it may not be this nations proudest moment it is a part of our history and it is a tragic event from which we can learn and we can actually grow i think as a nation the enlisted men stationed at the port chicago naval magazine including the port chicago 50 served our nation proudly and they served her honorably for that they deserve our gratitude for those unfamiliar with the story and i know it has already been talked about but i would like to talk about it very briefly again following a catastrophic cargo vessel explosion on july 17 1944 which killed or wounded 710 people several enlisted men voiced concerns about continuing to handle munitions at the port among those voicing concerns were two gentlemen from cincinnati ohio from the area that i am proud to serve mentor burns and edward lee longmire both men enlisted in 1943 they were not lifelong soldiers with extensive training they were ordinary patriotic americans doing their part to help in the war effort mr burns was a woodturner in a furniture factory before enlisting mr longmire worked as a sales clerk selling poultry nothing in their background prepared them for handling munitions and unfortunately the navy at that time did not provide adequate training for the men serving at port chicago so it is understandable that the men who survived the explosion were reluctant to continue loading munitions without efforts to make the process safer for that they were charged with mutiny reluctance and even refusal to return to unsafe conditions and procedures is not mutiny it is common sense america is the greatest country on the face of the globe but that doesnt mean we dont at times make mistakes and that is what happened here injustices like the mutiny convictions for the port chicago 50 certainly fall within that category however one of the things that makes america great is the freedom of the american people and the peoples elected representatives to speak out against injustices correct past wrongs and strive for a better future for all of us we cant go back in time and prevent the convictions of the port chicago 50 but we can correct the record and we can exonerate those wrongfully convicted and give their families and their loved ones the peace of knowing that they served our nation honorably and faithfully and that they did nothing wrong it is far past time that the port chicago 50 received justice we owe it to mr burns mr longmire and the rest of those wrongfully convicted and discharged we need to set the record straight i want to thank my colleagues for making it possible for us this evening to participate in this effort"]], "top_unsure": [[0.00017189979553222656, 0.4998281002044678, 1, "i obviously would work with the chairman on this

business practices is wellspent money everybody wants to keep everybody in the dark as to what is going on the american people have a sense of what is going on we have heard enough especially during this last campaign about the 1 percent and the 99 percent we have heard enough about how on wall street in my city of new york part of the problem was the lack of supervision by the fcc and by the sec and part of the problema large partwas the bonuses that these folks were getting a 50 million bonus in some cases and a 25 million bonus in some cases was not something unheard of so i think that every so often the american people need to know and get information that may seem like a waste of money to some people but actually can get at a problem we need to know in this capitalist society that we haveand we are not about to change that we all like it i like it i want to keep it but i think we have to try to look for ways to balance so that 99 percent of the people are not in danger of hurting while 1 percent of the folks are in great shape to find out that ceos sometimes get 400 times the salary of one of their workers is totally outrageous and the american people should know that and should knowespecially in the cases of stockholders too there are a lot of stockholders who are small stockholdersand they want to know what company they are investing in so i think that this rule
