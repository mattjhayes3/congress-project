those loud clear voices on behalf of limited federal government limited federal expenditures and i am proud that he has come out tonight to help us with this let me flush out what he was talking about in terms of increased federal receipts back in january of this year the cbo estimated that fiscal year 2005s tax receipts federal receipts would be about 2 045 trillion cbo is an organization that gets paid to try to estimate these things they generally do a really good job when we finished out the year i was looking at the same treasury report that my colleague made reference to awhile ago and for fiscal year 2005 which ended september 30 2005 receipts were 2 153 trillion over 100 billion more in federal tax receipts than we had estimated just 9 months previously so the numbers we have been talking about tonight the 50 billion in tax cuts the 56 billion and the impact extending the current tax law will have on tax revenues pale against over 108 to 109 billion of increased federal revenues that has come about as a result of the progrowth projob creation tax policy that was put in collectively in 2001 to 2003 in addition to that good news at the end of last week the gdp growth for the third quarter of calendar year 2005 was 4 3 percent that is a good growth rate on any economy a developing economy or whatever it is but let us make sure that we understand this is on the single largest economy in the world it grew 4 3 percent in the third quarter and that is staggering growth under any conclusion fl 2215 the unemployment rate was mentioned earlier as being as low as 5 percent that is full unemployment in reckoning of many economists and is certainly lower than the averages of unemployment of the previous 3 decades the decade of the 1970s which you remember we had a big depression then and as a result of a runup in oil and gas prices we had lower than in the 1980s when those of us in the oil business experienced a significant downturn in 1986 and later and then lower than the boom years of the 1990s when the unemployment rate was as low as anybody thought it would ever be the current unemployment rate is actually lower than that statistics are full of all kind of odd and important indexes that statisticians and economists use to try to make projections as to where the economy is going one of those that you do not hear a lot about is the consumer confidence index and that is supposed to be a measure of how consumers feel about themselves are they going to go spend money do they feel comfortable with their job and those kinds of things it jumped from an 85 2 percent rating in october to a 98 9 percent rating in november a 1month jump of over 13 points in consumer confidence what that tells us is that retailers for the christmas season ought to do very well one of my colleagues today said go try to find a parking spot in the mall these days and for all of the doom and gloom that is out there in the media it is not being reflected in americans going to the malls and working on christmas gifts and charity gifts for other folks that do not have it so the consumer confidence is up another statistic that gets talked about a little bit is that sales of new homes jumped 13 percent in october the largest 1 month percentage gain in 12 years and new singlefamily homes also climbed to an alltime record high of 1 42 million units more people again as we have said several times tonight more people owning a home in america than have ever owned a home now 1 month does not make a trend but continuing to talk about federal tax receipts and revenues the first month of fiscal year 2006 was the month of october of 2005 and during that first month federal tax receipts were about 149 billion and a year ago the equivalent month in october of fiscal 2005 which was october of 2004 federal tax receipts was 137 billion so a 12 billion gain in just 1 month against previous years months now you have got to be careful that may or may not be a trend but it is hard to say it is bad news thai the tax receipts for october of this year are greater than tax receipts for october of last year i think that is good news i would also like to point out a couple of tax provisions that are included in the extension that we will do later on this week that are important and one of those would continue the tax deduction for state and local sales taxes for states that do not have a state income tax states like yours and mine and my former colleague texas does not have a state income tax and so this provision would allow texans to deduct rather than the state income taxes to deduct state and local taxes which are used to fund many of the exact same programs that states who have income taxes use those taxes to provide goods and services to their citizens another deduction that is extended is the abovetheline deduction for higher education expenses now trying not to bore everyone with tax returnese or speak abovetheline deductions means that you get to detect that without having to itemize your deductions so higher education expenses the deduction for that is continued as well as an important expenditure for many teachers who find the school budgets do not provide some of the extras and maybe even sometimes some of the essentials that a teacher needs in providing a good classroom experience for her students teachers get to deduct their outofpocket expenses above the line which means they dont have to itemize deductions to get to deduct those personal expenses that the teacher may pay one that i came across tonight or an example of one i came across tonight is the tax incentive to revitalize the district of columbia included in the code of the past two tax cuts has been a 5 000 tax credit for anyone any new first time home purchaser here in the district of columbia well one of the folks on my staff who as you know staff are legendarily overworked and way underpaid one of the folks on my staff 2 years ago took advantage of this provision and bought his first home and has begun to build equity in that home over the past 2 years and would not have been able to do that were this tax provision not in place when you sell a home you have bought it from somebody who previously owned it hopefully and in all likelihood that person is going to go invest that money in another home so it is important that we have firsttime buyers to work into the market work into the housing market because as we stated earlier for many families the ownership of a home is the single largest asset that they have in their portfolio and this gentleman now has a home that he is paying a mortgage on of course but is building equity in that home building equity in his personal wealth and he is going to be better off as a result of having done that let me talk about something that we probably should have talked about right off the bat and that is the federal government does not grow this economy a lot of times the federal government gets a lot more credit for good economic news than it deserves and in all likelihood sometimes a lot more of the blame for bad economies than it deserves but the truth of the matter is a growing economy that we have right now is not created by a federal government it was created by hundreds of thousands of hard working americans employees who go to work every day and work for their employer to try to provide a good or a service that that employer can sell and make money on selfemployed individuals who have gone out there and taken the business risk of leaving that paycheck leaving the security of a check every 2 weeks to try to make it on their own those are the folks who are building this growing economy who are adding people to their payrolls who are hiring new people or setting up additional businesses to take advantage of opportunities that we are having in this growing economy so we cannot overstate the value of the hard working american in growing this economy but we do have some risks a lot of times of overstating the impact the federal government has in my view the role of the federal government is to get out of the way of these hardworking americans and let them continue to grow this economy pay their fair share of taxes of course but let us not do things that puts the government in the way of creating jobs gets in the way of furthering homeownership gets in the way of growing this economy and providing new opportunities for men and women in this country i participated in back in the early 1990s in a needs assessment for midland texas this was an attempt to survey on a statistically valid basis throughout midland county what were the needs of people within midland what were the needs of your family what were the needs in your neighborhood what were the needs within the overall community and we got all of this information together and began to sort them into like items and pared the list down to 10 so that we had in fact 10 top needs that the people in midland texas told us they were having in their homes their families their neighborhoods and the community and as you look down that list nine of those needs would have been positively impacted by a family that had a job it has been my experience that jobs cure an awful lot of ills within every community when families are working the family itself is better off communities are better off the strains on the social network that is the united way that is all those social charities that we have in place to create that safety net that is so vital in every single one of our communities is less strained when more people have jobs it is also better supported when more people have jobs so it is important that we give credit where credit is due with respect to this growing economy the gentleman from texas mentioned one of his or three actually of his constituents that are good examples of why these pro growth pro job creation tax policies are in effect now and that we ought to continue them in effect i want to talk about calvin fryar calvin is a good friend of mine from brownwood texas he and his partners own a company that distributes gasoline they also have convenience stores they hire people to work and he told me the other day at dinner that because we were talking about extension of these current tax cuts he said that the one that was the most important to him as a small business owner was the section 179 deduction section 179 provides for the immediate writeoff of certain equipment that is purchased by businesses and put into use each year and i think it is about 100 000 calvin told me that when that came into effect i think it was 2003 that it helped him make a decision to invest additional money into the businesses that he was trying to create and not only did he invest the amount of money that qualified him to immediately deduct that amount he also invested a lot of money on top of that and in doing so created jobs and not only did he create jobs for the people who built whatever it is he bought but he also created additional jobs for his company because he was expanding his opportunities within the gasoline distribution area as well as convenience stores so he was adding jobs to his business as a result of that one specific tax code that is expiring and under the tax law that we will pass hopefully pass on thursday will be continued another one of those that is very important and my colleagues earlier in the previous hour mentioned it and that is the tax rate on capital gains and dividends if you were to listen to the colleagues on the other side it is as if the federal government has some innate claim to some portion of your capital gains some portion of your dividends and i would argue that that is not logical where is it stated anywhere that the federal government has a claim on selling property that you have held selling property that you have invested in selling a business that you built from scratch why is it that the federal government has a claim to a certain amount of that and right now under the current tax law the federal government has a claim on 15 percent of that capital gain or 15 percent of those dividends that may or may not be correct it is the law of the land but certainly increasing that number you would have to answer the question is all right why does the federal government have a claim on or does it own in some way the capital gain that i get when i sell stocks and bonds or when i sell a business why is it that the other side believes that a higher tax rate on capital gains is somehow some right of the federal government that is not if we were to let those current tax provisions expire capital gains would get thrown back up to the previously high percentage rates everything is going to get thrown back in with ordinary income the taxable income rates and we will be right back into a circumstance where we are raising taxes the wrong way raising taxes by raising rates as opposed to raising taxes by having an economy that is growing at a staggering rate providing new jobs to workers in this country so i would argue against that as we close out this hour if you look at the reporting we are talking about the economy tonight and if you look at reporting of economic news it is i guess an attempt to be balanced balance is rarely neutral though you will hear somebody talk about well you know this economic statistic is looking up and looking better but if that path continues it will drive us into higher interest rates or if we have got increased job growth or jobs going to be created at too fast a rate then that is going to drive up inflation so it is rare that you ever have good economic news simply presented as good economic news and maybe we will never get to a point where that happens hopefully on the nights that we get to come in here and talk about the economy get to brag on the economy actually we will be able to help set the record straight as i mentioned earlier my good colleague mr hensarling has said often that we are all entitled to our own opinion but we are only entitled to one set of facts not our own set of facts just the set of facts as are out there hopefully we can be responsible for what we say in front of these microphones be held accountable for what we say the other side made a lot tonight about accountability and all those kinds of things i would argue that that same accountability ought to go to things that are said from behind these microphones if i have said something that is incorrect if i have made an insinuation or made some sort of a comment that was intended to mislead that i am called to account for that and i would hope the other side would ascribe to that same kind of philosophy that the folks in the chamber tonight who are listening to this debate or listening to these arguments not really debate since we are not going back and forth but listening to the three of us put out information that we believe is important for the american people to hear and to understandand to understand how we are coming to the conclusions that we are coming too that we be held to a very high standard of what we say and that we are able to back up each and everything that we do say with facts that are verifiable so i want to thank you tonight for being able to lead this hour and i want to thank my colleague from texas mr hensarling for his role in our talk tonight and i want to also thank my freshman colleague from georgia mr price for his helping nie out tonight as well so the message i would leave with the american people is this that we have got a growing economy we have got an economy that is well grounded and is going to sustain this growth but that what we do not need to do is to increase taxes tax rates on that economy but that we continue the pro growth pro job creation tax rates that have been in effect since 2001 and 2003 e 2230"], [0.0010472536087036133,

and republican budgets suffer from the same infirmities fiscal irresponsibility and selfserving and outoftouch priorities both are wholly inadequate to meet the needs of our nation and will pass along mounting deficits and debts to generations yet unborn first the 5year republican budget will result in a deficit of 376 billion in 2006 44 million over the presidents projection the republicans budget proposal also has many cost omissions because they know that their deficit numbers explode after 5 years as such this budget does not take into account the cost of fixing the amt which will cost at least 642 billion it does not take into account the 774 billion needed to pay for the presidents muchtalked about but yet unveiled social security privatization plan i suppose the republican budget proposal deserves a little credit for hiking its deficit projection as it at least includes 50 million in 2006 for the wars in afghanistan and in iraq the presidents budget proposal contained zero dollars as a matter of fact it reported that the costs could not be known however both figures are fantasy the realistic figure over the next 10 years in addition to the 80 billion that we just passed in the supplemental is likely to be 384 billion to pay for its misguided policies the house budget resolution cuts nondefense discretionary spending by 12 billion below the amount needed in fiscal 2006 just to maintain current spending levels and it cuts spending on mandatory domestic programs by 8 billion to add insult to injury the republican budget provides 18 billion in additional tax cuts these misguided tax cuts will actually cost much more when the tax cuts actually expire in 2010 in fact 97 percent of these tax cuts will benefit taxpayers with incomes above 200 000 i think most reasonable people can agree that these priorities are not americas priorities while little good can be said about the bush administrations budget it at least provides detailed information on the programs it seeks to cut the house resolution shrouds its cuts in darkness leaving the american people to wonder what vital programs will find their way to the ch6ppinig block next both the republican and bush budget proposals are travesties when the bush administration took office the nation was experiencing record surpluses it has managed to turn a 521 billion surplus into a 367 billion deficit in contrast the spratt alternative budget as well as the congressional black caucus alternative budget that we will consider tomorrow focus national spending on priorities that benefit all americans and get us on the road to economic recovery they do this by funding key domestic priorities which address the needs of working families while fully supporting the national defense and protection of our homeland and preserving medicaid social security pension programs and student loans let me speak particularly about the budget developed by the congressional black caucus which corrects the irresponsible fiscal and economic policies contained in the house budget resolution by supporting existing programs that are essential to closing disparities creating opportunities and helping our citizens build their future it will get our country on the road to recovery while funding meaningful national priorities for our children for our seniors for our veterans and for our communities importantly the congressional black caucus budget supports these priorities while also meeting our obligation to our troops in iraq and in afghanistan the cbc budget funds community development programs including restoring funding to the community development block grant program and supporting increased funding for elderly and disabled housing programs the congressional black caucus budget will also restore funding for veterans health care rather than imposing new copayments on them for essential services and prescription drugs importantly the congressional black caucus budget will reduce the budget deficit by 167 billion during the next 5 years below the deficit that will be produced by the house budget resolution theirepublican budget cuts educational housing and health programs for our children while bequeathing to them a public debt that has increased by 1 268 trillion over the last 4 years and that will exceed 4 6 trillion even before we begin fiscal year these actions are not only irresponsible they are unconscionable in the end one can only conclude that the republican budget balances itself on the backs of americans who can least afford it i urge the administration to reconsider its illconceived economic policies the congressional black caucus budget is the ultimate expression of our national priorities and our priorities must be our children our families our elderly and our veterans and of course our soldiers"], [0.0010499358177185059, 0.9989500641822815, 1, "i just want to make sure mr ryan that the american people understand what is happening in the present wedo not even have to go as far back as what happened 4 or 5 years ago or what happened 2 years ago we just have to talk about what is happening right now once again this president could not do it by himself needed the partisan vote in this chamber on the republican side to accomplish 1 05 trillion in borrowing from foreign na tions knocking on the door of china saying can you help us because we are fiscally irresponsible that is what the debt ceiling letter comes from we did not write this letter democrats did not set this letter into motion it was the republican policies in this republican house that set this policy into motion raising the debt ceiling not paying as we go this is not the responsibility of the minority on the democratic side it is the majority i want to make sure because we need to break this thing down in 1 2 3 a b c so that no one can go back home and tell their constituents well you know you have got a point there but i did not quite catch that and i did not know that we have borrowed 1 05 trillion more than 42 presidents before this president 42 other administrators before this president 1 05 trillion that other presidents and administrations and congresses have borrowed from foreign nations in 224 years folks say well you all act like you are alarmed by this we are alarmed the american people should be alarmed republicans and democrats it is almost like saying if you had your daughter or son that you gave a credit card to and they went out and they just charged that credit card up as a matter of fact they charged it to the point that it is at the limit let us say they had a 2 500 limit on it what the republican congress is doing now is that they are going even though they are maxed out they are calling the credit card company that happens to be china that happens to be saudi arabia that happens to be other countries of interest as it relates to the defense of this country saying we have maxed out right now we need your help to pay our bills and then at the same time as i continue to go to c here through the abcs they are saying this on one side but on the other side they are saying hey make the tax cuts permanent make them permanent for the most wellfinanced americans for the top tier of the individuals that are making 2 and 3 million a year on this side of the debate they are saying it is okay togive not only royalties but other benefits and tax breaks to the oil industry while they are making record profits they are saying that it is okay but then here in the middle are the american people and the american people are having to suck it up mr ryan the american people who want to educate themselves parents who want to see their children educated if you have a prepaid college program you better revisit that program because it will not assist your child or your son or your daughter in paying for their college because we will just yank the carpet out from under young people and the republican majority did we voted against it the democrats voted against it so if we are going to have a paradigm shift and i am hoping that we put the pressure on the republican majority that we are here to play we mean business we are very serious about having the opportunity to give this country what it deserves and that means representation representation for them and not the special interests i speak all of the time abotlt i do not have a picture of the special interests in my office saying i really dislike the special interests i really dislike individuals that are paid lobbyists i really dislike them no no it is not them it is the individuals that allow the raw needs of those special interests to make it into statutory language it is those individuals that appropriate in those areas where it gets into the appropriations act and into the budget just the way they wrote it without saying you know i know you have a concern i know you have an issue and you have needs but we have to make sure that the american people are represented in this budget we have to make sure that the american people are represented in this bill we have to make sure that the future of this country as it relates to innovation plays a major role in what we do here and that is where we are lacking so you know mr ryan as we go on and many members will return back to their districts and speak to individuals that live there we challenge those americans to challenge your member of congress it is almost too late for us to wait until election day for you to speak the way you want to speak but you have the opportunity i tell you give the republican majority the benefit of the doubt that they are going to take a paradigm shift but i am going to let you know right now the evidence does not speak to a paradigm shift or a change in thinking or their ways so i say mr ryan that yes we do have a couple of friends over here on this side of the aisle that believe what we believe and it will be those individuals those very few that will join in with a democratic leadership if the american people see fit to have it so that will allow us to move in a bipartisan way and it will not be like it is now and it will not be business as usual and it will not be well i dont care if you do not like it"], [0.0010851578554138541, 0.0010851578554138541, 0, "i rise in support of increased exploration drilling and production of natural gas off our intercontinental shelf this is an important issue for all of th country but especially true among ms 3 farmers and ranchers in kansas i am one who supports renewable fuels and ethanol and soy diesel pro 1 vide a great opportunity for economi u opportunity in kansas fot kansa farmers and for american agricultur f and for our country we must becom u much more independent from the en s ergy sources abroad but for our farmers and ranchers to remain in business to survive into the future they have got to have access to natural gas and at prices that are affordable natural gas is the primary feed stock the ingredient for the production of many agricultural components but especially for nitrogen fertilizer that is so important and if we are going to produce ethanol in this country if we are going to produce soy diesel we are going to have to have the fertilizer at an affordable price that will allow our farmers to raise the corn and grain sorghum to produce the ethanol to raise the soy beans to produce the soy diesel our farmers are struggling across the country input costs are dramatically on the rise nearly 40 percent of the nitrogen capacity fertilizer capacity has been shut down in this country since 1999 six years ago approximately 15 percent of our fertilizer needs were met in the united states from abroad today 50 percent is imported prices have increased dramatically 250 a ton for nitrogen fertilizer in 2002 today 416 one of my farmers who farms in southwest kansas 30 years ago when he started farming natural gas was 19 cents today it is 9 we are seeing double triple and even fourfold prices that donny young talks about in trying to stay in business with these increasing input costs while the price of corn has stayed the same we in the united states need to become independent if we are going to produce the ethanol and it is important that we remember that natural gas is necessary to make that nitrogen fertilizer i encourage the adoption of this proposal a vote for h r 4761 is a vote for agriculture agricultures ability to produce an affordable food supply will continue to face huge obstacles if our nation does not come to grips with its desire to have limitless resources like natural gas for production and not realize that these resources have to come from somewhere our natural gas crisis has two solutionsincrease supply and reduce demand h r 4761 addresses one aspect of this crisis as it will increase the supply of natural gas from the outer continental shelf this additional supply will do two things it will send a strong signal to natural gas markets and could increase the elasticity in north american natural gas markets it indicates to these futures markets that the united states is committed to lifting the moratoria in the outer continental shelf to provide consumers with an additional supply of natural gas this message should ease the volatility in natural gas prices that all of us have seen since 1999 and the additional supply should help ease the natural gas prices over time why does agriculture care so much about this natural gas crisis simply put agriculture is a very large consumer of natural gas farm3 ers use significant amounts of natural gas for food processing irrigation crop drying heating farm buildings and homes and for the pro duction of crop protection chemicals and nitrogen fertilizers natural gas is the primary feedstock in the production of virtually all commercial nitrogen fertilizers manufactured in the untied states natural gas is not just an energy source it is the raw material for producing the fertilizer today in the case of the nitrogen fertilizer anhydrous ammonia natural gas accounts for over 90 percent of the total cash cost of production just like kansas wheat and wisconsin milk fertilizer is a commodity bought and sold worldwide and subject to basic global supply and demand economic principles as the unitedstates domestic nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing sector declines due to high natural gas prices kansas farmers and other unitedstates food producers will be subject to global supply demand forces on the fertilizer products they buy even more so than today the climb in natural gas prices since 2q00 has forced unitedstates fertilizer production costs to unprecedented levels over this period of high prices and intense volatility the unitedstates fertilizer industry began to shut down production nearly 40 percent of the industrys nitrogen capacity permanently shut down between 1999 and today this has and will continue to make unitedstates farmers dependent on offshore production from the major suppliers such as saudi arabia venezuela and russia this rise in natural gas prices and the permanent closure of so much unitedstates fertilizer production has dramatically impacted fertilizer prices throughout the marketing chain and in particular at the farm level according to usda unitedstates prices to farmers for ammonia climbed from 250 per ton in 2002 to 416 per ton in 2005 that is almost a doubling of the price of ammonia to farmers this continued loss of production from the unitedstates nitrogen fertilizer industry would force farmers to rely on a highly uncertain and highly volatile world market with no assurance that they will be able to obtain enough product to meet their full demand this is particularly important when considering the importance of nitrogen to farmers thirty to 50 percent of corn yields are directly attributed to nitrogen fertilizer passing h r 4761 represents a direct positive action to increase our nations domestic natural gas supply to help relieve the high prices pressuring american farmers fertilizer producers and homeowners allowing exploration and development of the outer continental shelf is an essential commitment that our nation must make these natural resources belong to all americans and should be developed for the benefit

me to spend some time this evening talking about an issue that is of utmost importance to the american people i am constantly amazed at news reports at home when i go home and i watch television news and i read the newspaper and see what is being portrayed as usual for the american public if you just followed those stories you would not believe that there was anything that was good or positive going on in our nation you would not believe that the economy for example was doing very very well so one of the things that i try to do and i know others try to do as well is to try to assist and bring about some truth in reporting so tonight what we would like to do is spend a little time talking about the economy for the american people know better than what they see on the nightly news and what they read in the newspapers in fact so many of the folks that i talk to at home are really tired of the gloom and doom that gets reported on the news and frankly gets stated over and over and over here in congress by some members they are tired of congressmen and women who put politics and partisanship over good policy and i hear so often back home that folks say why cant you just get something done on behalf of the american people well a lot of good things are getting done and we are going to spend a little time tonight talking about our economy and some things that congress is doing and has done to assist the american people to help american families to help american children to help american communities it is important that we do that because there is good news to tell so what we would like to do is spend a little time tonight and review so many of the positive things that have been done to create really an economy that is on the move i would like to begin by just sharing a number of different charts that demonstrate clearly that the economy is growing this is a chart here that i think really crystallizes so many of the good stories that we have to tell this chart begins in the first quarter of 2001 and along this axis here is the annual change in gdp or gross domestic product that is how well is the economy doing as you see for the first number of quarters of 2001 and 2002 it is kind of going along kind of bumping up and down and then there is a remarkable change that occurs in early 2003 from then on from the second quarter of 2003 on what we see is a gross domestic product growth in every quarter 10 quarters in a row of a growth of greater than 3 percent and oftentimes greater than 4 percent in faqt the most recent quarter grew at a rate of 4 3 percent the individual who wants to know how to continue that kind of growth and who is excited about policies that encourage growth would say well what happened what happened at that point to bring that kind of growth about as most people know what happened was that the tax cuts the tax relief that congress enacted on behalf of the hardworking american taxpayers went into effect and that has resulted in this incredible incredible growth in the economy that continues that continues unabated and what congress has an opportunity to do this week is to continue and extend that tax relief hopefully to be able to continue the lines that we have seen grow in the economy this is another chart that demonstrates the kind of response that the american economy has to that kind of activity this talks about the creation of new jobs in our country in fact since the spring of 2003 there have been 4 46 million new jobs that have come about and this chart shows the percent increase each month from early 2002 through the current time you see again there is that remarkable change that occurs in the early part and midparet of 2003 where the growth in the number of jobs is remarkable again the inquiring individual would want to know well what changed there what made it so that we did not have negative growth in jobs we had positive growth in jobs as everybody well knows now that change was the tax relief the tax relief that congress enacted that took place in early 2003 just to put those numbers all together this chart which is a little busy shows two very clearly distinct lines one is the green line down here that is the number of jobs that increase in our nation each month the red line is the level of unemployment and as you see at the beginning of 2003 the unemployment rate was taken up here somewhere around 6 percent and the number of jobs began to increase at this point when the tax relief package went into effect we see that continued increase and in fact right now the unemployment rate is down at 5 percent which is lower than the average for the decades of the 1970s and the 1980s and the 1990s some economists will tell you that 5 percent unemployment rate is full employment because you have got a number of folks who are between jobs or are working to find other places of employment that is their design so 5 percent is basically full employment the number of new jobs that was created last month 215 000 new jobs so there is good news to tell i have been joined tonight by many of my colleagues and many of them will share some of the same kinds of goodnews stories with you first i would like to yield the time to congresswoman blackburn from tennessee she has been such an incredible leader in this congress in the area of tax relief and in making certain that we enact the kinds of policies here that result in smaller government lower taxes and more opportunity for americans with that let me yield to congresswoman blackburn"], [0.0011150240898132324, 0.9988849759101868, 1, "it is an honor to come before the house we would like to thank not only democratic leader ms pelosi but the entire democratic leadership mr hoyer mr menendez and mr clyburn our vice chair of the democratic caucus as you know the 30something working group comes to the floor to share not only with members but also with the american people about what is happening good here in the capitol and also what is happening bad here in the capitol and hopefully through a bipartisan effort we can move towards positive change here in the capitol it saddens me to report the fact that this congress need it be whatever poll you look at the american people by 33 percent think that we are doing a good job thirtythree percent of the american people feel that this congress is doing a good job i would tell you that if it was a grade system i would assume that and members i would assume that that would be a failing grade i have two children that attend school and if their grades were based on a 33 percent performance i do not think that they would be moving to the next grade and i think it is important members of congress as we start to look at our responsibilities to the american people not just to our constituents in our districts but to the american people because by them sending us to congress they federalized us to come up here and run this country in the way that it should be i also want to remind the members that this is the peoples house it is not my house it is not mr ryans house it is not ms wasserman schultzs house all due respect it is not your house it is the peoples house in the senate i must add and we must let all of the members we must remind them in the senate someone can be appointed to the senate of course they have elections but in a time let us just say like in new jersey the governor of new jersey the new governor of new jersey has the opportunity who was a unitedstates senator to appoint someone to be the new unitedstates senator from the state of new jersey but in the house with a seat being vacated let us just say someone from new jersey is appointed to be the senator he cannot appoint someone here to the house of representatives he would have to set a special election for that seat to be filled constitutionally so this is the peoples house and so when we start talking about the people of the united states of america we are closer to them than any other i think than any other branch of government i would like to say that on the heels of president bushs speech today on iraqs economy i could not help and mr ryan and i just returned from iraq we visited three cities in iraq and we went to the infamous green zone and baghdad visiting our troops many of them were members of the army soldiers some on their third deployment to iraq i could not help but pay attention and i got a copy of the presidents h11199 speech and he released a 35page 32 pages if you look at glossy cover and all 35 pages of his strategy for victory there in iraq but he talked about the economy today in iraq but i cannot help but say and to the members that it would have been good if the president could have talked about our unitedstates economy i think the reason why he did not talk about the unitedstates economy is the fact that we have record deficits some 3 5 trillion over the next 10 years deficits that is not the kendrick meek report that is not the tim ryan report that is not the congresswoman debbie wasserman schultz report that is reality we are recordbreaking as it relates to borrowing money members from foreign countries this president along with this republican majority here in the house and in the senate has achieved 4 5 trillion in borrowing money from foreign nations more than 42 presidents before him they were only able to among all of those presidents i mean all of them i am talking about since we became a country 4 1 trillion that have been achieved and i want to correct myself i am sorry i have so many numbers here i want to correct myself i am glad mr ryan brought this over 1 05 trillion by this president i said four and i will correct myself right now because in the 30something working group we believe in thirdparty validators and sharing with the american people and the members the truth about what is happening here in the capitol so maybe 4 05 might have sounded a little better but we believe in making sure that we give good information 1 05 trillion this president the last 4 years 2001 to 2005 and he is not done yet 1 01 trillion 42 presidents in the history of this country republican democrat and in their lifetime for some of them very early on were members of the whig party from 1776 to 2000 224 years and this is from the unitedstates department of treasury this is not from the national democratic party or anything like that we just want to make sure mr ryan that we have our thirdparty validators here maybe the president mr ryan could have talked abouit the fact that health care costs increased over 60 percent for small businesses over the last 5 years major companies are cutting jobs and not only their pension plan that they promised but they are following our lead here under this republican majority mr ryan by the fact that we are not only increasing copayments and the wait for our veterans once they leave the military they are following our lead companies like gm delphi merck verizon and now ford are now reprioritizing that means cutting jobs that means cutting back on promises that they promised their employees from the beginning the average family right now in the united states as relates to natural gas are paying three times more than they paid in 2001 the president could have talked about that but he did not he wanted to talk about iraq because he needs to explain himself republican majority they need to explain themselves sixty percent of americans if we like it or not do not believe that our leadership as relates to leading our effort in iraq has a sound plan in getting us out of there so we are going to talk about some of these things tonight we are going to also talk about this ongoing culture of corruption andc cronyism and incompetence this is not the kendrick meek report this is just todays papers this is just today that is outlining a culture of corruption and cronyism and incompetence so when historians look back on the 109th congress and the contributions that we made they are also going to look at the void in leadership and leading this country in the way that they should lead we used to give speeches here on the floor mr ryan and you know full well about putting burden on future generations fl 2015 well i can tell the members right now and this is not me speaking they can check with any of the federal agencies that do the reports or the auditor generals that put out reports on an annual basis we are putting this generation in the present in jeopardy so i am so glad that we have the opportunity tonight to come to the floor and i am so glad that the gentleman from ohio is here and i am glad that we have a level of consistency for the american people to come to the floor and share this information i yield to the gentleman from ohio"], [0.0011282563209533691, 0.9988717436790466, 1, "catholics have a sacrament the sacrament of penance which they call reconciliation it is a time when you revisit your own life to take a close look at how your daily actions square with what you believe as a catholic looking at this budget i cannot square the moral values of our country opportunity equality and justice with the practical impact that this budget proposal will have on the lives of working american families this year thanks to president bushs taxcutting progtam the unitedstates government will deliver up to 106 billion to the multiple bank accounts of some of the wealthiest americans this government program to help wealthy americans spend more money now forces a false crunch on our resources a 50 billion cut that republicans believe should come from medicaid food stamps and student loans who will feel the impact of these cuts well almost 60percent of all people in nursing homes who are on medicaid and onethird of all babies who are born on medicaid and 8 million americans with disabilities who depend on medicaid and 36 million americans who have to worry about going hungry how do we as a congress reconcile the fact that these cuts will disproportionately affect lowincome americans the elderly and the poor the answer is we should not reconcile ourselves to such an action not for 1 minute not for a nanosecond if we are going to dramatically change for the worse the lives of millions of children and families and senior citizens across the country it had better be because we had to not because we chose to and there is no doubt that republicans have now chosen to rob the poor to maintain and create new tax breaks for the rich we are not simply robbing the poor of resources the proposedcuts are robbing the poor of opportunity the reconciliation budget targets programs that work to bridge the gap between rich and poor medicaid food stamps and student loans that strive to even the playing field for all american families eight weeks ago across the united states americans saw the faces of other americans staring up at them from television screens scratching out desperate signs on rooftops help us the signs said grandmothers brothers nieces nephews newborns the faces of families who could be our families neighbors who could be our neighbors but desperate alone and calling out to the world to see across the country americans answered with one voice we are better than this this is wrong this is immoral this must not be allowed to continue we must take care of our own it is our responsibility it is our duty it is who we are as a people as a country we saw that 100 000 people were trapped in new orleans because they did not have automobiles to escape the flood waters we found that 50 percent of all children in louisiana live in poverty in response to this national revelation republicans have revisited our national budget and made a decision to cut programs from the poorest of the poor while protecting a new tax cut giveaway to the richest of the rich instead of limiting these tax cuts to millionaires the republicans have decided to rebuild new orleans on the backs of the poorest people from the rest of the country this is a moral question not a budget matter the repjiblicans are building the high levees around their threatened tax cuts while letting the flood swamp the programs that matter for the rest of americans this is what the debate is really all about it is about our values as a nation and how they are reflected in how we govern how america should treat its neighbors our fellow americans who by an accident of birth came into this world unable to see or who were born into a family without the means to put food on the table or who had the misfortune to develop alzheimers should we let them starve should we tell their children they will never go to college because their parents cannot pay the tuition shall we turn them away from the hospitals because they cannot afford the care and do not have the insurance or should we as a country decide that in this land of plenty no one should go without basic human dignity as a catholic i was brought up to believe that character is judged by how we treat the least amongst us this budget does not pass that test and my hope is that tomorrow we as a congress will rise up to defeat it poverty is on the rise in our country 37 million americans are now in poverty i a family of two in povertya single mother with her child is living on 1 069 a month about 14 million americans are living on half of poverty a single mother with her child living at half of poverty is trying to survive on 535 a month that is two people living on 123 37 a week and each day in america 2 385 more babies are born into poverty the republicans will say that society has little obligation to help the poor because they fail to take personal responsibility for their lives the united states has highest gdp in the world we are first in military technology first in military exports first in gross domestic product first in the number of millionaires and billionaires and first in health technology but we rank 12th in living standards among our poorest onefifth 13th in the gap between rich and poor 14th in efforts to lift children out of poverty 18th in the percent of children in poverty and 37th in the health status of our citizens we should be working to close these gaps and ensure that all americans have a fair chance at life and are treated with basic human dignity instead this reconciliation plan will take away food health care education and the abilityto live in dignity in old age from people who have no other options this budget will proliferate existing inequalities i simply cannot reconcile this budget with my values because this budget does not reflect who we are as a nation and what we believe our responsibility is to other americans we will be judged by how we take care of the least of our people we will be judged by our decision to turn our backs on those americans who were driven to cry out

want and deserve a clean upordown vote on raising the minimum wage and this rule does not provide for such a vote minimumwage workers want and deserve a clean upordown vote a clear bipartisan majority of this house wants and deserves a clean upordown vote not a cynical maneuver to provide political cover for certain vulnerable republican members a maneuver that the majority knows full well will kill any chance of an increase in the minimum wage this year let me say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle maybe you can fool your constituents in august but let me tell you the american people will not be fooled in november what the republican leadership is presenting is a bill that clutters up the minimumwage vote with surprise surprise tax cuts for the wealthy actually it isnt a surprise at all the republican answer to every problem is more tax cuts for the wealthy medicare prescription drugs tax cuts for the wealthy drug companies and hmos an energy bill tax cuts for the oil and gas industry despite their recordbreaking profits and now an increase in the minimum wage with estate tax cuts for the wealthiest few attached the republicans believe that lowwage workers dont deserve a raise unless paris hilton also gets a big tax cut no wonder the american people are so sick and tired of politics as usual in washington i would ask my republican colleagues why is it so impossible for you to do anything good for working families why does it cause you such pain and anguish and handwringing why cant you just do the right thing congress has not raised the minimum wage since 1997 that is 9 years during that same period of time congress has raised its own salary eight times now that is what i call out of touch the congressional pay raise just the amount of the pay raise in the last 9 years has been 30 000 almost triple what a minimumwage worker earns in an entire year the average corporate ceo who will benefit of course from the estate tax cut earns more before lunchtime than a minimumwage worker earns all year a republican staffer told the columbus ohio dispatcher not too many people work at minimum wage anymore i dont think it gets you anywhere politically politics arent the point the point is to make sure that people who work hard every day in this country have enough money to feed their families and pay their rent and fill up their gas tanks nearly 15 million americans will benefit from a minimumwage increase 6 6 million directly and 8 3 million indirectly almost 60 percent of those workers are women 40 percent are people of color 35 percent of them are their familys sole wage earners you want to talk about family values about helping children just raise the minimum wage even worse the massive estate tax cut being tacked onto this bill will actually harm those hardworking families by adding millions of dollars to the national debt the children of todays minimumwage worker will have to pay that debt they will have to deal with increased interest rates they will have to deal with china and other countries controlling the debt of this country they will have to deal with the cuts in education and health care it is outrageous in additionthis rule makes in order a pefision bill that not only misses an important opportunity to deal with this countrys retirement security crisis it also will lead to benefit cuts for millions of american workers and let me again clarify it for the record so there is no mistake this is not a conference report that we are voting on here tonight i want to make it clear because there is some misunderstanding this is not the result of the conference negotiations that we have this bill before us tonight the pension bill fails to encourage companies to keep offering traditional pensions to their workers it fails companies from using bankrdptcy to dump worker pension plans and it fails to stop companies from awarding lavish retirement compensation packages to executives at the same time they cut workers benefits i cant say it any more plainly the priorities of this republican leadership are not the priorities of the american people what the american people want and what they deserve isa clean upordown vote on increasing the minimum wage we have voted on this issue in various procedural votes over and over and over and over we want a clean vote we want this to become the law of the land we want to make sure that lowincome wage earners get the raise that they deserve so they can get out of poverty and what the american people also want and eserve is a pension bill that protects them they wont be getting any of that today so i urge my colleagues to reject this rule i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.0011477470397949219, 0.9988522529602051, 1, "mr ryan i think and also mrs tubbs jones i think it is important that we look at this issue of the irresponsibility of the republican majority they are being very irresponsible and to say that that is fine we will give you what you want of course i think we are going to see more of that kind of action by the republican majority to say that oh we are with you even if we are running the country into the ground we know better we know that we have foreign countries that we are borrowing from because we cant even borrow from ourselves anymore because we have done such a bad job we know we have raised the debt ceiling time after time after time again meanwhile we come to the floor and say our policies are working we know that there are things we should not be doing because you are working every day or you are running your business eyery day you may not be paying attention to everything that is going on not only are we elected but we are paid to watch out for your best interest and also for future generations best interests and they are doing it and i think that the paradigm shift as it relates to the american people paying attention to what they are doing in a way from a fiscal way i think will take place between now and november and so what is so unfortunate abqut this whole situation is that we are supposed to be responsible policymakers on a bipartisan basis and that is not happening right now that is just not happening the american taxpayers are getting mugged knocked down and kicked by this republican majority and the rubber stamp or the rubberstamp congress republican majority that is here now one other thing i want to mention here which i think is very very important just today mr ryan mrs tubbs jones we dont have to go back to weeks or months or 2 years ago or 3 years ago we had a payasyougo provision here individuals decided not to take it up we had an opportunity to raise the minimum wage on behalf of the american taxpayers the republican majority rejected an opportunity to raise the minimum wage for everyday working americans as a matter of fact mr ryan one of the republican leaders said i havent voted in 25 years to raise the minimum wage and if he would have had his way the minimum wage would still be 3 35 versus 5 15 i am so glad that my state joined 21 other states in raising the minimum wage meanwhile we are still here with chisel and hammer in hand as neanderthals on the republican side of the ball and saying oh we dont have to raise the minimum wage we are so indebted to the special interests that we dont even want to bother them of having an american public that is able to pay the rent or pay for their house mortgage or to be able to put gas in their tank we are so invested in the k street project we are so invested in so many other things that we are willing to allow these individuals to suffer but guess what those are the same individuals that are making america america and there are millions of americans that are there and so what is very very unfortunate here is the fact that the republican majority is still boasting about you know we are in charge we are going to continue to keep our foot on the necks of everyday americans that are going in punching in and punching out every day 5 days a week sometimes 6 because they have to work overtime those americans that know what it means to take a 15minute break in the morning and a 15minute break in the afternoon and a solid 30 minutes of lunch if they get that and they better not be a minute late those kind of individuals i think are going to go to the polls this november and say no more they are going to go to the polls and say we are willing to fight for the kind of accountability that we need from this government i am so proud of the 30something working group and the members that come down here and the democratic members that file legislation on behalf of the american people not on behalf of the democratic party not even on behalf of the democratic caucus not on behalf of our leadership but on behalf of the individuals that they represent who woke up early one tuesday morning and voted for representation in this unitedstates house of representatives and i must add the only chamber that you have to be elected to that you cant be appointed to al due respect to the senate but senators can be appointed by governors if a senator was to say hey you know i have had enough i want to go home i want to take care of my grandkids a governor can appoint a senator but in democracy in this chamber in the unitedstates house if one member were to say hey i want to take care of my grandkids i want to spend more time with my kids they have to run for office they have to run for office and they have to be replaced by the people so we have a greater responsibility we have a greater responsibility than the white house than the senate or the supreme court when you look at the three branches government to the american people the oversight house resolution 841 and mr cardozas legislation that calls for the calling in those administrators that are not accountable to taxpayers dollars these are the kind of bills that we must pass one thing i can say mr ryan which is so very important on our side of the ball of saying we want to take this country in a new direction is the fact that we said we will increase the minimum wage we will make our country more energyindependent within 10 years we will implement the 9 11 recommendations to be able to make sure that we can fight terrorism here and make sure that local communities have

asian pacific region six of the 10 largest armies in the world are in the asian pacific region our trade with the asian pacific region is four times greater than any other region in the world

american to be a member of a presidential cabinet when he was appointed as secretary of commerce in the year 2000 by former president clinton and now is unitedstates secretary of transportation appointed by president bush elaine chao another first secretary chao is the first female asian american cabinet member appointed secretary of labor by president bush gary locke first asian american governor on the mainland united states elected governor of the state of washington in 1996 and i could never forget and my deepest respect to the late congresswoman patsy mink first asian american female elected to the unitedstates congress since 1964 then our late colleague and friend my dear friend the late congressman bob matsui who inspired me and mentored me throughout our time here together as a senior member of the house committee on ways and means as a vietnam veteran it would be ludicrous for me not to say something to honor the hundreds of thousands of asian pacific americans who have and continue to serve in all the branches of the armed services of our nation i would like to share with you the contributions of tens of thousands of japanese american soldiers who volunteered to fight our nations enemies in europe during world war ii we are all aware of the fact that after the surprise attack on pearl harbor on december 7 1941 by the imperial army of japan there was such an outrage and cry for an allout war against japan in days afterwards our president and the congress formally declared war but caught in this crossfire were hundreds of thousands of americans mind you americans who happened to be of japanese ancestry our national government immediately implemented a policy whereby over 100 000 americans of japanese ancestry were forced to live in what were called supposedly relocation camps i call them concentration camps their lands their homes and their properties were confiscated without dueprocess of law it was also a time in our nations history that there was so much hatred and bigotry and racism against our japanese american community and yet despite all of this leaving their wives their parents their brothers and sisters behind barbedwire fences in these prison camps the white house accepted the requests from tens of thousands of japanese americans who volunteered to join the army and as a result two combat units were organized one was called the 100th battalion and the other was known as the 442nd infantry combat group both were sent to europe to fight and i might say that i am very very proud to have been associated and been a former member of the 100th battalion 442nd infantry combat group out of the state of hawaii in my humble opinion history speaks for itself in documenting that none have shed their blood more valiantly for our nation than the japanese american solders who served in those two combat units while fighting enemy forces in europe during world war h the military records of the 100th battalion and the 442nd infantry are without equal those japanese american units suffered an unprecedented casualty rate of 314 percent and received over 18 000 individual decorations many awarded posthumously for bravery and courage in the field of battle for your information 52 distinguished service crosses 560 silver stars and 9 480 purple hearts were awarded to the japanese american soldiers of the 100th battalion and 442nd infantry group i find it unusual however that only one medal of honor was given nonetheless the 442nd combat group emerged as the most decorated combat unit of its size in the history of the united states army president truman was so moved by their bravery in the field of battle as well as the tremendous sacrifices of the african american soldiers in world war ii that he issued an executive order to finally desegregate all of the branches of the armed services senator inouye lost his arm while engaged in battle against two german machine gun posts and he was awarded the distinguished service cross after a congressional mandate to review again the military records of these two combat units some 5 years ago i was privileged to attend a white house ceremony where president clinton presented 19 19 congressional medals of honor to the japanese american soldiers who were members of the 100th battalion and 442nd combat infantry senator inouye was one of those recipients of the congressional medal of honor i submit these japanese americans paid their dues in blood to protect our nation from its enemies it is a shameful mark on the history of our country that when the patriotic survivors of the 100th battalion and the 442nd infantry returned to the united states to be reunited with their families who were locked up behind barbed wire fences living in prison camps and could not even get a haircut in downtown san francisco simply because they looked japanese they were japanese and for that reason alone even with their uniforms on they were not given the privilege of getting a haircut my former colleague and now unitedstates secretary of transportation norm mineta and the fate congressman bob matsui from sacramento both spent some of the early years of their lives in these prison camps secretary mineta told me one of the interesting features of these prison camps was posting of machine gun nests all around the camp and everyone was told that these machine guns were posted to protect them against rioters but then secretary mineta observed if these machine guns were posted to guard us why is it that they are all directed inside the prison camp rather than outside it i submit ladies and gentlemen my good friends my colleagues the wholesale and arbitrary abolishment of the constitutional rights of these loyal japanese americans should forever serve as a reminder and testament that this must never be allowed to occur again when this miscarriage of justice unfolded during world war ii americans of german and italian ancestry were not similarly jailed en masse some declared the incident as an outright example of racism and bigotry in its ugliest form after viewing the holocaust museum in washington i understand better why the genocide of some 6 million jews has prompted the cry never again neveragain likewise i sincerely hope that mass internments on the basis of race alone will never again darken the pages of the history of this great nation now to those who say well that happened decades ago we must say that we have to continue to be on our guard for this kind of thing to happen again i remember years ago the case of bruce yamashita the japanese american born and raised in the state of hawaii who was discharged from the marine corps after a training program as an officer candidate and an ugly display of racial discrimination the marine corps superiors taunted yamashita with ethnic slurs and told him we do not want your kind around here go back to your own country the situation was made worse when a leading officer of the marine corps made a statement on the 60 minutes program who said marine officers who are minorities do not shoot swim or use compasses as well as white officers the commandant later apologized for his remarks but it was a little too late and i am really happy to know that after all of the investigations that the secretary of the navy finally awarded mr yamashita his commission as an officer and a captain in the united states marine corps the tradition continues today of the thousands of asian pacific americans who served in the armed services retired general eric shinseki was the first asian pacific american fourstar general who served as unitedstates army chief of staff our asian american pacific island soldiers are fighting for freedom in iraq even as i speak just this past weekend i was privileged to witness in germany the swearing in of a samoan soldier by the name of command sergeant major iuniasolua savusa as the command sergeant major for unitedstates army europe and the 7th army i am very proud of command sergeant major savusa for his accomplishments he is an inspiration and a great role model for our youth and other asian pacific americans who currently serve in the military i think at this point i want to defer to my good friend the gentleman from california the manager of this special order this evening

off the florida coastline the minerals management service which is a government agency under the department of the interior has documented that there is only about a 70day supply of natural gas off the coastline of florida in the gulf under current consumption rates in the united states that to me does not appear to take us into the rest of the century in terms of dealing with our energy needs what we should be doing is uniting as members of congress representing this country and dealing with our longterm energy crisis by exploring alternative energy sources not going to the same old energy sources and trying to drill our way out of this problem drilling is not the solution there is far too much environmental risk to drilling whether we are drilling for natural gas or drilling for oil and the proposal that we will be considering that is attached to the budget reconciliation bill the budgetcut document that we will be considering at the earliest next week includes a terrible proposal that would expand drilling off the coastline of florida and bring drilling within 125 miles of floridas coast on the gulf that is a totally inappropriate proposal it makes absolutely no sense it would jeopardize our environment and i am hopeful that my colleagues from florida and other colleagues who represent coastal communities which will also be in jeopardy if this provision passes will join us in opposing this budget reconciliation bill not the least of which because there are many other reasons why it should be opposed because of the dire cuts that are in the budget that are going to rain terror down on americans across this country but to add insult to injury it also has a terrible provision in it that would allow drilling off the coastline around our entire country so with that having been said i want to talk a little bit about what we talked about in the previous hour and turn the conversation back to the budget reconciliation bill there are a number of significant problems with the budget cuts that the republican leadership is proposing but one of the things that i wanted to turn to is what democrats think we should be doing in terms of the budget democrats want to bring the budget back into balance what we proposed in the budget committee today included a proposal that would bring the budget back into balance by 2012 the democratic budget also has a smaller deficit than the republican budget every year and would accumulate less debt and waste fewer resources on interest payments that are needed to service the national debt we would include budget enforcement measures to protect social security we would do more for education the democratic proposal provides 4 5 billion more for appropriated education and training programs than the republican budget for 2006 and 41 billion more over the next 5 years we also reject the 21 billion in cuts that the republican budget requires the education and workforce committee to make over the next 5 years those are cuts that could fall on students loans and school lunches these are not the same old tired complaints it is insulting to suggest that cutting school lunches and financial aid are tired complaints if one is struggling to be able to give their children breakfast and lunch on a daily basis and make sure that they are provided with nutrition and they do not financially have the ability to ensure that they can do it themselves staring down budget cuts that take that opportunity away from them is nothing short of cowardly this is a cowardly budget reconciliation bill it does not show any guts at all and it abandons the american people let us talk about housing in the previous hour we talked a little bit about the housing cuts that this budgetcut bill would hand down and i am joined by my good and close friend whom i had an opportunity to serve with in now three different chambers the gentlemanfrom florida his district and my district were hit badly by a category 3 storm last week hurricane wilma and we were talking in the last hour about housing and the issues related to affordable housing that our constituents were already facing i want to just point out this picture here over the weekend i had an opportunity to go door to door in my district because there are so many senior citizens trapped in their homes without power we still have half a million people who do not have power in south florida and unfortunately whether it is because of hurricane fatigue or just the fact that there was so much damage in the gulf coast region that it may be difficult to feel the pain that we are going through in south florida and understand it but there is not nearly as much attention as we need focused on what happened in south florida when i was going to door to door in my district to try to help some of the folks who have trouble getting out of their houses and i am talking about people who are in their 80s and 90s one of the apartments that the building captain in the condominium brought me into included this kind of damage this is the result of hurricane wilma and this is just one example there are hundreds and hundreds of condominium units and apartment buildings and homes and mobile homes that look just like this there is a perception whether it was created by the media or created by the lack of attention by the national media on what happened with hurricane wilma that everything is fine in south florida everything is not fine in south florida this is the third floor apartment and that is the ceiling of the apartment and as we can see we can look right through the ceiling at the sky this is this womans master bedroom and literally during the storm 1 minute after she walked out of that master bedroom the roof caved in on her bed a minute earlier and it would have caved in on her when we talk about the affordable housing problem that we already had now we have thousands of people in south florida whose homes have been condemned who are faced with nowhere to go because the average price of a house just in broward is 348 000 a year the rental units the monthly rent is sky high and fema has literally only 300 inspectors in our state going through these homes to determine whether these people are goingto qualify for assistance i yield to the gentleman from florida"], [0.9969504475593567, 0.9969504475593567,

amendments added tothe bill in the senate as a firm believer in the second amendment to the united states constitution and an opponent of all federal gun laws i cannot support a bill that imposes new unconstitutional gun controls on americans i believe that the second amendment is one of the foundations of our constitutional liberties in fact i have introduced legislation the second amendment protection act which repeals misguided federal gun control laws such as the brady bill senate amendments added two sections to s 397 that impose unconstitutional controls on american gun owners and sellers first a section was added to the bill to outlaw any licensed gun importer manufacturer or dealer from selling delivering or transferring a handgun without a secure gun storage or safety device each and any violation of this requirement can result in a person being fined up to 2 500 or having his license revoked this gun lock requirement amounts to the imposition of a new federal tax on each handgun sale because gun buyers will be forced to pay the cost of the secure gunstorage or safety device that is required with a handgun irrespective of if that device is desired further the severe penalties for non compliancewhether intentional or accidentaladd yet more weight to the crippling regulations that hang over gun transactions in the united states second a section was added to the bill to create draconian penalties for people who possess armor piercing bullets just like the democratic congress before it that passed the assault weapons ban the republican congress is poised to give in to antigun rights scare tactics by selectively banning bullets instead of each gun owner being able to decide what ammunition he uses in his gun federal bureaucrats will make that decision to recognize the threat such regulation places on gun owners just consider that a gun without ammunition is nothing more than an expensive club regulating ammunition is the back door path to gun regulation the armor piercing bullets restriction imposes a 15 years mandatory minimum sentence for just carrying or possessing such bullets even without a gun during or in relation to a crime of violence or drug trafficking given the wide scope of criminal laws and the fact that people are on occasion accused of crimes they did not commit this provision promises to discourage many nonviolent lawabiding individuals from possessing ammunition protected under the second amendment further it does not take much imagination to see how such a provision could be used by an antigun prosecutor in the prosecution of an individual who used a gun in self defense especially considering that use of such bullets to murder can result in a death sentence in such instances a defendant who exercised self defense may well accept a guilty plea bargain to avoid the severe enhanced penalties imposed under s 397 i am particularly disturbed that the house of representatives leadership has taken the unusual step of bringing s 397 to the floor for a vote without house members at least having an opportunity to vote on removing the gun control amendments instead of voting on a bill that contains the new gun control provisions we should be considering h r 800 the house version of s 397 prior to its perversion by gun control amendments notably gun owners of america has written to house members to request that they oppose s 397 and instead support h r 800 last month i wrote to house speaker dennis hastert majority leader tom delay and committee on the judiciary chairman james sensenbrenner of my opposition to these antigun rights provisions in s 397 while i am concemed about some of the federalism implications of h r 800 it is a far superior bill because it neither requires gun locks nor restricts gun owners ammunition choices with 258 sponsors and cosponsors h r 800 would easily pass the house the house voting for h r 800 would allow the differences between h r 800 and s 397 to be reconciled in conference committee in conference every expectation would be that the new gun control provisions would be stripped from the legislation given that the original unamended s 397 had 62

scene every day all day so much has gone into getting this agreement we must do everything to make sure that it lasts it is also important as we look forward that we do not forget the tragedy still unfolding in sudan as i speak women continue to be raped children die from hunger and disease men continue to be murdered by the governmentsponsored janjaweed and new attacks continue to be launched against defenseless villages many of these people have been huddled in camps for over a year put yourself in their shoes for a minute you are uprooted from your home you live in a refugee camp where conditions are terrible you do not know if your family members are dead or alive you are sick weak watching people die all around you from hunger and disease now picture you have been there for over a year the tsunami in south asia demonstrates how quickly and effectively the world can respond to such terrible disasters once again we are reminded that the world has failed the people of darfur i commend the quick and generous response to the tsunami but we must not only focus on disasters as they occur but also to respond to disasters like in darfur that have gone on for decades the peace agreement between the north and south opens new doors for a comprehensive peace throughout the country and dr john garang who will now be vice president of sudan has an opportunity to play a positive role and should go to darfur to help bring about peace i have strongly supported the united states commitment to the united nations since i became chairman of the subcommittee on commerce justice state judiciary and related agencies of the committee on appropriations all unitedstates assessments to the u n have been paid in full but over the past year we have seen the united nations fight an uphill battle on darfur resolution after resolution has failed to have any impact at least two security council members china and russia have threatened to veto strong resolutions from being passed secretary general kofi annan continues to report that the situation in darfur continues to deteriorate and the government of sudan has violated the previous security council resolutions by failing to disarm and prosecute the janjaweed ngos are leaving the region secretary general annan has sent a commission on inquiry to darfur to investigate if genocide has occurred and he has the report in his hands as i speak most people believe there is genocide but whether or not they use that term it still is horrible what is taking place and no matter what you call it the facts remain innocent civilians are systematically being murdered raped and displaced and the world has failed to stop it it is time for the united nations and the international community to respond in a meaningful way i ask secretary general annan to go to darfur to confirm with his own eyes that the situation has not improved then secretary general annan should make bold recommendations and call on the security council to immediately implement them because a strong meaningful resolution should be put forward and could make a difference it is now time for secretary general annan to use his strong moral leadership he is a nobel peace prize recipient and surely the security council would take his recommendations he should use his power and prestige to plead for the people of darfur and if the security council fails to take meaningful action secretary general annan should resign in protest i am not blaming kofi annan for darfur he does not control the security council but i ask him to use his leadership to demand a new course of action from them i believe these actions could turn the attention of the world back to what is taking place in darfur resigning under protest is an act of great moral leadership and this world would respect his actions great men in history have given up their posts to force change in 1973 at the height of the watergate scandal president nixon ordered attorney general elliott richardson to fire the special prosecutor he refused and resigned in protest and later got the presidential medal of freedom william wilberforce a member of the british parliament he could have been prime minister but spoke out to abolish the slave trade and gave up being prime minister of england anything kofi annan can do to get the world to focus on darfur would be greatly admired if in the year 2005 the security council cannot deal with genocide the raping of women and the systematic burning of villages now occurring then i believe it is fair to ask what purpose is the united nations serving in the 21st century i close by adding that just yesterday the new york times reported that villages continue to burn and that civilians are bearing the brunt of the violence in

here we have passed two very meaningful tax bills we have passed the jobs and growth tax relief act in 2005 and we also passed the economic growth and tax relief act we have to look at where we were

out for alot of different reasons with the leadership of the president we followed through in congress to pass those two tax relief acts i think i would like to go to the numbers and talk about some of the things that i think are significant in terms of the numbers and how it has influenced americans i always like to personalize everything to my state so i have gome state numbers as well for instance this year who will gain tax relief 111 million taxpayers will see their taxes decline by an average of 1 877 significant numbers five million total individuals and families will see income tax liabilities completely eliminated because we moved the tax the lowest tax bracket down to 10 percent fortyfour million families with children will receive an average tax cut of 2 493 that is because we have moved down significantly the child tax credit fourteen million elderly individuals will receive an average of 2 000 and 25 million small business owners will save an average of 3 641 so those are the numbers in terms of what could possibly be saving average savings through the tax relief but i think we need to look at where we are right now we have an economy that is moving in excess of 3 5 percent in gross national product we have created over the last several years 1 85 million jobs over the last 12 months alone and 5 4 million since augustof 1993 what i think this translates to is more small business owners having more money to create jobs to buy more equipment which creates more jobs i think we also have individuals who have more discretion over their own dollars they can say what they want to buy when they want to buy it because they have fewer federal taxes to pay i think that empowers them to consume more goods which then translates to more business

the information on their disclosure forms the marshals service must agree that the information on their disclosure forms could be used to harm the judge or his or her family in order for it to be redacted disclosure information might seem to some to be an unlikely source of useful information to someone looking to harm a judge that is a flawed assumption for example the fact that a judges daughter has received a scholarship from a particular college must be reported on that judges disclosure form this information can then be used to identify the location of the judges daughter under

same massive underlying problems still plague haiti and a second round of elections looms in the coming weeks while the haitian people and government have the ultimate responsibility for ensuring their future we in the united states have a duty to assist in every aspect of haitis political economic and social statebuilding moreover given haitis proximity to our borders we have an overwhelming interest in doing so now is the time for the united states to tangibly demonstrate that it stands with the haitian people in their quest for democracy and stability therefore together with chairman burton and a bipartisan group of subcommittee colleagues i recently called for us to seize this limited window of opportunity by providing 50 million extra money in fiscal year 2006 supplemental assistance for our neighbors to the south elections signal the beginning of a transition not an end it is thus my hope that the appropriations committee will ensure that haitis enormous needs are met this is the least we can do to help the haitian people at this critical time i also call on the administration to work with the citizens of haiti their newly elected government and the international community to help haiti advance on its path of freedom and prosperity and i urge secretary of state rice to attend prevals upcoming inauguration and finally i reiterate my congratulations to the people of haiti for their successful elections and to rene preval for his victory i would like to highlight that presidentelect preval is visiting washington today as the gentleman from florida mentioned and i look forward to meeting him and offering my full support for haitis quest for national reconciliation democracy and development i am proud to be the ranking democrat of the international relations subcommittee on the western hemisphere and i look forward to working with my colleagues"], [0.0009432435035705566, 0.5009432435035706, 0, "in the days and weeks after first hurricane katrina and hurricane rita it became very clear that the lack of communications was one of the biggest obstacles to a rapid recovery and a rapid rescue effort in the face of these awful disasters the purpose of the amendment that i offer today is to use 2 million for the department of defenses technical support working group to deploy in hurricaneaffected states existing technology that provides wireless interoperable mobile bncrypted broadband communications for first responders national guard federal response personnel in the case of future disasters or in the case of the temporary absence of communications fema has already been tasked with identifying and providing existing commercially available capabilities in time to provide responders with this capability before the next hurricane season begins the capability exists and needs to be rapidly deployed the purpose for my amendment is to use 2 million for the working group to deploy in these areas existing technology federal state and local law enforcement and first responder agencies were limited in their ability to respond to hurricane katrina because they couldnt communicate the house select committee on katrina identified this as a key failure at all levels the select committees recommendation states in part that the department of homeland security should establish and maintain a deployable communications capability to quicklygain and retain situational awareness when responding to catastrophic incidents my amendment takes a step in the right direction and importantly does so before the wxt hurricane season which starts june 1 we must provide responders with the capability to talk across agencies within their agency when customary communications systems like phones are disrupted or destroyed this is not obviously a cureall approach to solve our nations interoperable problems but it is one solution that provides a stopgap system that allows responders to talk to each other using their existing hardvare from mobile or fixed locations when existing systems arent available fema has already been tasked with this responsibility before the next hurricane season the capability exists and needs to be rapidly deployed this amendment does not require additional federal dollars it simply provides 2 million and directs the department of defense and its technical support working group to work with fema using funds congress has already planned to provide fema to identify and deploy the capability from a personal perspective i can state being on the ground in the days and weeks after katrina and rita this was one of the biggest gaps in our federal state and local response the inability to have interoperable communications"], [0.0009555518627166748,
