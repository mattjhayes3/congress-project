offers this nation the promise of strong economic recovery rather than the continued pain of unemployment high interest rates and runaway deficts this alternative is necessitated by the fact that this current administration continues to make excuses for its bankrupt economic policies which are bankrupting our nation we are told to just wait intil our economic recovery program takes effect we have been waiting now for 8 months with these results interest rates are the highest in history 16 million americans are either out of work working parttime or so discouraged that they no longer even look for work the housing industry is in the worst condition since world war ii business failures and farm foreclosures are running at the highest levels since the great depression this litany could go on and on but suffice it to say that if the congress had enacted last year the congressional black caucus economic recovery plan instead of president reagans we would not be suffering the economic contractions that are now wreaking havoc with our nation there is no joy however in pointing out that the congressional black caucus last year predicted the misery and human suffering that would occur as a result of the adoption of the reagan economic program the reagan record hs all too clearly shown that the congressional black caucus was right the congressional black caucus is right again this year we have once again met the presidents challenge to put up or shut up we put up once again a fair and sound budget proposal which will rescue our nation from devastating and debilitating deficits unemployment and economic stagnation the fauntroy alternative controls federal spending not by pushing millions more americans into poverty not by a continued assault on the nations young disadvantaged and poor but by an assault on wasteful military spending extravagant tax breaks to wealthy citizens and irresponsible tax subsidies for profitable corporations the fauntroy substitute rejects the reagan economic shell game which redistributes income from the poor and middle class to the rich more than any other alternative the cbc alternative embodies creative and comprehensive tax reformstopping the raid on the federal treasury through tax breaks for those who least need them rather the cbc alternative restructures the presidents tax cut to principally benefit those earning less than 50 000 per year moreover our alternative provides real tax relief to the poor and middle class by increasing the standard deduction and earned income tax credit the fauntroy substitute proves that fiscal responsibility can be achieved while maintaining compassion and concern for the american people by implementing tax reform and by reducing military expenditures the cbc budget would reduce the projected fiscal year 1983 deficit to 97 billion by 1985 a surplus of 4 2 billion would result let me emphasize once again that fiscal responsibility need not come at the expense of the poor and disadvantaged in our society the republican party platform for 1980 said the measure of a countrys compassion is how it treats the least fortunate yet we now know that this republican administration has systematically dismantled every program which was created to serve our least fortunate under the cbc budget the american tradition of compassion and concern for the needy and destitute would be restored to address the totally unacceptable rate of unemployment among our people the cbc alternative includes 6 billion for a desperately needed jobs program to train and put people who want to work back to work additionally the cbc budget restores funding for important education programs such as title 1 and student financial aid in order to maintain an investment in our human capital and in our future by educating our young people other vital national needs in housing social services and transportation which the reagan budget fails miserably to address are best met under the cbc alternative budget in short there is a way to move this nation toward the goal of reduced inflation without throwing millions of americans out of work there is a way to reduce the federal deficit without taking school lunches away from hungry children and snatching costofliving adjustments from the elderly there is a way to lower interest rates and to restore confidence in our economy without slamming the door on thousands of small businessmen and farmers the way is the fauntroy substitute i have a special concern in the area of health care and waut to discuss with my colleagues the cbc alternative budget proposals in this regard the fauntroy subutitute recommends that 85 5 billion be spent on health care programs in fiscal year 1p83 in order to provide the resources necessary to treat and prevent disease care for sick workers mothers children and the elderly this amount is a full 7 5 billion more than the reagan budget and 5 5 oillion more than the budget committee alternative as cochairman of the congressional black caucus health brain trust i enjoy the benefit of the special expertise of hundreds of experienced health care professionals throughout the country these health care professionals are appalled and rightly so about the ruthless impact of last years budget cuts on the ability of poor and disadvantaged americans to obtain high quality medical care it is all too obvious that the great progress that we have made in the last decade in expanding the availability and affordability of health care from inner city communities to isolated rural towns is swiftly being undermined last year 1 billion was slashed from the medicaid program forcing states to cut benefits and limit eligibility for the poor and working poor as a result over 1 million people lost med icaid coverage virtually all of the losers were women and children in lowincome families thousands of families with incomes at or below the poverty line when faced with overwhelming medical care costs have had to quit their meager paying jobs and go on welfare in order to keep or obtain vital medicaid coverage we believe that it is unconscionable to impose this type of pain and hardship on the poorest and most disadvantaged segment of the population the cbc budget therefore restores those cuts in medicaid imposed last year and maintains a basic level of medicald coverage for the millions of women children and lowincome famtlies who depend upon the government for basic health care similarly the fauntroy substitute restores cuts imposed last year in medicare and rejects any cuts for fiscal year 1983 more than 90 percent of medicare enrollees are senior citizens who have the greatest health care needs in this nation senior citizens have the highest percentage of heart attacks and the greatest number of strokes they are the individuals who for the most part have the greatest incidence of cancer and suffer the greatest incidence of crippling and debilitating disease moreover in addition to being the most sick the elderly suffer the double disadvantage of being sick and poor one out of six senior citizens is poor one out of every two black elderly is poor or marginally poor the cbc finds untenable any proposals which penalize our senior citizens and ask them to use their already limited resources to pay more for medical care the cbc also rejects as foolish and shortsighted any freeze in spendling on such vital health programs as maternal and child health alcohol drug abuse and mental health rervices health manpower and biomedical research additional spending in these areas now only serves to save money in the long run no where is the cost effectiveness of a strengthened federal investment in health care more evident than in the area of biomedical research the economic losses from illness and diseases which we still are unable to prevent and cure run into the billions of dollars last year i had the pleasure of hearing testimony from 10 nobel laureates who spoke about the fact that our nation is becoming scientifically and technologically illiterate they spoke about the need for more funding for biomedical research in order to maintain a leadership position in advancing new knowledge about medical care in order to continue progress in understanding the causes of disease and illness the cbc budget provides additional fundiqg to maintain a strong federal investment in biomedical research let us remember that the debate about health programs and out the larger federal budget is otri simply a debate about numbers and dollars and cents it is about human beingschildren parents elderly it is about their successes and failures it is about their hopes and dreams the cbc budget is an alernative which will allow all america te to enjoy human dignity and a high qusiity of life i urge my colleagues to support the fauntroy substitute"], [0.005091249942779541, 0.9949087500572205, 1, "today as some of us will begin to enjoy windfall gains from a new tax law that was approved not on the basis of being fair and equitable but as being deliberately constructed to~help the rich i hope we will not continue down a deadend street of believing in what president reagan calls the magic of the marketplace empirical evidence of six recessions in the postwar period resulting from similar tight monetary and regressive fiscal policies now being pursued documents the fallacy of feeding the fat and starving the lean economics for those who care to think objectively and to heed commonsense i am inserting into the record the report of the national advisory council on economic opportunity a governmental agency which the congress created warning us that the blunderuss budget cuts in social program will lead not to price stability and a sounder economy but more crime poverty welfare dependency and general social and economic chaos the councils statement follows the national advisory council on economic opportunity today sharply criticized the reagan administrations proposed cutbacks in federal incometransfer and antipoverty programs saying that the effect of these cuts will be to cause massive suffering as well as to undermine the work ethic and family life among the poor the administrations proposed cutbacks of these crucial federal programs warned the council in releasing its final report will severely deepen the crisis of poverty in the future and could drive whole segments of our society toward hopelessness and despair instead the report calls for passage of the economic opportunity act and continuation of the legal services corporation two programs that are essential to the wellbeing of the more than 29 million americans still living in poverty in a separate statement arthur 1 blaustein chairman of the council said by separating economic theory from social policy and pursuing the former at the expense of the latter the administration has adopted a strategy of brinksmanship that could lead to social chaos there is a price to be paid for the reduction of human and social services the price is that these cuibicks will not reduce crime they will increase it they will not reduce the use of drugs they will increase it they will not reduce alcoholism they will increase it they will not reduce physical and mental illness they will increase it they will not promote better family life they will destabilize it they will not increase respect for the law they will weaken it at present there exists an air of suspended disbelief over the radical changes that have occurred in the past two months that is because the layoffs the shutdowns the cutbacks and the reduced paychecks have not yet reached ground level but the day of reckoning will come shortly october 1 1981 will be remembered as a day of infamy for it will mark the worst massacre of social and human service programs in american history the report the american promise equal justice and economic opportunity addresses itself specifically to the issues of unemployment inflation women in poverty the implementation of human and social service programs citizen participation and volunteerism and the myths of poverty the 15member council established by congress in 1967 and appointed by the president is responsible for making an annual report to the president and congress on programs and policies aimed at helping the poor it is slated for abolition by this administration attacking what it termed persistent myths about poverty in the united states the council presented evidence that disputed what it termed the mistaken view of some economists that the reduction in the proverty population had been a result of growth ini the private economy the council maintained that for some time such growth has ceased to trickle down to the poor in the farm of more jobs better income and a more rewarding and productive role in society and the council reaffirmed its belief that only those comprehensive and national economic revitalization efforts targeted specifically toward dissadvantaged communities and the jobless would effectively combat poverty in the 1980s a strategy that the administration is abandoning in addition to releasing the report the council issued the following statement seventeen years ago this nation made an historic commitment to reduce if not eliminate poverty in america the economic opportunity act was conceived with moral conviction and dedicated to the proposition that all americans even the 36 million poor were entitled to both opportunity and equal access to the law the act itself called for a national effort to attack the causes of poverty and related social problems which were national in character and scope all the testimony given to the council over the past several years has shown that these federal programs do work that they do help people get out of poverty and that the delivery systems are providing the necessary basic human and social services thus after fifteen years of progress in our nations effort to relieve poverty when in fact the number of poor had by 1980 been reduced by 11 million and millions more have been kept above the poverty line this council is deeply concerned that the process will be reversed by recent policy decisions by the administration that will serve not only to increase the number of poor but to make their burden more severe the three aspects of the administrations economic recovery program that gravely concern the council are 1 the massive acrosstheboard cuts in social and human service programs 2 the abolition of delivery systems provided for in the economnic opportunity act and the legal services corporation act 3 the transfer of federal authority and program responsibility to the states through block grant programs in evaluating the impact of these changes on the poor we believe that each of these decisions taken alone would be painful but taken together they will be absolutely devastating this council under four presidents two republicansand two demo crats has consistently taken the position that the federal government must maintain active responsibility for pursuing the goals of the economic opportunity act this has never beena partisan issue and it should not be one now the council vigorously reaffirms its earlier recommendations that the economic opportunity act and the legal services corporation act should be reauthorized the council is well aware that the economic difficulties facing our nation are complex and often seem overwhelming but these difficulties cannot be used as an excuse for reneging on our social and moral commitments as a nation we are deeply troubled by the notion that national issues ones that require national policy and programs and that are a part of our national purpose should suddenly devolve to the states the issue is not federal versus 9tate responsibility rather it is the dimunition or avoidance of any national standards of responsibility and accountability to deflect suspend or fragment responsibility and accountability suggests that we are either renouncing or failing to assert our moral purpose as a nation worse than that the administration seems to be denying that this moral purpose exists the effect of the block grant proposal as opposed to the economic opportunity act and the legal services corporation act is to destroy existing support systems that are effective that have a proven capacity to deliver services and that utilize local planning and implementation capabilities they are being replaced by a new system that has a poor track record and is restrictively financed more bureaucratic less accountable ans more subject to intense political pressures the last point is extremely important in that effective and efficient use of limited federal funds is in danger of being thwarted by conflicting political interests in each state after reviewing the recent budget process it appears that there has been a massive transfer from basic human and social services to our military budget the council seriously questions whether it is in the national interest to relegate a substantial number and social service programs to the junkpile while we increase the stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction in an arms race where overkill has long been achieved moreover these changes are occuring without any serious national debate when advocates of balanced national priorities are dismissed by the president as representatives of special interests and critics of the administrations policy are referred to as demagogues in criticizing the administrations sharp cutbacks in social programs the councils statement emphasized the negative impact of these cutbacks on work and family life from an administration that places high priority on the importance of faily life and the work ethic it said this budget will be selfdefeating the council cited the following analyses drawn from its own research and other recent studies in support of its statement that these policies will actually encourage dependency instead of work family breakdown instead of family stability the council cited an estimate by the congressional budget office that proposed cuts in public service employment under the comprehensive employment and training act ceta would result in a net loss of between 210 000 and 330 000 jobs in fiscal years 1981 and 1982 causing a sharp rise in expenditures for welfare and unemployment insurance the loss of these jobs the council pointed out would be compounded by cuts in support services which range from child care to mass transit creating a spiral effect that will deal a devastating blow to the realistic job prospects of hundreds of tihousandsof disadvantaged workers the council cited an estimate by the wharton economic forecasting associates that about threequarters of a million jobs would be lost through cuts in ceta alone and an additional million as a result of the administrations program reductions as a whole the council singled out proposed cuts in the aid to families with dependent children afd c program as an example of how the reality of the administrations budget departs from its rhetoric citing independent studies by the congressional budget office and the university of chicagos center for the study of welfare policy the council noted that the bulk of cuts in afdc are concentrated on families who are presently working but do not now earn enough to maintain an adequate living the council pointed out that welfare recipients who work will have their incomes cut by an average of more than 20 percent versus a 4 percent reduction for those who do not work and in some states the administrations proposed changes will eliminate the difference between what an afdc family can receive if no one works and the income it can receive with a fulltime worker noting that this sharply penalizes the working poor the council commented that tile administration apparently feels that only the rich need incentives to work the council said that families with young childrenespecially minority families and families headed by womenwould be among the worst victims of thle hardships imposed by the administrations cuts citing an analysis by the congressional budgct office the council pointed out that of those families that are expected to lose a substantial portion of their spendable income from reductions in public service jobs af dc food stamps and the school lunch program over twothirds are headed by women and almost two out of five are nonwhite referring to thle university of chicago study the council noted that a singleparent faily with two children could lose up to 30 percent of its disposable income from reductions in afdc food stamps and child nutrition programs alone in rejecting the administrations contention that renewed economic growth will eventually trickle down to the poor to offset these losses the council declared that it flies in the face of everything we know about poverty today tile council cited new evidence in this years report affirming that growth in the private economy has had a declining role in reducing poverty and that virtually all of the reduction in poverty since the mid1960s has come about through the expansion of social insurance and incometransfer programs of the kind now under attack by the administration though poverty increased most dramatically in the hardhit declining cities of the northeast and midwest the report says poverty rates also remained disturbingly stable even in those cities characterized by strongoccasionally phenomenalgrowth in jobs and income in short economic growth has had little impact in decreasing poverty rates in recent years even in the boom cities of the southwest the stubborn persistence of poverty in the face of economic growth the council pointed out in its statement results in part from the changing nature of thle poverty population what tile report terms the new poor are increasingly a population of those whom the private economy has passed by even in good times thle council noted these peoplethe aged the disabled disadvantaged youth women heading families with small childrenare rarely hired by the private sector in 1978 a year of economic recovery thle unemployment rate among disadvantaged minority youth was 41 percent among afdc recipients one of the groups most harshly affected by the administrations cuts nearly 70 percent are clilldren more than twothiirdls of them 11 years old or younger among the adults thle overwhelming majority nre women heading fainiliesabout 80 percent of whom are either required as fulltime homemakers disabled or already in training at work or seeking work because few of these people can be absorbed into the private economy without special assistance and support said the council the massive suffering these program cuts will bring cannot be balanced by any credible longrange benefits from the administrations programeven under the hi 6769 most optimistic economic assumptions instead the council declared any economic renewal resulting from the administrations policies would take place at the expense of stable rewarding family lives and genuine work opportunities for the poor and their children mr lllaustein chairman of the council added that we are watching a great tragedy unfurl before us the steady drumbeat of rhetoric emanating from administration officials and shrewdly orchestrated by the white house is intended to create and has heretofore succeeded in creating a counterreality and new myths with respect to social policy for example by continuously referring to economic opportunity and equal justice programs as welfare programs the administration has misled the american public these programs are in fact designed to achieve the opposite to create jobs and economic opportunities and to encourage people who are dependent upon welfare to become productive citizens and taxpayers by seeking to eliminate these programs and substituting its own policies the administration will deny upware mobility to millions on welfare and will force many of the working poor into welfare dependency by shifting program authority from the federal government to the states through block grants the administration has created a bureaucratic nightmare that will result in government by provisional catastrophe by transferring huge amounts of funds from human and social services to defense the administration is not dampening inflation it is fueling it in order to gain support for its economic package the administration has conjured up the specter of an economic dunkirk what it is perpetuating is a social pearl harbor which will have a devastating impact on the poor who are defenseless as well as wiping out the modest gains made in the past fifteen years by women the elderly minorities and the youngthe most vulnerable segments of our society"], [0.005888760089874268, 0.9941112399101257, 1, "it is with great pride that i rise today to welcome a group of ministers from the chicago area who have journeyed here to participate in the clergy crusade and lobby the government regarding the traumatic effect the presidents fiscal year 1983 budget if passed by congress would have upon the poor the elderly the unemployed and the children it is appropriate that these ministers have chosen to come to washington this weekthe week the house will use the presidents fiscal year 1983 budget as the vehicle for the consideration of the latta and house budget committee alternative i would like to tell these ministers that this will be the week in which my colleagues will vote conscientiously and courageously by defeating the presidents budget and others which throw tax dollars to the pentagon at the expense of people programs it is doubtful that will be the case i unequivocally oppose the presidents budget primarily because of my concern over the devastating impact his budget will have upon millions of americans specifically children and the elderly president reagan has stated on too many occasions that the truly needy will not be affected by the proposed budget cuts i am sure these chicago clergy can attest to a more realistic scenario the truly needy along with unemployed middle class and bankrupted businessmen are dropping like flies through the safety net and the president has the audacity to propose even larger holes in that net it is my belief that the reagan 1983 budget undermines the moral responsibility of government to the citizens of america i agree with the great american hubert humphrey who stated the moral test of government is how it treats those who are in the dawn of life the children those who are in the twilight of life the aged and those who are in the shadows of life the sick the needy and the handicapped the president has failed this test last year under his leadership the president claimed that his budget proposal was fair in fact however its cuts were disproportionately directed at programs to assist the poor and the disadvantaged including investment in health education training services and public works this year the administration has not bothered to pay lip service to the idea of fairness it has once again targeted for cutbacks the same programs which sustained deep speeding reductions last year under this budget the children will see an additional 8 billion cut in their programs child nutrition services will be cut by 334 million in budget au thority and 300 million in outlays the summer feeding programa program which helps preserve nutritional gains made by children during the school yearwill be terminated the special milk program a program which subsidizes milk consumption in schools that do not participate in other federal meal programs will be eliminated school breakfast and child care food programs will be placed in a block grant while grants for nutrition education will be terminated medicaid a health insurance program which pays the medical bills for lowincome americans children and pregnant women will again bear the brunt of the reiagan cuts the federal child support enforcement program a program which par tially reimburses states and localities for expenses in collecting child support payments from absent parents would also be drastically impacted if that is not enough approximately 165 000 women infants and children will be dropped in fiscal year 1983 from the wic program due to inadequate funding and 370 000 would have to be cut off by fiscal year 1985 this means that some half a million fewer people would be reached suffer the little children the aged and elderly are of course to assume an even heavier burden if the presidents budget is passed they can look forward to changes in the federal supplemental income ssi program which will exclude some 115 000 individuals in fiscal ydar 1983 who will not be considered permanently disabled food stamps will receive a 1 3 billion decrease from the fiscal year 1982 authorized spending level for working poor families this amounts to encouraging them not to worka philosophy supposedly counter to the reagan work ethic for our elderly less food coupled with less food stamps the lowincome energy assistance program will be cut conceivably our seniors may not have a choice between heat or eat they will not be able to do either under medicaid we would witness major legislative changes which would cut the federal payment for all services for medically needy recipients in addition to including federal payments to the states for administering medicaid in a new welfare block grant last year the president claimed he would preserve a social safety net of basic programs to protect the poor and elderly despite this claim the administration and its congressional allies forced cuts in virtuqlly every safety net program this years budget proposal continues this policy and proposes a new round of reductions in the safety net programs with cuts being requested in medicare afdc supplemental security income and others this is deplorable and further strengthens my resolve to support the program submitted by the congressional black caucus which increases funding for all the programs above while lowering the dreaded deficit in closing i again thank these chicago clergy who by making this trek to the capitol are attempting to improve the quality of life for those in the

federal budget and the budget cuts on children in this country president reagan was right when he spoke the other night and said that millions of americans harbor the simple wish for a safe and financially secure future for their children but in fact the president is deceiving the american people into thinking that his policies will achieve such ends the administration would have us dismantle programs and policies for children and families that took 30 years to develop but on the basis of what evidence would he have us dismantle those programs the administration argued that dismantling these programs will save money but all our evfdence from the wic program for lowincome pregnant women and their infants all the evidence from the fledgling foster care reform program all of the evidence from the 17yearold title i program for educationally disadvantaged children shows just the opposite without these programs of prevention the longterm costs to the american taxpayer would have been far greater the administration argues on the basis of a few anecdotal cases that dramatic funding cuts for these programs will eliminate waste fraud and abuse if the administrations real concern is with the waste fraud and abuse why is there no administration effort to go after waste fraud and abuse in the defense budget just this week it was reported that paul thayer who is chairman of ltv a major ddfense contractor told the president that i have been in the defense contracting for over 30 years and i can tell you that 40 percent of the cost of planes i sell is attributable to redtape bureaucracy and duplicative expenditures forty percent is there a person in this congress who has been hearing lately of 40 percent of social program expenditures that are a result of redtape bureaucracy and duplicative expenditures i do not believe so that has never been alleged in this congress and yet those are the programs that have received the heaviest cuts while the heaviest increases have gone to the pentagon in fadt there has been a careful refinement of those social programs by the congress over the past years which has eliminated untargeted use of funds and abuses by program operators even in the falsely discredited food stamp program which we tend to forget has been the single most important force in eradicating hunger and malnutrition in this country even in this program usdas own figures show that fully 95 percent of the food stamp recipients are in fact eligible recipients the administration also argues that the drastic cuts in social programs are the oni hope for balancing the budget but this is patently false as the omb director stockman so convincingly revealed last year in his interview with the atlantic monthly president reagan is not willing to renege on his commitment to the wealthy individuals and corporations even by closing the huge tax loopholes or by eliminating special interest favors but the president and his advisers apparently have no qualms about breaking decades of commitments to our most valuable and vulnerable americans children and lowincome families it is time to set the record straight the programs this congress created over the past several decades are working they are saving money they are helping children to become productive citizens we did not develop these programs in the first place simply because the congress had nothing to do one day each of these programs was developed in response to some clearly identified need on the basis of extensive investigations and hearings by the congress and as a result of testimony from state and local officials who asked for our guidance and our assistance we made the commitment to those states localities and school districts as well as to the children and the parents they serve they depend on that commitnient on the basis of what evidence would we now throw away 30 years of work in these longstanding programs on the basis of what evidence would we now disinantle a program that brought this country from the depths of the depression to being the richest the freest the strongest the most able country in the history of the world as we are being asked to dismantle these programs let me ask a simple question what is it that we are apologizing for are we going to apologize for having the most successful education system in the entire world for having more young people enrolled in college than any other country for having greater literacy than any other country are we going to apologize for traveling over the best transportation system of any country in the world for cutting down the cost of bringing our goods and services to market are we going to apologize for having the best harbors and networks for the best inland and boat ways of any place in the world are we going to apologize to the millions of americans who had their homes financed by fha by the veterans programs are we going to apologize for the government providing mortgage assistance and other programp for millions of americans are we going to apologize for the fact that even today the government is spending millions of dollars to keep the savings and loans institutions from going broke thirty years ago there would have been a panic if this many savings and loans were on the poor list if this many savings and loans had to merge but it is the federal government that is picking up the pieces to the tune of millions of dollars in just the last few months because of bad management are we going to apologize because the federal government assisted tens of thousands of farmers across this country that created the most productive agricultural system in the world that not only feeds everyone in this country at lowest cost but feeds a good portion of the rest of the world and provides vital foodstuffs for those people on what evidence is one man who comes into office who weekly demonstrates his lack of knowledge of the workings of these programs and others on what evidence is this one man asking us to turn back the clock to go where we were 20 years ago to dismantle the federal government a federal government that has served the people of this country well that has provided nutrition that has provided health care for the elderly for the poor education for our children who is going to educate the next generation of children who is going to provide health care to the next generation of the elderly who is going to finance the next generation of housing the president would have us believe that charity and the private sector would they never have in the past and i do not know why they would start now there is no indication in fact that they plan to i think that as we consider the impact of last years budget cuts and as this congress engages in another round of budget cuts we had better understand the multiple impacts that these cuts start to build on our nations children as we start to cut title xx which provides help for foster grandparents programs and for children awve start to cut the education programs as the gentleman who sits with me on the education and labor committee knows we sat through several hours of hearings this morning with local representatives of the national school boards association and not one of them could tell our committee how education is better today for this nations children than it was a year ago not one of them could provide an example of how we are better serving the children of this country then we were a year ago the question this congress must face and hopefully can be addressed not only in this special order but can be addressed throughout the rest of this year is where is the evidence who can say that life is better for those children than it was a year ago let me remind you that none of those children yet have been proven to be fraudulent have been proven to be wastefull have been proven to abuse the programs that this congress and this couritry designed to help them i think before we go any further this administration has an obligation to the people of this country to show them the evidencenot the hope not the desire not the promises but the hard evidence about how their program will treat children better this year than it did last year and next year better than it did this year because these is no evidence to suggest that that will take place again i want to thank the gentleman from new york who has been deeply involved in trying to provide for those who are less fortunate than the rest of us and who has provided tremendous leadership in this congress on childrens issues every fourth of july the politicians of our country stand up and say children are our most important resource the future of our country if we do not provide for these children the country will not exist in the future if we ignore these resources we will truly be poor i guess they figure on the fourth of july the children are all of a sudden not paying attention because the rest of the year these politicians slash the budgets they ignore the children who cannot vote and so are not listened to but on the fourth of july they look at a child waving the flag and they teil that child you my dear are our worlds most important resource you are the future of our country and then when they come back to washington they ignore it they ignore it

fashioned by the 18 members of thecongressional black caucus of the house of representatives it is the one budget resolution among the four to be considered by the house which responds most succinctly

gross national products and employ 80 percent of the working people of the country i want you to pay particular attention to the presentations of representative ranoel and representative ford on the tax package that is part of this resolution for it goes to the heart of why we are able to respond best to the mandate of the american people the american people want a new beginning but not a new beginning that is business as usual what good is a socalled tax cut that does not deal with bracket oreep that keeps throwing american workers into higher and higher tax brackets with no real increase in income the reagan proposal continues business as usual inthis regard the congressional black caucus budget resolutionalone among the alternativesgives us a new beginning by correcting bracket creep and returning 17 billion to the american people in tax relief the reaganstockman proposal gives the american taxpayers business as usual when it fails to take into account the increased social security payments that american wage earners and businesses will have to pay this year the cbc budget gives the amer1can taxpayer and small businesses a new beginning a 10percent tax credit on social security payments that returns 10 8 billion zo the american employee and another 7 2 billion to the businesses of our country the 10percent a year acrosstheboard tax cut proposal of the reagan administration is more of the same old thing it will have the average worker earning 15 000 a year paying 93 more in federal taxes by 1984 while the twotenths of 1 percent of the people who earn 200 000 a year will have the government return nearly 20 000 a year to them the american people voted for a new beginning not more of the same old thing with respect to the budget and tax policies of this nation they voted for a balanced budget and reduced federal spending and tax relief not for a legalized raid on the treasury by rich individuals and multinational corporations that will rob the people of 220 billion a year in tax revenues by 1986 they voted for a strong america not an america weekened by throwing 1 1 million people out of work which the reagan human needs budget cuts alone would do in fiscal year 1982 and the fauntroy amendment gives them that they voted for a just and compassionate america not a callous america that would deny a 1 5 billion free lunch to hungry children while continuing a 3 billion free lunch program for the rich that we call the three martini lunch deduction the fauntroy amendiment gives the amerncan people what they voted for it is living proof that the budget can be balanced government spending decreased and tax relief given without necessarily cutting back before yielding to my colleagues in the congressional black caucus to provide you more of the details of our constructive alternative budget resolution let me say three things about this budget resolution that the democraitic study group described as the substitute that takes the boldest step of any proposal being offered to the house to deal with the federal deficit that offers the largest and fairest tax cut of any of the proposals before the house and that accomplishes all of this without hurting other important national programs the first is that while the fauntroy amendment in the nature of a substitute is authored by black legislators it is not a program for black people only the most serious problems confronting this nation just happen to be reflected most acutely in the black experience this is a program for all americans the elde ly on limited income most of whom are white the struggling young couples all over the nation who want but cannot find affordable housing anywhere most of whom are white the coal miners whose black lung benefits are being threatened most of whom are white young people from low and middleincome families who would be denied guaranteed student loans and basic opportunity grants for higher education most of whom are white the sick the cold the hungry the handicapped most of whom are white and all of whose burdens will be made heavier by the grammlatta budget proposal thus the solutions we seek are not for black people only but solutions that will benefit all americans black and white together young and old together rich and poor together protestant catholic jew and gentile together the second thing i want to point out is that our constructive alternative budget is based on a different assessment of the root cause of the problem we are experiencing in our domestic economy and the arena of world affairs than that of the reagan administration a in the area of the economy we maintain that inflation unemployment and loweconomic growth are not caused by government spending government taxation and government regulation as the administration would have us believe imprudence in each of these areas contributes to our economic woes and we are as determined as president reagan to sort out waste fraud and abuse at all levels of government expenditures but the fact is that our economic woes have nothing to do with the fact that we provide food stamps for the hungry medicaid for the sick housing for the poor and public service employment for the jobless our economic difficulties are rooted in the fact that other people are making better mousetraps nowadays our difficulties are rooted in the fact that over the past 15 years or more we have had a steady decline in economip performance in manufacturing output in product design and in productivity in sector after sector we are producing insufficient quantities of poorly designed products at too high a price when you do that not only does the world not buy what we make but we do not buy what we make this is best illustrated by an experience which i had a few months ago looking for a christmas gift for my young son marvin he said he wanted a portable radio for christmas i went to one of our local department stores and saw on the shelf a portable radio by rca amfm 87 i was about to purchase it when i noticed on another shelf something called sanyo it said amfm radio three speakers and tape recorder 47 now i love america and i have sense enough to know that when i purchase american made products i am sustaining jobs for americans but when i saw something better for less i must candidly admit that i bought the sanyo and i did it not because i like strange sounding names but because it was a better mousetrap the problem with our economy is that most americans are doing just what i did we are buying datsun toyota kawasaki suzuki honda yamaha panasonic sony seiko nikon and pentax that is our problem and it will not be solved by denying students basic opportunity grants or poor children free lunch or the elderly poor medicaid the problem is that we are losing market shares in the world at large as well as at home the consequence is rising unemployment inadequate profits and therefore reduced investments still worse productivity a falling dollar and still worse inflation our goal therefore must be to restore productivity the competitiveness of unitedstates industry and our other major economic sectors in both domestic and world markets to do this we must undertake the most fundamental reassessment of our economic structure since 1932or perhaps of all time as our colleague representative augustus hawkins has repeatedly pointed out and will do so again today to remedy that problem we must begin to implement the policies called for in the humphreyhawkins full employment and balanced growth act the third thing i should like to say is that the congressional black caucus makes a different assessment of what our problems are in the areas of world affairs our view is that our problems in 1hternational affairs do not lend themselves to military solution they are social economic and political in nature and thus we have emphasized a strong national economy and food and technical assistance as the primary weapons in the arsenal for our confrontation with soviet russia we favor improved national security but without wasteful military spending our budget as representative dellums will point out today calls for defense of our nation not domination of the world our emphasis on the area of foreign affairs must be for example upon development aid and technical assistance to nations like zimbabwe so that mr mugabe may build roads from the chromium mines to the sea where we can buy it sail it to detroit and make a kcair that goes a longer way to empty than does datsun that is what we need to be doing finally our speaker of the house thomas tip oneill has prominently displayed on a desk in his office in the capitol a quote from hubert humphreys last speech on capitol hill on november 17 1977 i think that quote summarizes the choices we must make this week on our budget resolutions he said the moral test of government is how it treats those who are in the dawn of life the children those who are in the twilight of life the aged and those who are in the shaows of life the sick the needy and the handicapped the three other choices before you this week fail the moral test of government the fauntroy amendment in the nature of a substitute which we now detail for you passes that test with flying colors i yield for the distinguished gentleman from new york to open our presentation of the details of our proposal"], [0.00603175163269043, 0.9939682483673096, 1, "house resolution 470 provides for the consideration of the bill to authorize the minting and sale to the public of the unitedstates legal tender commemorative coins to support the 1984 los angeles olympic games the rule provides for 2 hours of general debate the time is divided equally between the chairman and the ranking minority member of the committee on banking finance and urban affairs the first reading of the bill is dispensed with since the report on the bill has not been available for the required 3 days the rule waives clause 2 1 6 of rule xi againd consideration of the bill ordinarily the rules committee does not look favorably on requests to waive the layover rule however the urgency of establishing the method for the minting and the marketing of these commemorative coins was in the judgment of the committee sufficient to move forward with the bill the banking committee estimates a time lag of at least 1 year for the bidding process to be completed and the coins to be minted and sold each day of delay jeopardizes prospects of making the kind of sales which will genuinely benefit our athletes and the olympic committee the committee substitute will be made in order as an original bill for the purpose of amendment the rule is open so that any amendment germane to the bill will be in order however the rule does specifically make one amendment and one substitute in order it will be in order to consider an amendment printed in the record of may 19 1982 by and if offered by representative st germain it will further be in order to consider an amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in the congressional record of may 19 1982 by and if offered by representative annunzio the rule waives all points of order for violations of clause 5 rule xxi against the committee substitute the amendment and the annunzio substitute each of which contains appropriations language in the section providing for the distribution of funds the rule provides for a motion to reeommit with or without instructions it may seem unusual to consider a rule calling for 2 hours of debate on commemorative legislation however in the committee on rules the gentleman from illinois made an impassioned plea for 1 additional hour of debate in order that he might have ample opportunity to present his case for a different marketing approach to the olympic coins mr annunzio is chairman of the subcommittee on consumer affairs and coinage which reported by a 6 to 0 vote a procedure which varies signifi cantly from the procedure adopted by the full banking committee mr annunzio succeeded in persuading the members of the rules committee that the additional time was essential to fully air the differences of opinion in a manner which is fair to all parties since the members of the house will have sufficient time to consider two very different approaches to the sale of olympic coins i will not devote a great deal of time here to a description briefly the legislation managed on the floor by chairman st germain proposes to mint legal tender coins in 17 emblematic designs the coins would be sold through private marketers selected through a process overseen by the treasury department and allowing for competitive bidding a 30 million guarantee to the olympics is required from any private marketer receipts from sales would be split between the private marketers the los angeles olympic organizing committee laooc and the unitedstates olympic committee the substitute proposed by mr annunzio and reported by the consumer affairs and coinage subcommittee recommends one silver and one gold coin marketing would be accomplished through the mint as opposed to private marketers and through bulk sales only foreign sales would be arranged through private marketers who would be chosen in a competitive bidding process all sales would require a surcharge to be divided equally between the los angeles olympic operating committee and the unitedstates olymplc committee for training and construction of training facilities though there may be disagreement over the best method of marketing an olympic coin there is no disagreement about the importance of minting an olympic coin in july and august of 1984 los angeles will be the site of the xxiii olympiad it will be the first time in half a century that a city in the united states has served as host to this prestigious sporting event and the first time in history any nation has been host to three olympic games over 150 nations throughout the world are planning to compete before a worldwide audience that could number in the billions an olympic coin program is important in two respects the tradition of minting special coins can be traced back centuries to the ancient greeks throughout history special coins played a role in generating enthusiasm and support for the games and more recently have helped fund the staging of the games so that countries from all over the world could participate second the coin program plays an important role in providing support for the training of our athletes this training is a longterm process financial support is critical to our ability to provide american youth of all ages and skills the opportunity to develop their athletic ability and to build the pride and confidence

gentleman for yielding this time to me i am pleased to join the discussion of the federal budget for fiscal year 1982 this debate is particularly important because of the proposals offered by the reagan administration and the orammlatta substitute we should not minimize the impact of the choices we will make in voting on ljhs budget this vote involves far more than dollar levels for federal outlays it involves higher health care costs for all americans and devastating reductions in services for the poorest of the poor as chairman of the subcommittee on health and the environment i have carefully assessed the impact of the administrations budget proposal on the health of our people i am very concerned that these proposals are not in the best interest of the nation these proposals seek a major restructuring of federal efforts and directions in health care they would halt 20 years of progress in improving the health of the american people the wellbeing and economic security of millions of americans would be jeopardized my fundamental concern with the reagan budget is that it proposes to shift or eliminate altogether every federal program which provides health care services to americans while it does nothing to address the underlying problem of health care inflation the reagan budget fails to recognize that it is inflation in health costsnot federal health programswhich has created the funding problems we face today last year alone health care costs increlused by 14 2 percentor 29 billion nationwide annual health expenditures by every american exceed 1 000 a person or 4 000 for a family of four hospital costs are now increasing at the record rate of 19 7 percent per year a day in the hospital now costs an average of 270 and is projected to exceed 500 by 1985 and nearly 1 000 by 1990 instead of confronting this unbridled inflation the reagan administration has proposed to limit federal ex penditures by merely shifting the cost and responsibility for providing adequate health care services to the states localities and individual providers health care services to needy children and our most vulnerable elderly and disadvantaged citizens will be cut while health care inflation in creases national health care spending by tens of billions health care to the poor will be rationed while the basic faults of the entire health care systempublic and privateare ignored the reagan administration has charted its new course for health care without examining the impact of its proposed actions and without consulting with the states and private groups asked to assume additional costs and responsibilities let us briefly review the reagan proposals first federal costs would be reduced by limiting expenditures on care for the poor the federal commitment to share with the states in the cost of care for the indigent under medicaida 15year partnershipwould be replaced with a ceiling on federal financial involvement the states would be left with the impossible task of meeting the needs that exceed the federal contribution or reducing vital health and longterm careservices this cutdespite all the talk about a safety netis targeted on the very poorest of our people the proposal to replace many existing categorical health programs with block grants to the states would also reduce federal costs at the expense of the poor and underserved funding for a wide range of health mental health and prevention activities would be reduced by 25 percent and the states given total discretion to decide how or whether to continue liny of these programs block grants would slash dozens of essential health services including prenatal care immunizations family planning and drug abuse counseling as the budget committee reports these programs provide valuable health care for poor and medically underserved populations they could not absorb a 25 reduction in funding without drastically reducing medical services second the reagan budiget proposes to abolish two existing federal programns designed to limit health care costshealth planning and professional standards review organizations while these programs are not perfect they are our only tools to control costs locally based and staffed by thousands of volunteers the two programs are now beginning to work the reagan budget would abolish these programs and give the nations health industry a blank check on the federal treasury an unplanned unreviewed system is the pserfect prescription for excess beds unnecessary care and even greater health care inflation the final reagan health policy is a heavy dose of rhetroic about a competitive health care system beyond rhetoric however the rdminlstration has provided no concrete details on how it plans to force doctors and hospitals to change their current mode of oper ation and whatever the longrange benefits of increased competition it clearly will not limit costs in 1982 or 1983 experience from boston cleveland and denver indicates that years are necessary to establish successful health care plans even the strongest advocates admit that it will take competitive reforms 10 years to control health care costs yet the reagan administration asks us to believe that 12 billion in savings will accrue to medicare over the next 5 years from this undefined proposal the overall effect of the reagan policies are simple to predict if these polivies are adopted the nation will experience highdr health care costs and health services for millions of our citizens will be reduced rather than improved without any effort to restrain costs federal state and local governments will all laceever increasing expenses forexisting benefits and existing beneficiaries private industry will see billions of dollars otherwise available for plant modernization envirornental improvement and better wages and benefits devoted to higher and higher health insurance premiums but most importantly continuing increases in costs for our existing programs will inhibitif not precludeefforts to improve services for all people further efforts to improve effective preventive care for mothers and children will be deferred medicare benefits which already pay less than one half of the healtb~care costs for the elderly will continue to erode year by year the more than 20 million americans now without adequate health insurance and the 15 to 25 million of our people who live in rural and innercity iunderserved areas will see fewer doctors and hospitals available to serve them higher costs and reduced carethat is the message of the reagan health budget i must add some comments about committee on rules to make in order this budget process and the recondili for me to offer this amendment to ation procedure that has developed

perspective as a result of the reagan administrations scare tactics the public is confused and worried about the future of a program that has provided income security to americans for nearly half a century during his campaign for the presidency mr reagan promised that he would preserve the social security system as a safety net we now see that this was just so much more campaign rhetoric already mr reagan and his chief budget slasher david stockman have succeeded in eliminating the 122 minimum benefit this will hurt nearly 3 million americans at the bottom of the economic ladder now the administration is attempting to panic the congress into making benefits to most americans who have come to believe in the integrity of the system and to rely on it for security the president has proposed cutting 88 billion in early retirement disability and other benefits by 1986 attempting to frighten the american people into believing that the social security system will go broke unless he has his way this is a blatant example of overkill the measures proposed by the white house to protect the social security system it is clear that the president is interested in protecting something other than social security the tax bill that tie stampeded congress into accepting is guaranteed to produce huge budget deficits so he can keep his campaign promise to balance the budget by 1984 there is no question that the gigantic tax cut for the rich will reduce revenues and will require budget cuts beyond anything so far proposed reducing social security benefits is just another way to achieve these cuts some measures must be taken to insure social securitys immediate future but they need not be nearly as drastic as the white house proposes social security supports three separate programseach financed by a separate trust fund they are financed by a payroll tax on earningscurrently 6 65 percent for employees and 6 65 percent for employers up to a maximum of 29 775 a year first there is the old age and survivors insurance program that pays benefits to retired workers and their dependents and survivors next there is the disability insurance program that pays benefits to disabled workers and their dependents finally there is the health insurance program which is part a of the medicare program which pays for doctors bills is finance4 by monthly premiums paid by those enrolled in the program and from general tax revenues because i have encountered considerable confusion regarding some other programs i would like to set the record straight the supplemental security income program which provides a basic level of income for the aged blind and disabled is run by the social security aministration but is not part of the social security program it is paid for by general revenue tax funds and not from any of the social security trust funds a person does not have to work under social security to be eligible for ssi benefits this used to be called the old age assistance program when it was run by the states until a few years ago funds for the aid to the families with dependent children program afdc also come from general tax funds and are in no way related to social security it has surprised me to discover that many people think the programs are somehow related neither is the civil service retirement system related to social security this retirement system is funded by contributions from federal employees who are not covered by social security and matching funds from the employing agencies the social security program does have some problems that must be solved but solutions do not require the kind of severe remedies that the president has proposed in the past few years we have had historically high rates of inflation accompanied by high unemployment moreover wage rates have fallen behind price increases as a result social security has been paying out more and not collecting as much as had been anticipated it is expected that the economic picture will improve and that the social security outlook will brighten as well for the next 30 or 40 years until longrange problems begin to take hold it is apparent to me that this administration wants to mislead the public on the social security issue to achieve its own ends all through the tax debate mr reagan used the most optimistic economic assumptions to argue his case in his social security proposals he uses the very worst economic assumptions he cant have it both ways depending on which he wants to advance i dont want to mislead the people into thinking that there are no problems with the social security program the longrun problems are very serious they result from the fact that the population is aging at a time when the birthrate is declining social security is a payasyougo program where active workers pay the benefits of retired workers it is predicated on an everexpanding work force and today that work force is not growing what the reagan administration wants to do is solve the problems of the next century in the next few years none of us knows what is going to happen in the 21st century as in our private lives most of the things we worry about so much never happen none of us knows what the economic conditions will be like 30 or 40 years from now perhaps we will develop new energy sources that will expand our productive capacity beyond our wildest imagination we would not recklessly leap into solving predicted longrange problems when to do so will cause injury to millions of people right away the president wants to cut billions in benefits out of the program in the near future by discouraging early retirement 55 percent of full benefits rather than 80 percent allowed now at age 62 restricting eligibility for disability insurance limiting benefits to survivors and by taking other steps beyond what is needed it is not necessary to hurt millions of americans now when there is a good chance that such extreme measures will not be needed at allespecially if mr reagans assumptions for economic recovery should prove right in the meantime using the social security system to achieve shortterm economic ends such as a balanced budget is playing recklessly with the future of millions of americans there are a lot of things we can do we can amend the law to permit one fund to borrow from another we can allow the troubled old age and survivor insurance fund to borrow from the healthy medicare fund we can consider financing a portion of social security from general tax revenue funds there is an opportunity as well for creating standby loan authority from general funds whatever changes we decide to make should be thought through very carefully and should take effect sometime in the future we cannot simply say to americans who have spent all their working lives paying into a system that we are going to change the rules and they are going to have to make other arrangements do you say to a man or a woman 55 years old that they are going to have to start some kind of private fund for their retirement how much time do they have to build that fund many people made assumptions about retirement income based on social security they took out private insurance annuities and set up separate savings accounts or made other investments they figured out how much they would need based on how much they could expect from social security it would be heartless and unrealistic now to tell them they will have to find a way to increase their savings in the working years they have left working beyond 62 is fine for those people who want to and are able but recent studies by the social security administrat ion show that only 15 to 20 percent of those who opt out before 65 do so voluntarily most who retire before age 65 do so because of failing health or because they can no longer handle the job pressure in many cases the 62yearold worker who has labored 40 years in the steel mills or the auto plants is worn out if he works until he is 65 he may well be dead maybe that is what the administration is counting on there is something else to consider social security is a compact between the young and the old it was designed for a changing society where it is no longer possible for younger people to assume the responsibility of caring for their aged relatives because of changes in working and living conditions mr reagan wants us to return to the old world even though it is no longer possible if we fail to meet the income and medical needs of the older citizens we inevitably are going to shift this cost to the young who cannot afford it we would also create major problems in private pension funds that are tied to social security workers would demand higher employer contributions to make up the difference putting added pressure on price developments we simply cannot afford to destroy the confidence of a program that is so much a part of our society because we are worried about what might happen 30 or 40 years from nowor because mr reagan has gotten himself into an embarrassing revenue situation as the result of an illconceived tax bill"], [0.006218016147613525, 0.9937819838523865, 1,

has doubled since 1960 not because women thought working would be a lark president reagan is wrong and sadly out of touch with reality when he tries to blame male unemployment on women working instead of his own misguided economic policies now 74 percent of all women are working because they are single divorced widowed or married to husbands who make less than 15 000 a year as unemployment has soared the wifes job has in many cases become the only barrier between her family and welfare this was dramatically illustrated in a december 8 article in the wall street journal which showed that many womenmarried to steelworkers autoworkers construction workershave become the breadwinners for their families as their husbands lost their jobs we all know that the overall unemployment rate is 10 8 percent we are accustomed to having the rate broken down by various groupings for example we hear that 9 2 percent of white men are unemployed and that among black teenagers unemployment is a crushing 50 percent or higher one group we do not hear as much about is women who do not have husbands to support them these are women who are single or widowed or divorced and who are responsible for taking care of themselves or themselves and their children their numbers are growing and so are their problems the bureau of labor statistics says unemployment among these women in november 1982 was 12 5 percent more than 3 points higher than the rate for white men over the age of 20 and those who do have jobs must deal with the reality that their jobs pay less than they would pay if men held then eighty percent of all women work in just 20 job classifications those classifications do not pay as well as the jobs in which men are concentrated and those classifications do not include many of the jobs we seek to create here todaycarpenter plumber bulldozer operator welder there is no reason women cannot hold these jobsno reason except a traditional pattern of discrimination whiclh some administrations have tried to adaoess but this one is virtually ignorinr in the short runnow when we need the workwomen are not going to these jobs according to the bureau of labor statistics there were over 4 million persons employed in the construction trades in august of these 387 000 or 9 3 percent were women in the specialty of highway and street construction 262 300 were employed of which 16 500 or 6 percent were women i recently received a report on job opportunities in federally aided construction prepared by the southeast womens employment coalition they noted that only 5 2 percent of all workers on federally financed highway projects are womenand thats including those working in secretarial and office positions created by roadbuilding projects while much of this bill and of the highway bill we passed last week will not help women who need good paying jobs now i am pleased that some provisions of this bill will provide immediate help the employment and jobs training programs through the jobs corps and the job training partnership act passed earlier this year are necessarily aimed at helping workers displaced because of dislocations in major industries and most of these workers are men still the job search assistance retraining and relocation assistance offered could help women trying to reenter the job market and i am hopeful that will happen the added funds for running state employment services agencies will help women in two ways first women will likely get many of the jobs in the agencies and women and men alike will benefit from improved efficiency in processing unemployment checks and providing help finding jobs probably the single most valuable item in this bill for working women is the additional 50 million for day care services for many working mothers of young children the availability of affordable day care is critical for women with parttime or lowpaying jobsand women still make only 59 cents for every dollar men earnreliable subsidized day care means a direct increase in their disposable income in many cases it can mean the difference between being kble to work and being forced onto the welfare rolls having adequate day care enhances the value of the job training opportunities in this bill as it means women can be sure their children are being cared for while they seek better job opportunities finally as in the case of employment services the day care jobs created by the additional funding will provide work for women thousands of unemployed day care workers who have lost their jobs because of the recession and reagan budget cuts will be rehired and most of them are women immediate work openings for women will also result from the increase in home health care services cutbacks in these programs have resulted in hospitalizations which could have been avoided if proper outpatient care had been available restoring the home health services will not only provide jobs for women it will also save money by providing competent medical care without the expense of hospitalization while these are the principal areas of jobs opportunities for women i am hopeful that women will benefit from other provisions as well for example i would expect that women will get a reasonable share of the 160 000 emergency productive jobs created by the bill these jobs involve repairing community facilities and must produce a tangible benefit to the community there is no reason women cannot do these jobs and those women who are able and willing and who meet the other eligibility requirements should be given full consideration women should also be considered for the 65 000 light construction jobs provided through community development grants as i mentioned earlier women make up a very small percentage 1f zo ruction workers with unemployment at 23 percent in the construction trades we must be sensitive to the need to put people back to work i believe this bill coupled with the highway and bridge repair bill respond to that need at the same time i hope we will reaffirm our commitment to move toward equal employment opportunity and to eliminate sex discrimination wherever it exists the unemployed are not statistics they are real human beings with real hopes and fears for the nation an unemployment rate of 10 8 percent is intolerable but for a family whose breadwinnerwhether a man or a womanis unemployed the unemployment rate is 100 percent and that is not just intolerable it is tragic if it goes on too long it can completely ruin peoples lives for millions of americans this recession has gone on too long we have to do something now the immediate concern of this bill and rightly so is to put people back to work it is vitally important however that we move now to develop policies to restore longterm health to the economy in this regard i was very pleased to notice the committees recommendation in its report that we give prompt consideration in the 98th congress to reviving the reconstruction finance corporation this is an idea which i have repeatedly spoken in favor of as a means of strengthening government cooperation with the private sector and generating needed investment the rfc played a key role for 25 years in helping to lead the country out of the depression when it finally went out of business it had stimulated billions of dollars of investments and return j a profit to the taxpayers a similar institution now could provide needed capital assistance to strengthen the private sector i look forward to working with members of the commitee on appropriations and other interested members to make this idea a reality e"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.9898985028266907, 0.9898985028266907, 0, "i am proud to express my wholehearted support for the adoption of house joint reso lution 220 proclaiming raoul wallenberg to be an honorary citizen of the united states and requesting the president to ascertain from the soviet union the whereabouts of raoul wallenberg and to secure his return to freedom raoul wallenbergs extraordinary record of saving the lives of countless thousands of jews during the holocaust at great personal risk and sacrifice amply justifies this nation conferringupon him its highest honor by proclaiming him an honorary citizen of the united states mr wallenberg undertook his perilous mission at the behest of the united states and the american war ref ugee board the passage of house joint resolution 220 will represent a ringing affirmation of americas commitment to the survival of the jewish people and our tremendous esteem for someone who risked his own life to try to save so many jewish lives from nazi extermination a number of bills have been introduced over the years to confer honorary citizenship on various persons but the only successful effort to date related to sir winston churchill the conferral of honorary citizenship on raoul wallenberg however will not establish a precedent for similar action on behalf of a number of other heroic figures the fact that our action today will not serve as such a precedent is clear for a number of reasons raoul wallenbergs valiant efforts to save thousands of jews from the holocaust provide an appropriate basis for distinguishing this bill from bills introduced on behalf of others conferral of honorary citizenship on wallenberg unlike any other honorary citizenship bill congress has considered heretofore will symbolize our commitment as a nation to remember the holocaust and vigilantly guard against the possibility of any recurrence congressman lan~os who introduced this joint resolution testified before the subcommittee on immigration refugees and international law thatwe need to establish a clear record for posterity that america through wallenberg did act to prevent the holocaust in its final days during the subcommittee hearings i requested congressman lirrros to develop this idea further and place mr wallenbergs actions in the context of other actions or even inaction by the united states to prevent the holocaust congressman lairros answer i believe should be brought to the attention of the house and for that reason i will quote from it at some length it is important to underscore that wallenberg was not a diplomat wallenberg was a young man living in the comfort and safety and affluence of neutral stockholm during the brutal closing days of world war 11 he left behind a most promising career as the son of swedens most prominent family the safety the security the comfort of stockholm to voluntarily assume the task of saving human lives so raoul wallenberg did not think of this mission himself this was not an activity that stemmed from his own plans it was a mission that he tundertook at the specific request of the secretary of state of the united states the united states thtrefoe bears a very heavy responsibility for the untold numbers of years that this young swede spent under the nightmarish conditions of the gulag archipelago whether he died earlier or whether he is alive today it is we the united states who are responsible for his tragedy and for his lost life a great deal of criticism has emerged over the course of years concerning the failure of the western powers to act in decisive ways to stop the slaughter questions such as why werent the railroads bombed why wasnt there an attempt to liberate the camps earlier here is a tangible demonstration that the united states officially acted and successfully acted to save approximately 100 000 people our record for world war ii is a better record because of the actions of raoul wallenberg undertaken at our own behest honorary citizenship is singularly appropriate in the wallenberg case not only because of the place the holocaust occupies in the history of human depravity and our national commitment to the survival of the jewish people the fact that wallenberg acted at the behest of the united states and suffered untold misery as a result of it establishes our interest as a nation in giving this special recognition to him the soviet union in addition never satisfactorily has accounted for what happened to mr wallenberg the conferral of honorary citizenship on him may give the united states added leverage with the soviet union in determining whether he is still alive and possibly in securing his release honorary citizenship is exactly what its designation impliesnamely an honor that does not confer on either mr wallenberg or any members of his family any rights or privileges under the immigration and nationality act the concept of honorary citizenship must be distingished clearly from citizenship itself no member of mr wallenbergs family as a result of our action today can possibly claim any derivative rights under our laws even mr wallenberg himself will not be recognized as an american citizen under united states domestic law or under international law if he is found to be still alive conferral of honorary citizenship in no way can be described as giving away anything tangible the meaning and significance of our action today is entirely symbolicbut it is a critically important symbolic gesture in an age when many nations treat human life so cavalierly a few of the statements in the legislative record underscore the critical significance of the step we are about to take today secretary of state alexander m haig jr said that mr wallenbergs contribution during the dark days or world war ii in hungary stands out as a beacon to all those who respect human rights and dignity he expressed his full support for this legislation assistant secretary of state richard fairbanks informed the judiciary committee thatthe conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would serve to underscore the seriousness with which the american government and people view sovietbehavior in the wallenberg case conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would also serve to reaffirm to the government of sweden that the united states firmly supports the quest to resolve wallenbergs fate former secretary of state edmund muskie informed two subcommittees of the house committee on foreign affairs that the chronological record of state department and war refugee cables and conmnunications 0 documents the unitedstates governments position of responsibility for the selection of wallenberg the directive and funding for his activities the appreciation for his work and the deep distress over his disappearance mr muskie concluded that its isthe uniqueness the extraordinary link between a man raoul wallenberg and our nations conscience that makes this action appropriate mr muskie went on to say raoul wallenbergs mission on behalf of the united states behind nazi lines in world war ii was without precedent what hie accomplished on our behalf risking his own life to save the lives of tens of thousands of people is unparalleled in our history the cost to him the years of his life can never be repaid the action of bestowing honorary citizenship on wallenberg undertaken by the congress of the united states will recognize his humanitarian sacrifice under our direction this is an important part of american history this adoption of raoul wallenberg as our own citizen makes clear to our posterity that the american government did act to save lives threatened by the holocaust i can add nothing further to the eloquent statements submitted by numerous witnesses before subcommittees of both the committee on foreign affairs and

automobile accident known by so many of us in congress for his whirlwind dynamism and tireless unswerving commitment to ending world hunger harry chapin inspired an invigorating confidence that it was possible for policies and programs to be changed that the energies resources and great talents of our nation could be mobilized to breathe a fresh new life into the great humanitarian principles for which we want our nation to stand in one of his many finely crafted probing ballads harry queried now if a man tried to take his time on earth and prove before he died what one mans life could be worth well i wonder what would happen to this world during his short lifetime harry proved to so many people what his life was worth he was vision confidence inspiration unbridled energy and selfless dedication to others and his life matteredhe made a difference he constantly reminded us that hundreds of millions of people suffer from hunger and malnutrition that hunger makes every day for them a struggle whether or not their plight makes the nightly news or the morning paper as harry reviewed the cold statistics of hunger they became even more dramatic he reminded us that hunger is most vicious when it stalks the young that 100 000 children go blind each year because of vitamin deficiencies that in some poorer countries almost half the children die before reaching the age of 5 mostly from nutritionrelated diseases and that among the survivors handicaps of learning behavior and work capacity are widespread due to inadequate diets and recurring illness harry would repeat to himself and to millions of others that these conditions did not have to exist and people listened and they read and they learned that we do have the basic technological knowhow and resources to alleviate the hunger problem it became plain to those who began to familiarize themselvbs with the many dimensions and facets of the hunger problem that our task is formidable indeed but that is where harry came in many of my colleagues will attest to the fact that is was difficult if not impossible to avoid becoming totally enveloped in harrys electric enthusiasm he sparked a realization that the job was not going to get any easier that the time had come to roll up our sleeves to construct a comprehensive strategy against hunger more finely tuning those programs with a demonstrated record of success and terminating those programs which actually exacerbated the hunger problem i first met harry during the summer of 1977 he had come to washington seeking support for an idea he and his wife sandy had conceived creating a presidential commission on world hunger to find ways that our nation could develop more effective policies to combat hunger and malnutrition more comfortable in the jeans and casual shirts and shoes his fans recognized him in harry had come to town in a conservative threepiece suit that lobbying suit as harry liked to call it was to get quite a workout during the next year in between the hundreds of concerts he performedmore than half to benefit the hungerfighting activities of his world hunger year and food policy center organizationshe would return to washington to lobby for his hunger commission singlehandedly harry stormed the capitol along with me harry persuaded our former colleague rick nolan and senators pat leaiiy and bob dole to introduce a resolution urging the president to establish the commission he soon generated enough interest in the conmmission to attract 265 cosponsors in the house and 51 in the senate the presidential commission on world hunger was finally established in 1978 during the course of the next 2 years harry never missed a commission meeting often exhausted after a night of performing at a concert and the logistical nightmare of grabbing any available means of transportation to get back to washington for the commission meeting the next day harry nevertheless injected a spirit of infectious enthusiasm into those meetings he was the conscience of the commission everurging us to explore the deeply rooted causes of hunger and prodding us to produce a final report which did not equivocate did not pull any punches in detailing those actions our nation would have to take if the hunger problem was to be resolved harry chapin led our commissions efforts to involve the public in our deliberations and to explore ways to mobilize public opinion in support of comprehensive policy initiatives against hunger the commissions report did not reflect unanimous support for each of its findings or conclusions with differences of opinion noted in our report but we did provide the chief executive and the american public with some good thoughtful recommendations producing a document which has served as a vehicle to stimulate muchneeded public discussion about the dimensions of and threats posed by world hunger the end of the commission did not end harry chapins commitment to ending hunger it was but a new beginning meeting with him on a number of occasions during this past year harry expressed his everpresent concern that congress and the administration commit itself to developing new hunger policies he continued to pound upon the doors of staid indifference to the global suffering and instability that hunger breeds i always had to listen very carefully when harry spoke because he could pack into 5 minutes more thoughtful innovative ideas than anyone i have known in a conversion he was a master at conceptually changing gears launching a fusillade of incisive questions comments and proposals on a variety of topics it was as if he were afraid he would not have the time to discuss and to do all those things that truly mattered to him there is an empty space now where once there was boundless energy and unfettered contagious enthusiasm calling for an end to world hunger harry once asked and if our future lies on the final line are we brave enough to see the signals and the signs resolving the complicated global problem of hunger will not be an easy task it will be that much more difficult with the absence of a prodding insistent force such as harry chapin but world hunger does place our future on the final line harry took the time to see the signals and the signs of an awesome menacing problem which if left to fester would visit an unprecedented catastrophe on us all he bravely confronted powerful institutional impediments to change and individuals revering the status quo he underscored the urgent need for courageous decisions if our nation were to act against hunger while the best opportunities for success still existed we greatly miss harry chapin our heartfelt thoughts and prayers go out to his wife sandy and their five children jamie jason jond jenny and josh during this grievous period but those of us who harry touched so deeply who remember the hopefilled strains of his songs who recall his unfailing commitment to others will not let harrys vision and dream be forgotten i urge my colleagues to find in the spirit of harry chapin their own determination to channel the necessary resources and energies of our nation into a long term comprehensive strategy to end world hunger"], [0.9889511466026306, 0.9889511466026306, 0, "i will not yield until i have finished the situation the house finds itself in today as yesterday is something out of lewis carrolls alice in wonderland trying to appreciate the rule governing debate today much less following the seven substitutes and 67 odd amendments is like playing croquet with hedgehogs and flamingos mir chairman i hold the president and his advisers primarily to blame for this ludicrous situation only a white house more interested in scenarios than fiscal responsiblity could first present congress with a stillborn budget proposal and then launch a media blitz complaining that congress was damaging chances for economic recovery by constantly delaying the budget process this administration keeps faulting congress for not immediately making hard choices necessary to prepare a budget that is tantamount to a doctor strangling his patient and then complaining because the clergy cant bring him back to life this administration has failed to make any hard choices in its travesty of a budget and now complains because congress struggles in building a consensus on budget priorities i have only been here 6 years but in those years and well before never has a president sent up a budget knowing it was doomed and then gone riding off into the sunsetleavins congress to struggle without a scintilla of presidential leadership this is a disgrace and the american people know where the blame lies it lies with the president of the united states and his colleagues yesterday and today we have tried to write a budget for the united states on the floor of the house of representativesand we will continue to try though as everett dirksen used to say there will be blood in the well up to our boottops before we are through i i have looked at all the substitutes and find their deficits with one exception because it has no deficit absolutely unacceptableand i believe the banking community wall street the american taxpayer the bluecollar and whiteshirted workers the labor leadership the small businessman and the corporate boardroom the family struggling to send their children to college or graduate school persons concerned with the environment the black community and minorities generally will also find them unacceptable the one exception to this view of course is the substitute offered by the geitleman from california but he balances his budget for 1983 on the backs of the elderly the poor the sick students farmers the housing automoble and steel indus tries and their workersand leaves essentially intact the unfair tax cuts and tax loopholes for corporations and wealthy individuals his sensitivity to human needs i need not dwell onhis substitute speaks for itself i just do not believe the american voter will return to office any member of the house of representatives or senator of whatever party who with a straight face presents a budget deficit for 1983 ranging from 96 8 billion to 109 4 billionand claims this was the best he or she could do and is in his constituents best interest if the white house likes scenarios this scenario is one of political suicide we all know that with a deficit of about 100 billion there will be no easing of interest rates you can have faith you can have trustand you can believe in this administrations economic policies if you care to but i respectfully suggest to you that this administration will still be forecasting the roaring back of the econom7 ad infinitum administration budget and economic experts must have known in their hearts that their deficit for 1983 was at the time they presented it in excess of 150 billion they also knew that their proposed defense increases and insistence on maintaining tax subsidies for the rich was feeding those deficits deficits which keep interest rates up workers unemploy d rnd families unable to buy homes cars clothes college educations for their children and the like administration economists of all people should have learned the lesson from franklin delano roosevelt when he said we have known that heedless selfinterest was bad morals we know now that it is bad economics it is bad economics to fatten the rich even more than they are already bloated it is also bad short and longterm politics this administration is riding into the sunset of political oblivion with its economic brand exposed in full view to the american people k that brand spells greed and uncontrollable greed is exactly what we are seeing as the hallmark of this administration and its misguided and selfdestructive economic policies may i first talk about corporate tax subsidies the combination of accelerated depreciation leasing of tax credits plus investment credits means that all of corporate america will soon reach the zero rate of taxation already achieved by such profitable corporations as occidental petroleum ltv and burlington northern rather than helping directly those companies which should receive tax relief these budgets are helping out very profitable corporations at an extraordinary cost to the treasury the taxpayers and to the future economic recovery of this nation those special interests who gathered in washington for the lear jet weekend may find that in aiming to raid the treasurythey really ended up shooting themselves in the corporate foot the feeding frenzy generated around the federal tax trough degenerated into an exercise in timelapse cannibalism their tax benefits are costing the nation revenues it does not haveare hiking interest rates and the deficit to ungodly levelsand helping kill the recovery needed to generate their own profits and sustain healthy economic growth and the creation of jobs for the millions upon millions of anericans out of work besides reducing the revenue hemorrhageinduced by the tax benefit given to corporations and the wealthy last yearanother way in which we could cut the deficit is by repealing reducing or delaying the third year tax cut however neither the tiny net tax saving of the middle income nor the several thousands realized by those with income in six figures are justification for the economic p nalties we will all pay through persistent high interest rates if the third year tax cut is left untouched repeal or reductions in the third year tax cut are essential if money managers and investors are to be convinced of our determination to reduce deficits it is far better to adjust the third year tax cut ant thus lower interest rates and create jobs than to maintain a tax cut which guarantees that the unemployed do not even have incomes on which to pay taxes defense spending is the third area where significant federal revenues can be saved the president wants to increase defense spending by from 13 to 18 percent above inflation the house budget committee would increase defense spending by 5 percent above leflation while the committee proposaland otherscut actual spending for 1983 between 10 and 15 billion they are really merely nibbling at this mammoth fiscal cheese i maintain that before we have a truly credible defenseand one which we can sustain without seriously eroding the economywe must repair the economic damage this administrations policies have caused to our great productive economic machine better to reduce defense spending by 50 to 60 billion than risk continued and deepening recession of the economy while experiencing runaway inflation and horrendous cost overruns in the defense sector defense spending can and must be reduced significantly beyond what any of these budgets before us propose a delay of several years will not have the russians launching their strategic missiles at us assuredly cuba will not strike out at us our present military strength is such that no nation on earth would dare risk assured mutual destruction defense spending ranging from 191 to 214 billion as proposed by the various substitutes is just too high during this period of economic crisis i feel sure our allies in nato and around the world would feel far more secure s9eing a unitedstates economy in good healthwith rational interest rates with greater production and productivity and with a dollar valued to facilitate rather than dampen world trade as the saying goes when the american economy has a cold the world economy catches pneumonia these three revenue sources must be tapped the american worker running out of unemployment benefits has lost patience with this president and this administration the congress must bite the bullet and present the american people with a budget which will foster economic growth and the creation of jobs for the mllions and millions out of work we must repeal or adjust the tax benefits passed out last year during a moment of fiscal drunkenness on the part of this administration and the congresstax benefits which i happened to have voted for unfortunate ly we must repeal or adjust the third year tax cutwhich again i voted for unfortunately we must reduce defense spending to a level consistent with economic realities we cannot accept continuing deficits in the 100 billion plus renge in spite or what our republican savior the gentleman from new york has said interest rates will not come down if deficits remain at current or higher levels we must secure the revenues necessary to achieve that and the areas i have indicated are those which i believe will produce increased revenues without cutting off economic recovery good government costs moneyby good government i mean that which helps peoplenot hurts them we should be investing in a government that truly cares for those who cannot care for themselves to have carelessly defaulted in his leadership responsibilities on the budget indicates that this president is greatly at odds with the view the vast majority of americans hold of the american government and its responsibilities i believe this president and those around him truly misread the american people they listen too much to the rhetorical grumblings and not enough to what the people really feel the american people instinctively understand what teddy roosevelt and his cousin franklin talked about when they used the word national the american people want a government that works and not one that is to be dismantled to oblige the greed and ideological liturgy of destruction espoused by this presidents wealthy cronies i have voted against all substitutes put before the house i shall continue to vote against others yet to be discussed the american people

opposition to the bill and request to revise and extend my remarks my opposition to h r 5618 comes not from the good intentions of this legislation but from the fact that this bill despite the claims of its sponsors mandates the secretary of agriculture to take away limited research and extension funds from highpriority programs of the department of agriculture the state agricultural experiment stations and the state cooperative extension services and directs that these funds be placed into the relatively low priority research programs mandated by this legislation and i might add that since we removed the specific authorization sections from the bill in committee we really do not have any figures to say how much this bill is going to cost and how much damage we are going to ou to our highpriority agricultural research and extension programs i ask the question how much is this bill going to cost our estimates show that as a minimum the bill is going to cost 2 000 000 in research funds 1 250 000 in extension costs to establish and administer the six pilot programs mandated in this bill and much more to recruit train and pay the travel for an unspecified number of volunteers to advise family farmers and other producers all over this country on organic farming techniques my bet is this bill is going to cost upwards to 5 00 000 a year now what programs are we going to cut to implement this bill at usda or at the state level because that is how we are going pay for this program are we going to cut it from the agricultural research services which conduct basic agricultural research programs or the animal health and protection research program or range and pasture research or the national plant germ plasm research program or the tropical and subtropical research program or the research on acid rain precipation program or research on soil and water conservation or human nutrition research or are we going to raid the hatch act which funds each states agricultural research program or the mcintirestennis forestry research program or the special research programs to states for specific state commodity research grants or are we going to take it from the state cooperative extension program i think it is important to note that the house committee on agriculture and the house appropriations subcommittee on agriculture and related agencies have for years been fighting to increase appropriations for agricultural research and extension only with the passage of title xiv to the 1977 and 1981 farm acts were we really able to get the executive branch to consider even a minute increase in the specific aspects of the agricultural research and extension budget ironically we have a slight increase in the fiscal year 1983 budget for highpriority agricultural research programs i also think it is important to consider this additional fact the organic farming proposal espoused in the bill before us today did not appear one time in the recommendations in the annual reports to the president and the congress of the national agricultural research and extension users advisory board during the last 4 years for the edification of my colleagues this board made up of the users of agricultural research that is the producers processors consumers environmentalists rural representatives and labor representatives is charged by law with duty uf recommending research and extension project directions to the secretary of agriculture neither did the joint council on food and agricultural sciences made up of research scientist at the federal and state level consider organic farming as a subject of specific concern this bill then flies in to the face of traditional project programing it makes a mockery out of our efforts to concentrate our efforts on highpriority research and protect potentially high payoff projects during periods of government belt tightening that we find ourselves in today i think we need to make one point extremely clear here today organic farming is not new research thomas jefferson and george washington practiced organic farming 200 years ago it served the country well then when most people lived on farms we could afford to practice this technique when we did not have many mouths to feed but today we only have a little over 2 million farmers and ranchers and their responsibility has risen from feeding their own family to feeding over 75 people per farm today most farmers use the best aspects of organic farming such as minimum tillage animal manures and integrated pest management systems we need to advance our research on the best aspects of organic farming and usda is spending over 50 million this year in this direction in modernized versions of the art practiced by washington and jefferson the art of organic farming the knowledge of it is being passed on today from father to son as it always has been additionally clubs and groups are passing on this knowledge mostly to suburban gardening groups i practice a form of it myself in my own garden down in bristol recently usda began gathering information on this ancient technique and will complete its literature search on this project in about 1 year by that time they will know how best to disseminate what they are able to gather until t hey have completed their literature search they have formerly notified

are garbled and out of perspective and i do not know that we are considering them in their proper context some time back we were looking at a number of basing modes for the mx well first off do we

minuteman iii icbm in silos that are there as a deterrent so that no powerin this case the soviet unionwould feel emboldened and adventuresome and would ever try to take advantage of the united states by their nuclear capability well we came out some time back with the realization that we had a window of vulnerability that we were facing well now what does that mean window of vulnerability well we know from monitoring soviet missile shots over a long period of time that they have been increasing their accuracy without changing their yield because they already had the yield built in and we know that over a number of years they have been increasing their accuracy and increasing their technology all the time that salt i was in place and they were not prohibited from doing this salt i precludes deploying more missiles but it does not preclude increased accuracy and efficiency of missile systems so for a number of years while we have had salt in place the soviets had a bigger bank because they did not have the accuracy of united states missiles and in order to have an insured kill of the target they had a bigger explosion so that has been the basic philo sophical difference between the soviets and the united states going way back to the beginning so when salt i came about and was signed and put in place it limited the number of missiles that each side could deploy but it did not say anything about iriproving the missile system so wc had a smaller warhead because we depended on our technology and accuracy the soviets did not have this they went for a bigger bang a bigger throw weight and a bigger explosion at impact but all during the salt prohibitions on putting out new weapons they were improving their accuracy it is no secret now i am sure but one of the main things that we lost when we lost iran as a friend were two very important monitoring stations on the soviet border where we could monitor missile tests that the soviets were performing on a systematic basis we could see how much more accuracy they were building into their systems and we could project ahead and say look they are making this advance and we can project ahead to say that if they continue to improve their missiles by the year 1982 1983 at the latest 1985 all of our minuteman iii silos will be in jeopardy because they would have the accuracy to take them out whether they were hardened or nonhardened silos we know now that 1982 is the year according to our intelligence estimates and our minuteman silos are within the socalled window of vulnerability so this administration and the previous administration recognized that from this period of 1982 in a first strike the soviets could take out 90 percent of our icbms this leaves us so to speak rather naked so we have been of the opinion since this was recognized as a factand i think the entire intelligence community agrees to thisthat we have to do something well what do you do well in order to make us less vulnerable the department of defense has tried to come up with a different mode to base the icbms this has caused a great deal of consternation and it has not been resolved yet we came out with the theory of the racetrack where the missiles be shuttled among a series of sheltersbecause we are limited to the number of missiles we can employ but we are not limited in the number of holes in the ground so we have the mps the multiple protected shelters in which you could put these missiles so we had a field of missiles and then we had a racetrack so that one vehicle could go around the track and periodically move the missile from here to there to generate a level of uncertainty as to the missiles location this became a political brouhaha so to speak residents of the states where they were supposed to be based said thank you very much but we do not believe we would like them based in our state a number of political factors came into being and we examined additional methods including the continuous patrol aircraft we were going to have aircrafts flying all the time 50 percent of them would be in the air at all times carrying a missile nobody would know where they were they could not be targeted and there was the deep underground basing mode which is still viable then there is a dense packwhich is to be distinguished from the sixpackwhere enough missiles are placed in a confined area so if one nuclear explosion should go off there it would put up enough debris and so forth into the atmosphere so that any other fol lowing incoming missiles would selfdestruct they would hit rocks and debris and so forth and they would either be destroyed or would be inaccurate we do not know what is the best basing mode for this reason the national security council and our department of defense our research and development part of the department of defense has not come up with a single recommendation as this is the best for this reason the president of the united states has communicated to the congress and he has written me a letter a copy of which i have here in effect saying that if you give them a little more time they will come up with a recommendation based on the best scientific brains that we have in this country the best recommendation as to what would be the basing mode the president wrote me as he did other members of the committee dated july 15 of this year it says dear bill and i am skipping part i believe that we must make a solid commitment this year to deploy the mx missile we simply cannot allow the landbased leg of the triad to remain vulnerable we must show our allies that we can make the hard decisions necessary to modernize our strategic nuclear capability decisions that promise to have great influence on the pace of ongoing theater nuclear force modernization initiatives within nato and while it is my intention that the mx not be a bargaining chip in the start negotiations the president says we need to secure the powerful leverage that a commitment to produce the mx would provide as we begin effective arms reduction talks with the soviets and he goes on and it is signed ronald reagan the point is that we must make a decision the president who is the commander in chief has said that he will make this decision as a matter of fact the national security council is to make its recommendation to the president by november 1 of this year the president has assured us that he will make his decision and recommendation to the congress by december 1 of this year we have already approved money in this budget for the production of the mx missile what we are talking about now is research and development even leading up to the production we have already approved this last week what the simongreen amendment would do is take out the research and development money for basing even though we have already approved the production of it this hardly makes sense what we are asking from the committee and what the administration is asking of this houre is that we go forward with the money and with the research and development necessary what the gentleman from new york"], [0.985352098941803, 0.985352098941803, 0, "senator ted stevens

and for all to eliminate the link between their salaries and its own increases in the toplevel executive grades are urgent since 1977 the pay of the highest federal officials has been raised 5 5 percent other whitecollar federal employees meanwhile had raises that total 33 5 per cent that means more than 48 000 employees pay has been leveled flat eliminating distinctions between managers and those they manage that is no way to run a government or hold superior talent with executive pay now capped at 50 112 a year senior managers are fleeing federal service programs in health education and space exploration seem typically hard hit whereas 15 5 percent of eligible executives retired in 1978 the current rate is above 90 percent replac ing them is no easier than holding them the problem is rooted in politics to cam ouflage its own pay raises congress over the years contrived to link its salary scales to those of the top people in the juicial and executive branches but it also prohibited almost all of these officials from earning more than a member of congress now the cost of that folly is coming home the legislators are embarrassed to raise their own pay while they cut most federal budgets and so some of the best talent in government is deprived and driven away the house debate of the issue is not promising it turns on a bill that would merely extend the cap for another year the case for a fundamental change has never been stronger but if that is rejected congress should at least provide some relief by approving a proposal in the senate to give senior executives an immediate

and costofliving adjustments pushed up federal pensions by 55 percent for those who have stayed behind the cap has caused severe management and morale problems pay increases at lower grade levels have forced more and more workers up against the pay ceiling at the moment there is nothing beyond selfesteem to motivate workers to accept the added duties and pressures associated with a promotion within the top five civil service levels the stevens amendment would not remove the pay cap entirely it would how ever improve the competitiveness of top federal salaries somewhat and restore some incentive for promotion at the top grade levels for several years now congress has held federal officials hostage to its own reluctance either to take the heat for raising congressional payto which federal pay

federal executives have increased to the point where it may actually be cheaper to raise their pay than to let them go and have to pay for both their replacements and their pensions at once keeping the cap on at its present level is in any event not going to make a dent in the budget anywhere near large enough to justify the losses it wll pretty surely continue to cause in the way of poor management but congress has so far failed to act why because at present these executive salaries and congressional salaries are pegged to one anothers levels and the congress does not want to undergo the public embarrassment of raising its own pay so you ask why dont these understandably modest congressmen simply break the executive salaries free of congressional pay and allow them to find a more appropriate level because the congressmen really dont want to set loose the possibility that the managers will end up getting paid more than congressmenm you have here a bunch of congressmen who are obviously incapable of taling about this issue except in the most inappropriate populist terms if youre in a moneysaving mood they say it has to come out of the hides of those who earn the most if youre setting pay scales the appointed bureaucracy cannot possibly be allowed to get more than the elected representatives of the people these are not very surprising arguments to hear in washington

in this body in making every effort to achieve the equality women have worked so hard for and certainly deserve like the right to vote the right to equality under the law will become part of the constitution i am proud to be among those to reintroduce the equal rights amendment in congress and continue tlfe campaign for its ratification confident of success the drive for the equal rights amendment has changed american politics never before have so many women raised so much money been so active in lobbying and campaigning and learned so much about politics according to pollster louis harris one of the major developments of this decade will be the fullblown emergence of women as a powerful new force in american politics public officials everywhere will be held accountable and those legislators who have voted against women will be replaced i would like to interject one anecdote while campaigning last weekend back in my district i went through a factory where there was an elderly gentleman who said that he had been working every day of his life and was thrilled that i was a congresswoman i asked why he said he had been working every day of his life to support his three daughters and he feels that when he passes away i will continue to support them in my own way one is a doctor one is a lawyer and the third a housewife with children he firmly believed that unless we had more women taking up the responsibilities and posijuy 14 1982 tions of women we would not be able to obtain that type of equality under the law that this gentleman believed was so very necessary the argument that we do not need the era because there are no longer any discriminatory laws is completely wrong genderbased laws can be as picayune as the north carolina statute that requires a husband but not a wife to go to court for a legal name change if the couple wants to use a combined or hyphenated name or the laws can be reflective of deeprooted stereotypes such as the georgia law that states that the husband is the head of the family and the wife i subject ot him married women are the big losers property rights marital regulations provisions for separation and divorce and statutes concerning wills and intestate succession combine to discriminate against womenwhether they are homemakers work in a familyowned business work outside the home are widowed are divorced or getting a divorce so despite the many rights that women have won over the past decade equal opportunity and equal treatment under the law are incomplete and impermanent the rights we have gained could be revoked by changes in the political balance of congress administrative action or a realinement of the supreme court without the era in the constitution the shift of a few votes could wipe out equal employment opportunity equal access to credit and equal education many womens rights were enacted by small margins for example the law that gives a woman the right to sue an employer who discriminates against her would not be on the books if three senators had changed their minds the reason the era has not yet been ratified is because a few state legislators who ignored the wishes of their constituents and a vast majority of citizens throughout the country these legislators bottled the era up in committee tied it up by parliamentary maneuver and used backroom political pressure to defeat it but those days are past i expect the new erawith the same simple straightforward languageto win approval in congress and then be ratified by the required 38 states state elections will make all the differencewith legislators who oppose era held accountable i believe the era drive will be looked upon as the turning point in the womens movement women will move from being spectators to the inside political track i firmly believe that era more than anything else is a bread and butter issue for women 70 percent of the nations poor are women according to the national advisory council on economic opportunity this figure could rise to 100 percent before 2000 thp irony of this decade of advancement for women is that it has also been the decade of the feminization of poverty while this is most prevalent among elderly black and hispanic women the fastest growing segment of poor women are single white and ralsing children with no or little support jobs alone are not the answer while mens poverty is a consequence of unemployment womens is the result of occupational segregation in spite of the fact that more women are employed now than ever before 80 percent of these women are concentrated in traditional womens work service and cler cal jobs which are not only low paying but have declined in real earnings for years the great strides made by women into traditionally male occupations chiefly reflects their very low starting point and even in these areas equal pay for equal work is still mostly theoretical"], [0.9838308189064264, 0.01616918109357357, 1, "i rise in support of the consensus bill i think this can now be termed a bipartisan and noncontroversial bill and i am pleased to join with my colleagues in supporting its passage i first want to commend the members who have worked on this bill i think we have dealt with this bill in a responsible manner we have given our seabed mining companies what they need an interim legal framework under which they can proceed with their preparations for mining the seabed at the came time we have produced a bill that is supportive of our governments efforts to achieve a comprehensive law of the sea treaty and we have handled the timing of the legislation so as to minimize any adverse impact on the law of the sea conference in a true spirit of compromise the committee of lurisdiction have reeonciled all the differences among the varous versions of the bill which is what enables us to bring this bill before the house under suspension of the rules i think this is a remarkable achievement for which the members are to be congratulated i particularly commend the chairman of the merchant marine committee and his staff for their hard work and their constructive and cooperative attitude on this bill without their efforts we could not have produced this result this soon since it is at my suggestion that the floor manager is bringing this bill up under suspension of the rules i would like to comment on my reasons for suggesting that procedure at first glance this bill might seem too important and complex for that procedure however a similar bill passed the house in the last congress by a vote of 312 to 80 the changes that were made in the bill in this congress were carefully considered and agreed to by four different committees obviously no member is entirely satisfled with the bill but i am aware of no opposition on any of the four committees to passage of the bill in its current form in fact there is agreement among all the committees the administration and the mining industry that the earliest possible passage of the bill is imperative in view of the fact that the bill is both urgent and noncontroversial and in view of the crowded floor calendar i think the suspension procedure is appropriate the committee on foreign affairs has been involved with seabed mining legislation since it was first reported out of the merchant marine and interior committees in 1977 since that time the objective of the foreign affairs committee has remained the same to fashion a bill that would support and contribute to the achievement of this nations overriding interest in successfully concluding a law of the sea treaty while at the same time protecting the interests of our seabed mining industry this objective has required our attention to both the timing and the substance of the bill and in dealing with both timing and substance we have had to recognize the opinion of most countries of the worldeven though we may not agree with that opinionthat the united states does not have the right under international law to mine the seabed outside the context of a treaty premature enactment of legislation or enactment of legislation without certain necessary provisions could have scuttled the tre ty i join in bringing this bill to the floor at this time wit h the sincere intent and belief that it poses no threat to the negotiations or to those countries that do not have seabed mining capabilities several provisions of the bill are important in that regard first under the bill commercial mining of seabed nodules is prohibited before january 1 1988 this provision is intended to provide a reasonable period of time to bring a treaty into force before seabed mining begins second this is explicitly interim legislation on its own terms it will be superseded by a law of the sea treaty so that unitedstates seabed mining operations will be conducted under the terms of the treaty third while the bill states the intent of congress that the rights of us mining companies be protected in any treaty there is no statement as there was in earlier versions of the bill that the terms of the treaty should necessarily conform to the terms of the legislation finally should a treaty not be in force by january 1 1988 the bill provides that some of the proceeds of any seabed mining that may commence after that date must be deposited in a revenuesharing fund for future sharing with the international community under the terms of a treaty i want to say a few words about the socalled grandfather language in title 2 of the bill section 201 states that a law of the sea treaty should provide unitedstates mining companies assured and nondiscriminatory access under reasonable terms and conditions and security of tenure and that the attainment of these goals should be determined by the totality of the provisions of the treaty rather than by any one article or provision this section recognizes that a treaty negotiated by 150 countries with widely divergent interests cannot be expected to provide terms and conditions as favorable as unitedstates legislation drawn specifically to promote the development of our seabed mining industry the administration has testified many times and this section recognizes that a treaty will provide for additional financial obligations and other new requirements not contained in this legislation such as the transfer of technology on fair and reasonable terms and conditions it is our intent that section 201 does not exclude such treaty provisions section 201 simply states the realistic expectation that these and any other treaty provisions taken together must not impose significant new economic burdens that have the effect of preventing the continuation of mining operations on a viable economic basis i have said that no member is totally satisfied with this bill i would be remiss if i did not mention that i am deeply concerned about the implications of the unitedstates flag requirements in the bill the mining consortia are multinational in character and i do not understand how only one of the countries particiiating in a consortium can expect to reserve for itself the lions share of the shipping business associated with seabed mining foreign governments have expressed their opposition to these provisions in very strong terms in recognition that i would not have the votes i did not press for a procedure which would have permitted me to offer an amendment to delete or soften these provisions although i would have preferred to do so i can only express my hope that these provisions do not lead to the breakup of the consortia on the other hand i am gratified we were able to include sufficiently flexible provisions in the compromise bill with regard to the location of processing plants the successful conclusion of a law of the sea treaty is important to the national security of the united states when the united states entered these negotiations several years ago our principal objective was to secure provisions that would preserve the freedom of maritime movement necessary for unitedstates air and naval mobility and the projection of our national power as events in iran and afghanistan demonstrate this objective has never been mire important it is achieved in the current treaty text it is my sincere hope that our delegation to the law of the sea conference will be able to achieve a treaty that meets our interests in other areas as well that the senate will ratify such a treaty and that our mining industry will support such ratification ambassador richardson has written an article for foreign affairs examining the national security implications of a law of the sea treaty which i include at the end of my remarks in short i believe the bill before us meets the foreign policy and national security interests of this country as well as the interests of the seabed mining industry and i urge the members to

that we worked on and passed over here and which i voted for we did our jobs and now the senators are working the bill overand over that bill will create some 300 000 jobs the other was an effort by the joint economic committee to put together a second jobs bill under the able leadership of its chairman the gentleman from wisconsin whom we will all miss himself a distinguished economist i understand there were hearings with john kenneth galbraith walter heller former labor secretaries ray marshall and willard wirts federal reserve chairman paul volcker and others something happened to the reuss proposal the one that would have reduced deficits by 0 5 billion the first year rising to 7 billion the third year on the way to the forum the longawaited eagerly anticipated jobs bill you have before you is not the one drafted with the aid of renowned economists or former labor secretaries as i said in full committee last friday the jobs proposal you have before you was drafted with a magnet every program with a nut or bolt within 5 miles has been drawn into this bill the road to economic recovery in this proposal is in the tracks of a bulldozer we passed a 5 billion highway bill the other day and we have 250 million more in highway funds in this bill there is no rhyme nor reason we do not even know whether the states can afford to match the additional 250 million in highway funds let alone use it this is not a carefully planned billit is a christmas tree excepting defense the nine biggest appropriations subcommittees have gotten their plums in this proposal and the branches of the poor christmas tree are breaking there is 50 million in here for a program called the sba national resources development grants i hikve served on the small business committee for 24 years and i have never heard of that program do you know what it is supposed to do provide treeplanting services christmas trees i am sure our auto industry is in trouble no problem we will put in 100 million for the government to buy car whether it needs them or not well buy 15 000 cars and with the 100 million create 2 000 jobs at a cost of 50 000 per job this is a replay of the surplus milk situation right now we have warehouses overflowing with surplus milk and chcese with this bill we will have garages overflowing with surplus cars these programs are fantasies but things really take a serious turn when you look at the energy and water section that is where you really see the plums plums like an additional 145 million on top of the 236 mllion increase in corps of engineers funding already in the regular energy and water bill that additional money will speed construction of projects like the red river waterway a 1 7 billion barge canal on one of the most siltladen and unstable watercourses in the country a project faulted by both the gao and the army auditing agency a project that duplicates rail service already in existence and if you look at the corps 05 million in operation funds you will see it is going for projects that include the tennessee tombigbee a project you may have thought you would have a separate vote on today if you look ever further beyond the report buried in the bill tinder the heading other productive activities you will find a section providing as follows appropriations for the yatesville lake construction project shall be made available for obligation in the amount designated for that project in title ii of h r 7145 that is an 8 million earmark as far as i can deter mine for a project that would have reduced the 200 million damage from the twin 197778 flood of the big sandy river by 5 000 that would have reduced the worst flood in history by 2 5 inches and that according to the corps of engineers will operate in the red for its entire 100 year economic life as a recreational facility the total cost for that project by the way is estimated at 200 million in case you are wondering how many jobs per dollar you are creating take a look at bureau of reclamation operation and maintenance where you will be spending 21 million to create 434 jobsa cost of 49 000 per job at 49 000 a job the next thing you know those 434 workers will think they work for the house of representatives in case you are wondering what kind of jobs you will be funding let me point you to page 46 of the report which states that flood control funds will be used for increasing the stockpile of materials for revetment work which would include the ordering of additional reinforcement and other materials for any unemployed stock clerk out there take heart this jobs bill is coming to the rescue or look a little further down on page 46 where bureau of reclamation funds will be used for archeological studies and boundary fencing another major step in the rebuilding of amerlea somewhere on the way to the forum this jobs bill got hijacked and soaked in a pork barrela poik barrel that could not make it through the regular funding process i might add and in case you are taken by the notion that this bill is meant to create jobs to help the immediate problem of our 10 8 percent unemployment rate look closely at the bill language take the 489 million for military housing construction money for instance that money is to remain available for obligation through september 30 19875 years from now by supporting title ii of this bill you will be getting a foot up on unemployment all right unemployment in 1987 and that pattern is repeated through the bill 500 million in transportation programsto remain available until expended 1 billion in community development block grant moneyto remain available until september 30 198 5 20 million for construction in the forest serviceto remain available until expended 200 million for rural water and waste disposal grantsto remain available until expended 100 million for watershed and flood prevention operationsto remain available until expended do not let yoursel be kidded these programs are not designed to prime the pump to get us out of our current crisis these programs are not designed to put people to work today they are not even necessarily designed to put people to work tomorrow these are programs that will put people to work whenever the agencies get around to spending it whether the pump needs priming or not and that may be years from now this bill is being used as a vehicle a vehicle to provide extra funds to a number of programs that could not get those funds any other way and a vehicle to provide funds for a lot of projects that never would get funded any other way what is more it is doing it by using the guise of jobs creation as a free pass free from the scrutiny of hearings free from the scrutiny of individual examination and authorization and free from scrutiny as to cost effectiveness this bill is a grab bag pure and simple when i finally saw this eagerly anticipated jobs bill and took a look at the proposal list of 5 6

farmers are cultivating land that today is selling for over 3 000 an acre the yield per acre of crops such as corn is probably double what it was just a few years ago but are farmers themselves enjoying a higher standard of living than they were in the 1950s i doubt it are consumers still obtaining food at reasonable prices and at a lower percentage of income than any other nation in the world i am sure they are thus while this 1981 farm bill is being written in something of a watershed period of this country as it relates to farm legislation and while new constraints are placed in putting a farm bill together many of the reasons for providing sound reasonable farm legislation are here today as they were many years ago the current administration and farmers themselves i believe wish to see a shift to more marketoriented farm programs howevers like an accident victim in a hospial who is on a life support system we cannot remove that life support system abruptly without endangering the patient the farm programs in this bill do not contain massive subsidies to farm commodity groups they are modest in cost and are intended to decrease government interference in farm operations where cuts have been made in farm programs every attempt was made to make it fair and equitable in relationship to cuts made in nonfarm programs moreover attempts were made to increase somewhat the reliance on private sector financing and income in the marketplace where the availability of credit and income do not depend on the vagaries of government congressional whims or the fine print in appropriations bills president reagan is making inroads in reducing inflation getting control of the government and even reversing the direction of overregulation of several aspects of farm operations interest rates are beginning to show signs of moderating the administration is showing its determination to balance its budget by 1984 all of these things will aid farmers in the long term but a reasonable farm bill is needed for the next 4 years to provide a safety nct that will avoid widespread bankruptcies and a deep recession even today as we come to the floor we are advised of a 18millionmetricton sale of grain to russia that will help take up some of the farm surplus however it is universally acknowledged that while the sale helps it will not have much of an effect on farm prices in the near term it may merely stem the erosion of farm prices at country elevators i strongly urge the members to pass a farm bill that is fair to farmers they are out there producing food for our tablesour consumnersat the most reasonable prices in the world they are suffering terribly from the costprice squeeze of high oroduction costs and low prices meanwhile farm exports are the one really bright spot in our export trade picture our farmers are hard working and independent but they continue to need our help in the form of a good and reasonable farm bill let us join together to provide this measure let me now just summarize what is contained in h r 3603"]], "top_unsure": [[7.808208465576172e-05, 0.49992191791534424, 0, "a point of order i cannot hear"],

vast majority of those coming to our country are economic refugees people coming from the caribbean and all over central and south america most of them looking for nothing more than a better life the

little trouble in the closing hours of debate in the next few days this makes this caribbean initiative most important this caribbean basin initiative it is most important for this country on two counts first we must create a reason for these people to stay at home they must be able to make a decent living at home and second we must promote stability in those countries these countries right

damages and by prohibiting class action suits what the thomas amendment does is takes it a step further it says that you have to be an employee a farmer does not have access under his amendment children in a playground who might be injured do not have access under his amendment household impacts and injury to families would not be covered under his amendment the second part of my objection
