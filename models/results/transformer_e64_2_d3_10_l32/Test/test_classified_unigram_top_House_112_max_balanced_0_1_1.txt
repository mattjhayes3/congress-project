epa regulatory relief act of 2011 and h r 2681 the cement sector regulatory relief act of 2011 im proud to sponsor this rule which provides for a modified open amendment process with a preprinting requirement this modified open rule means that any member republican or democrat with any germane amendment that complies with the other rules of the house will have the opportunity to debate that issue its another example of the republican majoritys continued commitment to openness and transparency since coming to this body back in january my priority has been to create an environment where american workers can prosper in my home district unemployment hovers around 13 percent i dont doubt this sad statistic is part of the reason why vice president biden is in my district today talking up the presidents socalled american jobs act unfortunately for thousands of people looking for work in floridas fifth congressional district they cant afford for the president and vice president to just keep talking about it they need action not promises they need to actually break down the barriers that are preventing job creators and employers from creating new jobs every week when i go home i meet with small business owners to get their input on what they need to start hiring again they always tell me the same three things we need demand from customers loans arent as easy to come by as they were prior to the recession and they have no idea what to expect from washington as it relates to regulation and taxes washington cant directly control the first two things but can absolutely take care of the third when we had a balanced budget amendment rally in dade city one of the small business owners stood up and said what we need is certainty from the federal government we need certainty what our taxes are going to be and what regulations are going to be he talked about the fact that regulations change on a moments notice based upon whims of the government he used to plan 3 to 5 years out in regards to what their business plan was going to do what their hiring process was going to be today theyre lucky if they can plan 90 days based upon the uncertainty and so long as twothirds of americans in this country think that were on the wrong track theyre going to stay hunkered down waiting for signs that things are improving the american people need to believe that were putting this economy back on track back towards growth and prosperity and you do that through leadership there are currently 219 regulations under consideration each of those regulations separately will cost us 100 million thats 21 9 billion in increased regulations on businesses today that are already crushed because they cant compete whats more there are 4 226 new regulations in the hopper with that many regulations costing that much money hanging over their heads how on earth can we expect small businesses to actually create jobs today in the house we have the ability to address some of these executive rules all promulgated by the epa those rules collectively known as boiler mact and cement mact put thousands of jobs in my district in jeopardy for the life of me i cant understand how the vice president can stand up in front of the citizens of land 0 lakes florida talking about job creation with a straight face when the obama administration is actively pursuing regulations like boiler mact and cement mact in my district alone the cement mact rule could cost up to 200 cement manufacturing jobs not adding into the total of jobs that are going to be lost on the associated industries that move it sell it and use it additionally numerous groups and industries have made it clear that boiler mact regulations will cost them hundreds of millions of dollars and will put many of their employees in the unemployment line and yet our president ignores these regulations and keeps talking about doubling down with a second stimulus following the failed first stimulus package well here we are today doing something to actually save jobs not just talking about it one of the very first actions i took as a member of congress was to invite the epa to come to my office and explain to me their finalized rules in respect to the portland cement manufacturing that goes on in my district they said to me we understand its not without challenge to the industry i may not have been here long but i know washington doublespeak when i hear well its not without additional challenges to that industry its not just the cement mact rule thats not without challenge my colleague mr hastings wrote a letter to the epa about 2 months ago and i commend him for this letter in it he says the boiler mact rule alone could impose tens of billions of dollars in capital costs at thousands of facilities across the country my colleague from florida asked the epa to consider a more flexible approach that could prevent severe job losses and billions of dollars in unnecessary regulatory costs in florida alone boiler mact will affect at least 43 boilers requiring 530 million in retrofits i just heard from the florida sugar industry who estimates boiler mact for their compliance alone will cost 350 million and cost untold jobs ive heard from the pulp and paper workers who may need to lay off 87 000 workers if the boiler mact regulations go into place ive heard from timber producers in my district that have recently been hurt because unitedstates plywood producers have had to close because of lack of demand and now theyre fearful they may have to deal with the double whammy that boiler mact is going to do in regards to putting businesses out of work and close them down it could crush one of the last outlets for their timber products representative hastings in his letter to the epa said this i believe that regulations can be crafted in a balanced way that sustains both the environment and jobs i believe these bills h r 2250 and h r 2681 meet that balance and makes that balancing possible these bills dont completely eliminate clean air emissions regulations for boilers incinerators or cement kilns but what they do is require the agency to create regulations that actually take achievable science into account they give the affected industry time to comply in sum they make the epa think about the american workforce and in an environment where job creation is key i dont see how we cant support that with that i encourage my colleagues to vote yes on the rule and i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.001191479153931141, 0.001191479153931141, 0, "i thank the gentleman from arkansas i appreciate his leadership and his friendship and his service to our great state the great state of arkansas i am thrilled that were having the conversation that were having here late in the day regarding these types of issues that in my strongest opinion are impacting our ability to create jobs and thats the prize that we all keep our eye on here in these chambers is what can we do to strengthen our capacity to put people back to work because i think at the end of the day thats exactly what people elected us to do last november is to come up here and change this climate change this culture and put the entrepreneur back in charge because thats where job creation comes from a couple of points before i go to some notes that i brought specifically for this afternoons presentation and that is that this cloud of uncertainty that continues to hover over the economy of the united states of america is influenced by a number of things but let me just take two or three of them the threat of higher taxes and not just the threat of higher taxes but the relationship of the threat of higher taxes to the issues of the deficit and the debt i made these comments not too long ago on this very floor that in private business in business in general your debt is usually tied to your assets the assets of the company most businesspeople get that but in government your debt is tied to your capacity to increase taxes so this debt and deficit issue that we continue to struggle with as a country and the prospect of that debt continuing to riseand not too long from now were going to have a vote on increasing the statutory limit on debtinfluences i think contributes to this cloud of uncertainty that leads a prospective entrepreneur a prospective job creator to not do what that person would like to do even with trillions of dollars sitting on the balance sheets of corporate america the hesitancy to create these jobs influenced by the threat of higher taxes and then i think also fundamental to this cloud of uncertainty as i call it continuous overregulation by this government that the prospective job creator cannot compute the input costs associated with more government regulation notice i havent even mentioned the impact of the health care law obamacare as we call it its hard to compute the input costs of this health care law and then more recently the threat of higher energy prices and a flawed if not almost nonexistent energy policy of this administration just think about it youre a prospective job creator youve got an idea youre a creative person you want to live the american dream but standing in your way between your dream and your capacity to do something creatively and resourcefully to put people to work to contribute to society are things like higher taxes more government regulation and red tape the impact of when i hire these people the impact of obamacare and then on top of all of that the price at the pump and higher energy prices i just dont see why the other side cannot understand why were not creating jobs why we continue to hover at the 9 percent level on unemployment just a couple of weeks ago we passed on this floor a budget for 2012 and in that budget immediately before the ink was dry we were being criticized because of what we were trying to do and what i believe is the reasonable approach to solving our nations fiscal problems and that is finally delving into something that nobody ever wanted to touch and thats the entitlement programs the mandatory spending side of the house where most of the money is i just want to make a couple of these comments as it concerns medicare because i heard back from my constituents a teletown hall meeting the other night the first phone call i got from bella vista arkansas was a gentleman worried because he had heard that we were attempting to take his medicare away in 1965 when that program was created baby boomers were teenagers and now 10 000 baby boomers a day enter qualification for medicare when medicare was created in 1965 the life expectancy of a human being was around 70 a little younger today its close to 80 years of age medicare spending is growing at an unsustainable rate of 7 2 percent every year seniors are already facing access issues think about this under the current system one in three primary doctors are limiting medicare patients one in eight are forced to deny medicare patients altogether if the medicare program is allowed to continue without any change at all the congressional budget office projects it goes bankrupt in 9 years basically if we allow medicare to maintain the status quo medicare collapses so were leading our conference is leading were taking mandatory spending and entitlement programs and were deciding that were going to throw our cards down on the table were going to do something about it the plan that we voted to approve just a couple of weeks ago preserves protects medicare for those 55 and over not just those drawing medicare but those nearing retirement people that have planned their lives around that program we dont change that for those people that needs to be said it needs to be repeated over and over again but again we get demagogued about it because at the surface level it sounds like were trying to just take it away let me repeat again those 55 and older not affected by the proposed reforms that we support starting in 2022 new medicare beneficiaries would be enrolled in the same kind of health care program that i have that my colleague from arkansas has and my other colleagues who have spoken here tonight future medicare recipients would be able to choose from a list of guaranteed coverage options and theyd be given the ability to choose a plan that works best for them its not a voucher system its premium support no money changes hands between the government and the individual its modeled after what members of congress and federal employees already have the reforms are designed to decrease the fraud within the system and requires congressional oversight by requiring transparent pricing and minimum benefit and quality standards and instituting more competitive forces my friends thats what the free enterprise system is about and i believe if it has worked for 235 years of this great country it should be also the way forward let me finish by saying this like my colleague from arkansas he and i came in as freshmen together on january 5 in these hallowed chambers we didnt come here to do nothing we didnt come here to kick the old can down the road to ignore the facts we came here to act with dispatch and make a difference for our country thats why im pleased to join my colleagues here of our great freshman class in providing this information to the american public its not only what we were elected to do it is our moral duty to do it and to do it as soon as we can and to do it with the sense of purpose that i think defines the 112th congress"], [0.0012219661148265004,

8 percent now for some time in fact its been over 8 percent for 32 months which is the longest period of unemployment this high since the great depression i mean the things were doing in washington d c frankly havent been working and so its time to start pushing the types of bills that the house has been pushing this year to try to get this economy back on track im happy to join my colleagues tonight im also happy to be a strong supporter of the forgotten 15 and the new seven bills and dozens of bills that are passing the house throughout this session that will help the economy recover and help small businesses create jobs now americans are frustrated with what they see going on in congress with what they see going on in washington d c and theres a reason because they see the policies that have failed in this town over the past few years and they dont believe that washington can function and they can do things to help the economy recover thats because weve been doing all the wrong things whether it was the bailout stimulus bills cash for clunkers the health care takeover capandtrade card check you couldnt think of a more antibusiness set of legislation that this congress passed over the last few years than those bills and what they did is theyve held down the recovery and theyve stopped small business owners theyve stopped entrepreneurs from growing and creating jobs frankly we know that jobs are not going to be created in washington d c theyre going to be created back home in places like illinois and in colorado and in kansas and in alabama and yes even wisconsinall across the countryby innovators and job creators and entrepreneurs the people that built this country and that create the jobs theyre not going to come from big washington programs and thats what has caused the problems in this country these big washington bailouts run up national debt all of it has not worked and so its time we changed course its time we start pushing legislation that will promote small business that will promote the free enterprise system and frankly these things are common sense the american people want congress to pass commonsense legislation the point about these commonsense bills that the house is pushing these probusiness projobcreating bills that the house has been pushing and sending over to the senate is that they focus on the very things that built this country in the first place this nation was not built because we had the highest tax rates in the world because we had more regulations than any country in the world because we had national debt in the trillions thats not what built this country it was the hard work and determination the sweat equity of the american peoplewho had no guaranteeswho built this country brick by brick the commonsense things that congress doesnt do that theyve been doing the wrong way for yearslook tax increases tax increases dont create jobs borrowing and spending doesnt create wealth doesnt create jobs regulations dont create jobs and so every day in washington were putting more barriers in the way of these small business owners that we want to have create jobs and its making things worse in fact just looking at the regulations that are coming out every week out of washington its unbelievable this is just a stack of the regulations that have come out just this week in washington d c monday a new set of regulations tuesday a new set of regulations wednesday a new set of regulations that one was pretty thick there thursday another set of regulations just this week these regulations they just dont stop it just keeps coming and coming and hitting our small business owners and stopping the economy from recovering let me just give you an example of what these regulations have on wednesday alone 188 pages of new regulations dealing with the health care takeover is that what the economy needs is that what you hear from your small business owners at home is that what americans are crying out for 188 new pages of regulations dealing with health care its got to stop and yes to the president we can wait on having new regulations we can wait on the presidents big tax increases we can wait on this stuff we dont need 188 new pages of obamacare regulations we dont need this new stack of regulations this week its not helping the economy recover its making it more difficult

thank him so much for his service to this house as we close for the christmas season i do want to make just a few comments about what has transpired today and i think it is so noteworthy that those members who are departing have stood on this floor tonight and have talked about what it means to serve in the unitedstates house of representatives and how grateful we are that they have chosen that service and we each have shared a commitment to make certain that we are committed to pushingpushingthe federal government to get its fiscal house in order indeed mr hensarling many times has said that that is our primary goal as conservatives because we know that the greatest threat to our nations security is our nations debt many of us talk about admiral mullens comments on july 6 2010 when he said that the greatest threat to our nations security is our nations debt this week as we have looked at the socalled fiscal cliff as we have looked at the expiration of the tax cuts as we have worked through the growing and just boiling and rolling debt that is sweeping over this government as we have watched this deficit climb higher every year we have sought to find a solution to this as i mentioned earlier in our remarks we have stood in this house and going back to may 10 we passed reconciliation august 1 we passed an extension of all the 2001 2003 tax reductionstheyre called the bush tax cuts we passed a sequester bill on the 2nd and on september 19 we passed a pathway to tax reform what is so significant about that is that those pieces of legislation left here some of them with a bipartisan vote all with a strong vote from this body and they traveled across to the senate and from may to september they found their place on harry reids desk what is so sad about this is that harry reid made his choice the senate made their choice and their choice was to not take up those pieces of legislation this crisis that we have had our socalled crisis the fiscal cliff crisis and taxmageddon all of this is a crisis of their making because it is a crisis of inaction but many times that is what happens here it is inaction what does not get done that causes the situation where there is a rush to the last minute we have had the american people watching closely and we have had the comments from the president the comments from different ones in the cabinet and the comments from the senate but i remind my colleagues that we took our actions here in the body we sent that legislation and we did it because we understand that 16 trillion worth of debt and annual deficits of 1 trillion are far too much for our children and grandchildren the speakers tonight who have joined me on this floor have talked about how we have hopes and dreams for our children for our grandchildren for the futures of our families you know what if youre facing 16 trillion 20 trillion 25 trillion worth of debt as a nation it is very difficult to see those hopes and dreams come true my concern as i look at my grandchildren is that the decisionsmaybe the selfishness evenof people in washington who want to tax too much and want to spend too much who are taxing and spending not their money but my children and grandchildrens money children of the next generation leaders maybe even a generation or more away they are spending their money because at this point we are borrowing 46 cents of every dollar we spend its not sustainable that is why we have very thoughtfully over the last several months approached this issue and its why this week we have worked with our leadership to find a solution to this to look at different angles and the decision came that the best decision for this the best way to approach it the best way to make certain we address this is to stand firm on the actions that the house has taken and for the senate to take up the legislation that theyve had the opportunity to take up since september 19 they could take up any bill and amend it they could vote on it they could send it back to us they could go to conference you see as we talk about our children and their future and as we talk about this amount of debt what we do not want to do is to cap our childrens future and trade to the people that hold our debt if were not careful thats exactly what is going to happen as we have gone through this process this week as my colleagues have all watched it and said exactly what has happened what are the decisions what are the consequences of the decisions we have made are we going to resolve it i do believe that you are going to see a resolution to this it will happen because the american people are saying to us and theyre saying to the president it is time to get this spending under control our children deserve better of us they have the right to live free lives to dream big dreams and to make those dreams come true i do want to say a thank you to our leadership i think the way that speaker boehner has handled these issues this week the way he has worked with the members in this body to show respect to them to show respect for their opinions and respect for their constituents i think that that has been a true sign of leadership that was willing to listen and then willing to move the way the body wanted to move and the decision was made by the body not to move forward on the plan b but i think in making that decision what you will see is our leadership moving forward more committed and with individuals even more prepared to get to work and to get this solved and to do what the american people are expecting us to do which is to get this spending under control they have sent the message loud and clear washington does not have a revenue problem it has a spending problem it has an outofcontrol spending problem and an insatiable appetite for the taxpayers money as we have worked through this week as weve talked to our constituentsand so many of us in this body have done telephone town halls and we have been on the phone and we have answered emails and we know that there is no limit to how much money how much of other peoples money government will try to spend theres no limit to how much of the taxpayers money so the american people have sent the message to us and we all have sent it to our leadership and they have listened and they have responded the time to get the spending under control is now the time to stop kicking the can down the road is now and we will head away for christmas and return i think with a strength and a resolve and a courage to address the fiscal issues of this nation the house where the spending bills and appropriation process begins we will tackle this with strength with resolve with courage to get the job done so that just as my colleagues have said here tonight so that future generations have a brighter future and so that we will continue to stand for the cause of freedom with that i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.001227906090207398,

important in the eyes of all americans and that is getting america back to work our economy is stagnant this administration is throwing up barriers which is freezing assets because the folks that normally would invest in growth and hiring people are frightened about whats around the next corner and theyre sitting with all their money and theyre not growing i met this morning with around somewhere between 12 and 14 of my neighbors in just a sitdown cup of coffee where we sat around and we talked about the way that folks in central texas view whats going on with the job market you know in texas weve been blessed we havent faced the kinds of unemployment numbers that other states have had but we now are certainly seeing unemployment creeping up in our state also we had small businessmen and women there and they talked about the things that concern them but yet weve had meetings with bankers whove explained to us that you can look at their deposits and see that american local investors are sitting on the sidelines and keeping their deposits in the bank and not investing in growth and not investing in capital structure not building buildings and certainly not hiring people and so part of the discussion this morning from some very intelligent small business folks was we think we know why why do you say this is happening the answers i got were answers that we hear on the floor of this house every day but the one that ive been talking about now for almost a year probably maybe even over a year is the fact that we are seeing the administration doing through government regulations which are basically laws passed by the regulators which change the playing field for people and our economy across the board at every level its not done by acts of this congress its done by acts of bureaucrats in the obama administration as they make rules and regulations that fit their view of the world and how they think the world should work and these regulations regulate the drivers the force builders that employ the american people many of these regulations have become such a shock to the conscience of people who are in business that they say my lord im not about to get invested in growth until i know whether im going to even have my business once the regulators are through with me and then sitting on the sideline is the giant regulator program which is the health care bill that this house passed last year and the senate passed we call it obamacare its 2 000 pages are multiplying very rapidly as the regulators the people who are able to pass rules to set up the regulations that govern that bill are imposing more and more burden on the individual employer and on those people seeking health care so what i heard today from some people who are presidents of small businesses run small businessesa thomas barrett a very intelligent lawyer who is both a financial adviser and a lawyer for small and other sized businesses all over central texas and is highly sought after for his opinionthey said its the unknown thats driving the investment off the page in the united states its the unknown we dont know whats going to happen next our taxes what are taxes going to do weve got taxes that will last for a while and then go back to a different tax automatically unless this house acts then most importantly and what we talked mostly about today was all the new regulations that are coming up in the next 3 or 4 months the republican leadership in this house is going to do everything it can to turn back some of the craziness thats gone on in the regulatory world i brought the members here tonight just a few examples of some of the regulations many of which weve been talking about all year weve spent a lot of time talking about the cement industry weve talked about boiler mact weve talked about a lot of other things were going to talk about tonight but its just a general outline of some corrective measures that this republicanled house is going to try and going to pass through this body to just start slowing down and changing the direction of what we think are some illconceived regulations by the executive branch the obama administration i want to start off with this poster right here which just gives you a small example of what were talking about in july of this summerthis is what weve called the regulatory summer these are regulations that have been proposed by various agencies many of them are household words like the environmental protection agency but there are plenty of others the labor departmentyou could go on and on in july 229 proposed regulations went into effect 379 final regulations and the cost estimated of these proposed and final regulations over 9 5 billion to the economy in the month of july that meant business the job creators took a hickey of 9 5 billion in 1 month the month of july 2011 we have just finished august270 proposed regulations 347 final regulations over 8 2 billion in august so for this summer just july and august the 2month total 17 7 billion in costs to the people who create jobs now is it any wonder that the people who create jobs are sitting on the sidelines and saying holy cow how do i hire somebody and i think the american people know why people in business hire somebody they hire somebody because they think that person will make their business more prosperous will make it work more efficiently will make it do the job the business was set up to do if you are in the roofing business and you put roofs on houses you hire more roofers because you think you will be able to produce a better quality product faster and more efficiently therefore enhancing the profit that those who have invested their capital and labor into that businessthey can make a profit so that that business can thrive you dont hire roofers when you dont need to put roofs on houses i mean that doesnt make any sense and everybody with any kind of common sense knows that now if youve got a person whos got some business whether it be big or small and they literally dont know what the government is going to do to them tomorrow or lets just say in the next 2 months following this track record they could be looking at another almost 20 billion worth of additional costs to their business that could be coming up in september and october based upon the last 2 months its arguable that its pretty close to 20 billion of additional costs that they were not anticipating and never thought was going to happen to them and all of a sudden out of the clear blue it drops in their lap now you will hear arguments like wait a minute there are these things that are environmental and other ways and people have known all along something about this was going to be done and that may or may not be true but the ramifications of what the regulators actually did are turning out to be horrendous costs to industries that right now are trying to get the ground under them stable so they can start hiring people again if youre on balancing ground sort of like this earthquake we had up here in washington which i am very fortunate that i wasnt in when that ground is unstable you dont know which way to turn well the same thing goes for business when the foundation underneath your business is unstable you dont know which way to turn are you going to go out and hire somebody give them a job when this is what your life is right now and someone is creating that problem that are actually by their actions making it unstable i would argue that questionable regulations the imposition of additional costs the unknown of what taxes are going to be tomorrowall these things create an unstable environment for the people who hire people so this last regulatory summer is a perfect example of the earthquake that has shaken the foundation of the small businessman and the job creators in america the president of the united states promised us the white house promised us to save 10 billion in redtape which is kind of the slang term for bureaucratic regulations in 5 years but the white house has put forward 17 7 billion worth of redtape in 2 months the message has been lost somewhere where is it when did what we were promised change into a threeforone worse situation we were promised a 5 billion savings for the job creators and in fact weve created a 17 7 billion expense and uncertainty to the job creators and we wonder why we are not creating jobs mr kucinich was talking about his view of the world he and i dont see the world the same way but the facts are when he was talking about we need to create jobs we darn sure need to create jobs the role of the congress today is finding ways to get this country back to work if we put this country back to work 90 percent of our problems will be much much better so the real goal of the republican house this year to finish this year out is going to be trying to correct at least some of this instability created by these regulators these unelected regulators these are appointed people not elected people the heads of these agencies are appointed by the president they are under the wings of the white house if you will they are part of the executive branch of government and the legislature this branch the congress is going to in the next several months try to put some reins on these outofcontrol regulators and hold them back and weve got just some of them i am going to talk to you about that some of my colleagues are putting forward in the future the week of september 12 which is next week i suppose were going to take up the protecting jobs from government interference act by tim scott of south carolina now the facts of this situation are very unusual in my way of thinking and i think most of the people in the united states when they heard this on television they said they cant do that can they it seems the boeing corporation has a big operation up in the washington state area and they were wanting to build an additional plant to build whatever boeing builds whether its aircraft or whatever it isthey wanted to do it in south carolina they have been negotiating and working in good faith with the citizens of south carolina and the government of south carolina they have looked at alternative locations around the country to make a determination of what is best for their business in their situation today and they determined that they were going to build a very important plant in south carolina but the national labor relations board the nlrb issued a complaint against the boeing company for the alleged transfer of an assembly line from the washington plant to south carolina yet not one union employee at the boeings puget sound facility thats the washington plant has lost his or her job as a result of the proposed south carolina plant still the nlrb is pursuing a restoration order against boeing that would cost south carolina thousands of jobsthese are new jobs in south carolinaand deter future investment in the united states this is the government telling boeing how they can run their business at the base level of you cant move unless we tell you you can move and if you choose to go to a righttowork state instead of a union shop state were going to tell you no you cant do it what happened to the freedom of movement that our founding fathers created in this country i mean part of what makes us great is if you cant prosper in texas you can maybe prosper in south dakota in fact people are right now as we talk right now people are taking businesses from one part of the country and going to another part of the country because of maybe newly discovered resources maybe a better work environment maybe a more intelligent workforce maybe a better investment community maybe better opportunities maybe better tax structure thats the free right of every american is seeking prosperity for their company and for their family to go seek these places if were going to tell boeing they cant build a plant to create jobs in south carolina next they may be telling sam smith in oklahoma im sorry but we need you to stay in oklahoma we dont want you to move to texas or we dont want you to move to south carolina to go to work in the boeing plant which we just canceled is that the kind of world we have and we want this government to have i would say no do we want the people of south carolina to have 1 500 new jobs yes is anybody talking about hurting the people employed at puget sound no its the issue of union membership that drove this whole thing and we have given our states the right to choose whether they have a righttowork state or they have a union state and every state in this country has some difference in how they view that its part of the environment that state creates to bring business into the community what in the world is wrong with that and when did that become big brothers job to tell somebody where they can and cant offer you a job so are we now saying that the people of washington stateand i have many friends there and i love very much and i dont mean to be in any way defaming washington statebut we have got a group of bureaucrats that are saying those are more important people than the people in south carolina who want to work for boeing for a good salary because the governments telling them they cant do it the gentleman from south carolina tim scott has got this bill h r 2587 were going to take it up next week i understand which is going to protect these jobs from this government interference it would take the commonsense step and it would prevent that national labor relations board from restricting where an employer can create jobs in the united states who would have ever thought we would have had to even address this on the floor of this house this world that we have lived in and in fact president john f kennedy in writing one of his dissertation papers at harvard came up with a term the great frontier which the whole concept of america was if you failed in one place the great blessing of america is you can pack up and move to another place at one time that was the frontier now that frontier is in technology that frontier is in science that frontier is not just moved from one place to the other its moved from one idea to the other thats the greatness of america to have the government tell you where you can and cant locate is an abomination to the very spirit of the american dream this one we need to do it right away we are going to do it we hope our friends in the senate are going to help we have the administrations new maximum achievable technology act mact standards and cross state air pollution csapr for utility plants will affect electricity prices for nearly all american consumers in total 10 000 power plants are expected to be affected i cant tell you the number in other states but texas surprisingly fell under this act which no one anticipated and we actually had no input whatsoeverbut thats a different argument which i have made before but i know that we are talking about 17 to 19 plants just in texas are being closed down these are coalpowered plants were talking about coalpowered plants in most instances here the result to middle class america is an annual electricity bill increase in parts of the country anywhere from 12 to 24 percent just by this one regulation that has been proposed dealing with coalpowered plants and greenhouse gas emissions well representative john sullivan of oklahoma has come up with a solution for this h r 2401 the transparency in regulatory analysis of impacts on the nation one of the things that we think any regulator should be looking at as he is doing this type of work is how does this impact the jobs of the american people how does this impact the economy of the area if you have a state that has 20 power plants and the results of your mandatory and arbitrary ruling is going to shut down 12 or 15 of those plants it doesnt take a genius to figure the price of electricity is going up even if they go in and they make a conversion to some other form of power at great cost and expense billions of dollars of additional money happen to be spent even if they do that you are still going to have down time when electricity is going to be scarce and the risk of blackouts and brownouts is going to be increased quite honestly it hurts every industry and every person that depends on that electricity has anybody looked into this and said here is how we figure this out and told us with transparency what effect this has no so what mr sullivan is trying to say is that we need to call a timeout and it would require a cumulative economic analysis for specific environmental protection rules and specifically delay the final date for both utility mact and csapr rules until full impact of the obamas administration regulatory agenda has been studied some of this stuff is done with computer projections but the facts are its kind of a shock and surprise to everybody thats in the business and its time that we call time out and rather than cost this country jobs give these people a chance to continue to have good jobs for the american people to work in this is a good bill and were going to take this bill up the week of september the next bill that this republican congress is going to go take up is h r 2250 to deal with whats called boiler mact from hospitals to factories colleges thousands of major american employers use boilers that will be impacted by the epas new boiler mact rules these new stringent rules will impose billions of dollars in capital and compliance costs increasing the costs of many goods and services college kids will tell you how expensive going to university is today they dont need any more cost increase there but it will increase the cost of higher education and it will put over 200 000 jobs at risk just what they have done under the boiler mact rules so what are we doing with h r 2250 representative morgan griffith of virginia has proposed this its called the epa regulatory relief act and would provide a legislative stay for four interrelated rules issued by the epa in march of this year the legislation would also provide the epa with at least 15 months to repropose and finalize new achievable rules that do not destroy jobs and provide employers with an extended compliance period in other words if its a problem lets fix the problem without costing people jobs lets fix the problem with a reasonable amount of time for compliance so that its not a kneejerk reaction that is required by everybody to try to keep from going out of business because of epaimposed rules so basically just like the last bill we talked about this is saying stop this craziness take a new look let the people youre regulating have some input into the cost and the compliance and the job loss and then lets restructure if weve got to fix this problem restructure it in a manner that makes common sense to keep the american men and women of this country working keep the factories open and producing and the colleges and universities open and producing and not impose a shortterm heavy burden of an additional capital infusion in order to meet regulatory changes give them a reasonable amount of time that common sense says it would take to fix the problem instead of imposing this rammeddownyourthroat series of rules october 3 is the week the republican congress will be bringing that before the american people and before this house this is one ive been working on for quite awhile i hope through part of our efforts during these evenings when weve talked about the cement mact issue the imposition of new regulations on greenhouse gas emissions for the cement factories and the fact that weve had the opportunity to very effectively drive cement production out of this country and offshore to china india and maybe mexico where they dont regulate at all the emissions and then we think that somehow its going to fix greenhouse gases its kind of insane that cleaning it up over here and driving people offshore to where they dont clean it up at all is going to help anything its going to hurt something but thats a different argument in the week of october 3 the cement mact and two related rules are expected to affect approximately 100 cement plants in america the cost is estimated to be somewhere between 3a billion for a 68 billion industry just do the math thats a tremendous burden if these rules come into effect these stringent requirements will be cost prohibitive and the american cement industry quite frankly could be at risk across the board we could wake up finding ourselves importing from other countries by necessity a product that we now lead the world on you know concrete is the second most used building material on earth the only thing thats used more than concrete is water so portland cement which is the base ingredient in creating concrete is as important to the building of infrastructure buildings and basically everything that we live with as anything on earth and we are in that business and we produce cement in various states in this country we produce the portland cement process and these regulations would shut down factories and basically cause these international companiesbecause all companies whether they are based here or not trade internationallyto move someplace else and you wonder why jobs are going overseas well in this case in the cement industry jobs will be going out of the country for one specific reasongovernment regulations beyond reasonableness the cement sector regulatory relief act sponsored by representative sullivan my good friend from oklahoma will provide a legislative stay of these ruleshold off brother we need to look at these thingsand provide the epa with at least 15 months to repropose and finalize new and heres the magic word achievable rules that do not destroy jobs and provide employers with an extended compliance period once again quit cramming it down our throat quit saying youve got to do it tomorrow give us time to implement reasonable rules and as we look at these rules lets analyze what they are going to cost us in the way of jobs and in the way of our economy and take that into consideration as you plan out the reasonable way forward youll find that many of the things that well be taking up in the next couple of months right there is the secret key ingredient were going to come up with rules that you can achieve without destroying jobs that will still over a long term if you give time to comply will meet the requirements that are necessary that people think to clean things up if they need to be cleaned up october 3 is when we are going to take that up sometime in the month of october or november we will take up another bill oh by the way when youre talking about jobs in these portland cement factories these jobs are good jobs these are labor jobs but they are trained labor jobs they are good jobs that pay somewhere between 65 000 and 85 000 each now thats a good american job that ought to be done by an american not by someone from china or from india because we have driven these industries out of our country coal ash h r 2273 these are antiinfrastructure regulations commonly referred to as coal ash rules that will cost hundreds of billions of dollars to fix according to the existing regulations affect everything from concrete production to building products like wallboard the result is an estimated loss of well over 100 000 jobs so you know at the end of this last month we had no job gains not one job was created thats what the report said well just in the things that ive read to you so far as a result of these regulations if all of this took place next month just the numbers weve given were talking about 500 000 jobs so far that these bills that this republican congress is going to take up and try to get some reasonableness in this regulatory process its time for this congress to not surrender the lawmakingrulemaking is lawmakingauthority to regulators without overseeing what they are doing and making sure that they are not harming our economy and harming what is going on in america and the jobs that everybody needs we cant afford to lose more jobs we have to keep the people working who have jobs and then weve got to enhance these businesses in such a way that they feel that they are not going to be threatened by surprise regulations and therefore they are willing to say i have got stable ground under my feet and i can start to expand and hire again and start to invest my capital which right now is sitting in the bank into new and better products services factories et cetera so this coal ash bill that will cost this country 100 000 jobs h r 2273 the coal residual reuse and management act sponsored by representative david mckinley of west virginia will create an enforceable minimum standard for regulation of coal ash by the states allowing their use in a safe manner to produce products and protect jobs its just basically saying let the people who have this coal ashand its in certain states more than other placesuse this coal ash and regulate this coal ash in such a manner that it does enhance the environment without destroying american jobs once again the congress has got to act and the republican congress is prepared to act now here comes my favorite of the crazy regulatory acts the epa is now proposing rules to regulate dust now i live in texas weve got more highway miles than any other state in the union plenty of paved roads but weve also got what we call farm roads and ranch roads and in the western part of the state those farm roads are covered with what we call caliche which is a pulverized limestone and over in the eastern part theyre covered with certain types of gravel some of its river gravel and other things when a farmer drives up to his house on his driveway its usually got some kind of gravel or caliche on it and it kicks up dust the epa is now saying you can be fined for driving home every night on your gravel road now what is your solution well its easy go out and spend 20 000 and pave your driveway5 miles of driveway so put pavement on it oh but make sure you put a certain kind of pavement because its got to have pavement that doesnt kick up dust arguably if you use asphalt it wont kick up dust or concrete wont kick up dustor not as muchbut you might kick up a little more dust if you do what they call squirt top which is what most farm roads are which is tar with gravel spread on it until that gravel sets it kicks up dust so even if you went to the expense to build a farm road that was a paved farm road your paving method might kick up enough dust to get them to fine you and take money out of your pocket anyway and the epa now wants to regulate dust california does this already i asked one of my california colleagues how do you keep from getting fined in california while having the dust regulations heres what they said water down your roads every day so it doesnt have dust mud is okay dust is bad okay now that may be great for california i dont know what the water situation is in california but it hasnt rained in texas some kids are about to go off to school and havent seen rain in texas it hasnt rained so long but seriously i landed at the airport and looked out at this waterfall up here on the east coast and said holy cow we dont know what that looks like back home why dont they move all this water on the east coast down to texas where it hasnt rained to my knowledge in 6 months and half of my neighboring county of bastrop is burning to the ground because its so dry and so hot and we havent had a rain in so long we may be the only state in america thats praying that a hurricane will hit our coast so we can get some rain are you going to tell that farmer that the only way hes getting that water that hes feeding his animals is through shallow wells that may have gone dry on him or deep wells he has to drill to get to additional water under the ground or windmills that are pumping that water if you are out west which are not that deep and a lot of them have gone dryhis precious water that his livestock and his family needs to survive hes got to take it out and squirt it on his road so he can get home at night now does that make economic sense to the american people i dont think so but then if you sit in the big epa building in washington d c and have never even seen one of these roads and probably never been outside this beltway it may make perfect sense to that person in this paved world that we live in inside the beltway but it doesnt make sense to the average person thats trying to make a living all across the rural parts of the united states and not just rural but all across the united states where unfortunately we kick up dust by the way plowing kicks up dust so then you can only plow when the fields are wet did you ever plow when the fields are wet the only person who would sit in the epa office and think that the farm products magically appear at their grocery store would know that you cant get off in a muddy field and plow effectively yes you can turn up some moisture at the right time and you can keep dust down and farmers do they dont want their top soil blowing away like it did in the dust bowl theyve learned their lesson about that and theyre doing the best they can and i would commend them for doing it i went to school in lubbock texas back in the 1960s at the end of what we call the dust storm era and because of modern farming methods and so forth they still have dust storms up there but theyre nothing like what they had in the fifties nothing like what we had in the sixties and i would argue that because of good modern farming methods we keep the dust to a minimum but we still sometimes have half the state of new mexico blow through the panhandle of texas now who are you going to fine the state of new mexico the new mexico farmers the texas farmers where it lands whos going to be responsible for all that dust thats out there in the air well the epa says somebody is because they set regulations and that would be a violation of these regulations the biggest shortage of anything in this town is common sense this is the most nonsensical rule of anything thats come down one of our new freshman congressmen kristi noem is a smart lady she knows rural america she knows the ridiculousness of this set of epa rules shes come up with a farm dust bill which we will take up this winter to make epa start using some common sense the president was asked a question about this in one of his meetings here recently at a town hall he sent this farmer on a bureaucratic wild goose chase and he never got anything in return so as a result of that that farmer his efforts whichthat wild goose chase produced nothing that was satisfactoryrepresentative kristi noem of south dakota has h r 1633 which would protect american farmers and jobs by establishing a 1year prohibition against revising any national ambient air quality standards applicable to coarse particulate matterthats dustand limiting federal regulations of dust which are already regulated under state and local laws in other words let the states take care of it let me tell you something this is not one of those texas brags we had dust storms when i went to school where girls didnt wear dresses in the spring because it would pick up pea gravel the size of a dime with those 60mileanhour winds coming across the plains and it would blow that gravel so hard against their bare legs if they had on dresses it would literally cut them off if they tried to walk to class now thats an act of god nobody created that wind and certainly pea gravel is about as big a particulate matter that would be flying around anywhere but the federal government doesnt control the wind and it never will weve got to get some reasonableness back into whats going on finally because ive been talking about this now for over a year and in my office we are tracking every regulatory agency and every day were seeing new and bizarre concepts of what we need to do from regulatory agencieswere seeing bugs shut down major highway projects when the president laughed and he said he learned that shovelready jobs are not really shovelready jobs he should have gone on to tell you why many of those shovelready jobs werent shovel ready and it was because of regulations created by the regulatory agencies that stopped legitimate road and bridge projects that were funded i have one in my district right now that is funded and the dozers are on the ground ready to move and that project is shut down by one of these many many regulations its the same across the country we cant do today what fdr did its great to talk about what fdr did i dont think it accomplished a whole lot in getting us out of the depression but thats my opinion but the facts are you couldnt build a hoover dam today just up and go out there and start building a hoover dam my lord just to build an electric power plant the number of regulatory agencies and permits that you would have to have would cover the walls of this chamber before you even get to break ground ive seen those rules put on walls its an amazing number of rules we are a world of government control of everything thats what these regulatory acts are about finally this congressman john carter because of looking at this stuff now just for the last year or so i really and truly think the best thing we can do to give the stability to the employers who employ people is to basically ban the implementation of any new federal regulations from now through january 31 2013 guarantee a 2year window for businesses to hire without any fear of new costs from regulations and certain exceptions would be allowed for the military or foreign affairs or internal agency management and personnel rules so theyd still be able to have regulations that fit in those categories and make sure that we keep our foreign operations and our military operating they have to make rules to operate under we would exempt those particular things but the rest of them we would say timeout continue your studies continue your discussions i would encourage you to extend an arm out to business to say this is what were looking at lets hear what you think lets start putting ourselves together with the idea that people are part of this environment too people are really what makes up this country without people were just a barren land people to live need to have a job and the people who create jobs need to have a reason for hiring people and giving them a job people who have ideasthe great driving force of america the new idea we just have so many examples of new ideas just in the hightech industry and the communications industry the revolution that has taken place just in the last 10 years of new ideas those new ideas come from the freedom to think and the belief that you can take that idea and put it into reality without somebody stepping on your toes and preventing you from doing it these regulations and this control from washington d c this cradletograve mentality that seems to be running inside this beltway and the creation of these regulatory rules is putting the brakes on our economy and putting fear in the hearts of american entrepreneurs and businesspeople and employers who want to make their business better by hiring those good people that were graduating from our colleges and universities those good people that are trained in trained skills that we need to put to work in america and well put them to work in real jobs not governmentcreated jobs with borrowed money but real jobs that produce something and create wealth and make us and continue to keep us the most prosperous nation on earth it doesnt come from government it comes from the people the people are the wealth of this nationtheir ideas their entrepreneurship the investment of their own personal capital and their willingness to take a risk on america because they know america is great and to people who dont think were great or think that theyre smarter and can be inside this beltway and make rules that can do a better job of telling you how to run your life or how to drive home on your farm road than you know i say get out of the way thats what this fall is going to be about were going to be bringing these things up and these are things that are going to be discussed and talked about and voted on this fall because we republicans believe that the right path to create jobs and create wealth in america is to get the regulators to start thinking in terms of creating jobs not destroying jobs enhancing businesses not negating businesses and to put america back to work and if we put america back to work all the rest gets better the debt goes down the tax revenues go up the country has more to pay back the people we owe which ought to be our first priority we can get our financial house back in order we can get our credit rating back that was taken away from us and we can start operating like america has always operated the business of this country is business and as much as that was criticized back in the twenties that statement is true today just like it was then its the american people that give the american people jobs not the government lets put the brakes on these regulatory things were going to do that this fall i look forward to it pay attention to it members of this house and anyone around the country who has an interest pay attention to it give us your input because we are bound and determined to level out and stabilize that playing field that business creates jobs on so that we can put america back to work i thank you for your time and i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.001342389383353293, 0.001342389383353293, 0, "i thank the gentlelady for yielding i agree with most everything you said tonight but i have to disagree with you on one point with regard to medicare the president does have a plan i talk to seniors all over my district one of the things that makes our seniors so angry is that over the course of their lifetime the money that they have put in their social security accounts its been robbed its been taken out and spent for other things so what the president does in obamacare is he takes half a trillion dollars out of medicare and uses it to spend for obamacare everyone agrees that we have to fix medicare the president agrees theres a problem bill clinton agrees theres a problem republicans agree theres a problem how do we fix it well what the president does is says im going to institute the ipad board the independent payment advisory board this is a board thats going to look at prices that we pay our health care providers and its going to reduce those reimbursementsreimbursements that are already incredibly low what does that mean its going to affect the access to care for our current seniors that is absolutely unacceptable we have a plan in place thats going to save medicare its going to protect medicare and were going to continue this great program for future generations lets not be mistaken the president has a plan that is going to kill medicare and provide a lack of service to our seniors i do want to move from that to jobs though because that is what is on everyones mind as i travel central and northern wisconsin people are concerned about jobs theres a lack of opportunity theres a lack of prosperity and so i want to review what the democrats did which is they talked to folks who will come up with abstract theories they went and talked to university professors and they came up with an 800 billionplus stimulus bill remember that was their jobs plan 800 billion of government spending they said government spending will lead to economic growth prosperity wealth and sustainable jobs we know that government spending doesnt lead to sustainable jobs it has never worked it doesnt work and thats why when they promised that we would have unemployment of only 8 percent and we would create millions of jobs the alternative happened weve lost millions of jobs and weve had unemployment reach almost 10 percent what weve done is not talk to the professors who sit in the classroom ive gone out and talked to job creators people who are actually putting people in my community back to work and what do they say why arent they creating jobs they continually talk about uncertainty in the marketplace what does that mean when they talk about uncertainty they talk about a 14 3 trillion debt the fact that were going to borrow 12 5 trillion this year alone were going to borrow a trillion dollars every year for the next 10 years as the gentleman from illinois said we are cascading towards a cliff and theres a road sign that says danger pump the breaks youre about to go over thats what were going to do our job creators are saying listen with this massive debt it creates uncertainty it creates uncertainty because we dont know what interest rates are going to be in the very near future were concerned about inflation because government is printing money to purchase our debt theyre concerned about punishing tax increases theyre concerned about health care costs with obamacare as the gentlelady from alabama said theyre concerned about regulation in my district we have a great forest product industry we make paper in my district boiler mact is going to kill jobs in central wisconsin and send them to china where they have no regulation all these things have come together to create uncertainty which means our job creators arent reinvesting theyre not expanding theyre not growing theyre not innovating do you know what it doesnt hurt the job creator it hurts the families in our communities because they have a lack of opportunity for jobs i want to just point to a chart that we have here when we have recessions there is whats called symmetry if you have a ushaped decline in this recession youll have a ushaped recovery if you have a vshaped decline youll have a vshaped recovery thats our history and youll see that in this chart what has happened differently in this recession the great recession is weve had a vshaped decline the recovery has ticked up a little bit and then it has flatlined why has it flatlined because of the uncertainty that has been created coming from washington from our democrat colleagues on the other side of the aisle and this administration its causing a lack of willingness for our job creators to reinvest i want to bring up one last point i continually hear how our friends want to increase taxes on our job creators i think anyone who looks at that says we will not create jobs by taxing the job creator i think its a good example if those who say we should raise taxes are concerned about jobs going overseas its a pretty simple example that i use you have walmart and target and kmartall the bigbox retailers they compete against one another right theyre competing yet kmart is not doing so well theyre laying people off theyre closing stores right my friends on the other side of the aisle the democrats they would come in and they would advise kmart theyd say listen you have to bring in more revenue you have to keep these people employed you have to keep these stores open you need more revenue to bring in more revenue all you have to do is raise your prices if you raise your prices youll bring in more revenue we all know thats not what will happen if you raise your prices at kmart you will drive more shoppers to walmart and target if you raise the cost of doing business in america you are going to send more of our jobs to china india mexico vietnam but youre going to outsource these jobs because youre raising the cost of doing business in america lets make sure we make america a competitive place where our job creators can do what they do best which is to create jobs and to

the gentleman from arkansas is correct they kill jobs but yet i hear folks on this house floor i see folks on the left i see folks in the media arguing repeatedly that these regulations are actually good for business in fact robert reich argued earlier this year he said theres no necessary tradeoff between regulations and jobs in fact regulations that are designed well can generate innovation as companies compete to find the most efficient solutions and innovations can lead to more jobs as they spawn new products and industries 1610 regulations dont create innovation regulations dont create jobs they are a job killer this is a commonsense principle that i know a majority of americans agree with and its one that is completely refuted day after day on this house floor if we can come to an agreement that regulations dont create jobs we can get somewhere one of the reasons we dont and youve been debating that this afternoon is because they create additional burdens additional hoops and additional challenges for small business owners that were expecting to create twothirds of the jobs in this country in fact just for fun i brought down the stack of rules and regulations that have come out just in the last week every day our small business owners have to deal with another one of these another one of these every day theres last tuesday theres last wednesday theres last thursday theres last fridaya pile of new rules and regulations for business owners even if they dont affect them they still need to read them and follow them and hire folks to be able to respond to them you talk to folks at home you say are you creating jobs are you hiring new folks they say we are hiring a few folks in the compliance department so yes you might create a new job but youre killing the jobs in innovation entrepreneurship and free enterprise the other principle i want to leave with the folks here is that taxes dont create jobs taxing and spending doesnt create wealth that is something that is in dispute on this house floor if we could get an agreement with both parties that regulations dont create jobs and taxing and spending doesnt create jobs we would be going a long way to solving this debate so when folks at home wonder why are they arguing so much why cant they ever get anything done why arent they moving forward because were debating basic commonsense principles of the free enterprise system and folks come down here and argue hey these regulations are good for jobs hey these new tax increases thats good to create jobs were not going to get the free enterprise system going while were smacking them down with new taxes and new regulations every day i appreciate the gentleman from arkansas the gentleman from colorado and others down here having this

going to be but i felt sure you were going to answer the way you did for the simple reason that we hear our colleagues on the other side the democrats keep talking about wanting to create jobs but their policies are destroying jobsamerican jobs private pay jobs their policies are developing bigger jobs bigger government here in washington d c so much so that the only city in this country that real estate prices have not gone down is washington d c theyve gone up why because this administration nancy pelosi harry reid and their colleagues in the house and the senate in the 111th congress are creating bigger government more regulations more taxes more attacks on jobs in the private sector more attacks on small businesses and its creating a bigger government thus higher real estate prices here in washington because weve created government jobs they claim about all the jobs created with the stimulus bill et cetera but its government jobs is pretty much what were creating weve got another problem in fact i introduced h r 1032 the relief act because we have excessive and frivolous lawsuits against our own energy production and it has significantly delayed and in many cases prevented our energy resources from reaching the american marketplace h r 1032 the relief act doesnt stop people from having their day in court but what it would do is it would allow the environmental wackos that are trying to stop energy production here in this country from having this endless plethora of lawsuits that stop the permitting and stop the production what it would do is it would require that all lawsuits be filed within 60 days and that the courts would have to have a determination or solution to that case within 180 days and that if the district court ruling was appealed that it would go to the supreme court and the supreme court would have a ruling within another 180 days it would also allow some relief from the frivolous lawsuits by allowing the prevailing party to be able to seek legal fees and other expenses under the act this is the kind of bill that we need to pass ive been asking members of congress to cosponsor this because we need to pass this kind of

people can do is contact their members of the senate and the house and demand that we start producing american energy america is not secure as a nation because were not energy secure weve got to start

taxes on the american people but only a majority to cut spending well maybe some people have been in washington too long to realize it but the american people want to tie washingtons hands and make it easier to cut spending than raise taxes they want to cap the growth of government they want to require a balanced budget for decades weve heard excuses for why washingtons special and shouldnt be forced to balance its budget its time to tell those people that their scare tactics are over this is a new day in america the people are sovereign and today the people demand accountability they demand a responsible constrained government they demand a balanced budget clearly washington is never going to choose to balance its budget so the people demand that we force it to fortynine out of fifty states have some form of a balanced budget amendment if 98 percent of the states know this is a wise plan why do washington politicians fight tooth and nail against it the answer is plain and simple power they will try to scare the american people any way they can to avoid losing power over this massive bloated bureaucracy they will say today that they must have this power or else they cant keep taking care of people they will try to scare seniors to continue their unrestrained power to borrow they say they will manage their borrowing power wisely they will restrain themselves well talk is cheap and ive heard this same line for decades what matters are results how have washington politicians been managing their borrowing power one number will tell you 14 3 trillionthe amount of our debt today a balanced budget amendment is essential because the government has shown time and time again that until we restrain its spending with fiscal handcuffs the problem will continue president obama has only made our spending problem worse by adding 3 7 trillion to the national debt in just 2 years the president has spent more money in less time than any other leader in american history last week president obama told republicans dont call my bluff well i for one think this game has gone on long enough the power needs to be restrained as lord acton famously said all power tends to corrupt absolute power corrupts absolutely today we fight back against this corruption of absolute power today we stand with the american people today we vote to return the power to the people we invite president obama to get on board oppose this runaway spending and pass a balanced budget five years ago he agreed on march 16 2006 thensenator barack obama stood in the well of the senate and said the fact that we are here today to debate raising americas debt limit is a sign of leadership failure he spoke of the commonsense budgeting principle of balancing expenses and revenues but then 5 years down the road unfortunately president obama is singing a different tune he has demanded more borrowing authority with no strings attached when his own party voted against that proposal a few weeks ago he started telling us that we must raise the debt ceiling and called our commonsense budgeting reforms gimmicks and radical well heres what im hearing from people in missouri my district thats where common sense is heres reggie from adrian missouri raising the debt ceiling is like handing five more credit cards to someone who has already maxed out 50 other credit cards and then sitting back and saying you fixed the problem how dumb would that be heres from michael in sedalia dont give in as a veteran receiving a pension i continue to stand behind you and the house leadership in expecting meaningful spending cuts before raising the debt ceiling without raising taxes taxpayers dont like whats going on and we arent going to sit by and watch anymore heres from margaret from lake ozark a minimum of 4 billion over 10 years is a drop in the bucket we also need a constitutional amendment since our leaders cant seem to stop spending and do the right thing do the right thing now heres from judy from warsaw missouri the very idea of increasing the debt limit to get us out of trouble is absurd you cannot borrow your way out of trouble deal with it cut the pork mark from camdenton missouri we have always had to live within our means and it is time for the government to do the same we cant have everything we want the government needs to be reduced i do not think my children and grandchildren should pay for our lack of responsibility larry from conway missouri this is a turning point in history i agree lets do the right thing today lets pass cut cap and

common sense when we need to cut spending washington finds a way to spend more when we need to create jobs washington piles on new regulations that put americans out of work when we spend billions of dollars to create a safe permanent storage facility for our countrys nuclear waste politics gets in the way and that facility is shut down like millions of americans across the country im tired that politics is getting in the way and im looking to bring some common sense back to this republic and as you know theres no better example of putting politics before country than the case of yucca mountain yucca mountain is a multibilliondollar project that was supposed to be the solution for storing our countrys nuclear materials ratepayers in states like south carolina ratepayers like my constituents have poured billions of dollars into the development of yucca mountain as a nuclear repository this administration needs to understand that america runs by the rule of law and depositing our nuclear waste at yucca mountain is the law of the land this administration does not get to make willynilly decisions to benefit supporters without congressional approval and when congress spoke in the national waste policy act it made yucca mountain the law of the land i was deeply disappointed when the presidential candidates were recently asked about yucca mountain i was astonished that these good folks would echo the failed rhetoric of senator harry reid and i would remind all the presidential candidates of the federal governments promise to construct a longterm storage facility for the legacy weapons materials temporarily being stored in south carolina and i would remind them that this is the law of the land i suspect that many south carolina voters including myself will expect to hear the presidential candidates plan to solve this problem during their next visit to the palmetto state but lets talk about the states rights aspect of this where is south carolinas right to be rid of this waste this is a federally created problem the residual waste of our cold war weapons programs whole towns in my district were relocated by the federal government to create the savannah river site im not saying that we dont want the savannah river site to continue the important nuclear nonproliferation work of the nation and i commend nnsas recent announcement concerning the conversion of some of the plutonium material into mixed oxide fuel for commercial reactors what i am saying is that the nation needs to do right by south carolina and fulfill the promise to take care of the radioactive waste and get it out of our state yucca mountain is a geologically stable location its the right location for the job it doesnt get much rain its in the middle of nowhere and when it does rain the arid climate evaporates the water but lets take for instance that it may rain a lot one day for leakage to happen at yucca mountain would require that little bit of water that doesnt evaporate to transpose through a thousand feet of granitelike rock and then its going to get to our concrete vault and inside that concrete vault are stainless steel canisters so the water erodes and transfers through a thousand feet of granite rock through the concrete through the stainless steel and it comes in contact with radioactive glass glassified material that its got to erode and then the water has to transfer that material through more stainless steel through more concrete through another thousand feet of nonporous rock down to an aquifer that is a closed system this is why yucca mountain is the right place to do the job no one thinks that rolling fields next to a river that is a water source for two states as it is at savannah river site is a longterm answer to nuclear waste disposal the sooner we recognize this the sooner we can deal with the real problem now the department of energys blue ribbon commission is circulating a draft report on the future of americas nuclear waste including the nuclear waste currently being temporarily stored at the savannah river site the savannah river site can only be a shortterm home for this waste the best longterm outlook for the waste of this sort is in a deep geological site hence the need for yucca mountain the waste stored at savannah river site can be processed for a number of purposes but ultimately this waste needs to go deep underground i urge representative lee hamilton and general brent scowcroft the cochairs of the blue ribbon commission to reconsider their draft report to include yucca mountain as the longterm disposal site that congress mandated americans have already given billions of dollars to the state of nevada for the construction of a safe longterm storage site for nuclear material president obama and senator reid shouldnt be able to have it both ways nevada must either rebate the billions of dollars already spent on yucca mountain or stand out of the way and allow the facility to open for business it would create jobs in the state of nevada south carolina has unfairly carried the burden for storing nuclear material for decades already its time for this waste to move on may god continue

has perhaps eclipsed every other issue that has come before us in this halfyear period of time that related to our national debt and the anticipated expiration of our debt limit which will hit in just a couple weeks many americans are understandably concerned and have articulated the concern that if we pass the debt limit deadline of august 2 without raising the debt limit there could be catastrophic financial consequences in light of that i along with a number of my republican colleagues both in the senate and in the house have introduced legislation called the cut cap and balance act to address the debt limit to address it head on it says we will raise the debt limit if three conditions are met first that we make significant cuts to domestic discretionary spending for the fiscal year 2012 budget second we need statutory spending caps to put us on a smooth but steady glidepath toward balancing our budget sometime within the next decade third we need a balanced budget amendment passed out of congress and submitted to the states for ratification we think all three of these steps are necessarily required before we take the significant additional step of raising the debt limit because of the fact that it took us a long time to get to this point the point where by the end of the year we will have accumulated 15 trillion in debtabout 50 000 for every man woman and child in america between 120 000 and 150 000 for every wage earner in america this is a lot of moneybefore we extend that debt limit again by an additional 2 4 trillion we have to solve the problem we have to address the problem that led to its creation in a real lasting binding fundamental way that is why the most critical part of this legislation while each part is important happens to be found in that which rests upon the idea of a balanced budget amendment to the constitution we as members of congress could decide right now that over the next 10 years or 15 years it might be a good idea to cut spending by 2 trillion 3 trillion 4 trillion 5 trillion 6 trillion perhaps morebut if we made that promise today as a downpayment to the american people in exchange for the permission of the people to raise the debt limit it is a promise we cannot make good on because we cannot bind a future congress this congress was sworn in in january of 2011 elections will be held in november of 2012 and a new congress will be sworn in based on those elections in january 2013 the same thing will happen again in january 2015 and every 2 years after that for the duration of our republic the decisions we make right here right now can affect the here and now and can be binding for the here and now but we cannot reasonably expect and we cannot ask the american people when making a decision so longlasting and precedentsetting as this one to simply trust us that future congresses will see things the same way we do the only way we can bind a future congress is by amending our law of laws that 224yearold document painstakingly ironed out by some of the brightest men of the last several centuries in philadelphia 224 years ago when we amend the constitution we make it possible to bind a future congress that is what we need to do we have had some interesting debate and discussion surrounding this proposal last friday i listened with surprise and dismay as our president said we dont need to amend the constitution to require a balanced budget but we do need to balance our budget in the opinion of the president congress just needs to do its job not amend the constitution i think i understand his point i think he is suggesting that for congress to do its job it needs to balance its budget but i have to ask the question how has that worked out for us have past congresses balanced their budgets has the current congress balanced its budget overwhelmingly the answer is no it happens every now and then some would describe those instances where it has balanced in the last two or three decades as an accident others a momentary blip still others would suggest it was the product of accounting gimmickry rather than an actual act of budget balancing when that occurred regardless we know that balanced federal budgets are newsworthy indeed because they are very rare i look forward to the day when they are no longer newsworthy when they are customary and the only way to make them customary based on our experience as americans throughout most of our nations history is by amending the constitution to require it to make this a binding and permanent law i was shocked and dismayed again to learn that our senate majority leader senator reid from nevada stated just a few hours ago that he does not like this legislation he made some very disparaging comments about it notwithstanding the fact and completely ignoring the fact that this is not just the best legislation to address the debt limit issue right now it is the only legislation it is the only legislation that addresses this issue that is moving through congress and that has been reduced to legislative language it is certainly the only one that has been passed by one body of congress and is now moving over to the senate he is criticizing something when he himself has not offered anything this is the only show in town given how close we now are to the august 2 deadline and in part because we punted this so long and in part because we have not been having the debate and discussion in congress we should have been having for months this is it this is the only proposal if senator reid has suggestions on how we might change this proposal i am all ears i would love to hear what they are if he has his own proposal i would love to see what that is but simply to stand from that desk over there and disparage this legislation is inexcusable absolutely inexcusable given the fact that he has offered nothing let me read some of his words he said the american people should understand that this this meaning the cut cap and balance act is a bad piece of legislation perhaps some of the worst legislation in the history of this country i dont know what he is referring to he didnt give specifics nor has he given any specifics on what he would like to see in its place or how it could be improved my suggestion to our senate majority leader is if he has ideas please put them on the table because as we approach this debt limit deadline we are running out of time the clock has been ticking for 6 months we have known this was going to happen this is not news to us why then has there been so little debate and discussion in this body why is it that we spent weeks and weeks and weeks often dealing with legislation that paled in comparison to the importance of this issue the clock kept ticking and we kept debating and discussing other legislation far less important this in my opinion was a gross dereliction of duty but we still have a few weeks we can still deal with it we can still address it i suggest strongly that we address it by starting with that legislation that has actually been proposed and that we have full debate and discussion but no we are told even after the house of representatives earlier this week passed the cut cap and balance act passed it with bipartisan support by the wayno fewer than five members of the democratic caucus in the house of representatives voted to support this that was passed tuesday night we were told later we would be having a vote on saturday or perhaps monday then just a little while ago we were informed by the senate majority leader that the vote would be tomorrow giving us little or no time for actual debate and discussion on the floor of what is still to this moment the only legislation moving through to address this issue this is not an appropriate moment for demagoguery demagoguery on an issue this important can result in a lot of unnecessary pain no one disputes that there could be significant negative economic consequences associated with not raising the debt limit i do not dispute that not for a moment that is exactly why i put my neck on the line in order to file this legislation because nothing else was moving forward i didnt want to do it but when i was sworn in as a senator just a few months ago i understood it was my obligation to do what i could to make things better to make our constitutional system work so i filed it it is an insult not only to me and to my colleagues but to all americans when addressing an issue this important to have so little debate and discussion over this issue i find it appalling i find it reprehensible i demand an explanation and i demand an alternative solution if the senate majority leader is going to pick this apart and say he will not do it moreover i will remind the senate majority leader that just a few short years ago in 2006 when we had a different president belonging to a different party and this body was in control of another party if my memory serves me correctly not only did thensenator barack obama vote against raising the debt limit calling the need to do so the product of a failure of leadership that he was not willing to condone and perpetuate but every single one of his democratic colleagues joined him in that vote not one of them voted to raise the debt limit here we are again approaching the debt limit here we are again with only republicans stepping to the plate and offering a solution only this time the solution is a permanent one unfortunately in 2006 and prior and in subsequent debt limit extension votes there was no serious debate attached to it as to a permanent solution we have to amend the governing document the law of laws the only kind of law that can bind future congresses in order to solve this problem we have to do it now this is part of what it means to be an american we as americans crave liberty and we eschew tyranny to any degree every single time we authorize deficit spending we fuel the unfettered expansion of the federal government and all its power we commit ourselves and our posterity to a future that will include working more and more hours and days and weeks and even months just to pay their federal tax bills every single year that is time they will not get back that is time we will not get back that erodes our individual liberty it also erodes our liberty when the same regulatory structure that exists today grows bigger and bigger every year because we are borrowing now more than 1 5 trillion every single yearnot because of some aberrational condition some unusual development that requires an unusual expenditure of borrowed money but just to cover our basic daytoday operations this is what fuels the perpetual expansion of government and when government expands perpetually our individual liberty is diminished unfortunately and to a corresponding degree this is unacceptable but there is a way home the way home is found in limiting the role of government we can limit the role of government most effectively at this point in time i believe by limiting the pool of money to which congress has access the only way to do that is through a constitutional amendment i wish to close by addressing one final argument that sometimes has been used in response to and against the cut cap and balance act many of its detractors are making the claim that i find extraordinary a claim that says why are you even supporting this because it cant pass it is a little bit akin to saying why do we even play the super bowl when it is expected that one team is going to beat the other team we have to play but this one is not a game this one is for real when we vote after debating and discussing members of this body can and will be held accountable to our constituents so it will be up to me and each of my colleagues in this body to decide how to vote on this issue for those who make the unfortunate decision to vote against this notwithstanding the fact that 75 percent of the american people strongly support the idea of a balanced budget amendment notwithstanding the fact that 66 percent of americansboth of these figures according to a cnn poll todaysupport the principles underlying cut cap and balance notwithstanding the fact that this is the only permanent way of solving our debt problem if members of congress and members of this body choose to vote against this legislation they will do so i believe at their own peril they will have to face their constituents and explain why a handful of them were unwilling to raise the debt limit unwilling to address this problem unwilling to fix the perpetual deficit spending habit of congress simply because they did not want a balanced budget amendment to the constitution i think that is a tall order i think that is difficult to explain i think those who try to make that explanation to their constituents will do so at their own political peril but more importantly the vote they cast will be at the peril of the people of the united states of america of their liberty of their economic stability and of their ability to prosper now and in the future we can turn this ship around but in order do it we need robust debate and discussion and our constituents deserve more the american people deserve more than to have the kind of sleightofhand scheduling and the kind of dismissive cavalier attitude toward what is being characterized correctly by many as the fight of an entire generation we need to pass the cut cap and balance act it is not only the best solution it is the only solution the time is running out and i urge each of my colleagues to support this thank you mr president i yield the floor"], [0.9945012079551816, 0.005498792044818401, 1,

unfortunately devastatingly there are nearly 13 million people in america who are still unemployed and many millions more have even given up on looking for jobs three years ago the white house said that because of the stimulus package unemployment would not exceed 8 percent that has not happened in fact the unemployment rate has topped 8 percent for 36 straight months nowthe longest stretch of high unemployment since the great depression the congressional budget office predicts it is going to go even longer we will not see sub8 percent unemployment according to the cbo until 2014 the president sold his stimulus package to the american people by claiming he would make immediate investments in what he characterized as shovelready jobs but last june the president acknowledged that shovelready was not as shovelready as we expected nevertheless a lot of money has been spent as we have been waiting for these jobs to materializejobs that never quite came about in fact some of it was spent in ways that have nothing to do with stimulating the economy for example consider some of the ways in which this stimulus money has been spent mr president 760 000 was spent on interactive

acceleration of social securitys bankruptcy last year congress voted for a payroll tax cut that averages roughly 1 000 for every working family in america as warned it failed to stimulate economic growth and it accelerated the collapse of the social security system but as promised it threw every working family a vital lifeline in very tough economic times we need to meet three conflicting objectives we need to continue the payroll tax cut we need to stimulate real economic growth and we need to avoid doing further damage to the social security system first we need to understand that not all tax cuts stimulate lasting economic growth cutting marginal tax rates does so because it changes the incentives that individuals respond to cutting inframarginal tax rates such as the payroll tax does not but that payroll tax cut did make a huge difference in the ability of working families to make ends meet in a time of declining family incomes and steadily rising prices to restore that payroll tax rate today given the economic pressures on working families is simply unthinkable yet at the same time the payroll tax is what supports the social security system last year that system entered a state of permanent deficit and this condition will worsen until the social security system bankrupts in 2036 at that moment every retiree will suffer a sudden and permanent drop in benefits of roughly 25 percent further reducing the revenues into that system will hasten this day of reckoning just as bad in the intervening time the expanding social security deficit will heap growing burdens on the nations already staggering public debt now some have proposed paying for the inframarginal payroll tax cut that doesnt help the economy with a marginal tax hike that actually harms the economy surely we can do better than that actually congressman landry of louisiana has done better and i commend his proposal to the attention of the house it avoids damaging the social security fund while at the same time offering families continued relief from crushing payroll taxes his measure h r 3551 the social security preservation through individual choice enhancement or sspice act constitutes the most realistic and innovative approach to these twin and related crises that has yet been placed before congress by linking the cost of social security to the benefits that it provides h r 3551 would give every american the choice of paying a lower payroll tax each year in exchange for working a month longer thats all it would take to pay for itselfa months delay in retirement for a years worth of tax relief for the first time individuals can make this choice to pay a lower payroll tax based on their own circumstances without further undermining the fiscal integrity of the social security system or the financial security of those relying on that system for the first time costs and benefits would be linked in a manner that all consumers can understand and judge for themselves based on their own circumstances in a difficult year like this i think most families would rather save the extra tax and work the extra month in better times ahead they may choose to pay the extra tax to maintain their retirement schedule but it will be their choice based on their needs their plans and their best judgment and not the governments and by linking costs with benefits it will protect

cant bring up a transportation bill a 2year bill because were just out of money but yet mr karzai you can get your 10 billion a month and you can negotiate with the taliban and take the 10 billion that were borrowing from the chinese to give to karzai so they can buy weapons to kill the american soldiers and marines it just does not make any sense i have put together a resolution that i have asked the speaker of the north carolina house of representatives thom tillis who is a great gentleman to introduce in the may session of the north carolina house asking the congress to bring our troops home out of afghanistan before the 2014 deadline and im pleased to say that the tea party in my district who doesnt agree with me on everything does agree with me on afghanistan they have

these days perhaps in the nottoodistant past it was more common but i think it shows that theres an opportunity for actually good bigpicture agreements on what we need to do in general although we may disagree on some of the particulars id like to point out some of the real problems that my colleague from wisconsin alluded to first and foremost i have got a chart here that talks about the amount of money were actually borrowing to make our payments in this country hes right were spending way too much were spending almost 3 6 trillion our revenues only about 2 2 trillion were borrowing almost 40 percent of what we spend you cant do that in your household folks you cant do that in your small business and we shouldnt be doing that and cant do that as the greatest nation on earth and keep our fiscal balance sheets in play right now our debt is almost up to 15 trillion and our deficit has been stuck at 1 3 trillion for the last 3 years the projections are even worse i would like to show a chart that shows the longterm projections given the current rate of spending at our level of revenues which are quite low at this point in time its a little bit busy but theres a grayer portion down below you can see that talks about the actual current law budget thats the stuff that my friend in wisconsin and i have to budget to that the congressional budget office puts out but the real budget is what the committee for a responsible federal budget talks about thats the real longterm debt that were dealing with that assumes unlike the current law budget that were not going to eliminate all the tax breaks to middle class americans different corporations it assumes that were not going to have docs have to pony up a 30 percent cut in their wages to make ends meet and it also assumes that were going to do something to keep the alternative minimum tax from affecting middle class americans i would also like to point out that this is not a good picture you look at whats happened historically were in a really bad situation at this point in time and there are some pretty big historical drivers to this id like to switch to a different chart this chart shows historically where our revenues and our spending have been the top line here is our spending this lacquer line down below is our revenues they have been a little out of whack forever only during the years when we had a democrat president and a republican congress were they back in good shape that was just 15 years ago but you can see that we historically have had our revenues probably in the 18 to 18 5 percent range and our expenditures in the 20 percent range not great but were worse now were at 25 percent and spending and only 14 or 15 percent in revenues to emphasize the point my colleague from wisconsin made so weve got to really work at getting this stuff back under control or were not going to be where we need to be id point out real quick that to that point were actually giving away almost a trillion dollars in tax breaks and i think my colleague has some good points hes going to make in a moment on that and weve got to get this tax code under control as a small businessman you cant possibly do your own tax you cant even come close when i started my veterinary business way back whenim not going to say how old i was my friendbut i could actually do my own taxes thats impossible these days thats impossible and it shouldnt be that byzantine the other piece of the problem here is the entitlement system people dont want to admit this particularly people on my side of the aisle but were going broke here in the medicare system the bottom blue is social security medicaid and other health expenditures is the green and medicare is up at the top there and heres our revenue line were busting through with medicare thats not because of malfeasance yeah theres some waste fraud and abuse that we have got to get under control and im sure we can get it under control but there are some simple economics here in 1960 there were five workers for every one beneficiary right now there are only three workers for every beneficiary and in 2035 there will be two workers for every beneficiaryless money in to take care of more folks back in 1975 we had about 25 million beneficiaries i believe now it is almost 89 million beneficiaries and the cost per medicare recipient has gone through the roof we are living longer hopefully living healthier lives in 1975 we spent about 2 000 per medicare enrollee thats hard to believe in this day and age now its 18 000 so more people more expensive care which is good quality care and frankly fewer workers to provide for the benefits adds up to this huge growth in spending that will be facing us over the next few years unless we get our act together at this point in time"], [0.992733683437109, 0.0072663165628910065, 1, "i thank the gentlelady from massachusetts for yielding me the time i would just like to say to the gentleman from

office to handle these cases we continue to place the unit commanders and the base commanders in a conflict of interest what happens when the unit commander is in fact the assailant that means that the rape victim has to go to her rapist and seek to have help and to report that rape to her unit commander what we need to do is create an independent authority that will have the expertise which a unit commander is not going to have regarding sexual assault and rape and have investigators who have again the expertise to look at these cases so that the unit commanders and the base commanders are

done right now i dont come to this with any kind of ideological knee jerk i am one who believes that you need to go and look and ive been to colombia on several different occasions once with commerce secretary gutierrez we went out to community meetings we sat down and listened to people talk president uribe had a community meeting and we saw what was going on ive been to medellin which was one of the most dangerous cities in central americain fact in the world and one day when one of the drug lords was taken out the people of medellin said no mas no more we dont want anymore colombia has come a long way from the image that people have of that country but there still are problemstoo many remainingand the efforts to address them have not been really activated now the labor problems are really grave last year more union leaders were killed in colombia than the rest of the world combined nearly every murder has been gotten away with no one has been arrested no prosecution nothing now effective organizing would save lives in colombia just like it has in the rest of the world but colombian laws compound this culture of impunity by making it easy to deny workers their basic rights imagine what it does to a worker thinking about joining a union to improve his lot or her lot no wonder only 4 4 percent of colombias labor force dares to unionize democrats have been clear from the very start that this situation needs to be addressedfor the sake of the working people in colombia for the safety of colombian workers and their families and for the working people here in the united states because the working community around the world is all one really what happens to workers in one area has an effect in other areas and if we allow people to take jobs where the cheapest labor is or where there are no rules or no anything we then damage our own workers and thats part of the problem in this whole issue as we discuss it here tonight now to be sure weve made some important victories in trying to renegotiate this agreement after the bush administration had written these agreements we said no and then we took over in the house and mr rangel and mr levin negotiated the may
