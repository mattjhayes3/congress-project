that i have cosponsored as a new member of this body was in fact in cosponsoring the legislation for term limitations i think it is extremely important to recognize that there is no silver bullet that you can fire at the congress and reform it in one shot the war i guess for congressional reform would be won over the many little battles we win over a time and term limitations just happens to be one of those many little battles that will help reform this institution i think that is important for all of us to recognize you can bring this issue so close that i just returned from having 21 town meetings in 20 counties that i have in northern indiana over the last 2 weeks i still recognize that even from that from those 21 town mieetings that there is still a tremindous trust deficit that the american people have with their government just from the last 2 weeks part of that trust deficit is that they feel that members of congress are not responsive to the people any many of those concerned are saying wait a minute we are sendingthe message to cut spending first instead of raising taxes and hear that congress out there raised taxes without streamlining the effectiveness of government what are you guys doing and so the message one of those messages of reform we talk about things like term limitations we try to say is that the answer that will make this body this institution more responsive to the cries of people that are out there i think it can in fact be one of those tools to be more responsive but i can say that as a new member of this institution of the congress that not only one of the reasons that this congress is not responsive has to do with that the committee on rules that sits right up i have learned that the committee on rules is a committee that is an arm an extension of the speaker of the house that it is controlled by 9 to 4 it is 2 to 1 plus 1 it is not even proportional to the membership of this body and when that rules committee controls the agenda the flow of legislation that comes to this house floor that in and of itself makes this body unresponsive to the will of the people because there are many representatives many congressmen and congresswomen republicans and democrats alike who come to play an active constructive role in our government we are finding out we are shut out of the process so there are many little things not only the term limitations but also changing the rules committee likewise so this body becomes more responsive one thing in particular that i have noticed on this whole quest for term limitations is that we have states out there who have enacted term limitations right now let us take california for example when you have members that can only serve three terms and you do not change the seniority system of this congress now california has placed their membership and placed their state in more jeopardy because there are other states out there that have not passed term limitations and pretty soon you are going to have those other states that do not enact term limitations go in positions of seniority and that is why i feel that your leadership and the direction for a constitutional amendment for term limitations to set the standard is the way to do it not letting the states out there set all those standards i think that is extremely important"], [3.233065945096314e-05, 3.233065945096314e-05, 0, "i am going to change the subject a little bit from an international issue to a domestic issue which is troubling me and troubling a lot of us from the state of california two years ago i came here as a former small business owner thinking that i could have a real opportunity to help this nations small businesses however i found out over the last 2 weeks that that is not necessarily true let me tell what happened the lkst 2 weeks several weeks ago i found out that sba a federal agency that is supposed to act as an advocate of small businesses spent over 100 000 of taxpayers money to promote employee mandates i was shocked that the sba would do such a thing especially since small business owners and employees overwhelmingly oppose employer mandates they are frightened for good reason every credible study predicts substantial job losses as a result of the employer mandates so i decided to offer an amendment which would change this ridiculous situation my amendment was simple it would prohibit the sba from spending taxpayer dollars to promote employer mandates the first thing i found out is that my amendment will not be allowed to be offered on the floor unless the rules committee approves the rules committee decides which amendments can and cannot be offered on the house floor for debate so i went to the rules committee to offer my amendment i thought that this was a simple amendment and that it should not have any problem being accepted when i walked into the rules committee i was surprised i found out something interesting there are nine democrats and only four republicans serving on that committee suddenly i had a bad feeling about my amendments chances sure enough the democratcontrolled rules committee rejected my amendment remember my amendment is simply asking sba not to spend taxpayers money to promote employer mandates it was simply rejected they said that the sba bill was not the appropriate place to debate health care issues despite the fact that my amendment dealt specifically with the sba and despite the fact that our own house parliamentarian ruled that my amendment was perfectly germane this ruling was obviously very unfair so i went to the house floor to try and overturn the rules committees decision and you can guess it i was defeated again even though 10 brave democrats stood up lid joined all of the republicans in voting to overturn this unfair decision my amendment again was blocked despite this defeat i was not willing to give up the fight for small businesses in fact i found out that i had one last chance to get a vote on my amendment i decided to offer a socalled motion to recommit which would have forced the house to debate and vote on my amendment just as i was preparing to offer my motion the democratic leadership removed the entire sba billthe bill i was trying to amendoff the floor why did they do this let me tell you why because they did not want to have a vote on my amendment they are scared to have a vote on my amendment they are terrified that this body might actually pass my amendment and reveal the truth that the american people dont want employer mandates and being taken over by government small business people do not want employer mandates california people do not want employer mandates because they know that with employer mandates it is not a question of whether jobs will be lost it is just a question of how many jobs will be lost this is exactly why the american people are so frustrated with congress they are frustrated because instead of debating issues openly and honestly the democrat leadership of this body delays and hides behind parliamentary rules the american people are frustrated because instead of telling the truth about employer mandates the democratic leadership uses its dominance of the house to force members to toe the biggovernment line on health care reform the american people should know the democrat leadership is holding a bill hostage which would provide funding for an entire agency because they do not want to deal with employer mandates which is my amendment sadly this is just business as usual in the house of representatives i am

have an opportunity to work to help small businesses unfortunately that doesnt seem to be the case this morning i was going to offer an amendment to a billh r 4801which was scheduled to be debated and voted on today but suddenly the entire bill was removed my amendment was simple it would prohibit the small business administration from spending taxpayer dollars to promote employer mandates this amendment is necessary because the sba spent over 100 000 in fiscal year 1994 funds to promote employer mandates telling small business owners that employer mandates would be good for them the sba has also spent appropriated funds to send erskine bowles the sba administrator to town hall meetings to spread the word about the benefits of employer mandates what is disturbing about this is that the sba 1s promoting employer mandates in spite of the fact that employer mandates will hurt the very small businesses that the sba is supposed to rep resent in case you have any doubt about this fact just look at the evidence almost every credible study predicts substantial wage and job loss as a result of employer mandates a study by the consad research corp for example predicts that over 1 million workers could lose their jobs as a result of employer mandates another study done by the state of california predicts that over 3 million employees will lose theirjobs the evidence also shows that the owners and employees of small businesses are overwhelmingly opposed to employer mandates for example in six out of seven white house conferences on small business held in seven different states small business owners voted overwhelmingly to reject employer mandates in other words the sba has spent taxpayer dollars to promote a policy which the evidence shows will be bad for small businesses and which the owners and employees of small businesses overwhelmingly oppose my amendment would address this shameful situation by prohibiting the small business administration from spending funds authorized by h r 4801 to promote employer mandates then the rules committee which decides what amendments are allowed to be offered on the floor voted to prohibit me from offering my amendmenteven though the amendment was ruled perfectly germane by the house parliamentarian in response to this ridiculous situation i was going to offer a motion to recommit before the vote on final passage this motion would have forced the house to vote on my amendment not surprisingly just as i was preparing to offer my motion the democratic leadership without any warningsuddenly decided to pull h r 4801 from the floor despite the fact that we had already started to debate the bill last friday why did they do this the answer is simple they are terrified they are terrified that if the issue of employer mandates comes up for a vote in the house this body might vote to reject this jobkilling proposal in fact they are so terrified that they wont even let my amendmentwhich is a simple amendment dealing with the activities of the sba come to the floor for a vote this is an example of why the american people are so frustrated with congress this body is supposed to debate issues but

the committee on rules in trying to make your case too unfortunately with our nine to four ratio up there it makes it extraordinarily tougli to get some of these thoughtful amendments that the american people would like to see passed even open for consideration here on the house floor that is one of the oder reforms that was among the 25 amendments that i had offered because they we tragically see is a pattern of waiving the rules of the house i offered an amendment when we were in our markup last november in which i said we should allow the majority to pass the rules under which this house will operate by a majority vote and if the majority wants to say that we will change the rules we should change the rules by a majority vote but once those rules are in place we should not have a pattern of regularly waiving the rules of the house and in fact if the membership decides it is important to waive the rules we should have a threefifths vote in fact if we are going to violate the rules weshould have a threefifths vote to say this is a matter that needs to be addressed and we should proceed with it for example waiving the three day layover if there an emergency item that has to get to the floor of the congress immedfately we should be able to waive that by a threefifths vote it seems to me if we are going to have rules here we should play by them the way they are outlined hin a very responsible way at the outset i remember the statements made by our former colleague the late mr natcher who constantly said to me over and over agairn what we should do is simply comply with the standing rules of the house he was always very concerned at the arrogance with which this institution run by the democrat majority would regularly just cast aside these rules i would like at this time to yield to my very good friend from washington who is also a member of the committee i say to my friend from colorado he can continue as part of this conversation i do not want to limit by any means the opportunity for people to be involved i know myfriend from washington who again worked long and hard on that committee came in i was so impressed in her first days in the

greatest concern to this member and i really am not concerned about moving this particular rule through and proceeding on with the debate i am concerned however with some of the things that are going to be debated as a part of this rules procedure there is no doubt that the american people in the latest election gave this congress and this government a mandate for change we republicans were on the wrong end of that particular mandate and president clinton was elected and there is no doubt the american people want change however if you look at the bill that is being brought to the floor under this particular rule you will find that this aint change it is more of the same and the reason why i say that there is no part of this supplemental appropriation or stimulus that is a change is because when you look at the details you will find that this is the same old spending game that congress has gone through for years and years and years and years and it is the reason why we today have massive deficits and have massive debt let me give a few examples that are down in this supplemental appropriation bill for example there is a large amount of spending that comes under the jurisdiction of the committee on science space and technology that is in this bill that is unauthorized we have a problem in this congress when we begin to spend money that has not been properly authorized under law when in fact what we do is spend money that is being spent over and above the obligations of law we have had several discussions in the joint committee on reorganization of the congress on which i serve where authorizing chairmen and the distinguished chairman of the committee on appropriations the gentleman from kentucky who is here on the floor today have come before our committee on reorganization and stated flatly that we ought not have any more unauthorized money being passed in appropriations bills that it is time to reform tiis process that the congress and the country are being badly abused by what is going on and yet in the package that will be brought to the floor and debated this afternoon i find the following items there is 103 million for adp that is under the american technology preeminence act which is 70 million over the 100 million of fiscal year 1993 statutory authorization that was in public law 102245 there is also 47 million in energy conservation all in excess of the 358 2 million of statutory authorization in public law 102486 the energy policy act there is also 81 million for the national oceanographic and atmospheric administration which is over and above that is 81 million over and above public law 102567 there is a new commerce department information highway that is a brandnew program that has not been authorized by anybody that is at 64 million in addition it is my understanding that there is a 94 million add on for eda which is unauthorized and 188 million for amtrak which is also unauthorized now just the items that i have talked about here is 500 million over 500 million of money that has not been properly allocated by law if the american people and middleclass american workers wonder why the debt is piling up it is because congress goes on spending money that has not been properly authorized under law we are doing so in the bill that we have brought to the floor today it is wrong it is

parcel out the available money accordingly this has been the position advocated by he distinguished chairman of the appropriations committee mr natcher whom we all applaud for 2a ntegrity but nothing

understand this with one little change this way one little sweep of the pen they took the debt from 4 359 000 000 000 to 4 370 000 000 000 with one sleight of the hand they added 11 billion to the

that if there is ever one document that we ought to be taking a look at it is this this is hundreds of billions of dollars in spending and hundreds of billions of dollars in debt and they are adding to the debt and by one little sleight of hand with one red pen down in the middle of this they just add 11 billion to the debt that no one knows where it came from and we are going to waive the rules

the congress of adding to their debt adding to the 17 000 per person in debt that we have already accumulated in their name this is the kind of sleight of hand that they are particularly concerned about because what they are concerned about that goes on in the congress is in dark rooms somewhere there are people adding up trillions of dollars in spending and then adding with red pens along the way billions of dollars more in debt and no one knows what is going on my guess here is that the reason why they do not want us to look carefully at this document is they have no idea what we might

and straightforward my amendment expresses the sense of congress that employer mandates would be detrimental to small businesses and prohibits the sba a government agency which is supposed to act as an advocate for small business from spending taxpayer dollars to promote employer mandates i offered my amendment yesterday because the sba has spent nearly 100 000 last year alone to make a slick brochure telling every small business owner that employer mandates is good for them the reason behind my amendment is simple employer mandates would be bad for small business every credible study predicts that employer mandates will cost substantial job losses even the economic adviser of the president himself predicted that over 600 000 jobs would be eliminated as a result of employer mandates every study shows that there would be huge job losses if employer mandates are implemented we do not have to rely on academic studies to understand why employer mandates would be a bad idea all we have to do is listen to any small business owner and any small business employee in the nation over the last 2 months the white house has sponsored seven different small business conferences attended by owners of small businesses and employees of small businesses in seven different states in six out of seven of those state conferences small business owners voted unanimously to reject employer mandates my point is simple employer mandates is a bad idea one that small business owners overwhelmingly reject and they are frightened that the sba which is supposed to be an advocate for small business should be spending its own budget money going around the country telling small business owners that employer mandates would be good for them that is why i offered my amendment to prohibit the sba from spending taxpayer dollars to promote a policy which would be detrimental to the very small businesses it is supposed to represent however the rules committee decided yesterday to reject my amendment and prohibited me from even offering it on the floor even the parliamentarian said this is a germane amendment why was this done why was it rejected they said we should not be

to debate issues and that is what the fight on thi6 rule is all about if we cannot debate the activities of the small business administra tion now when can we debate them all i am saying is that the

good diet exercising regularly and stabilizing ones blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible one can dramatically reduce the odds of developing the diseases complications however there are

and against the north american freetrade agreement i have talked at length with and listened to my constituents to three past presidents to president clinton and to many past and present cabinet officers to both our business community leaders and to our workers and i have listened attentively to our floor debate since the debate on this issue first began over a year ago i have openmindedly waited to hear and to understand any compelling arguments as to why this agreement truly benefits our nation our economy and our nations workers but the more i have heard the less i am convinced that this nafta is good for our nation with its high price tag nafta will cost our taxpayers billions of dollars it will throw our labor markets into turmoil and will cost thousands of american workers their jobs the joint congressional economic committee reported that nafta will cause a potential gross job dislocation of 500 000 or moreand downward pressure on unitedstates wages as well naftas environmental provisions are unwieldy unworkable and have been virtually closed to public participation it will place the health and safety standards of our states at risk because we will simply be unable to effectively enforce them equally important this agreement is not linked to any guarantee that mexican wages will rise as productivity increases in mexico nafta will force american workers to compete with mexican workers who make as little as 6 per day in some mexican export industries productivity is 80 to 90 percent of that in similar united states industries but wages are only 10 to 15 percent of united states wages naftas worker retraining program is not worth the name it proposes to spend the same limited amount of money to retrain hundreds of thousands of workers throughout the entire country as was spent to retrain the workers of only one automotive plant in new york moreover we must consider the threat of increased narcotics traffic crossing the mexican border without question the flow of illicit drugs into this country will increase as our borders are opened as transportation system are streamlined and as border inspections are reduced under nafta this administration was able to find a 17 million customs duties break for the honda motor corp as part of this bill but it could not find any new funding to deal with narcotics traffic that is sure to increase just as it erupted in europe when the european community opened its borders liberalizing trade is an important goal and we should support mexico in its economic reform efforts but in doing so this agreement must not neglect our nations interests and our interests are not well served by an administration which tries to buy a trade agreement at the expense of the taxpayer and the consumer with a number of sweetheart deals that amount to protectionism by any other name it is a sorry spectacle when the administration is willing to put us on the road to protectionism in the name of free trade yet this is precisely what is occurring when special protection is promised to our vegetable citrus sugarcane and beet growers the congressional budget office should be required to provide us with the cost to the treasury and to the consumer of these and any other special interest deals designed to win approval for this agreement it is my understanding that this legislation is trying to lower trade barriers at the same time it is laying the cornerstone of several new centers facilities banks and even bridges voters cynicism about washington only worsens as the mexican government and united states corporations pour millions of dollars into the lobbying campaign for this agreement a study conducted last may by the center for public integrity found that mexico was spending at least 30 million to sell this agreement to the united states congress since then millions more dollars have been pumped into this effort according to the center mexico has mounted the most expensive elaborate campaign ever conducted in the united states by a foreign government the mexican government has also helped to finance a private investment fund set up to buy american companies and move their work to mexico amerimex has tried to target some united states manufacturing firms by promising to replace our 10 an hour workers with 1 50 an hour mexican workers if nafta is adopted many american companies are going to have a hard time paying decent wages not to mention complying with environmental and safety standards in a poll conducted last year some 40 percent of 455 executives surveyed indicated they were likely to move some manufacturing to mexico after nafta is passed unlike the situation prevailing in the united states and in canada a governmentdominated alliance of business labor and farm organizations in mexico has broken the traditional tie between a workers wages and his productivity with the result that wages are artificially set and are thereby vrevented from responding to market forces nafta and the labor side agreement do not address this important problem nafta proponents argue that mexican wages have been rising over the past 2 years but these wages are still at about the same level as that prevailing in 1980 at present the average hourly wage in the united states is 16 17 per hour versus 2 35 an hour in mexico president salinas has promised to address this wage and productivity disparity but there are no guarantees that there will be a follow through on his commitment or that any successor mexican administration will choose to honor it in regard to the critical question of job creation there are no commitments about the agreements effects on our labor market only many confusing and contradictory studies the administration bases its claim that nafta will create some 200 000 jobs over the next 2 years based on the shortterm projections of the institute for international economics over a longterm scenario however this same institute projects a net job loss the economic strategy institute estimates that nafta will stimulate foreign investment in mexico especially in its exportoriented industries and that by the year 2002 as many as 220 000 jobs could move south a recent study by the joint economic committee concluded that the trade agreement could produce significant disruptions in the unitedstates labor market and the gross dislocation of 500 000 workers citing the 1993 trade statistics for mexico from the department of commerce the jec study concluded that our trade surplus and the related increase in united states employmentis fast disappearing together with the fact that mexico is likely to devalue its currency in the near futurewith or without a trade agreementthe administration claim of 200 000 new nafta jobs over the next 2 years appears to be completely unrealistic a study completed last month on the impact of the united statescanadian freetrade pact on canadas labor market concluded that the net employment effect has so far been slightly negative the migration of canadian jobs southward to the lower wage and less regulated workplace in our country should be a red flag for the implementation of nafta especially in light of the much greater difference in wages and working conditions prevailing between the united states and its neighbor to the south while many american workers will find their wages being held down or reduced by the agreement the american taxpayer will be asked to contribute billions of dollars for the agreement as well according to the joint economic committee report issued last week the total cost of nafta comes to 20 1 billion over the next 10 years this includes 8 8 billion in lost revenues resulting from tariff reductions 3 9 billion in proposed worker retraining which may be required and income support and 7 4 billion for the cost of the environmental cleanup and infrastructure development other estimates for naftas costs range from 13 billion to 54 billion depending on the estimates for the repair of large scale environmental problems along our border and for the comprehensive retraining and other support for labor force our society could be impacted with other costs as well many experts believe that the increased commercial border traffic resulting from nafta will lead to an increase in the flow of illicit drugs into the united states a september 1993 gao report on drug control efforts along the border indicated that the sheer volume of traffic makes effective interdiction an extremely difficult task about 8 million shipping containers enter the country in a single year and thousands of vehicles cross the bordef from mexico every day the drug problem lies in detecting which of these conveyances are transporting illegal drugs without impeding commerce according to the report an increased flow of commercial traffic under the proposed north american freetrade agreement can only be expected to exacerbate the problem one of the leading experts on the flow of illicit drugs into this country former unitedstates customs commissioner william von raab who served under president reagan has warned that nafta is likely to promote a quantum increase in drug availability here such an increase has taken place in europe when the border barriers were removed while the administration points to increased cooperative efforts of drug enforcement officials on both sides of the border there are no guarantees that mexico will continue its efforts if nafta is approved in advocating this agreement the administration also points to increased mexican cooperation in meeting the environmental pollution problems throughout that country and along the united statesmexican border the key environmental issue in regard to nafta however is the ability of the environmental side agreement to enable individuals or environmental organization to seek redress for any clear pattern of environmental abuses on this count the environmental side agreement is seriously deficient it fails to give these organizations or individuals access to the complaint and adjudication process the process itself is overly long and tortuous the agreement establishes a commission whose main function is the discussion and study of environment problems they are going to try to talk and study the problem to death and when more than talk is required its complicated and lengthy procedures requiring up to 470 days to completewill result in fines only after a countrys repeated failure to enforce its laws the ineffectiveness of the commission was described by top mexican trade negotiator jaime serra puche to the mexican congress on august 19 1993 in his remarks he noted the limited scope of the commissions powers and the timeconsuming process needed to reach enforcement recommendations he concluded that the long timeframe of the process makes itvery improbable that the fines or sanctions could ever be levied by any one of the governments against another in conclusion i believe that this agreement is deficient on too many counts accordingly i call on my colleagues to defeat this agreement before us today and to work with all interested parties in crafting a credible agreement with mexico that will truly improve living standards on both sides of the rio grands"], [0.9968401193618774,

particularly well whether you are from new york or punxsutawney pa when congress does finally vote on health care ieform legislation we must adopt a plan that provides flexibility for states and localities to meet their own special regional health care needs in particular congress must not forget that 27 percent of americans live in rural areas which have distinct health policy problems to resolve aside from the obvious geographic barriers to medical care such as rough terrain bad weather conditions and long distances between medical facilities rural communities must overcome certain demographic characteristics that make health care delivery a unique challenge rural populations tend to be older and poorer so there are higher concentrations of medicare medicaid and uninsured patients as a result rural hospitals and providers rely primarily on federal funds in the form of medicare reimbursement for survival as it is rural hospitals must contend with low occupancy rates and operate on shoestring budgets so the past decade of cuts and freezes in medicare reimbursement have put many rural hospitals in dangerous financial situations cutting the primary source of revenue for rural hospitals has forced many to close their doors altogether in addition to the financial problems of their local hospitals many rural areas suffer from an acute shortage of health care professionals primary care doctors physicians assistants nurses allied health professionals and other medical personnel are in short supply and most rural communities have a difficult time luring professionals from training sites in urban and suburban areas where they can make more money the maldistribution of health care professionals and the insolvency of our rural hospitals pose serious threats to the availability of medical care for rural americans regardless of whether they can afford it or not before we even try to control costs and increase access for the uninsured we must first revitalize the health care infrastructure in our medically underserved rural areas our efforts to reform the health care system will be pointless if rural citizens do not have a doctor to consult or a hospital to visit that is whywith the help of my health care advisory committee doctors nurses and other constituents concerned about health carei have drafted two bills to help solve the real health care problems confronting rural america the first bill i am introducing today is the rural health professional shortage act to improve the supply and distribution of medical professionals in rural areas the quality of rural health care is suffering because many young doctors nurses and other medical professionals elect not to practice in rural areas due to existing disincentives and drawbacks to practicing there while some decisions can be attributed to lifestyle preferences there are a number of other factors that influence where they choose to live and work for instance many young professionals are discouraged from practicing in rural areas because of lower earnings potential and lower medicare reimbursements for rural providers because rural professionals are often isolated from colleagues they cannot rely on them for consultation and second opinions they must work long hours many of which are on call often with little professional support most health care practitioners prefer working with the latest stateoftheart technology which many rural hospitals cannot afford also medical professionals tend to practice in areas close to where they were trained and most academic medical institutions and teaching hospitals are located in urban or suburban locales the rural health professional shortage act eliminates many of these financial and professional disincentives it provides urban and rural physicians equal medicare reimbursements for equal work by eliminating the urbanrural payment differential and it financially rewards those rural providers who have higher caseloads of medicare medicaid and uninsured patients my bill also encourages rural communities to grow their own health care professionals and targets scarce resources to individuals with rural backgrounds since they are most likely to return to and stay in rural areas finally the bill provides rural communities and their local hospitals the resources and technical assistance necessary to attract and retain medical professionals in their areas my second bill the rural hospital survival act recognizes the pivotal role hospitals play in the rural health care delivery system as the primary sources of medical care in rural areas and integral parts of local economies and it will help to keep many of our struggling critical access hospitals open according to the american hospital association 389 rural hospitals closed between 1980 and 1992 for those of us living in rural areas closure of a local hospital 6an significantly reduce our access to decent health care and cost the local economy valuable highskilled highwage jobs with fewer beds fewer admissions lower occupancy rates and higher perpatient perday expenses than metropolitan hospitals many small rural hospitals struggle to keep their doors open the office of technology assessment estimates that nearly onethird of all rural hospitals are operating in the red as i already mentioned rural hospitals rely primarily on medicare and medicaid payments and cuts in reimbursement rates have significantly increased the volume of uncompensated care provided by rural hospitals requiring them to provide more care with fewer dollars in addition to reimbursements that dont keep pace with health care costs rural hospitals must contend with an unfair medicare payment system that reimburses them less than urban hospitals the heart of the rural hospital survival act makes important adjustments to the medicare payment system including a complete elimination of payment differentials between urban and rural hospitals the bill establishes a new telemedicine grant program to promote the development of advanced data video and voice networks among hospitals and providers in rural regions it also renews two grant programs which have successfully helped hospitals and communities throughout the country improve health care delivery for rural residents antitrust exemptions would be provided to encourage cooperation and joint ventures among rural hospitals facilities would be able to share equipment services and health care personnel without fear of being sued and finally my bill would establish a commission to study the effects of state and federal regulations mandates and paperwork on small rural hospitals and the quality of care they provide rural americans have a great deal at stake in the health care debate not only will health care reformaffect the cost quality and accessibility of their medical care it will also impact the economic futures of their communities while working hard to promote job creation and economic development in my largely rural district over the years ive learned that the economic vitality of a rural community is closely tied to the quality and availability of medical care in the area local economic booms and busts closely correspond with the financial standing of the local hospital and the strength of a rural hospital can often serve as an accurate barometer of the state of the local economy as a local economy declines and unemployment rises the increasing burden of uncompensated care the local hospital provides fiscally strains the facility and affects the quality of care it provides often small rural hospitals cannot endure prolonged local recessions and when a hospital is forced to close it can devastate an already struggling local economy one reason is that hospitals are usually one of the largest employers in rural communities when a rural hospital closes the local area can lose dozens sometimes hundreds of well paying jobs also communities who have lost a hospital may have a difficult time attracting businesses and residents to their areas many companies are reluctant to relocate to a region that does not have a hospital or decent health care for a rural community to have a decent shot at attracting industry and creating jobs its local hospital must be in sound financial condition and its health care delivery system capable of providing quality medical care by strengthening the ailing health care delivery systems in our small rural communities my two bills will not only improve the health of our rural residents but also the health of our rural economies i urge my colleagues to recognize and address the unique health care problems affecting rural america by joining me as a cosponsor of these two vital

committee due to a jurisdictional conflict with the energy and commerce committee i have a commitment that this issue will be dealt with at the first appropriate opportunity the provision in question is section 13 of h r 3460 as reported by the public works and transportation committee this provision made a technical correction to section 131 s of the highway beautification act as added by the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act of 1991 that prohibits new billboards on scenic byways the purpose of the istea provision was to protect truly scenic areas all discussion of that provision related to scenic values and the understanding of the members during consideration of that provision was that it related solely to roads in scenic areas the federal highway administration interpreted that provision to override other provisions of the highway beautification act that permit the erection of billboards in commercial and industrial areas under the fhwa interpretation the new istea provision applies to commercial and industrial areas that may be designated as part of a scenic byway for the purposes of connecting scenic areas a state that has a scenic byway program will in most cases want to designate continuous scenic byway routes that is a scenic route that traverses mostly rural areas may pass through towns and cities the advantages of continuous scenic byways are numerous particularly conceming mapping and nolice to motorists what the fhwa interpretation means is that if a state designates a segment of road that runs through a commercial and industrial area as part of a scenic byway for the purpose of connectivity that segment of road would be subject to the new billboard prohibition no matter how urban or blighted that commercial or industrial area might be and even if the state does not want to change its billboard regulation in commercial and industrial areas the public works and transportation committee believes that the fhwa interpretation of section 131 s is not the best reading of the section the last sentence of section 131 s reads as follows control of any sign display or device on such a highway shall be in accordance with this section this section includes subsection d the commercial and industrial exemption the congress intended by this sentence that the scenic byway provisions would be subject to all the other provisions of the highway beautification act in addition if congress had intended to override other longstanding provisions of the act it would have explicitly done so a basic feature of the beautification act is to permit states to allow billboards to remain in industrial and commercial areas congress would not have relied on inference to make such a drastic change in the law indeed the conferees on istea never discussed the possibility of overtuming the commercial and industrial exemption the anomaly of the fhwa interpretation is that it preempts states in an area where they have never been preempted under the highway beautification act under the act a state may ban new billboards anywhere n the state including commercial and industrial zones the state may also choose to continue the federal commercial and industrial exemption the fhwa interpretation tells the state that if it designates a continuous scenic byway it may not as a matter of federal lawcontinue the commercial and industrial exemption even in the most blighted areas"]], "top_unsure": [[5.173683166503906e-05, 0.49994826316833496, 1, "i appreciate the gentlemans comments i would conclude by saying if weadopt the porter

nelson angapak of afn paul kirton and deborah williams of the interior department the state of alaska mr miller and committee staff for their efforts to bring forth a noncontroversial bill to amend the alaska native claims settlement act h r 3612 makes a number of technical changes to the alaska native claims settlement act of 1971 ancsa and the alaska national interests land conservation act anilca this bill has nine provisions which would resolve some of the technical issues with regard to ancsa and anilca not envisioned at time of passage for instance section i would ratify an agreement reached between the cook inlet region incorporated and caswell and montana creek native associations with regard to land conveyances aection 3 would direct the secretary of interior to submit a report within 18 months of enactment to the house natural resources committee and the senate energy and natural resources committee addressing the issue of hasardous substances on lands conveyed to native corporations another would authorize such sums as may be necessary to provide technical assistance to alaska native village corporations to fulfill the require ments of 14 c of ancsa section 6 would direct the secretary of interior in consultation with the secretary of agriculture to submit a report to cojngres within 6 months of enactment of all those vietnam era veterans who were eligible but did not receive an allotment under the native allotment act of may 17 1906 as such act was in effect before december 18 1971 i feel very strongly about this provision and hope that with this report congress will be able to enact additional legislation on behalf of these alaska native veterans affected and to allow them to apply for their native allotments many of these veterans were called to serve during the vietnam war and i do not believe they should be penalized for fulfilling their patriotic duty many were unreachable as you can well imagine and could not submit an application for their native allotment this section would start the process to correct a great injustice to my alaska native veterans h r 4665 as originally introduced is now incorporated into this bill as section 9 this section would allow cook inlet region incorporated ciri by amendment to its articles of incorporation to offer a plan to its shareholders to purchase and cancel settlement common stock in the corporation this section was approved by ciri after extensive survey of its shareholders this section would authorize ciri and only ciri to purchase and cancel stock from its shareholders on a voluntary basis only this bill is purely a noncontroversial technical bill which addresses some of the unresolved land issues which have arisen since the passage of the alaska native claims settlement act and the alaska national interest lands conservation act i introduced this bill on november 21 1993 the subcommittee on oversight and investigation held a hearing on september 22 1994 and the committee on natural resources favorably ordered the bill reported with amendments on september 27 1994 by a voice vote this bill is noncontroversial and i urge this body vote for passage of h r 3612 with one technical amendment at the desk i thank the gentleman for the time to clarify some of the major provisions of this bill and i urge its adoption i yield back the balance of my time"]]}
