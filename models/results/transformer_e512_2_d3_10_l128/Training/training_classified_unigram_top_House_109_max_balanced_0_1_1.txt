the majority has chosen to abuse the process so badly on what is traditionally a mostly bipartisan bill i supported the version of this bill that we passed in the house over the summer that version appropriated more than 400 billion for the department of defense it would have helped to keep faith with our service members by providing them with a much needed pay increase that bill also provided funding for our service members on the ground in iraq and afghanistan who are waiting for additional body armor and up armored humvees unfortunately the majority decided to destroy that bill by loading it up with special interests goodies what theyve done is the height of irresponsibility our service members should have every resource they need todo their job to protect and defend the

trade provisions to six countries five in central america and the dominican republic unlike every other trade agreement which president bush has signed morocco chile singapore and australia which were signed and voted on by congress within 60 days the central american free trade agreement has simply languished in the halls of congress the president has not brought it forward to vote on in large part because the people of this body a majority of the members of congress will not vote for it and here is why it is pretty clear mr speaker that our trade policy is not working in 1992 the year i ran for congress we had a 38 billion trade deficit meaning we sold 38 billion less than we imported exported less than we imported 38 billion today or 2004 that number had increased to 618 billion from 38 billion to 618 billion in a dozen years maybe that is just numbers but when you look at the trade deficit and you know what it means it has meant in large part a huge loss of manufacturing jobs just in the last 6 years these states in red have all lost at least 20 percent of their manufacturing michigan 210 000 ohio 216 illinois 224 pennsylvania 200 mise 1815 we can play with numbers but the fact is the enforcement of labor standards in central america is basically nonexistent under cafta and under the presidents plans at the same time the international labor organization sets standards agreed on by all countries around the world to lift up labor standards so that workers can make a decent wage that workers can bargain and organize collectively the ilo standards prohibit child labor prohibit forced labor all the kinds of values that we in this country share with our colleagues and our workers in our families with all of that the administration is one of only two countries out of 80 in the world that is not fully supporting the ilo and what it wants to do in geneva with its funding with its programs with all that so it is pretty clear that the 20 million offer to support labor standards is just a fig leaf to try to convince a few members of congress to vote for the central american free trade agreement while all those deals have been going on a group of us had a rally today at the cannon building in washington a group of legislators from the united states and a group of legislators from central america they rallied against the central american free trade agreement not to kill it but to defeat this central american free trade agreement and come back with a better central american free trade agreement that protects the environment that helps working people in both countries all of us together have called on congress to pass a better central american free trade agreement these legislators from our country and from seven countries in central america and latin america understand that this cafta protects drug companies while harming the sick and the poor they understand this cafta protects the worlds largest corporations while hurting small businesses and working families they understand this trade agreement protects huge industries while undermining the environment they understand that they want and have called for a cafta that lifts workers up and raises living standards a cafta that protects people the same way it protects property rights and the drug industry a cafta that allows hiv patients access to affordable

between islam and the nonislamic world particularly in a world of 15 second sound bites the holy fathers lecture was not intended obviously to be a critique let alone a criticism of islam it was instead a very esoteric discussion of three different views on the nature of knowledge particularly the knowledge of god the pope used a quote by the late byzantine emperor not a catholic manuel ii paleologus regarding islamic teachings on holy war and the command to spread the faith by the sword as a starting point of his discussion the basic thrust of the pontiffs remarks were that christian theology derives from hellenic roots that view god as the embodiment of reason and is therefore bound by reason because to be otherwise would be contrary to his own nature he contrasts christian theology with a strain of fslamic thought which in the holy fathers description posits that god transcends reason and therefore is not bound by any restrictions whatsoever he also contrasts christian theology with the evolving viewpoint that reason needs no embodiment that it stands outside of any form of divine authorship and views christ as merely an inspired moral philosopher rather thau as the logos the embodiment and author of reason and the creator of the physical world a careful reading of the popes remarks quickly reveals that he spends more time describing the dehellenisation of christian theology than discussing islamic theology and never at any point disparaged or insulted islam in fact he specifically describes the emperors remarks as brusque and is astounded by the quality at no point does the pontiff endorse the emperors remarks or make them his own there are three points that need to be made about the extreme reaction of the popes quotation of the byzantine emperor first the current turmoil is in large part the fault of those in both the west and the east who have misrepresented the popes words and the popes intent in the west the newsmedia has done a spectacularly poor job of reporting on the talk and putting it in context when the pope apologized for the upset that his words caused jim lehrer of pbs lehrer news hour said the apology stopped short of retracting his statement as if the pope had made the emperors words his own the persistent misreporting of the controversial quote as the words of the pope himself was evident also in the demands by muslim leaders for a papal apology from turkey to iraq to iran to the west bank many leaders and politicians have exploited the controversy to suit their own ends this kind of debased manipulation of religious sensibilities for demagogic gain should be condemned by moderate muslim leaders in the west second both christianity and islam needs to come to terms with their historic mistakes and excesses christianity has much to answer for in its history including inquisitions pogroms forced conversions and holy wars which have left scars that have yet to fully heal nevertheless islam is not without its own transgressions from its 7th centhry destruction of christian churches in north africa to its repeated invasions of christian europe islam has a long history of conquest indeed christendoms crusades need to be understood within the context of islams assaults on the byzantine empire and the continued threats to europe if only muslims are allowed to express historical outrage and only christians are required to apologize for past wrongs there will be no chance of a deep historical and cultural dialogue more importantly experience demonstrates that while we may learn from history we must put past offenses behind us if we are ever to hope to live in peace conflicting sects and ethnic groups from northern ireland to south africa recognize that demanding draconian justice for intergenerational grievances leads only to prolonged conflict and have chosen instead to concentrate on building a better future for their children the christian and islamic worlds can and must do the same third and finally this particular controversy underscores the importance of the popes call for a dialogue based on faith and reason even religions as different in their conceptions of god as christianity and islam must find ways to engage politically culturally and over time theologically my hoiae state was founded by william penn a refugee of an oppressed political minority who created an environment where sects could live together and exchange views and have mutual respect and even admiration voltaire wrote at the time that pennsylvania had the freest air on earth pope benedicts commitment to this kind of genuine dialogue is clear despite the fact that pope benedict never intended any offense the pontiff has repeatedly expressed regret at the misinterpretation and misunderstanding of his remarks on islam he has expressed deep respect for the faith of muslims speaking at the september 21 general audience in st peters square in front of more than 40 000 people the pope noted from his recent trip to bavaria and told his audience this quotation unfortunately has lent itself to misunderstanding i think we can take him at his word i think in my view we can let this matter die and we should use it as a starting point for a genuine dialogue between the christian west and those of us in the west who want to see a liberal society and also islam thank you for the opportunity to comment on this recent turn of events"], [0.0006799101829528809, 0.5006799101829529, 1, "rome 1993 i knew the city except for the machinegun carrying carbineri at romes fumicino airport and the cars whizzing by me on the autostrada at 150 kilometers per mile rome seem strangely familiar perhaps it was the ten years studying latin following the exploits of caesar veni vedi vici except caesar never had to drive his chariots in rush hour nor did anyone dare crowd his style along the appian way everywhere i looked cars were bumper on bumper i did a sidewalk survey and noticed that about se ven of ten cars parked along any given street had body damage rome was very personal like that my friend judy and i had come to visit the eternal city to study the cradle of our faith as we toured it became clear that just as washington is a monument to presidents rome is a celebration of the papacy prior to leaving for rome i had lunch with an old friend dr robert white the famed neurosurgeon and physician to the pope i told him i was soon going to be visiting rome he made a call to his friend at the jesuits headquarters in rome and was able to arrange for a special visit to the vatican including attendance at a general papal audience judy and i and about five thousand other persons minutes before we left the hotel for our vatican tour i received a call that there had been a change of plans judy and i were to come immediately to a certain entrance off st peters square just in case i was going to meet someone i always wanted to meet i brought with me a ceremonial presentation of a key of the city of cleveland although they changed the locks when i left the mayors office when we arrived we were greeted by swiss guards then we were ushered into the large hall where the general audience was held it had the air of carnival colorful noisy boisterous slowly we were escorted past one jammed pew after another to the front pew et introibo ad altare dei

left cleveland city hall concluding my own personal experience with manichean struggles with the forces of power and light the years after city hall were well different except for brief service in city council filling an unexpired term i could not win an election to save or lose my soul yes were very excited to be here i said the priest now a personal assistant to the pope responded were really glad you could make it wait a minute i waited my whole life just to get into close proximity to the pope and one of his assistants is telling me hes glad the holy father will be here shortly there will be a general audience afterwards people will file out and then he will come over to talk with you that is the moment i knew i was about to meet pope john paul ii i was lost in thought judy feigned panic omigosh she kept saying over and over the general audience is something like clevelands west side market on a saturday except many a pilgrims dancing playing music and singing while wearing the colorful costumes of their native lands the pope enters to wild applause he sits on a simple throne and after about an hour and a half his right hand is supporting his head i thought how physically demanding it was for him the general audience ended the pope had brief discussions with a group of clergy he then walked in our direction he stopped and spoke to two other couples then he approached he looked at judy and greeted her first he then turned to me is this your wife he asked in english she wasnt neither of us were married i wasnt going to lie to the pope talk about setting yourself up to go to hell a friend holy father he nodded holy father i come from cleveland yes we were talking about you earlier about your public service he said i remember cleveland indeed the pope had visited cleveland as cardinal karol wojtyla at st stanislaus church in the slavic village neighborhood one of his closest friends was john cardinal krol whose family came from st stanislaus parish there was a great joy in cleveland when he was chosen pope the polish community brought together 10 000 people in public hall to celebrate in prayer and song we spoke for a few minutes about how the same polish community was instrumental in my election as mayor in 1977 holy father i have a special gift i would like to give you a key to the city of cleveland it was one of the last keys from my administration i supposed he received a thousand like it but he accepted it and an accompanying certificate graciously as several cameras flashed around us he turned to judy and he thanked her for coming then my life changed john paul ii put his hand on my head he looked into my eyes and said in a polishaccented english i have come to know so well in my own neighborhood my son i give you my special blessing i felt something at that moment whether it was a connection with his charisma or grace i felt something a different energy field a buzz my imagination a sense of peace i felt something later i would mark that bright encounter as one when conditions began to change for the better in my own life i thanked him in polish he smiled he invited us to visit again ever the altar boy as he was about to leave i offered to him a prayer in latin emitte lucem tuam et veritatem tuam send forth your light and your truth it was said as an affirmation of his spiritual leadership his own quest to bring peace to the world he said goodbye judy and i were suddenly alone in the pew the audience had ended there are millions of people the world over who felt a personal connection to john paul i1 yet his passing may become significant not for that aspect of him which died in us but for something within each of us that was reborn through his life it was the only time i would ever

returned from my fourth visit to iraq with speaker hastert and two other members of congress and after this recent trip i am more convinced than ever that the time has come to change unitedstates strategy in iraq the ultimate goal is to establish a free open and democratic iraqi government and bring our men and women in uniform home i believe the best way to do this is to have the iraqi security forces specifically the iraqi army and military take on responsibility of patrolling and securing their own country i believe we must move american and coalition troops to the perimeter of the urban areas and let the iraqi military patrol the streets of their cities since the invasion of iraq in march 2003 more than 2 400 american troops have been killed and more than 20 000 injured the insurgents and al qaeda are using ieds which are roadside bombs and suicide bombers we at this point have not been able to defend our military as we should because of these tactics i believe a change in strategy in iraq is now necessary by moving our troops to the perimeter it will accomplish numerous things number one it will allow the iraqi military to be less dependent on the american military and our other coalition forces it will send a message to the iraqi people that now they have a new government that has been formed it will give them the message that this is their country this is their government and this is also their iraqi citizens providing their security by moving to the perimeter it will also allow us to change strategy to show the iraqi people and the american people and the world that there is a change in strategy that weare moving ahead and that the iraqi people and the iraqi military will now have less dependence on us in order for the iraqi military to be able to provide the security necessary we must cut the apron strings by going to the perimeter we will be able to do that now how will we be able to do that number one this is the beginning step to bringing our troops home we will also continue to backup the iraqi military when they need help if they are being overrun they can contact us you can be anywhere and many of us who have been to iraq know in a black hawk helicopter in baghdad as an example within 10 to 15 minutes we have the best special operations forces in the world our seal teams our rangers our marines we have the best in the world they have the ability to backup the iraqi military when they are in need but thiq will also allow our american forces to start using our technology our air power our abilities that have made us the strongest country in the world to backup the iraqi military but it will also by doing this going to the perimeter it will allow us to be able to focus on highvalue targets and let us again start bringing our men and women home it will not be necessary anymore for our military to patrol the iraqi urban areas and get blown up or injured by suicide bombers or roadside bombs because the iraqi military will now be in those same streets this is a very important plan it is something we should consider very strongly now it is important that we get our information from our military to make sure that we move forward with this type of plan i was in iraq about 2 months ago and i talked to four of the generals who are really in charge of running everyday operations in iraq starting with general casey and i asked them is the iraqi military ready to start taking on the responsibility of patrolling the urban areas their comments to me 2 months ago was that they feel that they are getting close that they are not ready yet when i just came back a week ago when i went to iraq with the speaker i asked the same generals how are we doing now is the iraqi military who we have trained for twoandahalf years is the iraqi military ready to take on responsibility of patrolling the urban areas they said to me basically they feel that the iraqi military could take on responsibility of patrolling at least 70 percent of the urban areas if this is the case then it is extremely important and urgent almost that we let the iraqi military start doing the job and we will then back them up now after i came back from iraq we were asked by president bush to come and to brief him about the issues and what our observations were i explained to the president a monthandahalf ago about my strategy of moving to the perimeter he said he would consider that when i brought up the issue this time about a week ago his comment was it could be a good idea but he has to rely on his military on the strategy of his military commanders and i understand that and i told him that my conversation with the military commanders in the presence of other members of congress was basically they felt they could start the process of letting the iraqi military starting to patrol the streets starting to implement this perimeter plan which will again allow the iraqi military to start providing the security in their country it will allow us to start bringing troops home because if we go to the perimeter we will not need all of the men and women our military to patrol the urban areas yet we will still be there in the perimeter it would be the green zone to backup the iraqi military when in need i think this strategy should be considered i hope it will be considered and by considering this strategy it will change our mission it will be a new strategy it will say to the american people it is not the same oldsame old and we know that the american people are getting pretty frustrated when they see in the media every day that men and women are being injured our men and women are being injured or being killed this will then allow us to fight the war on our terms using our air power our intelligence to be able to go after the highvalue targets like zarqawi and also to fight the war on terror because we are in a war against terror not only in iraq and afghanistan but throughout the world and we must focus and use our specialty and our expertise to fight this war on terror remember our ultimate goal is to turn this government over to the iraqi people let them start creating job let us help them create jobs let us start helping them deal with the issue of infrastructure if you do not have a job you are not going to have a community and we have to show to the iraqi people that their quality of life is better under a democracy than it was under saddam hussein but in order to do this they must have security they must have jobs and i think we can help them do this our ultimate goal is to bring our men and women in uniform home this perimeter plan is the first step i respect congressman murtha i think congressman murtha put this issue on the table so that we in this country and in congress could start debating the issue about what is the appropriate strategy my only issue with respect to congressman murthas issue about a time certain is that i do not believe that we should give any enemy a time certain on when we are going to leave iraq or afghanistan but i do believe that this perimeter strategy is first step to bringing the troops home"], [0.0006812810897827148,

constituencies and sometimes even from other states although i represent arizona a close friend of mine from california kevin rishell wrote us a poem today related to pope john paul ii and it seemed appropriate to read so i am going to start with that pope john paul ii a man of simple convictions a man of great love and peace afather to the nations a friend now at last released into the arms of his beloved savior into history with gods tender favor well done faithful servant echoes cross heavens portals as john paul is welcomed by friends and other immortals his life was a service to god and to his neighbors to the weak and to the poor and dearly loved unbelievers for he believed that all life had a godly purpose that all life was special and that god was never spurious for he understood clearly the vain rantings of men how popular their wisdom seemed to change with the wind but he held true to his course in the most turbulent times with gods word as his pilot and the holy spirit as his guide in faith he stood against evil when it could have cost him his life and for decades and more he fought for what was right for god was his center and jesus was his friend and the comforter never left him from birth to honored end for he was on a holy quest of nearly mythic proportions a man with a great commission teaching truth and sacred traditions he knew where he came from and he knew where he would go secure in christ adored by the masses this humble shepherdsoul but now his journeys over a final appointment he will keep a righteous servant to his master in whose arms he will now rest and sleep while leaving a beautiful legacy of honor and valiant grace that will live on beyond this tribute a priestly mantle so hard to replace we will miss you holy father we will miss your humor and your passion we will miss your concern for personal details and your courage to speak and to take action but now you have fought your good fight and you have finished your race we thank you for your example and pray god bless you for your faith via con dios my precious brother go with god my blessed friend shalom to you my loving confessor be at peace and as you always said amen it is with great admiration and gratitude that i now personally rise to commend to the ages the life of karol wojtyla pope john paul i pope john paul ii lived an intentional life too often today we spend our lives in a reactive state with daily events and crises drowning out the reflection and study which are required to live an intentional life the pope did not fall into this trap of the immediate he instead considered his lifes great questions and after seeking guidance in holy scripture and through prayer he steadfastly stayed wisdoms course by noiw the narrative of the popes life has become wellknown growing up in poland he had firsthand experience with two of the 20th centurys most horrible totalitarian creations that being nazism and soviet communism living under these systems as a young man he saw in detail not only the physical corrosion wrought by these systems of government but the spiritual and social decay they engendered as well he looked beyond the jackboots and the tanks and saw that the real power of these regimes stemmed not from physical force but from an intellectual climate that was stripping the humanness from humanity karol wojtyla dedicated himself to fighting this evil not with force of might but through prayer availing his heart soul and mind unto god and in serving his fellow human beings he exemplified what the holy scripture exhorts from man to do justly to love mercy and to walk humbly with god he sought for justice to be done and the truth to be told by placing a handwritten acknowledgment of christian sins against the jewish people in a crevice of the western wall in jerusalem and in his admonishment of the kneeling father ernesto cardenal the sandinista culture minister in nicaragua he demonstrated mercy and after recovering from his wounds from the assassination attempt on his life by mehmet ali agca he visited this deranged turk in prison he visited him and then he forgave him and he walked humbly allowing all of us to watch as he deteriorated physically right before our eyes believing that those who follow christ as christ himself taught must sometimes endure suffering karol wojtyla became pope john paul ii in 1978 and held the chair of saint peter for more than 26 years at the beginning of his papacy the totalitarianism that had colored his youth was on the march throughout the world previously free people were being enslaved by soviet communism with alarming regularity however the soviet union had reached its zenith and soon would crumble due in large part to the efforts of a triumvirate of courageous and noble leaders ronald reagan margaret thatcher and this new pope john paul ii he chose to attack the intellectual moorings of totalitarianism thus he could eliminate the power structure that it rested upon he opposed abortion believing innocent human life was sacred and that the casual elimination of the weak is the first step on the path that leads to the enslavement of all one of the great teaching documents of his pontificate evangelium vitae stated life especially human life belongs only to god for this reason whoever attacks human life in some way attacks god himself he opposed liberal theology firmly believing that a church which did not stand up for its core doctrines would be unlikely to stand up to evil in the world and he encouraged us all to do the same stating that freedom consists not in doing what we like but in having the right to do what weought and kindly but boldly he encouraged us not to be afraid stating have no fear of moving into the unknown simply step out fearlessly knowing that god is with you therefore no harm can befall you all is very very well do this in complete faith and confidence he demonstrated this full and complete trust in god and from his first appearance on the balcony of st peters basilica proclaimed that christ christ is the answer he was a friend of the united states not out of blind loyalty but out of a recognition that radical changes in world politics leave america with a heightened responsibility to be for the world an example of genuinely free democratic just and humane society and he admonished and cautioned us that it is not enough to speak about freedom but that freedom must have a purpose stating when freedom does not have a purpose when it does not wish to know anything about the rule of law engraved in the hearts of men and women when it does not listen to the voice of conscience it turns against humanity and society perhaps one of the most fitting tributes to this great man can be found in the news coverage of his death while the free world celebrates his legacy and openly mourns his passing states such as china which still hold much of their population in the dehumanizing chains of marxism do the best to stifle these reports it seems fitting that the only countries to bar a papal visit were china north korea vietnam and postcommunist russia those leaders know that john paul ii lived a life in accordance with a view that rejected dehumanizing chains because man was created to be free and even though he has passed from this life and into the next his world view remains and his courage in the face of death is a powerful symbol of that world view the oppressors realize that if their subjects witness this courageous man and embrace his vision of humanity that their days will be numbered we should all pray that they do in the meantime we should all take great comfort and gain great courage with the popes words of hope to all of us he said do not abandon yourselves to despair we are the easter people and hallelujah is our song i am certain that he is right now joined by a multitude of others singing hallelujah to the one he dedicated his life to i yield to the gentleman from

iraq and afghanistan let me also acknowledge that there are individuals who have had firsthand experience in the military courts having gone to a law school that had a very outstanding jag school i understand the importance of military law and was one time a member of the unitedstates military court of appeals but i think it is important that we make this argument understandable because in a few hours the president will give to my friends on the other side of the aisle an opportunity of bragging rights by having signed a bill that has been rushed through this process and has totally ignored the supreme courts decision wfy are we standing here on this side of the aisle seemingly making arguments that dont promote security and safety in the united states well that interpretation is totally wrong because not one ofus wants to take away the t9ols that would ensure americas security but what we are concerned about are the faces here who represent those who have lost their lives on the front lines of iraq and afghanistan and they continue over and over again we have concerns about the life they sacrifice and the soldiers that they left behind we know that soldiers dont leave comrades on the battlefield injured or lost in the line of battle today this military tribunal commission will leave our soldiers on the battlefield for what it does is it creates the atmosphere no matter whether we are in a guerilla war or we are in the confrontational wars that we know of world war i and ii it is to ensure that the treatment of our soldiers if caught by the enemy will reflect the lack of treatment that we have given here mr skelton has made it very clear we could fix this because he would have provided an expedited constitution review of the entire matter to give the opportunity for entry into the courts under habeas it would also require that these military commissions because they are eliminating rights we are not saying releasing people we are saying eliminating rights that then get translated to the miserable treatment of those who were incarcerated or taken off the battlefield that are our soldiers secondly it refuses to give reauthorization language to the military commissions we dont know where we will be in 3 years we dont know how negatively this will impact our soldiers on the battlefield which next conflict that god forbid we may have to be engaged in also the language that my friends have go beyond the scope of the supreme courts decision in hamdan to decide whether or not detainees have habeas rights the court already decided they do or whether or not the habeas provisions in the detainee treatment act are constitutionally legal the habeas provisions in the legislation are contrary to congressional intent in the detainee treatment act in that act congress did not intend to strip the courts of jurisdiction over the pending habeas in addition although my friends say they fixed it they also deny the rights which i had an amendment to to utilize the geneva conventions language to say that you were tortured or not tortured even if you would put that defense in a classified presentation so in concluding let me say we owe them a debt of gratitude lets vote down this tribunal to save future lives i rise in strong opposition to s 3930 the military commissions act i oppose this bill because i stand strong for our troops i stand strong for the constitution i stand strong for the values that have made our country the united states of america the greatest country in the history of the world i oppose this legislation because it is not becoming a nation that is strong in its values confident of its future and proud of its ancient heritage let us be crystal clear all americans and democrats especially want those responsible for 9 11 and other terrorist acts to be tried fairiy and punished accordingly and we want those convictions to be upheld by our courts democrats want the president to have the best possible intelligence to prevent future terrorist attacks on the united states and its allies democrats agreed with the president when he said whether the terrorists are brought to justice or justice brought to the terrorists justice will be done but democrats understand that justice requires the congress to establish a system for trying suspected terrorists that not only is fundamentally fair but also consistent with the geneva convention we should abide by the geneva convention not out of some slavish devotion to international law or desire to coddle terrorists but because adherence to the geneva convention protects american troops and affirms american values s 3930 the compromise before us includes some improvements that i strongly support for example evidence obtained through torture can no longer be used against the accused similarly the compromise bill provides that hearsay evidence can be challenged as unreliable perhaps the most important improvement over the bill passed by the house is that accused terrorists will have the right to rebut all evidence offered by the prosecution as is the case in the existing military justice system classified evidence can be summarized redacted declasified or otherwise made available to the accused without compromising sources or methods this change to the bill goes a long way toward minimizing the chance that an accused may be convicted with secretevidence a shameful practice favored by dictators and totalitarians but beneath the dignity of a great nation like the united states as senator john mccain said i think its important that we stand by 200 years of legal precedents concerning classified information because the defendant should have a right to know what evidence is being used however i am concerned that there is reason to believe that even with this compromise legislation this system of military commissions may lead to endless litigation and get struck down by the courts then we would find ourselves back here again next year or five years from now trying to develop a system that can finally bring the likes of khalid sheik mohammed to justice why would we want to give terrorist detainees a get out of jail free card when we can avoid that by establishing military commissions that work as currently written the compromise bill has provisions that could lead to the reversal of a conviction specifically the bill contains a section that strips the federal courts of jurisdiction over habeas corpus petitions filed prior to the passage of the detainee treatment act last december on behalf of detainees at guantanamo bay nine former federal judges were so alarmed by this prospect that they were compelled go public with their concerns congress would thus be skating on this constitutional ice in depriving the federal courts of their power to hear the cases of guantanamo detainees if one goal of the provision is to bring these cases to a speedy conclusion we can assure from our considerable experience that eliminating habeas would be unconstitutional common article 3 of the geneva convention requires that a military commis sion be a regularly constituted court affording all the necessary judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples notwithstanding the provision in the house bill that the military commissions established therein satisfy this standard the fact is that other nations will agree simply saying so does not make it so moreover they may well be right consider this mr speaker the compromise allows statements to be entered into evidence that were obtained through cruel inhuman and degrading treatment and lesser forms of coercion if the statement was obtained before passage of the detainee treatment act last december to provide limited immunity to government agents involved in the cia detention and interrogation program the bill amends the war crimes act of 1996 to encompass only grave breaches of the geneva conventions unitedstates agents could not be tried under the war crimes act of 1996 to encompass only grave breaches of the geneva convention unitedstates agents could not be tried under the war crimes act for past actions that degraded and humiliated detainees the bill also limits any use of international law such as the geneva convention in interpreting the war crimes act what is sometimes lost sight of in all the tumult and commotion is that the reason we have observed the geneva conventions since their adoption in 1949 is to protect members of our military but as the judge advocate generals pointed out the compromise bill could place united states servicemembers at risk by establishing an entirely new international standard that american troops could be subjected to if captured overseas as rear admiral bruce mcdonald testified i go back to the reciprocity issue that we raised earlier that i would be very concern~d about other nations looking in on the united states and making a determination that if its good enough for the united states its good enough for us and perhaps doing a lot of damage and harm internationally if one of our servicemen or women were taken and held as a detainee whats more the geneva conventions also protect those not in uniformspecial forces personnel diplomatic personnel cia agents contractors journalists missionaries relief workers and all other civilians changing our commitmentto this treaty could endanger them as well we can fix these deficiencies easily if we only we have the will what we should do is recommit the bill with instructions to add two important elements 1 expedited constitutional review of the legislation and 2 a requirement that these military commissions be reauthorized after three years under expedited review the constitutionality of the military commission system could be tested and determined quickly and earlybefore there are trials and convictions and it would help provide stability and surefooting for novel legislation that sets up a military commissions system unlike anything in american history such an approach provides no additional rights to alleged terrorists all it does is give the supreme court of the united states the ability to decide whether the military commissions system under this act is legal or not it simply guarantees rapid judicial review"], [0.0006827116012573242,

this very brief time that we have though is to bring a little truth to the debate and leave of absence that is the issue of the balanced budget by unanimous consent leave of abamendment we so many of us sup sence was granted to port a balanced budget amendment we mr davis of illinois at the request agree that there ought to be appro of ms pelosi for today and the balpriate accountability i believe that anc of the week on account of busithe desire or the inertia to restrain ness in the district spending at the federal level is frank ms kilpatrick of michigan at the ly nonexistent so i think that it is request of ms pelosi for today on acimperative that we have some kind of count of business in the district control on the amount of spending that ms mckinney at the request of ms we have here in washington and one pelosi for today way to do that and i believe an appro ms wasserman schultz at the repriate way to do that is through a bal quest of ms pelosi for today anced budget amendment mr culberson at the request of mr we just heard within the past hour boehner for today on account of offisome folks on the other side who say cial business in the district yeah we think there ought to be a bal mr sweeney at the request of mr anced budget amendment but whats boehner for today on account of illth6 truth about their actions when ness given the opportunity and that is what the official truth squad is about special orders granted is to make certain that folks are held by unanimous consent permission to accountable for not just talking the talkoutablest walking the address the house following the legistalk but walking the walk lative program and any special orders here is the most recent opportunity aerora nd an e or that congress has had to vote on a bal heretofore entered was granted to anced budget amendment now this the following members at the request of mr farr to revise and extend was an actual vote in 1997 on a bal their remarks and include extraneous anced budget amendment and how did material the other side vote well 8 individuals mr emanuel for 5 minutes today on the other side said yeah that is an mr defazio for 5 minutes today appropriate thing to do we believe mr pallone for 5 minutes today that that is the kind of budget ac mr george miller of california for countability that we need 194 was the 5 minutes today no vote on the other side 194 ms

september 11 than by establishing a system to prosecute the terrorists who on that day murdered thousands of innocent civilians and who continue to seek to kill americans both on and off the battlefield our most important consideration in writing this legislation is to protect american troops and american citizens from harm the war against terror has produced a new type of battlefield and a new type of enemy how is it different we are fighting a ruthless enemy who doesnt wear a uniform an enemy who kills civilians women and children and then boasts about it a barbaric enemy who beheads innocent civilians by sawing their heads off an uncivilized enemy who does not acknowledge or respect the laws of war justice thomas put it best in the hamdan decision he said we are not engaged in a traditional battle with a nation state but with a worldwide hydroheaded enemy who lurks in the shadows conspiring to reproduce the atrocities of september 11 2001 and who has boasted of sending suicide bombers into civilian gatherings has proudly distributed videotapes of the beheadings of civilian workers and has tortured and dismembered captured american soldiers so h6w is the battlefield new first it will be a long war we dont know if this enemy will be defeated this decade the next decade or even longer than that second in this new war where intelligence is more vital than ever we want to interrogate the enemy not to degrade them but to save the lives of american troops american civilians and our allies but it is not practical on the battlefield to read the enemy their miranda warnings finally this is an ongoing conflict and sharing sensitive intelligence sources methods and other classified information with terrorist detainees could be highly dangerous to national security and we are not prepared to take that risk so what have we done to develop a military commission process that will allow for the effective prosecution of enemy combatants during this ongoing conflict without this action the united states has no effective means to try and punish the perpetrators of september 11 the attack on the uss cole and the embassy bombings we provide basic fairness in our prosecutions but we also preserve the ability of our warfighters to operate effectively on the battlefield i think a fair process has two guiding principles first the government must be able to present its case fully and without compromising its intelligence sources or compromising military necessity second the prosecutorial process must be done fairly swiftly and conclusively who are we dealing with in military commissions i have shown the picture of khalid sheikh mohammed who is alleged to have designed the attack against the united states that was carried out on 9 11 we are dealing with the enemy in war not defendants in our domestic criminal justice system some of them have returned to the battlefield after we let them out of guantanamo our primary purpose is to keep them off the battlefield in doing so we treat them humanely and if we choose to try them as war criminals we will give them due process rights that the world will respect but we have to remember that they are the enemy in an ongoing war in time of war it is not practical to apply to rules of evidence the same rules of evidence that we do in civilian trials or court martials for our troops commanders and witnesses cant be called from the front line to testify iii a military commission we need to accommodate rules of evidence chain of custody and authentication to fit what we call the exigencies of the battlefield it is clear mr speaker that we dont have crime scenes that can be reproduced that can be taped off that can be attended to by dozens of people looking for forensic evidence we have in this war against terror a battlefield situation li 1330 if hearsay is reliable we should use it and i might add that hearsay is utilized and has been utilized in tribunals like the rwanda tribunals and the kosovo tribunals if sworn affidavits are reliable we should use them and we have not expanded the use of hearsay beyond what is being used in those tribunals rwanda and yugoslavia the supreme court has tasked us with an adjustment but in doing so lets not forget our purpose is to defend the nation against the enemy we wont lower our standards we will always treat detainees humanely but we cant be naive either this war started in 1996 with the al qaeda declaration of jihad against our nation the geneva conventions were written in 1949 and the ucmj was adopted in 1951 in that sense what we are required to do after the hamdan decision is broader than war crimes trials it is the start of a new legal analysis for the long war it is time for us to think about war crime trials and a process that provides due process and protects national security in this new war so what do we do with these new military commissions we uphold basic human rights and state what our compliance with this standard means for the treatment of detainees wedo this in a way that is fair and in a way that the world will acknowledge is fair first we provide accused war criminals at least 26 rights if they are tried by a commission for a war crime while i will not read all of them here are some of the essential rights we provide the right to counsel provided by government at trial and throughout appellate proceedings an impartial judge a presumption of innocence a standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt the right to be informed of the charges against him as soon as practicable the right to service of charges sufficiently in advance of trial to prepare a defense and i am going to insert the balance of those 26 basic and fundamental rights in the record so i wont read them all at this point the right to reasonable continuances right to peremptory challenge against members of the commission and challenges for cause against members of the commis sion and the military judge witness must testify under oath judges counsel and members of military commission must take oath right to enter a plea of not guilty the right to obtain witnesses and other evidence the right to exculpatory evidence as soon as practicable the right to be present at court with the exception of certain classified evidence involving national security preservation of safety or preventing disruption of proceedings the right to a public trial except for national security issues or physical safety issues the right to have any findings or sentences announced as soon as determined right against compulsory self incrimination right against double jeopardy the defense of lack of mental responsibility voting by members of the military commission by secret written ballot prohibitions against unlawful command influende toward members of the commission counsel or military judges 2 3 vote of members required for conviction 3 4 vote required for sentences of life or over 10 years unanimous verdict required for death penalty verbatim authenticated record of trial cruel or unusual punishments prohibited treatment and discipline during confinement the same as afford to prisoners in unitedstates domestic courts right to review of full factual record by convening authority and right to at least two appeals including to a federal article iii appellate court we provide all these rights and we give them an independent judge and the right to at least two appeals including the unitedstates court of appeals for the district of columbia and access to the supreme court nobody can say this is not a fair system i know some of my colleagues are concerned about the issue of reciprocity look at this list of rights and we are going to put it up here so that all the members can see this and also keep in mind that these are the rights for terrorists these are the rights for the people who struck us on 9 11 and killed thousands of americans if we are talking about true reciprocity then we are only concerned about how the enemy will treat american terrorists these are not our rules for pows these are how we treat terrorists we treat the legitimate enemy differently and expect them to treat our troops the same how do we try the enemy for war crimes in this act congress authorizes the establishment of military com missions for alien unlawful enemy combatants which is the legal term we use to define international terrorists and those who aid and support them in a new separate chapter of title 10 of the unitedstates code chapter 47a while this new chapter is based upon the uniform code of military justice it creates an entirely new structure for these trials in this bill we provide standards for the admission of evidence including hearsay evidence and other statements that are adapted to military exigencies and provide the military judge the necessary discretion to determine if the evidence is reliable and probative and he must find that it is reliable and probative before he allows it to be admitted i want to talk a little bit about how we handle classified evidence we had three hearings on this bill in addition to briefings and meetings with experts i asked every witness the same question if we have an informant either a cia informant or an undercover witness of some sort are we going to tell kalid sheikh mohammed who the informant is the legislation does not allow ksm to learn the identity of the informant after several twists and turns in the road after meeting with the senate and the white house in marathon sessions over the weekend we have crafted a solution that does not allow the alleged terrorists to learn the identity of the informant yet provides a fair trial and that is critically important to all of us in this chamber because that american agent or informant may have information that saves thousands of lives he may be of enormous value added to the security of this country we cant divulge his identity and we cant divulge it to the alleged terrorist and doing so would allow that information to go back quickly as it has on two occasions one coming out of the first bombing of the world trade center where we now have established that osama bin laden did come into possession of classified evidence that was moved up through those court proceedings and once in guantanamo so it is very very important that we protect classified evidence and that we protect the identity of our agents we address this in section 949d subsection f of section 3 classified evidence is protected and is privileged from disclosure to the jury and the accused if disclosure would be detrimental to national security the accused is permitted to be present at all phases of the trial and no evidence is presented to the jury that is not also provided to the accused section 949d f makes a clear statement that sources methods or activities will be protected and privileged and not shown to the accused however and this is how you move the essence of an undisclosed agents testimony to the jury without disclosing the identity of the agent the substantive findings of the sources methods or activities will be admissible in an unclassified form this allows the prosecution to present its best case while protecting classified information in order to do this the military judge questions the informant outside the presence of the jury and the defendant in order to give the jury and the defendant a redacted version of the informants statement the judge must find one that the sources methods or activitiesby which the unitedstates acquired the evidence are classified and two that the evidence is reliable once thejudge stamps the informant as reliable the informants redacted statement is given to both the jury and the accused it removes the confrontation issue and this again to my friends who said we want to follow the ucmj and we want to give these people all the rights that we give our uniformed servicemen our analysis is that we would not be able to keep from disclosure the identity of our special agents if we followed the ucmj that is designed to protect american uniformed servicemen and it is not something that we should apply in the case of alleged terrorists i think that these rules protect classified evidence and yetpreserve a fair trial one other point i want to make for the record as i mentioned earlier we have modified the rules of evidence to adapt to the battlefield one of the principles used by the judiciary in criminal prosecutions of our citizens is called the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine this rule provides that evidence derived from information acquired by police officials or thegovernment through unlawful means is not admissible in a criminal prosecution i want to make it clear that it is our intent with the legislation not to have this doctrine apply to evidence in military commissions while evidence obtained improperly will not be used directly against the accused we will not limit the use of any evidence derived from such evidence the deterrent effect of the exclusionary rule is not something that our soldiers consider when they are fighting a war the theory of the exclusionary rule is that if the constable blunders the accused will not suffer however we are not going to say that if the soldier blunders we are not going to punish a terrorist some rights are reserved for our citizens some rights are reserved for civilized people this is a complicated piece of legislation in addition to establishing an entire legal process from start to finish we address the application of common aticle 3 of the geneva conventions to our current laws section 5 clarifies that the geneva conventions are not an enforceable source of rights in any habeas corpus or other civil action or proceeding by an individual in unitedstates courts this protects american troops section 6 of the bill amends 18 unitedstatesc section 2441 the war crimes act to criminalize grave breaches of common article 3 of the geneva conventions as amended the war crimes act will fully satisfy our treaty obligations under common article 3 this amendment is necessary because section c 3 of the war crimes act defines a war crime as any conduct which constitutes a violation of common article 3 common article 3 prohibits some actions that are universally condemned such as murder and torture but it also prohibits outrages upon personal dignity and what is called humiliating and degrading treatment phrases which are vague and do not provide adequate guidance to our personnel since violation of common article 3 is a felony under the war crimes act it is necessary to amend it to provide clarity and certainty to the interpretation of this statute the surest way to achieve that clarity and certainty is to define the list of specific offenses that constitute war crimes punishable as grave violations of common article 3 and this is very important this protects our troops it gives them certainty it gives them clarity you dont want to have our troops so paralyzed by what they see as prosecutions arising out of common article 3 that you will have a situation where a female officer in the unitedstates military will not interrogate a muslim male on the basis that she is afraid that that action may be defined or projected as being a humiliation of that particular prisoner being interrogated and therefore subjecting that female american officer to a war crimes accusation so what we have done is we have taken the offenses that are considered to be grave offenses under article 3 and then i have enumerated several of those and we define those as the offenses which will be applicable upon which prosecutions can be brought and then we give to the president on what i would call infractions of geneva article 3 or lesser violations of geneva article 3 we give him the right to put together regulations that account for and treat actions that are defined under those minor offenses section 6 of the bill also provides that any detainee under the custody or physical control of the united states will not be subject to cruel inhumane or degrading punishment provided by the fifth eighth and fourteenth amendments to the constitution as defined by the unitedstates reservations to the u n convention against torture this defines our obligations under common article 3 by reference to the unitedstates constitutional standard adopted by the detainee treatment act that we passed in 2005 and all parties both houses decided that it was appropriate that we define this type of treatment degrading treatment especially under the reservations to the convention that is mentioned the u n convention against torture we decided that that was good enough for putting together the detainee treatment act it should be good enough for this particular body of law section 7 of the bill addresses the question of judicial review of claims by detainees by amending 28 unitedstatesc section 2241 to clarify the intent of the detainee treatment act of 2005 to limit the right of detainees to challenge their detentions the practical effect of this amendment will be to eliminate the hundreds of detainee lawsuits that are pending in courts throughout the country and to consolidate all detainee treatment cases in the d c circuit court however i want to stress that under this provision detainees will retain their opportunity to file legitimate charges to their status and to challenge convictions by military commissions every detainee under confinement in guantanamo bay will have their detention reviewed by the unitedstates court of appeals for the district of columbia so what we are doing here is channeling the suits to a particular court which has great expertise in this area rather than let them be put in rifleshot fashion or formshot fashion to other courts throughout the united states"], [0.0006830692291259766, 0.500683069229126, 0, "i too want to thank my distinguished colleague from arizona for organizing this time for us to pay our respects to a man who has had a profound impact on our world and a profound impact on the oppressed throughout this world we feel sad because of our loss but this is natural but we should in fact rejoice for i have no doubt that this great son of poland has ascended into heaven and has been welcomed home by our lord whom he did so much to serve with his life that he was given we should not dwell on our loss but we should rejoice for all the years we were privileged to know him to see him to hear him and to learn from his example we should rejoice in the strength he had inspired by his faith and conviction to suffer through parkinsons for so many years to survive an assassination attempt and the unsurpassed christian spirit to confront his nearly succtssful assassin and forgive him and pray with him and to know that he is at peace now with the heavenly father he so nobly and humbly served it is difficult to remember what the world was like before we had the example of our pope a scant 27 years ago the year he was chosen iranian protests were brewing that would lead to the imminent fall of the shah usher in the ayatollahs and produce an era of war and terror the soviet union was jailing religious dissidents and staging coups such as that which they nurtured in afghanistan and followed with a fullfledged invasion before john paul ii we did not yet have the vision and the leadership of ronald reagan nor of margaret thatcher who together with them he would usher in the end to the cold war we were told that the west was in irreversible decline and that the freedom bequeathed to us as an inalienable right preserved and protected by the wisdom of the people assembled in democratic government had failed the peoples of the world were being told that individual dignities should be subjugated to the collective it seemed that the only religion was that of the state and that it was to the state that people thought we should direct our worship a young pole named lech walesa had not yet dreamed that a simple concept jike solidarity could overcome the awesome forces of fear and oppression that were the soviet system that is until another son of poland had ascended to the throne of st peter and did what he would do for the rest of his life he provided the world with a brilliant example of the best of humanity john paul ii knew better than the conventional wisdom of the intelligentsia of those who had surrendered their birthright who had chosen to obey the commands of the state who had ceased to recognize the demands of the respect for human dignity ej 1745 he believed that communism would fall and freedom reign because communism at its core represented a false understanding of human nature he knew that totalitarianism in all of its forms would fall he was in a position to know this because of the cruel and harsh experience he gained having seen them both up front and close as a youth as poland was plagued by both nazi fascism and then communism he saw from an upclose vantage what is possible when authority is perverted to a philosophy contemptuous of life he wrote to a friend while a cardinal that a degradation indeed a pulverization of the fundamental uniqueness of each human person was at the heart of the sickness in the human heart that made the tragedies of the 20th century possible that when this happens as it did in the totalitarianism ideologies of communism and fascism the result was the unnatural death of 120 million people in europe and asia this truth is epitomized in an image seared in the collective memory of the world when the pope went to the holy land bowed in remembrance over the memorial flame in yad vashem the jewish holocaust memorial the experience of this youth informed his mission as a pontiff and was made possible because of his indomitable faith in the creator he fiercely pursued an agenda that life in all of its forms is sacred because it is created by god especially human life which is created in his image stalin once derisively remarked that the pope was a relatively powerless person a mere figurehead once famously asking an aide how many divisions does he have stalin never had to come to face john paul ii but later communist leaders would come to know the danger posed by this man and what he represented on earth and in heaven they knew that if the church led by this man was not dealt with sooner or later it would destroy them throughout the world where the people would travel to places where people were trapped under communism and totalitarianism parts of the world that did not dare have hope until they saw john paul ii the power was understood by those tyrants who feared that john paul ii would come to them would visit their land and inspire those people this was understood by the communist masters of poland when the newly installed pope made his first visit there in 1979 returning to the land of his youth of his first flock as a young priest the soviet system knew that it had met its match when onethird of all of the people in poland turned out to witness the homecoming of their native son the only thing for the soviets to do was to tremble and the trembling that started that day did not end until the berlin wall came down 12 years later the last few outposts of repression that remain in our world today deeply fear the loss of their power by the words and the actions of a simple man who would bring a measure of freedom it was a simple yet eternal message of faith in the almighty it almost defies our pitiful ability to comprehend just how different the world is today as we celebrate this mans life and mourn our having lost him on my bookshelf at home i have a wellread book of george geigels biography of john paul ii titled i think appropriately witness to hope billions of people around the world saw this man in that way whether in the full vigor of his youthful pontificate or in his advanced years for billions of people around the world the sight of this man was to see hope he stood for catholicism and all of the principles yet he was appreciated by all people around the world here was a man who while standing for his faith brought the essence of freedom to everyone unapologetically his 26year papacy saw him take this message to every corner of the world he was seen by more of his flock than perhaps all of his 263 predecessors combined he reached out to jews muslims protestants and the eastern orthodox church he took the time to learn at least a few phrases in over 100 different languages just so that he could communicate his message of hope at every place that he visited his message of human dignity is understood in every language and it was understood in every land he saw during the generation he served humanity and god as the bishop of rome in one of his many writings he argued that humanity is right to seed freedom but only if it is a freedom that is used to do justice and justice as he reminded us is to confer preserve protect prolong and give meaning and value to life the spread of freedom will continue unabated in his absence it will continue to inspire by his example as america leads a providential mission that humanity will only know peace and prosperity when every one of gods children knows the freedom and enjoys the dignity bestowed on them by their heavenly father we thank our heavenly father that we were able to know this man and to benefit by his love for us and the love of god we will profit and do service to our children if we remember the words of this man who will soon be known across history as john paul the great freedom has continually to be won it cannot merely be possessed it comes as a gift but can only be kept with a struggle gift and struggle are written into pages hidden yet open"], [0.0006833076477050781, 0.5006833076477051, 0, "mr other side speaker i have in front of me a docu he saw this in field after field he ment called peaking of world oil pro rationalized if he could add up all the duction impacts mitigation and risk fields in the united states and guess as management as i look at the second to how many more we were going to page it says this report was prepared find he could then estimate when the as an account of work sponsoredby an united states would peak in oil proagency of the united states govern duction he made that estimate in 1956 ment that agency was the depart and he said that the united states ment of energy and the organization would peak in oil production about that was funded to do this work was 1970 saic a very prestigious scientific or as itturned out he was right on targanization get you can see here from the graph dr robert hirsch was a project lead this peak in 1970 the smooth curve er he was supported by roger bezdek lere is his prediction the more ragged and robert wendling in this very im curve or the actual data points and portant work it was submitted in feb you see that right on target it peaked ruary of 2005 in 1970 what i would like to do this evening the red curve here is the curve for is to go through the salient points of the soviet union now russia they this socalled hirsch report remem kind of fell apart with their dissolution and they did not reach their potential so there is going to be a second kind of a much lower shorb peak here russia has already peaked in their oil production more than half of all of the oilproducing countries in the world some 25 i believe have already peaked their peak oil production is already behind them the next chart shows a schematic that helps us understand this perhaps a little better this represents a 2 percent exponential growth in oil now all the oil that was produced was used for the first part of the curve the production of oil and the use of oil are the same thing obviously you are not going to produce oil that you do not use if you need more oil and it can be produced your price indicators will mean that more oil is going to be produced so for this part of the curve we have used the oil as fast as we produced it at some point in time it will peak it peaked for the united states in 1970 m king hubbert said it w6uld peak for the wqrld about now actually he said a few kears earlier but he could not have known of the arab oil embargo and the world oil price hike spikes which sent the world into a recession which reduced thfe demand for oil that moved the peak a little forward we believe many observers believe that we are peaking about new or will shortly be peaking i hope that the message that is in this document peaking of world oil production and the things that i am going to say i hope they are wrong because if they are not wrong we in united states and the world is in for a very rough ride by the way we can make this a very sharp peak or a very gradual one by simply changing the scale on the abscissa and the ordinate this represents a 2 percent increase in oil use it is 2 percent of what it was last year so it keeps growing it grows what we call exponentially with a 2 percent growth it doubles in 35 years since this point is half of that point on the ordinate scale this represents 35 years 0 2100 so you see that some years before we actually reach peak and we believe that we mly be hereat this point but a few years before you reach peak you actually are not producing as much as you would like to use just a very few years ago in 1998 i think oil was under 10 a barrel and now it was about 60 a barrel so clearly there is not as much there as the world would like to use and because there is not as much there there is a higher demand for it and so the price goes up we will be talking this evening about filling the gap this is the gap we are talking about filling here what are we going to do now that we have reached this point there are two things we can do one of them is simply reduce our consumption of oil so that there is enough to go around and the other is to try to find some other source of energy so we can fill this growing gap and the further out we go you will see the bigger the gap gets we will be talking about that a little later the next chart is an interesting one that shows the relationship between the oil we found and the oil we used this is the difference between the oil we found and the oil we used you see this is about the year 1980 up until about 1980 every year we found more oil than we used so we were accumulating an exdess this much excess was accumulated from about 1980 on we did not find as much oil as we used and so to have enough oil available we had to now start pumping our reserves and so since 1980 our reserves have been going down and down because we have never i think in any year since about 1980 found as much oil as we pumped the next chart shows these relationships in a somewhat different way that may be a little easier to understand here we have these bars and they represent you see that was very similar to the previous chart and this shows the actual discovery of oil this does not subtract what we use from what we found because we have a second curve here which is the use curve and you will see this black curve here that is the amount of oil that we have used now it is very obvious that you cannot pump oil that you have not found so if you kind of round this curve out and you get a curve here that has an area under it that is the amount of oil that we can use the amount that we have used is under this curve here and since about 1980 we have had to make up for what we did not find by borrowing from thatwhich we had found so you are going to have to borrow some of this and fill in this space here to get us to where we are now in 2005 where do we go from here well where we go from here is going to be determined by how much of this oil that we found is still available and how much more oil we are going to find now the people who put this graph together guessed that the oil could keep going down because it has been going down for 20 years see the slope down for about 20 years they guessed it would keep on going down at that slope so the amount of oil we can use in the future is going to be the difference between what we find which they think is going to be less and less each year which i am sure it will be because it has been for the last two decades and the amount of oil that we use and that will be made up by the oil that is here so you can draw very many curves that do not have you falling off a cliff and clearly the wells do not perform the vay that you pump full bore and you get the last drop out and you do not get any the next day it tapers off little by little as you come down what is called hubberts peak the next chart is from thehirsch report and in this chart he has sirmplified hubberts peak and for purposes of their presentation here they have depicted hubberts peak as not being the bell curve that we looked at before but as simply being a slope up and they slope down and they will tell you in the report that they have simplified that because of the points that they want to make later the bottom of the chart here shows something very interesting it shows our production of oil in our country peaking in 1970 after 1970 we have developed some really good techniques for improving the discovery of oil and the recovery of oil really big increases in our technologies for both finding oil and for pumping it enhanced recovery of oil did not make any appreciable difference in the amount of oil that we were able to pump this points to the fact that the geology really determines how much oil we are going to get in the enhanced recovery techniques and the field exploration techniques do not make much difference another thing that does not make much difference at all is price we are falling down the slope here notice what happened to price i t went way up that ought to have resulted if you think the marketplace works that ought to have resulted in a lot more oil production in our country it did not you see nothing really happened to the oil production when the price really spiked here but what this graph does is to make the point that increased technologies and increased price will have little effect on the production of oil from a field that has already peaked and you are going down slope the next chart is an interesting one and what this shows is kind of what was shown in the past one perhaps in a more dramatic way by 1980 we were already 10 years down the other side of what was called hubberts peak and the reagan administration noted that and they knew they needed to have more oil their solution to that was to incent our oil companies to go out and drill more so they provided some tax incentives for that and it really worked because this is the drill here you see and it really spiked after 1980 they drilled a lot more wells but notice this relationship between the oil that you have found and the oil you are pumping and in spite of all that drilling we went negative what that shows is if it is not there you cannot drill it no matter how many holes you drill you will not get more oil if there is not more oil there to get the next chart is kind of a blowup of the situation in our country since 1935 to roughly the present this shows where we have gotten our oil from it shows us peaking in 1970 oil from texas the rest of the united states the natural gas liquids and then the big discovery of oil in prudhoe bay we were already slipping down hubberts peak there was a little blip there as we slipped down hubberts peak but notice this source where we are getting 25 percent of our oil really did not stop us from slipping down hubberts peak notice the yellow there that is the fabled gulf of mexico oil discovery you may remember that a number of years ago that was supposed to solve our problem it was oil for the foreseeable future that is all the contribution it made now we clearly have been using more oil since we peaked and we have been getting it from overseas and we now get nearly twothirds of our oil from overseas because we have only about 2 percent of the known reserves of oil in the world we use about 25 percent of the worlds oil and we import about twothirds of what we use the next chart shows the estimate of a number of authorities on when peaking is going to occur here we have the dates and this first block of dates are those between now and 2010 that is pretty soon you see the individuals there several of those i know personally colin campbell i have talked with him on the phone from over in the british isles matt simmons is the personal energy adviser of the president president and ceo of perhaps the largest energy investment bank in the world dr deffeyes is a professor at princeton university who has written a book on this subject the end of oil i think the view from hubberts peak is what he calls it then we have a few who think the peak is going to be between 2010 and 2015 and then there are three that say that it is going to be there at notice there is no argument that there will be a peak except for the last one here lynch who believes it will be a long plateau he is not arguing that it will not peak but he thinks it will not reach the top and fall off it will be a long plateau i would like to note that the economists here tend to be those that think that peak will be sometime in the future what economists do is simply predict the future from the past they are very good at studying the past and if in fact~there are inexhaustible resources it is very logical that you ought to be able to predict the future from the past but if in fact there is a limited 9upply of oil then you may not be able to predict the future from the past but notice the big group of experts and this is who they work for and what they are and notice several of them are retired we find when a military person takes off their uniform we sometimes get kind of different testimony from then than when they wear the uniform these people do not have any company they are accountable to they are retired for people who are just retired you tend to get very honest testimony from them so you know who they are and who they work for and they are very credible people and they are pretty much all saying that peaking is pretty soon h10478 co the next chart shows hoiy we use the oil that we get the big blue on top here is transportation that is where we use about 70 percent of it the yellow is industrial the purple down here is electric power and then what we use in our homes residential and then commercial at the very bottom the important part of this is the transportation important for two reasons one is that it is the biggest chunk of it and secondly it is that use of oil that cannot be readily replaced by something else in industry they can use energy from many other sources for much that they do but for transportation we are pretty much stuck with oil the next chart shows us some of the characteristics of the fuels that we use and this is talking about energy density how many gigajoules you get per ton gigajoules is a technical term it simply means btus or calories or heat or energy that you get from a given volume of this we tend to think of it in gallons or barrels 42 gallons in a barrel by the way here you see thatcrude oil is here at 449 and then diesel automotive as you start to refine it you get higher and higher densities now as we run down hubberts peak and start running low on oil and still wbnt to drive our cars and our planes and so forth we will have to find a substitute notice that the substitutes here have very much less energy density i would like to spend just a moment talking about energy density because it is really very important and presents a big challenge to us one barrel of oil that is 42 jallons of oil the refined product of which you can buy now for just a tenth of a penny under 2 at some stores now so you can buy it for well less than 100 that will buy you the work output of 12 people working all year for you if you have some trouble getting your arms around that just imagine how far that gallon of gas or diesel fuel takes your pickup truck or your suv or your car by the way that is still cheaper than water in the grocery store if you are buying it in the small bottles now you could pull your car or truck or suv as far as that gallon of fuel takes you how long would it take you to pull your truck there obviously you cannot pull it but you can usea comealong and guard rails and trees and so forth and by and by you will get it there but it would take you quite a while to take it the distance that that one gallon takes you i another little example of this energy density and the tremendous challenge we face of finding something that is equivalent to this if you work all day real hard in your yard this weekend i will get more work out of an electric motor with less than 25 cents worth of electricity that may be kind of humbling to recognize that in terms of fossil fuel energy we are worth less than 25 cents a day but this incredible wealth that we found under the ground how fast we have used it how little concern we show for the future the next chart addresses the transportation challenge we have obviously the oil will go further if we are using less of it but what he says here is that we cannot conceive of any affordable governmentsponsored crash program to accelerate normal replace ment schedules for our cars and trucks the average car is on the road i think 16 years that is the median that does not mean it is the average because the last one is 18 years that is the middle one and the average light truck about the same distance 16 or 17 years the average big truck heavy truck is on the road for 28 years so if you want to buy a prius or an insight or one of these hybrid cars now we ought to be doing that i am not discouraging us doing that that will make a very small dent in oil use because the things that were bought just this year are going to be on the road 16 or 17 years for cars and light trucks and 28 years median for heavy trucks so it will take a long time if you want to dramatically reduce oil use you have got to get these gas hogs off the road and get some fuel efficient things on the road what they are saying is they cannot conceiv of any affordable here and that is the key word here obviously we could bribe all the people in the country to take their suvs to the junkyard and give them enough money to get a new hybrid that would not be affordable that is the key word here what he is pointing out here is it is going take a long time to make this change from our present gas guzzling suvs big cars and trucks and so forth and go to these hybrids the next chart shows us the contribution that enhanced oil recovery can make we have some really good techniques today and some people will tell you do not worry we are really good at getting oil out of the ground now so do not worry about this peak what this shows is it does not affect the peak indeed if you think about it it should not affect the peak because up until this peak the oil comes out of the ground easily you do not need the enhanced recovery techniques to get it out because it comes out very easily anyhow when you really need them is on the down slope and thisshows you get a little more oil out on the down slope the next chart shows a depiction that the authors use and this is really a simplification they will tell you that this should be a growth curve here an exponential curve but they are making it a wedge because it helps them to make their points and this is a schematic one for any substitute that you want to have it takes awhile before you get anything out of it you have got to build the plant and plan and then you start producing some of whatever this is the next chart will show us the variety of things that it is and the longer you have the more and more of it you produce a day present this thing as a wedge the next chart shows us an addition of some of wedges that you might use to have more liquid fuels available enhanced oil recovery we looked at that that will produce something coal liquids when i was a little boy in our lamps we used coal oil by and by that was substituted by kerosene and hitler ran his military in world war ii on oil made from coal because he did not have any oil and we were not going to let him get any so he had to make it from coal they had a lot of coal heavy oil heavy oil is what determines why it is heavy it will most likely sink in water some of it all the rest of oil floats on water and some of it is what is called sour when you see that sour crude light sweet crude is the most valuable sour crude has a lot of sulfur in it you have to take that sulfur out you are really polluting the air then gas to liquids and then he shows something about efficient vehicles it takes a while before you get this in the fleet and notice in 15 years the trifling contribution that efficient vehicles have made the next chart is a composite here that makes a salient point that they make in their paper and here they look at three different scenarios of when you start to address the problem and the consequences of that the first of these you start your crash program when you peak out you say gee we cannot get as much oil out of the ground today as we got yesterday that will not literally be true it will be this month compared to last month because daytoday is probably not going to make that big a difference if you wait until you see peak oil what they are saying here is that run as fast as you can with mitigation you are still going to have a big shortfall by the way i would like to refer back to their simplification of the bell curve they simply use a slope upand a slope down and what they are saying here when you reach peak oil you would really like to keep on going and use more and more this really of course is an exponential curve going up but they show here for simplicity a straight line and what they are trying to do is fill the gap i am going to come back to that in a couple of minutes but i am not sure we ought to be trying to fill the gap the second curve here represents what happens if you anticipate it by 10 years and notice that most of the people in that former chart thought you were going to have peak oil a lot sooner than 10 years from now but if you have 10 years and start the mitigation you are still going to have a shortfall to have no economic consequences they say they are going to have to start 20 years ahead now almost nobody believes that we have 20 years ahead so obviously if we are trying to fill that gap there is going to be some shortfall because it is either upon us or will shortly be upon us i would like to talk for just a moment about whether or not we ought to try to fill that gap for two reasons i think that maybe we ought to be considering that that is not really a good idea one is there is a pretty widespread belief that the warm weather we are having and the more frequent and intense hurricanes the melting of the icecaps and the glaciers may be due to global warming that may have resulted from an increase in greenhouse gases which are produced by burning these fossil fuels now if that is true and you believe that is going to have a negative effect on our environment our climate and so forth which will ultimately affect us economically then i am wondering why you would want to have more of this by trying to fill that gap let me give you another maybe even better reason that you should not be thinking about filling the gap there is an old saying that if you are in a hole stop digging now a corollary to that would be in this case that if you are climbing a cliff a hill where you will come to a precipice and by and by fall off and have to uncomfortably go down the other side the higher you climb the further you have to fall that is very germane to this because the more oil that we use the more energy that we use the higher we will have climbed up that cliff and the steeper will be the descent down the other side the next chart and you should notice the page where you can find these on each one this is from page 64 of their report and let me read this because this is really significant and i suspect that not too many people know this world oil peaking is going to happen that is a certainty i think that everybody understands that oil cannot be forever there is not an inexhaustible supply of oil it is not going to last to forever what does that mean they think that it means that we will shortly peak in oil production i would like to emphasize that peaking does not mean that we are going to run out of oil we will not run out of oil for a long time maybe 100 years but what we will have run out of is readily available high quality oil that can be produced at the rate we would like to use it it is oil peaking it is not running out of oil a hundred years from now there will be some oil some gas some coal that we can find in everdecreasing amounts at everincreasing cost it will not be very much in 100 years but there will still besome world production of conventional oil will reach a maximum and decline thereafter that maximum is called the peak i would suggest that one can find a lot of information on this if you simply do a google search for peak oil now you get essentially the same information if you do a google search fot hubberts peak but peak oil will do that is maybe easier to remember you will find a lot of articles there relative to this a number of competent forecasters and we looked at that chart a few minutes ago project peaking within a decade others contend it will occur later prediction of the peaking is extremely difficult because of a number of things geological complexities let me pause just a moment to talk a little bit about the geology here and why you do not find oil everywhere we believe that a very long time ago there were warm seas and at that time the world was warm up in northern alaska and siberia because there were warm seas there in every sea there was life there that grew like algae on your pond at the end of the season it sank to the bottom and then dirt was washed off of the adjoining hills and through a very long time that built up large deposits at the bottom of these warm seas then the tectonic plates of the earth separated as you know there are tectonic plates that ride on the molten core of the earth and then the crust of the earth is above those these separated somewhat so that the bottom of these ancient warm seas were submerged covered by a lot of rock and dirt they were warm enough to the molten core of the earth that it was just the right amount of heat they were under enough pressure and with time in this pressure cooker this organic material was converted to oil and gas gas is the volatile part of this oil now you do not only need that you need something else before you really have oil deposits and gas deposits you need a dome of rock over top of this like a big umbrella that keeps the volatiles the gas from going up and escaping because you see if they can escape you do not end up with the nice light sweet crude oil that we value so much you end up with something like the tar sands in the oil shales it is a little bit like the asphalt roads you drive on now if you cook that stuff it will flow and it is pretty much what these tar sands in oil shales are something like that so they were a very unique series of events that occurred that provide the oil and the gas for us and it is no argument that you should not find it probably are not going to find iteverywhere in the world by the way when i was a little boy we lived near a coal mining town and we got what was called runofmine coal in those days there was not a big mechanical thing on a coal face digging it off it was a miner with a pick and his shovel and his wheelbarrow he may have had a little cart and a mule inside the mine to help him in some of the bigger mines but that would come out of the mine and we would buy it just as it came out called runofmine just the way you mined it some big lumps on down to dust some of those big lumps were so big i could not put them in the furnace so there was a sledge hammer and we would have to break the lump to put it in the furnace i remember breaking some of those lumps and they would fall open and there would be a fern leaf i remember the thoughts that i had gee how long ago did that thing grow it was very obvious where coal came from you can see the vegetation inside the coal geological complexities measurement problems pricing variations demand elasticity how much of it we are going to need and political influences are they really going to sell us the oil or not peaking will happen but the timing is uncertain but the fact that it will peak is not uncertain it will peak oil peaking presents a unique challenge they say then i emphasize this statement the world has never faced a problem like this without massive mitigation more than a decade before the fact the problem will be pervasive and will not be temporary previous energy transitions wood to coal and coal to oil were gradual and evolutionary oil peaking will be abrupt and revolutionary the next chart takes us back about 400 years in history it would be nice to have one that took us back 5 000 years in history because that is about the extent of recorded history about 5 000 years but we go back here to the very beginning a little bit before the beginning of the industrial revolution and we notice that the industrial revolution began with wood and it ramped up and we denuded largely the mountains of new england to make charcoal to take to england to make steel and then we found coal and the ordinate here is quadrillion btus that was the amount of energy we got boy did we get a lot more energy from coal than we did from wood it is inore dense it is easier to get and haul large quantities of it but notice what happened when we came to gas and oil there was essentially an explosion in the amount of energy that we could produce notice up there at the top the recession of the 1970s produced by the arab oil embargo there is a stunning statistic up until the carter years every decade the world used as much oil as had been used in all of previous history now what that means is that when we had used half of all the oil that was there we would have only one decade of oil remaining now that slowed down after the arab oil embargo we got a lot more efficient the refrigerator we have today probably uses a third of the electricity it did then so we really slowed down in our use of oil or this chart curve would have kept on going up there is another curve we might put on here and that is the worlds population and it might not be too surprising that the increase in population pretty much paralleled the increase in available energy we started out with 1 billion more or less before the industrial revolution now we have almost 7 billion people in terms of 5 000 years of recorded history the age of oil will be but a brief blip we have been in the age of oil about 150 years it was about 150 years ago we first found oil in any quantities and started to use it in another 150 years we will essentially be through the age of oil what will our world look like when we have exhausted the fossil fuels and they will be exhausted one of the writers in writing about this says that our great grandchildren in looking at history and what we did with these fossil fuels will say how could the monsters have done that how could they have found this incredibly valuable resource buried in the ground these riches buried in the ground and used them wantonly with no regard that they might be finite that they would one day run out matt savinar who wrote one of the articles that people will find when they do the google search for peak oil matt savinar begins his article by saying dear reader civilization as we know it is coming to an end soon i pulled it off the web and gave it to my wife and she read that first paragraph and said the guy is crazy i am not going to read any more i said please read on and reserve judgment she read on and was genuinely frightened when she had finished his article matt savinar may be audacious and i think that the future may not be so bleak as he presents it but i will tell the members if we do not do something meaningful in terms of trying to mitigate the damage it could be it could be as bad as matt savinar presents it he may be audacious but he is not an idiot and i would suggest that members read his article it is very useful the next chart shows something really interesting that we have been talking about this evening this is where we are now we have been running up this side of hubberts peak this by the way is worldwide the question is now when will the world do what the united states did in 1970 when will the world reach peak oil i had a course in statistics when i was working for my doctorate inschool maybe 55 or 60 years ago and what they have done here we have a probability of 95 percent that is most likely what we will find and then we have a 50 percent probability that it could be higher or it could be lower and then a 5 percent probability or it could be higher or it could be lower and somehow they mysteriously take this as the expected value it could be low just as well as high that is not the expected value the value that the statistician would tell us to expect is a 95 percent value and by the way that is pretty much what the experts tell us a couple of congresses ago i was chair of the energy subcommittee on the science committee and i wanted to determine the dimensions of this problem so we had a hearing and invited in the worlds experts on oil reserves and there was pretty unanimous agreement i was surprised it was somewhere like from 970 to 1 040 about 1 000 gigabarrels of oil that remained now we have pumped about the same amount we have pumped about 1 000 gigabarrels that is 1 000 billion barrels that is 1 trillion barrels and that sounds like a lot but if we divide that 1 000 gigabarrels by the 84 million barrels that we use a day 21 in our country alone 63 in the rest of the world 84 total if we divide that 84 million barrels a day into the 1 trillion barrels that the experts told us are still out there we come to about 40 years remaining oil remember up until the carter years when we used half of it which is about what we have used we would have only 10 years remaining so we have really slowed down fortunately we are using it much more efficiently now than we did then but they make two assumptions for this chart one is that it peaks in 2016 and that there is 3 000 gigabarrels that is not what the experts say th e experts say that there will be a total of about 2 000 gigabarrels 1 000 already pumped another 1 000 to be pumped if that is true then we would start downhill from this point but if we have another 1 000 gigabarrels notice with this exponential curve how little that pushes peak oil out not very far what is it about 2017 2016 something like that is all that it pushes out here it is 2016 and if we now assume that there is more than that it pushes it out further but notice what happens notice what happens notice how quickly we fall i made the point before i am not sure we want to fill the gap because the analogy of if you are in a hole stop digging is if you are climbing a hill and you are going to fall off a cliff on the other side the lower the hill the less you will fall and they make exactly that point here in these predictions these are predictions of the energy information agency these are economists working for the department of energy they are not oil experts they are economists and they do what economists do they predict the future from the past and they really study the past and know it ald they think that if theyknow the past well they can predict the future but what they do not take into account is that oil is finite and their predictions would be exactly right if market forces controlled and if oil were limitless but oil is clearly not limitless in the last chart that i want to spend a few minutes on where do we go from here from where will we get our liquid fuels from where will we get our energy as we run down the other side of hubberts peak we have here some finite resources by finite we mean they are not forever some of them are pretty big if we can get the energy out tar sands and oil shales some will tell us do not worry about the future of energy because there is 1 trillion barrels of oil in the oil sands of canada alone that is true but there is also an incredible amount of energy in the tides i pick up two 5gallon buckets of water and they are pretty heavy and then i note that the moon lifts the whole ocean about 2 feet that is an incredible amount of energy but because there is that incredible amount of energy out there does not mean that i can harness it and use it effectively the same thing is pretty much true of these tar sands yes there is potentially a lot of energy there but how effectively efficiently can we get it out the canadians are now producing oil maybe even less than 30 a barrel they are selling for 60 that is a good deal and they are producing a lot of it but when we look at the energy that it takes to get it out there are better techniques than the one they are using but the technique they are using they use more energy from natural gas than they get out of oil so that the energy profit ratio is less than nothing the oil is sought on the market and brings a good price the gas is up there and they do not need it and it is hard to ship so from a dollarandcents perspective it may make sense to use that gas even more energy and gas to produce the oil than they get out of the oil but ultimately of course as we move to a more energyefficient world we will not be able to do that i was out at a conference in denver colorado just this past weekend and the shell oil scientist that was doing some of the tests in the oil shales of colorado emphasized that his work was just experimental that he could not extrapolate from what he had now done to the future and what they have done is kind of interesting they have taken a small patch of colorado desert out there high desert and they have drilled a lot of holes in a circle and frozen put pipes down there and they froze in the ground what they have done is to make avessel out of frozen ground because they do not want what they are doing inside that b ig vessel to contaminate groundwater outside and then they cook the oil i hear from 2 years to 4 years for some period of time they cook the oil inside that v essel th6y keepputting hot water down there steam down there and they cook the oil by the way they heat that with natural gas which is why it takes so much energy and then they pump on that when they have heated it up it will flow so they can pump it out but this is pretty small it is hard to scale up from that and they put in one unit of energy from heat and they get out 32 units of energy that looks like a pretty good energy profit ratio but it does not account for all the energy that goes in there drilling the holes and refrigeration and the energy it took to make the equipment that they use and refining it when they get it out and so forth so we are not yet sure how positive that is going to be it may be that we will use the energy from four barrels of oil and have one net plus by the way that would not be all that bad because that is about the ratio in producing ethanol we have to put in about threefourths as much energy into the ethanol as we get out of it about 750 000 btus of energy to get 1 million units of energy in producing ethanol and that is for efficient production many of our ethanol production facilities now are producing ethanol dr pimental believes with a negative energy profit ratio the more fossil fuel energy goes in to producing it than we get out of it coal we have about 250 years of coal remaining in our country that is the current use rate if we increase the use only 2 percent exponentially that 250 years shrinks to 85 years for many uses like our car we cannot use coal we are going to have to use gas or a liquid and we are going to have to take some energy to make that conversion now it shrinks to 50 years so we have got about 50 years of effective coal remaining at only a 2 percent increase we may need to increase its use much more than 2 percent it is there we need to husband it and use it wisely nuclear we produce 8 percent of our eleqtricity in this country from nuclear that is 20 percent of our electricity that can and maybe should grow but the kind of plants we use the light water reactor plants cannot be expanded indefinitely because there is a limited supply of fissionable uranium in the world i get wildly divergent estimates from 30 years to 200 years that is at currentuse rates as soon as you start exponentially increasing the rate of use whateverthat time is it shrinks very rapidly that means if we really wanted to go bigscale nuclear we need to go to breeder reactors with breeder reactors you borrow a lot of problems like transporting the fuel for enrichment you have weaponsgrade plutonium produced and you may in the future be making a choice betweep buying these problems and shivering in the dark because in an energydeficient world that may be the choice that you come to nuclear fusion oh how i hope we get there because then we are homefree but planning to solve our energy problems in this country of the world with fusion is a bit like you or me planning to solve our personal economic problems by winning the lottery it would be nice if it happened it probably will not and i certainly would not count on it and then we come to the truly renewable sources about half of those a little more than half comes from nuclear up here as compared to what is down here solar wind they now represent about a quarter of a percent of our total energy a bit more than that of electricity but about a quarter of a percent of our total electricity geothermal that is tapping into the molten core of the earth where we can do that we ought to do it because that will last a very long time i mentioned ocean energy lots of energy there the tides the waves thermal gradients in the ocean there is a lot of potential energy there but there is an old axiom that says energy to be effective must be concentrated it is so diffuse in the ocean we have been trying for a very long time to capture some of that energy and it is very very difficult and then we come to agricultural resources a lot of people have high hopes for what we can get from agriculture we can get energy from agriculture in two different ways one by producing fuels like ethanol and methanol by fermenting the product and the other is by burning the product there are limits to both of these we now are barely able to feed the world tonight a fair number of people will go to bed hungry we could free up more of this energy if we would be content to eat the soybeans and corn rather than the pig and the cow and the chicken eating the corn and the soybeats to take biomass from the soil that is what makes topsoil different from subsoil is organic material biomass i am sure we can get some energy from that but we have to be careful how much to tend to get from that waste energy instead of putting it in the landfill burn it there is a really good plant here in montgomery county very near i would be proud to have that next to my church i cannot even see that it is burning trash because trash comes in inside a big container it is inside before it is emptied and it looks like a nice brick office building the last thing is hydrogen from renewables hydrogen is not an energy source you cannot mine it or suck it out of the air the only way you get hydrogen is to use energy from some other source like natural gas this is where we get most of it or like splitting water with electrolysis you will always use more energy in getting the hydrogen than you get out of hydrogen or else you are going to have to repeal the second law of thermodynamics and that is not going to happen it is still a good idea because hydrogen burns very cleanly you get only water you can burn it in a fuel cell where you have at least twice the efficiency of reciprocating engine but it is not a solution to our energy problem think of it as an energy carrier which is exactly what your battery is if you think of this as being a hydrogen battery as opposed to an electron battery that you have in your car you will get it right as far as hydrogen is concerned there is a lot of talk about a hydrogen future that is not going to happen in the next decade or two or even three it is going to take a very long time to ramp up and we will always have to have some bigger energy source from which we make the hydrogen because it will always be made with an energy deficit because we are not going to repeal the second law of thermodynamics i want to submit for the record this report because it is not available anywhere else for the public to review"], [0.0006834864616394043, 0.5006834864616394, 0, "i thank the gentleman for yielding to me and i also would like to join the gentlewoman from tennessee in really saluting the gentleman from texas and his commitment to being a prudent steward of the taxpay6r dollar i do not think there is anyone who serves in this house who has more of a commitment to the notion that the dollars that we spend and we raise here at the federal level the fact that they are not really dollars that belong to the government they are dollars that belong to the people and the businesses that earn them again as a watchdog of the treasury i do not think there is any other more adamant and loyal soldier than the gentleman from texas and i do congratulate him on that accomplishment and know that he will continue to serve in that capacity i would like to also return and just set the record st raight for some of the statements that were made in the prior hour regarding the war in iraq if i could just diverge a little bit from the topic at hand here regarding the federal budget because of the statements that weremade we are helping cause the local insurgency in iraq the next quote was if you want to end terrorism get out of iraq go after osama bin laden as for the first i am having a little difficulty following the logic of how the presence of american troops in iraq would cause local insurgency we all know as we read the news reports every day that there is a stream of outsiders coming in joining with the sunni insurgency in iraq and it has become ground zero for the terrorists who wish to do us harm in the united states who wish to do israel harm in the middle east and frankly wish to do harm to anyone in the free world i would say to the individuals in the prior hour that make no mistake iraq afghanistan other parts of the world where we see the operation of terrorist organizations and cooperation by local regimes that dynamic that formula is what continues to fuel the war that we are engaged in it is directly the sponsorship of unfriendly regimes of these terrorist organizations that allow these organizations sanctuary in which to train that allow these organizations resources on which to operate and frankly allow them to pull off the terrorist attacks that we have seen frankly for almost two decades if not longer one of the gentlewomen who were involved in the discussion prior said that we if we want to go after the terrorists should go after the individuals that perpetrated the attacks on 9 11 and of course we are first of all we know that 19 of them perished in their mission and demonstrated that their hatred of us knows no bounds they avenged that hatred including taking their own lives so we are engaged in a war for the free world and the sooner that all of us in this house recognize that and support this president and this administration in what we are trying to do and that is to secure our homeland and to provide national security for americans the iluicker it is that we will see victory the fact that we are being accused by some on the other side of the aisle for not having a strategy nothing could be further from the truth our strategy has always been very straightforward one counter the insurgency and assist the iraqis in forming their own military police and military so that they can take care of themselves that is ongoing reports show that over 85 battalions of iraqis are engaging with our troops embedded with our troops and fighting with us alongside our brave men and women in this war on terror secondly we are to identify the islamic jihadists and allow our special forces to deal with them and i know that all of us in this house know that that is being dealt with thirdly we are using the appeal of democracy to attract the sunni minority into the government to allow them the freedoms allow them protections that a minority enjoys in a democratic state as we saw 11 2 weeks ago the ratification of that constitution guarantees those minorities their rights and we will see in another couple of months the elections of the full and permanent parliament so again to underscore my opposition to their statements and the fact that i differ strongly with the representations that were made now back to the subject that the gentleman from texas and the gentlewoman from tennessee were engaged in and the fact that i too join with them in calling on our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to lay down their partisanship to join us as 51 of their fellow party men joined the republicans in 1997 in engaging in what wds then the first deficit reduction act under reconciliation since the republicans took majority i ask them to do that because it is imperative that we renew our commitment in this house to the hardworking american taxpayer and for what they do for their families every day we owe it to these families to be good stewards of their money we all were elected here in our various districts by constituents and their needs we certainly are here and are being judged each and every day by what we do and how we cast our votes i know that i was elected by my constituents to take a good long look at the way the government operates and to try to make the improvements to government and the structure so that it can be more efficient with the use of the taxpayer dollars so that we can as the gentleman and gentlewoman pointed out root out the waste fraud and abuse that unfortunately has continued to grow as the bureaucracy expands both the gentleman from texas and the gentlewoman from tennessee talked about the waste fraud and abuse in some of the entitlement programs that exist take for instance the medicaid program this is a program as we know that is a partnership between the federal government and the states it is a program that offers to some in this country a very necessary support for the health care of those indigent citizens in our society but if we look at the pattern of growth of this program it is something that i think strays far from the original intentions of those in this body that created and passed the enabling statute over the past 5 years this program has grown by 56 percent frankly it is an unsustainable growth rate given the increasing costs and escalating costs in health care so the reforms that we will have a chance to vote on next week as the gentlewoman pointed out under the deficit reduction act these reforms attempt to slow the growth and identify areas where waste fraud and abuse has been fueling that growth and even after we enact the reforms under the deficit reduction act we will still see medicaid with a 7 percent growth rate so what we are doing is identifying savings how are we doing that well first of all we see thecreation of health opportunity accounts this will be a pilot program that will enable certain states to afford medicaid beneficiaries the opportunity to set up essentially a health savings account and we know that we provided that ability for anyone in the medicare bill as well a few years back we created the opportunity for individuals to purchase highdeductible catastrophic health care plans so that we could lower the cost of health care for american families and also emphasize the familys role in deciding the destiny if you will of their health care provision and to emphasize the role of that family in making choices as far as health care is concerned we are going to afford the same opportunity to beneficiaries under the medicare program as well additionally once we pass the deficit reduction act we are going to able to root out the asset transfer fraud that is going on with many in this country which essentially allows those who could otherwise afford to pay for their health care services to become wards of the state again this is far from theoriginal intention of those who enacted this program of medicaid medicaid is for the truly indigent for truly those who cannot help themselves and are in need of health care we also provide for in the deficit reduction act the cessation of states somehow going about double dipping if you will in order to gain more access to federal moneys we want to cut that out as well because again this goes against the original intention of what this program was supposed to do and the list goes on areas such as student loans we wanted to make sure that we have an adequate supply or availability of financial aid as we see enrollment continuing to grow in our colleges and universities as we see increasing tuition costs in our colleges and universities and that is exactly what this bill does assure as well that the financial aid will continue to be there but as it increases we also increase the loan limit amount but also reduce the fees that our students will pay again it is very important to afford access to our students to our education system in this country but at the same time make sure that the federal dollars are used in the most appropriate and efficient manner"]]}
