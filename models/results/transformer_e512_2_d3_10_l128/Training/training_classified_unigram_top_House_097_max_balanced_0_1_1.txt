see this as a major shortcoming in the presidents pioposal and the grammlatta substitute both represent a radloal departure in federal transportation policy which will have a severe impact on many states and localities these proposals contain huge cuts in mass transit and highway assistance and substantial cutbacks in rail aid and aviation programls the reductions and the new transportation policies they would require will increase the tax burden in many states and localities they will preclude construction of new urban rail transit systems they will slow down highway construction they

using that airp~ort but they had no idea how such a system of nonstandardized taxes all over the country could be madie to work and more importantly they really had no answer as to why a passenger at one of these larger aimports would not be cheated by paying thle same federal ticket tax as somecone at a smaller airport while being pmevented from having any of these ftinds returned as adap grants to the airport he or she actually uses then on top of that the person would have to pay thie local head tax to make up for thle airports lost adap funds another area where the administration failed to review actual need is the f e program f e funds buy radars the air troffic control computers and the precision approach systems which are essential to air safety four months ago the faa completed its

consider the conference ageement on h r 4961 i want to go on record as standing adamantly opposed to this tax increase president reagan the other evening painted a pretty good picture why we as members of congress and as americans should support his proposals to increase taxes by 98 3 billion and cut spending by 17 2 billion over the next 3 years the president was quick to point out to the american people that this revenueraising proposal would be offset by the tax reductions enacted last year by congress this would be fine if the tax reductions enacted last year would have been geared for middle and lowincome people unfortunately the tax reductions were meant and have only helped the wealthy and corporations ironically enough this is just how the president wants to increase revenuesby taking away the tax breaks he assumed would spur the economy and would be vital to his economic recovery plan the bottom line of all this for the average american taxpayer is still the samenothing the president spoke of savings but the very programs he seeks to save money are the very programs which have suffered devastating budget cuts already how far does the president want to go how much does he think the american people can stand can we in all good conscience support a conference agreement which calls for a savings of 13 3 billion in medicarethe very program which helps our older americans meet their hospital costs to me this does not represent a saving but represents driving our senior citizens to ilhealth and pushing adequate health care further from the realm of being obtainable if this is not enough the president also wants to hold the elderlys property hostage and drive them further into the poorhouse a small simple provision making cuts in the medicaid program of 1 1 billion would set a lien on property of those poor elderly persons owing the medicaid system money states threatened by new federal sanctions if money is not collected would become the snidely whipflashes of foreclosing on those who through no fault of their own are having difficulty in meeting their payments now we all want to see both the state and federal government collect revenue rightly due but those older americans who had to rely on the medicaid system should not be driven further into the poorhouse there will be no dudley doright to help the elderly there will be no ray of hope for those who desparately need medical attention it is also not clear to me how a president who is insistent upon getting the federal government out of peoples lives and reducing needless paperwork can support a provision to enact a withholding tax on interest and dividends we all are aware that such a provision will impose substantial new economic and paperwork burdens on financial institutions businesses and taxpayers and the unitedstates government this is a classic example of economic smoke screening because the revenue windfall to the unitedstates government is heavily front loaded the bulk of the revenue gainabout 2 billioncomes only in the first year when the government receives its tax revenues earlier than it normally would after the first year there is very little revenue difference even though the economic and paperwork burden for taxpayers businesses and financial institutions continues at the same level in other words this is a oneshot deal of raising revenues while other provisions will continue over the 3year period i therefore question where the president is going to wave his magic wand next year after we have already been hit with the withholding tax on interest and dividends the president has also thrown us who want to help the unemployed a bone to entice us into voting for his tax increase package that bone and i might add that bone has no meat on it is a provision to extend unemployment benefits in states hardest hit by his economic policies if we really want to help the unemployed then let us address it in a separate piece of legislation can president reagan honestly tell the american people that he really wants to extend unemployment benefits after his fiscal year 1983 budget request and his approval of the first budget resolution passed earlier by the congress provided no funding for extended unemployment benefits can president reagan ignore the fact that since january 1981 when he took office to july 1982 the unemployment rate increased from 7 4 to 9 8 percentthe highest since 1941 these are very serious questions we need to address not in tax legislation but in logical responsible legislation to effectively deal with our unemployed let me also stress that this unemployment benefits bone is less enticing when you consider the fact that the president turns around and taxes the very same unemployment benefit he is giving outofwork americans in the conference agreement the thresholds limiting the inclusion of unemployment benefits in adjusted gross income will be reduced from 20 000 to 12 000 for a single taxpayer and from 25 000 to 18 000 for a married taxpayer filing jointly in other words the president wants to give the unemployed 10 extra weeks of benefits and then tax them on those benefits this may help the unemployed now but come the end of the year that unemployed person is going to end up with nothing if we really want to do something meaningful then let us talk about making corporations accountable for their fair share of the tax burdennot those who can least afford it a recent independent tax study concluded very clearly that federal taxes paid by 514 largest unitedstates corporations has declined from an average of 22 7 percent in 1980 to 20 5 percent in 1981 why because president reagan wanted and the congress gave him reductions in taxes last year it therefore makes no sense to me why the president ever proposed cutting these corporate taxes only to turn around in the next year and urge that we support a bill to reverse the corporate tax reductions he so desperately needed last year as part of the republican economic recovery plan the whole idea of increasing taxes at a time when the american people are already overburdened with taxes depressed about the economy and tired of the same old rhetoric from washington is absurd to recall vice president busns phrase it is nothing but voodoo economics we need sound economic policies not r madefortelevision melodrama"], [0.00020071864128112793, 0.49979928135871887, 1, "i would like to associate myself with the remarks of the gentleman in the well i think he is right on target i rise in strong support of the committee resolution and in opposition to the grammlatta substitute i would like to make three points about the economic program we are considering using a minimum of confusing numbers and a maximum of commonsense i oppose the reagan economic plan as embodied in the grammlatta substitute amendmentfor three simple reasons first the program prolongs inflation and deficit spending in the federal budget second the reagan budget is unfair and dettructive to my region of the country and to poor and disadvantaged people throughout the country and third the massive unprecedented increases in military spending under the reagan program are economically disastrous and counterproductive to our true security needs the administration is selling its program to the public on the basis of its supposed cuts in federal spending everyone supports such a policy but the reagan budget cuts amount to no reduction in overall federal spending spending under the reagan program will rise from 655 billion this year to 912 billion in 1986by the presidents own estimate the key element of the reagan budget program is a transfer of government spending from domestic programs to military programs as spending increases the reagan program calls for massive reductions in revenues through huge tax cuts for business and individuals no one is asked explicitly to pay for a military buildup three times the size of the vietnam war mobilization but we will all eventually pay with increased inflation and a more unstable economy our previous commitments to the elderly the disdvantaged and the disabled are now being shrugged off windfall tax cuts will fall into the laps of the rich with no restriction that this money be invested where it is needed to revitalize our economy what happens to the economy in the midst of all this the laffer curve suggests that tax cuts will somehow increase tax revenues it is an idea crazy enough to get the attention of the media and politicians but comnmonsense says otherwise increased spending and decreased revenues simply mean higher deficits increased consumer demand without the investment needed to increase productivity and output simply means more inflation massive spending on weapons that blow up or sit in underground silos simply means investments sucked out of productive sectors of the economy the second point i want to raise is on the question of the fairness of the reagan program for example should a program truly aimed at eliminating waste in the federal budget endorse tobacco subsidies boondoggle water projects or tax deductions for martini lunches for businessmen the reagan program is not fair and it does endorse these wasteful programs the reagan program ignores the fact that different cities states and regions have different needs the program does not consider where federal help is needed or where help will do the most good current federal policy has the effect of draining tax payments from the industrial states of the northeast and midwest to subsidize new economic expansion in the south and west between 1975 and 1979 the northern states sent 166 billion more in taxes to washington than they got back in federal spending the reagan economic program would intensify this regional bias nowhere is this more clear than in the area of defense spending anyone f amiliar with the regional patterns of defense spending can see that the administrations massive investments in ships planes and missiles will mean jobs and economic stimulus for the south and west meanwhile budget cuts in economic development programs to leverage private investment in distressed areas and social programs to help the urban poor and elderly are eliminated or reduced oil price decontrol and proposals to decontrol natural gas will drive up the cost of living in the north while cutbacks in energy conservation programs and fuel assistance erode our ability to deal with these rising costs besides the regional winnersthe south and westthe wealthy are the beneficiaries of the reagan economic program it is a matter of simple arithmetic that the rich who pay more taxes will benefit by the reagan proposal to cut income taxes by 30 percent in fact onethird of the benefits of the reagan tax program will go to those earning 50 000 a year who represent only 4 1 percent of the american public beyond that the reagan business tax cuts primarily benefit investment in commerical real estate drawing investment away from existing and usable plants speculators of all kinds would benefit from the reagan proposal to cut the capital gains tax including investment in both plant and equipment and speculative investmentin land homes gold paintings antiques and so forth this will force investment out of productive artas and into speculative investments since speculative investments paly off faster finally i have to address the reagan defense buildup the largest longterm mobilization of our armed forces since the second world war never has so radlcal and enduring a policy change been entered into with so little deliberation or sureness of purpose we have to compare this defense strategy with the policies of the french in the 1930s under general maginot i realize that this is a political hot potato but let is not preach about restoring the health of our economy while we ignore the most inflationary nonproductive element in the budget like the french in 1940 we may find ourselves beaten because of the threats we in our haste are ignoring who denies that americas primary strength is in economic power and our compassionate and fair society if we destroy these strengths to build up the military we will be weaker in the long run i have supported real increases in defense spending to meet real defense needs however the reagan proposals would increase defense spending by three times the amount of the vietnam war mobilization what is the threat perceived in this buildup and how is the administration answering this threat clearly the money for defense will go into huge projects like the mx missile which will become obsolete nearly as soon as they are completed money will immediately be poured into a defense industry which is already operating at capacity and the prices of planes tanks and bombs will simply be inflated to absorb the new money being thrown at our defense needs by the pentagon and the reagan administration i would prefer to focus on proposals like h r 1400 a revised gi bill which would offer education benefits as an incentive to retain experienced quality personnel in the service we need to spend money on people and the operation and maintenance of our existing forces in reasonable and economically viable ways frankly i am discouraged that we seem to have entered into a bidding process for members votes by blindly upping the defense budget this lack of thoughtfulness is disgraceful and counterproductive to meeting every true domestic and military need that we have i have outlined my objections to the reagan economic program and i recognize that there are sensible alternative proposals being presented to the house i simply support a policy of balancing the federal budget through real and reasonable reductions in expenditures i support a policy of curbing inflation through policies aimed at increasing savings and investment and increasing productivity i support a strong defense based upon addressing real needs in the areas of personnel and conventional forces the house budget committee and others have come up with reasonable alternatives that meet the standards i have set and i support these proposals i view this as a constructive contribution to the formation of and economic program which will reach the goals shared by all americanscurbing inflation reducing taxes and stimulating renewed economic growth"], [0.0002008974552154541, 0.49979910254478455, 1, "i am today introducing legislation to remedy what i believe is a serious deficiency in the supplemental security income ssi program as you know the ssi program was established in 1974 to provide a federally guaranteed minimum income for the elderly the blind and the disabled it operates under very strict guidelines as to the levels of income and assets allowed its beneficiaries these limitations are designed to restrict the program to serving only the most desperately needy of our citizens those who are unable to work who have no assets to fall back on and whose benefits from other federal social programs are not sufficient to allow them even the most basic of existences i believe that ssi plays a central role in the federal governments commitment to meeting the needs of the disadvantaged by guaranteeing a minimum living standard it prevents its recipients from falling through the gaps in our network of social service programs in 1976 an important change was made in the law to allow contrioutions to ssi recipients from state and local government agencies under this provision assistance provided by states and localities which is based on need is not counted toward the income limitation this allows recipients to receive extra help from nonfederal government social programs without losing anything from their federal benefits the legislation i am introduchig today would simply extend this provision to include assistance from private nonprofit organizations which is determined by the appropriate state agency to be based on need in most cireumstances ssi recipients now lose a dollar of federal support for eveir dollar of private assitance they receive under th is provision if a charitable group vished to help some of these elderly or blind or disabled incividuals and was certified by the state to be providing that help on the sole basis of the individuals need it could do so without the recipients suffering a corresponding loss in federal aid i believe this change in the ssi prozram is long overdue particularly now when federal social programs of all kinds are being cut back and we hear much talk of private sector voluntarism moving in to fill the gaps we must not discourage private charitable organizations from providing whatever assistance they can it is most appropriate for the federal government to guarantee a floor income for these most needy and most vulnerable members of our population however it is counterproductive to allow that guarantee to prevent the private sector from raising them above that minimumlevel existence this provision would allow more flexibility in the program without altering its fundamental purpose to insure that no american is prevented by age blindness or disability from achieving a basic decent minimum standard of living in addition this change would not add significantly to either the federal bureaucracy or the federal budget deficit by having the states rather than the federal government set the standards for private aid this bill avoids any major increase in either federal administrative costs or federal involvement in the operations of private charitable organizations moreover this provision would add to the direct costs of the ssi program only insofar as individuals now receiving private assistance became eligible for ssi or saw their ssi benefits increase once that assistance was no longer counted toward the income limitation since private organizations have as a rule been discouraged from aiding ssi recipients or potential recipientsthe very problem this legislation is designed to correctthis group is likely to be relatively small i would like to close by giving my colleagues two examples of the difficulties that have arisen under present law independent living for the handicapped a nonprofit organization operating in my own congressional district uses donations from private sources to help disabled individuals establish themselves in independent living situations rather than being forced to depend on others for their most basic needs however any aid they provide to ssi recirients is offset by a dollarfordollar decrease in the ssi benefit several years ago a church in rural virginia the mount pleasant church of the brethren formed a committee on the needs of the elderly to determine how best to aid the poor and elderly residents of their area the committee decided to assist some of these residents with monthly cash payments to be used toward their rent but again found their assistance offset by decreases in ssi benefits as the committee members wrote to their ren esentative in congress we as a country give the elderly enough assistance to allow them to survive and then stop and when others wish to help to allow them some dignity as well as quality to life our hands pre bound this legislation would give this church and other groups like it the iteedom to help those around them who they can see are in need who can survive with the aid of government benefits but can do

much about what the latta amendment does to housing not for housing hilt to housing because cf the extent of the confusion in the house over this issue some time needs to be taken tonight before we ultimately vote on the latta amendment i really thought that yesterday after the remarks of our majority leader that no one in the house of representatives would be left in a confused state about the death blow that the latta substitute would inflict on the emergency housing bill i did not hink anyone would be confused i felt and i think i was joined by others who helped pass the recent emergency housing bill that surely all members after listening to yesterdays remarks must know that unless that emergency housing program is passed and the latta substitute defeated most of the homebuilders will be destroyed by the end of this building season this summer but there still seems to be some confusion on that point i want to take this time to make clear what was made clear yesterday but needs to be made clear once againa vote for the latta amendment is a vote against the emergency housing stimulation program the program that this house authorized and voted by better than a 2toi margin only 2 weeks ago the latta substitute kills the housing programkills it i think this point was ably made yesterday on the floor of the house by the majority leader as well as in a letter written by the national home builders association which said that that 1 million member republican oriented trade association feels that the passage of the latta amendment would decimate what little is left of the american housing industry why because the latta amendment does not allow funds already approved in the emergency supplemental appropriation to be spent to save the housing industry yesterday one of our colleagues from texas and other latta backers tried to fuzz up the issue and pretend the funds for housing are actually in their proposal several speakers subsequently shot that argument down and showed what a bunch of baloney that was i thought the matter was settled but today i discovered this poop sheet which i hold in my hand un fortunately the alleged rebuttal continues to peddle the same distortions of fact that were peddled yesterday what we have here is an attempt to confuse the housing issue so that members who support housing will still vote for latta the members of the body are being duped this socalled fact sheet states that the latta amendment provides fiscal year 1983 housing credit assistance at a level almost 18 billion above the presidents budget what they neglect to mention is that this number is derived from a baseline estimate that has been discounted by nearly everyone and is not used in any other budget substitute pending in fact this number is nearly 19 billion below the jones budget proposal and it represents no new spending for these programs the second and most critical misstatement of fact is in regard to the emergency housing assistance program which has been overwhelmingly endorsed by the members of the house the fact sheet suggests that the latta amendment provides an outlay allowance for a housing stimulus program for fiscal year 1983 through let us assume for the moment that this statement is indeed correct if so by the admission of this fact sheet it would not provide one nickles worth of assistance for this fiscal year 1982 construction seasonthe most crucial in determining which of the remaining homebuilders and construction workers will survive and which will not but let us for the moment sweep aside this major flaw and examine the type of assistance that would be offered under the latta amendment proponents of the latta substitute argue that the 1 billion needed annually to cover the cost of the emergency housing program may be provided through function 370 which incorporates the gnma tandem program what then are mr latta and his supporters trying to tell us are they trying to tell us that their idea of an emergency housing production program is the onma tandem program afterall that is where they are saying the money is no they are not saying that because the gnma tandem program is not structured to provide the necessary stimulus to revitalize and breathe new life into the devastated housing industry so what they are really telling us is that they are intending to cannibalize low income multifamily rental housing programs to cover the cost of the emergency housing production program simply stated proponents of the latta substitute are dismantling programs that assist lowincome people with incomes of 80 percent of the area median income or lower to provide mortgage assistance to middleincome families with incomes of 37 000 but clearly this is neither a fair nor equitable way in which to approach the urgent crisis in the housing industry i know that supporters of the latta substitute know that so let us not kid ourselves any further what it comes down to is this who are you going to trust mr grasnh mr latta who are telling us that there is room for the housepassed emergency housing production program in their budget resolution but who voted against the bill when it came to the floor just weks ago are we to believe mr latta and his supporters who assure us that there are funds available for the housing production stimulus program when in fact the budget aggregates which the latta substitute would provide for 1982 are below the current level estimates of 1982 spending and any spending legislation coming to tne house floor including the conference report on the urgent supplemental ap propriation bill would thus be subject to a point of order if the latta 1982 budget were adopted and given the gentlemens recent track record on this issue it is not unlikely that they would be the very individuals to raise such a point of order so i ask you are we to trust these individuals or the 1 million homebuilders across this nationthe small businessmen who are the cornerstone of the american economy and who are strongly opposed to the latta substitute because it does not provide the assistance they need this construction season well after this explanation no one can use the excuse that they voted for latta because they did not know what it did to housing you are forewarned the latta supporters mumbojumbo sleightofhand games with numbers do not hold

voyageurs national park this legislation will effect several boundary changes increase authority for land acquisition within the park and authorize two important programs to enhance use and enjoyment of the park in 1980 in the final weeks of the 96th congress i introduced legislation similar to h r 846 senator dave durenberger introduced identical legislation in the senate that legislation represented the product of extensive negotiations involving ourselves the national park service the state of minnesota and the people living in the area around the park at the beginning of this congress senator durenberger and i with broad bipartisan support in our delegation introduced h r 846 and s 625 in june the senate passed an amended version of s 625 after very careful consideration the house interior committee has brought h r 846 as amended to the floor the subcommittee on public lands and national parks held a hearing at which park service and state of minnesota officials supporters of the bill and opponents of the bill had the opportunity to testify following that hearing the subcommittee amended h r 846 to reflect concerns raised by conservation groups regarding the bill i believe h r 846 as introduced was a good bill it reflected the extensive negotiations involving federal state and local officials which had preceeded introduction of h r 846 h r 846 as reported implements the essential elements of the agreement between the national park service and the state of minnesota it will authorize the secretary of the interior to transfer to the state of minnesota approximately 1 000 acres at black bay primarily water in return for which the state of minnesota is to first transfer approximately 138 acres to the national park service and second enter into a recordable agreement satisfactory to the secretary providing for the establishment of a wildlife management area in that portion of black bay deleted from the park and the establishment of a plan to manage the waters and state lands riparian to black bay to preserve the natural resources of the area to complement to the fullest extent possible the purposes for which the park was established the state has agreed to develop such a plan which will enhance the national park under state law the minnesota department of natural resources may convey a permanent easement to the park service for road construction and up to a 10year lease on other state lands as introduced h r 846 would have allowed these administrative conveyances the bill before the house today will insist upon a conveyance in fee simple of the 138 acres involved fee conveyance will reqire an act of the state legislature my concern with this change from the bill as introduced is that it will delay the conveyance authorized by h r 846 the state of minnesota has already provided 36 000 acres of land for the park the senate version of the bill does not require the fee conveyance the other major differences between the house and senate bills are that the senate bill does not include the authorization for a tourism promotion program included by the house interior committee and the senate bill authorizes a 10year extension of leases on land donated to the park service by the state of minnesota i had asked the house interior tommittee to include such an extension in order to allow the 62 current leaseholders the opportunity to remain within the park for an additional period this legislation comes at a critical time for voyageurs national park the park has suffered from inadequatc funding for construction of visitor facilities and as a result has an unacceptably low level of visitation consequently the communities around the park havc not enjoyed the economic benefits promised prior to the establishment of the park this legislation will authorize not only an acquisition increase but the addition of 180 acres at black bay narrows necessary for the development of a visitor facility in the area of international falls the addition will allow the park service to develop a primary access site with boat launching facilities ranger station visitor center and central maintenance facility the basic provisions of this legislation have been under discussion for almost a decade i introduced a similar bill in the 96th congress and again in this 97th congress the return of black bay to the state removes a nearly twodecadesold misunderstanding about the boundaries of voyageurs national park and how this particular area should be managed it will return to the people of minnesota in this small area the opportunity for recreational uses not permitted within a national park and will resolve a longstanding statewide controversy over duck hunting in black bay second this legislation will set in motion the means by which the area can benefit from the establishment of a national park with the passage of this legislation with the inclusion of tourism study and road access study we light that spark of hope that the area will be able toenjoy economic benefit from the park there is one area in the bill though that is somewhat unclear i would like to ask the chairman of the subcommittee to perhaps clarify language on page 4 lines 6 7 and 8 the legislation requires the state to establish a wildlife management area in the area of black bay that is now within the park second it requires that the entire area of black bay be managed to preserve the resources of the area in such a way as to complement the purpose for which the park was established the language of the report makes it clear that the state is to manage black bay in that fashion there is however a parenthetical expression the bill that suggests perhaps a different interpretation as i understood the committees deliberations in markup the committees intent is that the report language is correct in that the statutorily required management plan should be fo the lands riparian to black bay and not the entire area of rainy lake is that understanding correct"], [0.0002009570598602295, 0.49979904294013977, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume chairman i rise in support of h r 2329 legislation which i introduced to waive the statute of limitations to allow the cherokee choetaw and chickasaw nations to bring two claims against the government in two specific and longstanding cases i am happy to have my friend and colleague tom kindness join me in support of this legislation as you may recall tom had previously opposed one portion of the bill but i am happy to say that his concerns have been addressed and he will be speaking in support of h r 2329 shortly the full judiciary committee favorably reported the legislation by unanimous voice vote its a very simple straightforward bill which after many years provides an equitable and fair resolution of two particular claims i would note at this point that these cases effect only three tribes in oklahoma they are factually unique and have no impact at all on any other indian claim or water rights issue which might be pending elsewhere in the country i would further point outand i want to emphasize thisthat the legislation awards no compensation whatsoever to any of the three tribes nor does it make any judgment as to the merits of the two claims it simply waives the statute to allow the tribes to present their cases before a court of law i first want to briefly describe the two claims and later i would be glad to respond to any questions which anyone might have the first claim arises out of construction of the arkansas river navigation system which congress authorized in the early 1940s at the time of construction congress and the interior department erroneously believed that a 96mile stretch of the arkansas river belonged to the state of oklahoma in fact the bed and banks of that 96mile stretch had been granted in fee simple patent to the three indian nations under treaty the supreme court confirmed the tribes ownership in 1970 during construction of the navigation system riverbed resources belonging to the tribes were irrevocably destroyed the tribes were not granted compensation for these resources in 1974 the department of the interior invited the tribes to negotiate a settlement for the taking of sand and gravel from the riverbed these negotiations lasted for several years and the government even went so far as to survey the property in anticipation of the settlement the department sent a proposed settlement to the tribe for their review and signature however when the tribe did sign and return the governments own proposal the department abruptly reversed positions and refused to sign critically by that time the statute of limitations had lapsed in abruptly changing positions the department relied on the legal concept of navigational servitude to justify taking the tribes property without compensation however in testimony before the subcommittee the justice department admitted that navigational servitude had never before been applied in this fact s tuhtion and that the only way to ultimately know if it was applicable was to go to court exactly the approach we suggest today when questioned about this claim 3 years ago in a senate hearing the department also at that time responded that the three tribes would simply have to sue the government again exactly what this legislation proposes the second claim involves what ar e commonly known as railroad station grounds which the three nations granted throughout oklahoma in the late 1800s in making these grants of land to the railroads the three tribes retained full reversionary rights to the land and upon abandonment by the railroads the tribes should have regained the land however a 1906 act of congress gave away those lands to municipalitieswithout the permission of the tribesand without awarding them any compensation the act specifically authorized the secretary of interior to seek compensation or recovery for the tribes but the departmentthe legal trustee for the tribemade no attempt to do so at that time or at any time since the lands were given away in fact in a similar case in oklaho ma involving the creek nation the department legally fought the tribe for almost 50 years before the creeks finally won their claim and settled the case the tribes have provided ample information as to why they did not or were precluded from pursuing their claims but importantly the department of the interior has provided us with no information whatever to explain why they have failed for over 75 years now to pursue these claims on behalf of the tribes as the law authorized them to do and as their fiduciary responsibility would mandate needless to say the statute of limitation has expired on this claim and as in the riverbed case the indian nations ask only that they now be permitted to try and piotect their own property rights before a court of law finally i want to make one last point about the station grounds case the tribes do not wish to seek recovery of any of the lands their only intention is to seek compensation for the dollar value of the lands as of the time of the taking1909 they are asking congress to allow them the right to try and recover what they should have received in the first place fair and just compensation for their tribal lands which were given away to third parties i want to conclude on a personal note along with other members of the oklahoma delegation as well as many members who have provided assistance along the way i have been trying for several years now to resolve these two claims in a way which will be fair and equitable for all the parties involved i sincerely believe that this legislation provides such a solution we are not asking congress to authorize or appropriate money to pay the tribes we are asking only that the three indian nations be permitted to resolve the claims in a court of law we do not make this request lightly we do it only because the history of the two cases shows that time and time again the interior department has refused to protect the property rights of these tribes despite their legal obligation to do so the departments actions throughout the years represent nothing less than a total neglect of their duties and an endless string of broken promises and bad faith negotiations these cases are begging for an equitable solution it does nothing more than give the three indian nations their day in court it is long overdue and i urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation i reserve the balance of my time"],

and compromise between the house and the senate i would like to commend my colleagues on both the house and senate sides for their tireless efforts to reach agreement and to develop a workable and effective job training program this final product is not the bill i would have preferred nor i believe does it meet the senates first choice but i believe it is a workable compromise which preserves the basic tenets embodied in the house bill first the bill preserves the essential role of local governments in the planning and implementing of job training policy in their areas while the governor is given increased administrative responsibility for assuring compliance with the act and for improving coordination among employmentrelated programs in the state the governor cannot impose policy requirements on local communities nor does the governor run local programs or have dis 6retion on how funds are to be distributed within the state second the conference agreement keeps the equal partnership between business and local government and allows the parties to work out at the local level what form the partnership will take the conference agreement requires that both the private industry council and local elected officials in the service delivery areas approve the local job training plan and agree on how the plan will be developed and what entity will administer the program and be the grant recipient third the conference agreement preserves the federal governments responsibility for setting overall policy and for establishing performance standards for the program the secretary of labor has the responsibility for imposing sanctions on local pro grams found in violation of the act the secretary is also given appeal authority for plan disapproval as well as any findings of noncompliance finally the conference agreement preserves the house bills flexibility to provide wages in connection with training activities and to give participants allowance payments and supportive services necessary for participation local communities may waive the limitation on supportive services wages and allowances if they can demonstrate that they meet certain criteria such as areas of high unemployment or service to participants in need of exceptional supportive services such as handicapped individuals or single heads of household with dependent children there has been considerable confusion over the past week on just what this bill provides and how it relates to other vitally needed employment legislation i would like to set the record straight on these matters although i am pleased that the president has finally endorsed this measure in spite of the labor departments recommendation to veto the compromise agreement it is important to point out the differences between the conference agreement and the administrations initial proposal the administration would have restricted eligibility for job training to welfare recipients and school dropouts the conferees wisely recognized that the need for training and retraining is not limited to these groups and provided authority to serve a broad range of participants including older workers veterans inschool youth dislocated workers handicapped persons and many other categories of individuals in need of training who would not have been served under the administrations proposal the administration gave a block grant to the governor to determine what areas would be served and how local job training needs would be met as i have already stated the conference agreement preserves the local communities right to receive funds and to operate its programs according to local needs the administration would have limited local government involvement to those areas over 500 000 population disqualifying 85 percent of those communities current ly eligible to operate job training programs the conference agreement would retain eligibility for twothirds of those communities the administrations proposal would have given private industry total authority to make decisions on the use of public funds local elected officials would have had only a token say in these decisions the compromise preserves an equal partnership between the public and private sector the administrations proposal would have prohibited the use of funds for wages allowances or subsistence payments to lowincome individuals in training programs the conferees wisely recognized that many individuals may be prevented from participation in a training program due to the additional expenses incurred as a result of that participation the conferees provided broad authority to permit the payment of allowances and supportive services and also allowed the payment of wages in connection with training the administrations proposal would have provided training for less than 600 000 persons not the 1 million the president is now claiming credit for in fact fewer persons would have been served because in reality the administration was planning to spend less than half the amount requested in the presidents budget for fiscal year 1983 finally i believe it is essential to differentiate between the purposes of this job training proposal and the need to respond to the devastating levels of unemployment existing in the nation today while this job training program is vitally needed to provide job skills necessary to compete in a changing economy it is not the solution to the 11 million jobless in the nation today the provisions of this proposal will not even go into effect until fiscal year 1984 not one job will be created as a result of this job training proposals enactment thus it is essential we begin now on job creation programs the housepassed public works jobs bill which the president op poses would have created a modest 200 000 jobs in needed repair and rehabilitation of essential public facilities much more than this must be done and done in the private sector both training and jobs are necessary to get us out of this unemployment quagmire even the presidents own people recognize this a new york times article on september 24 quoted one reagan aide as saying we have got to talk about creating jobs especially if we go above 10 percent unemployment next month the president is either misinformed about the purposes of this job training bill or he is misleading the american public about its impact on present unemployment this however is a critical challenge to the presidents own views on the need to create jobs since his inauguration the president has consistently used jobs as an issue and a main argument to obtain approval of his tax concessions to business enterprises his deregulation efforts and his upside down budget priorities none of which has created jobs only unemployment at the same time however he has opposed every single jobs program without exception whether private or public permanent or temporary emergent or long range the harmful effects have fallen on every structural group the youth and our senior citizens rural and urban inhabitants veterans and draft evaders minorities and displaced workers and scientists as well as laborers the president discontinued job programs successfully operating when he took office without offering a single replacement incorporating improvements he claimed to support since then he has reduced or eliminated every one he could reach including the job corps win and senior citizens programs under the older americans act some such as the housing jobs bill and the senior citizens jobs he vetoed after the congress approved them with bipartisan support others such as the recently housepassed supplemental appropriations for emergency jobs he opposed as being only temporary jobs make work and too few only 200 000 jobsignoring the fact he did not support any other jobs either and regardless of number the explanation for this bizarre performance is rooted in a blind allegiance to the discredited tradeoff theory that unemployment is the way to decrease inflation therefore it logically follows from this false base that increasing unemployment is good in the presidents economics which ignores the empirical evidence the social consequences and the moral implications it is this dogma of the twenties that created the great depression to which he would have us return to face the technological age of the eighties i call on the president to support our efforts to put millions of americans back to work with the same enthusiasm as he is now supporting our efforts to train the work force we have met him half way let him now take a few steps in our direction a summary of the provisions of the conference agreement follows"], [0.00020101666450500488, 0.499798983335495, 1, "i am introducing today a companion bill to a bill introduced by my colleague in the other body senator heinz today i am introducing legislation which will temporarily halt the case reviews of american workers who receive disability insurance since the passage of the 1980 disability amendments which mandated continuing disability investigations for recipients of disability insurance many beneficiaries have been suddenly and unjustly dropped from the disability rolls my colleagues on the ways and means committee have worked hard this session to fine tune and strengthen the 1980 legislation the product of their efforts h r 6181 is pending on the house calendar and similar legislation has been intr9duced in the other body however because neither house has yet acted on these changes the problem of unfair and inequitable disability terminations has continued since the reagan administration began the accelerated disability review process in march 1981 this epidemic of improper cutoffs has been reflected in the figures of overturned termination decisions although in 1979 the social security administration estimated that only 20 percent of disability insurance recipients no longer qualified for benefits 45 percent of those reviewed at the state level have been terminated eighty to eightyfive percent of these recipients are appealing their cases to the administrative law judge level and 15 percent of these appeals are successful this high rate of overturned decisions indicates that a substantial problem exists with the reviews this statistical approach to the problem is very antiseptic let me illustrate this point more vividly by describing some specific examples which my caseworkers in delaware county pa have brought to my attention one of my constituents who had been receiving benefits since 1972 was reevaluated in the early part of this year he had multiple problems an accident in 1970 had left him with spinal injuries and he underwent several back operations originally he suffered from severe back pain and muscle spasms and doctors judged him unfit to perform substantial gainful activity over time his condition became worse as the pain and spasms moved to his neck doctors feel that the problem might be solved by further surgery but chances of success would be only 25 percent with a 25percent chance of total paralysis and a 50percent chance of death nevertheless in february his benefits were terminated on february 16 he appealed to the state reconsideration level only last month was the state decision reversed on the record by an administrative law judge the extended period without benefits and his anxiety over his case have caused such mental distress that he has almost been forced to seek psychiatric care another man who lives in my district has been receiving disability insurance for several years a result of various mental problems last year his case was reviewed and his benefits were cut off an administrative law judge reinstated his benefits but the stress of the cessation and subsequent procedures and uncertainty aggravated his condition his physician is of the opinion that his condition deteriorated significantly as a result of the process this year he was terminated again and presently has an administrative law judge hearing pending it seems likely according to my caseworker that he will have his benefits reinstated in order to properly attack this problem and introduce an element of compassion into the continuing disability investigation process changes must be made in three areas of the disability insurance review arrangement the committee bill includes many of these changes first we must act to smooth the passage back to work for those who are terminated from disability insurance we should consider adding additional adjustment benefits for those terminated after more than 36 months on the disability rolls making identical the month benefits are ended and the month in which a termination notice is received thus avoiding retroactive terminations earmarking funds for special rehabilitative services for those terminated in fiscal years 1983 and 1984 the first round of cuts the review process itself must also be modified in several ways all disability insurance recipients should be notified by the social security administration of the coitinuing disability investigations their intent and their form considering the high reversal level on appeal payments to terminated beneficiaries who appeal should be continued through the administrative law judge level repayment would be obligatory if the appeal is unsuccessful facetoface interviews should be instituted at the state reconsideration level the hearing record should be kept open through the administrative law judge level finally and most significantly we must make major changes in the rules guiding the reviews the rules used by the states and those employed by the administrative law judges must be rationalized somewhat but we must insure at the same time that all guidelines are published and subject to public comment in 1980 we indicated that we wished to terminate coverage for individuals who have medically improved and still receive disability benefits we must now clarify our intent that those whose condition has deteriorated or remained the same should not be cut off new guidelines should be applied to new recipients it is cruel and unnecessary to grandfather those who have been on the rolls for many years the time limit for filing a state reconsideration appeal should be extended from 60 days to 180 days in order to encourage attempts by terminated recipients to return to the workforce both houses of congress recognize the necessity for the continuing disability investigations at the same time every one of us has heard of the agony and trauma suffered by those unjustly dropped from the disability roles as the reviews proceed in order to provide us with additional time to consider the myriad of possibilities for making the continuing disability investigation process more fair and in order to add some time for reflection on the effects of the program to date i have introduced a companion bill in the house to senator heinz s 2730 this legislation will provide for a moratorium on continuing disability investigations until january 1 1983 giving us all a chance to review the process and modify it of course all cases of medical diarled reviews would be exempted from the freeze as would those involving fraud and abuse of the system this is only a temporary pause but one that would allow us to contemplate the product of our legislation without seriously disrupting the review process i hope that members will seriously consider some of these ideas as we examine the present disability provisions"]]}
