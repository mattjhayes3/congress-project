will vote against this resolution it is my belief that this debate and these votes should have been taken before a single bomb was dropped and before any unitedstates troops were sent our inaction prior to military strikes abdicated our constitutional responsibility and furthermore prevented the voice of the people i represent who are overwhelmingly against air strikes from being heard i agree that we have a moral imperative to bring an end to the horrific genocide and suffering in the balkans however violent means have only and will only escalate the crisis as a person who strongly believes in the teachings and the work of dr martin luther king jr i profoundly subscribe to the principles of nonviolence if peace is our objective then i implore us to consider the words of dr king not only on his birthday but each and every day of the year in his last book the trumpet of conscience he wrote about united states policy in north vietnam he said they are talking about peace as a distant goal as an end we seek but one day we must come to see that peace is not merely a distant goal we seek but that it s a means by which we arrive at that goal destructive means cannot brng about constructive ends i am convinced that our best hope for lpace and stability is the negotiation of an immediate ceasefire and a strong belief that the united states and nato must reach out to russia

a no vote i rise today in opposition to h j res 44 which would declare a state of war between the united states and the federal republic of yugoslavia i oppose this resolution because i believe that a declaration of war like the nato air strikes will only increase instability in the region and exacerbate the atrocities against ethnic albanians at this very volatile time my support and prayers go out to the brave men and women of the united states armed forces who have been dispatched to yugoslavia we must take every measure possible to bring an end to this crisis to ensure their safe and expeditious return home while i will vote against the declaration of war i would like to commend my colleague from california congressman campbell for introducing this resolution into the house of representatives and bringing forward congressional action on the us involvement in kosovo it is my belief that these debates should have taken place six weeks ago before a single bomb was dropped and before any us troops were sent into the hostile situation in the balkans by failing to vote on the air strikes before their commencement and instead debating authorization now when we are already heavily involved the administration is conducting a war without congressional consent as required by the constitution a vote to authorize the president to conduct military air strikes at this juncture is nothing more than a rubber stamp from congress for an action that has already begun i my opinion our inaction prior to military strikes abdicated our constitutional responsibility and furthermore prevented the voice of the people i represent who are overwhelmingly against the air strikes from being heard there are those who rise today in support of the administrations action in order to end the genocide of the ethnic albanians i agree in the strongest terms possible that we have a moral imperative to intervene and to bring an end to the horrific suffering however whether air strikes ground forces or a declaration of warthese violent means as a method to bring peace and stability to the balkans have only and will only escalate the crisis as a person who strongly believes in the teachings and work of dr martin luther king jr not just on his birthday but throughout the year i profoundly subscribe to the principles of nonviolence our policies and our actions must set an example for our young people that violence should never be an option if peace is our objective and i am certain that this is a goal upon which all in this chamber can agree then i implore us to consider the words of dr king in his last book the trumpet of conscience a christmas sermon on peace dr king discusses bombing in north vietnam and the rhetoric of peace that was connected to those war making acts he wrote what is the problem they are talking about peace as a distant goal as an end we seek but one day we must come to see that peace is not merely a distant goal we seek but that it is a means by which we arrive at that goal we must pursue peaceful ends through peaceful means all of this is saying that in the final analysis means and ends must cohere because the end is preexistent in the means and ultimately destructive means cannot bring about constructive ends the administrations policy and the nato campaign in kosovo to date have produced only counterproductiveand destructive results a mass exodus of over half a million ethnic albanians significant civilian deaths an escalation of milosevics campaign of racial hatred and terror and greater instability in the region the results are just the opposite of what we want to achieve our goal is to prevent innocent people from being killed in the name of saving kosovars we are destroying kosovo at this juncture i am convinced that our best hope for peace and stability in the region is the negotiation of an immediate cease fire it is my strong belief that the united states and nato must reach out to the united nations russia china and others to work together to develop a new internationally negotiated peace agreement and to secure serbian compliance to its terms in order to end the suffering in the balkans and to achieve long term stability support of a diplomatic political settlement is the only action we can employ as we today speak of a policy to end genocide in the balkans i am also greatly disturbed to think of the people in many countries in africa and all over the world who have also suffered unthinkable atrocities beyond our worst nightmare as a result of ethnic conflict in africa over 150 000 have been killed in burundi 800 000 in rwanda and 1 5 million in sudan more than 200 000 kurds have died in iraq and turkey and hundreds of thousands in burma and over 1 million in cambodia it is my hope that

especially for those who participated in the battles for guam and saipan as part of a conflagration sometimes referred to as the marianas turkey shoot one of the greatest naval victories during world war ii on july 21 at the end of this week the people of guam will be celebrating the liberation of guam it is the day that commemorates the landing of the third marine division on the shores of asan and the first marine provisional brigade supported by the 77th army infantry in agat i want to send my greetings to the veterans of that conflict as well as to draw and honor and pay respect to not only the unitedstates forces who liberated guam from japanese occupiers but also to remember the people of guam and the suffering that they endured during the japanese occupation japanese troops had earlier bombed and invaded guam on december 8 and 10 1941 as part of japans attacks on unitedstates forces in the pacific including the attack of course on pearl harbor and on the philippines both areas having also significant unitedstates forces this commemoration which i do annually and which is marked by a laying of the wreath at the tomb of the unknowns which i did last week will honor the american veterans and remember the sacrifices of the people of guam and will serve as a tribute for the necessity for peace for it is only in the remembrance of the horrors of war do we really truly remain vigilant in our quest for peace my purpose this evening is to give an historical perspective to the events we are commemorating on guam and to enhance the understanding of people across the nation of the wartime expe rience of the people of guam and the postwar legacy which has framed the relationship of my island to the rest of the united states it is a story that is a microcosm of the heroism of the soldiers everywhere and the suffering of civilians in occupied areas during world war hi but as is sometimes not understood about guam guam is a unique story all to itself and it is an experience of dignity in the midst of political and wartime machinations of larger powers over small peoples and as well as a story of loyalty to america a demonstration of loyalty that has not been asked of any civilian community during the entire 20th century guam which had been an american territory since the end of the spanishamerican war in 1898 was invaded in the early morning hours of december 10 1941 thus began a 32month epic struggle of the indigenous people of guam the chamorro people to maintain their dignity and to survive during an occupation by a brutal oppressor in the months leading up to the war in the pacific american military planners had decided that it was not feasible to defend guam against possible invasion forces by japanese forces in the surrounding areas all of the areas in micronesia save for guam were in the hands of the japanese under a league of nations mandate and the most significant japanese installations being held in saipan a hundred miles to the north and the naval forces in the truc lagoon some 350 miles to the south this decision was made because the war plans up to that time had called for several fixed fortifications on guam that required congressional appropriations and unfortunately due to rapidly moving events in the pacific and tight military budgets guam did not receive the necessary funds to build any defenses in anticipation of world war ii a conflagration rhich everyone in the pacific expected to occur at some time when the japanese landed they found 153 marines 271 naval personnel and 134 workers associated with the pan american clipper station and some 20 000 chamorros who were at that time under a status called united states nationals all american military dependents had been evacuated from guam in anticipation of the war with the last ship having left on october 17 1941 pursuant to an order of the naval governor captain mcmillan the other vulnerable territory the aleutian islands in alaska were similarly threatened by their proximity to japanese forces however in that instance the army evacuated all of the civilians off of the aleutian inhab itants in anticipation of the japanese invasion thus sparing the people of the aleutian islands enemy occupation so that it ended up that the chamorros the unitedstates nationals in guam were alone among american civilian communities to withstand the onslaught of an enemy occupation to demonstrate how chamorros were treated distinctively a handful of chamorros from guam who worked at the pan american station in wake island were not evacuated they were civilians and these were people working for pan american clipper station in wake island they were not evacuated whereas their counterparts american unitedstates citizens civilians were the end result was that this handful of chamorro civilian and construction workers ended up fighting like marines in the battle for wake island and many of them died and were placed in prison camps and after a long campaign we were able to provide those wake island defenders with the benefits of veteran status as a result of their battle efforts at wake island during world war ii for the actual defense of guam it fell to the guam insular guard and the guam militia comprised of civilian reserve forces along with a handful of marines and sailors the japanese invasion force numbering some 5 000 easily overwhelmed the american defenders and ironically the only ones who really fired any shots in anger with the japanese were members of the guam insular guard who had set up a couple of machine gun nests in defense of the plaza and the governors offices the signal that the japanese had used to indicate that they had now taken over the island was to lay an american flag on the grounds of the plaza this was early in the morning so the sun had not fully risen and to flash flashlights over it to signal aircraft overhead throughout the ordeal of the occupation the chamorro people maintained their loyalty to america and their faith that american forces would soon return to liberate them the resistance against the occupation manifested itself in many many forms but none so powerful and costly as the effort to help american servicemen who had decided not to surrender along with their other fellow servicemen seven unitedstates sailors decided not to surrender and they were captured one by one each in turn was hunted down and killed by the japanese occupiers one fortunate sailor evaded capture throughout the entire 32 months of occupation with the assistance of the people at the cost of numerous beatings and even beheadings the story of this one sailor george tweed was made into a movie entitled no man is an island the actual liberation of guam began on july 21 1944 and was preceded by a serious bombardment which began in mid june this was a time when they thought the invasion of guam was going to be an immediate followup to the invasion of saipan in june of 1944 after they began their preinvasion bombardment of the coast of guam they were called back only 2 hours after the initiation of the bombardment because of the ferocity of the battle for saipan so the invasion was actually called off for a period of about 5 weeks during the intervening 5 weeks following the original naval attack the onslaught of cruelty endured by the chamorros on guam from their occupiers was incessant this gave actually 5 weeks for japanese forces to reinforce their position in full anticipation and of course gave them additional opportunity to mass the people on one side of the island this increased brutality and intensity of the atrocities and marked the beginning of the end of the 2 year enemy occupation the invasion dubbed operation forager was schedule for july 21 and was preceded by a preinvasion bombardment lasting 13 days now my colleagues have to understand that this was an island 212 square miles had a preinvasion bombardment lasting 13 days in large measure due to the experience of the battle of saipan and the invasion of normandy there was a lot of rethinking about the nature of preinvasion bombardment while this bombardment level most fortified structures in guam it also acted as a stimulus for further atrocities against the people of guam and as the bombardment continued the chamorros became more restless and the japanese realizing their ensuing fate inflicted further brutality and mass slaughter against my people the preinvasion bombardment had been preceded by numerous air raids beginning in february 1944 5 months earlier after the bombardment underwater demolition teams udt teams spent 4 days sweeping the shoreline making the marine invasion possible it is maybe perhaps an apocryphal story but the navy the udt put a sign on asan on the shore of guam saying welcome unitedstates marines signed unitedstates navy the unitedstates marines landed on the narrow beaches of asan and agat to crawl up their way to what is now known as nimitz hill the men of the third marine division were thrust wave after wave onto asan beach already littered with marines that had come before them and once on the shore the unitedstates troops were in the heart of japans defense fortifications this wellthoughtout plan led to the heart of japans defense fortifications and into the heart of the defense fortifications climbing steep ridges i had the pleasure of meeting mr william rose who came to our wreath laying in honor of the liberation of guam last week and he was a participant in this as a 16yearold marine he was in an advanced team of marines and he had lied his way into the marine corps he had joined at the age of 14 and he went on to participate in tarawa guam and iwo jima all as a 16yearold simultaneously the southern beaches of guam were being braved by the first marine brigade however this less formidable it is a lot flatter area was quickly interrupted by the only japanese counter attack of the day it is also in those beaches that former senator hal heflin was wounded as a marine in guam the people of guam are a resolute and tenacious people as was proved over 56 years ago as they fought side by side with the marine corps participating as scouts lookouts and even forming little pockets of armed resistance to japanese occupiers the liberation of guam is commemorated as a time of solemn memory and remembrance every year since world war f because it is this special struggle of americans liberating what must be seen as fellow americans that serves as a reminder of the spirit of freedom and the high cost that must be paid to maintain it the chamorro people suffered severe privations and cruel injustices under the 3year occupation by the japanese where hundreds lost their lives thus the mutual and sacrificial experience of guams liberation holds unique distinction in the hearts and souls of both the marines and the soldiers of the 77th infantry and their story is the story of liberators from without and liberators from within one came down from the mountain while the others came from the shore and some came from places called dededo and agat and others the ones coming in from the ocean came from places like brooklyn and des moines this special kind of spirit in the liberation of guam which was not seen in any other battle during world war ii was very obvious in the 50th anniversary of the liberation of guam in 1994 when so many thousands of veterans came back still very tearful still very appreciative and still very understanding of the unique nature of this battle the importance of this particular battle for the war was very important to winning the war against japan the defeat of the forces on saipan and guam led to the fall of the tojo government and the recognition in japan that there was no doubt left about the outcome of the conflict with the united states hell is upon us stated admiral nagano supreme naval adviser to the japanese emperor and indeed it was as the marianas was used as the primary location for bombers to take off from airfields on guam saipan and tinian harmon andersen north northwest field isley field kobler field and other names very familiar to the men of the army air corps including one of our own distinguished members here in the house the gentleman from new york who participated in many bombing raids flying out of guam flying out of what was then north field and now what is called andersen air force base the importance of the marianas as the islands from which to prosecute not only an air war against japan but as the jumping off points for further landings in the philippines and okinawa and iwo jima became crucial to final victory in effect apra harbor on guam became the forward naval base as pearl harbor was effectively moved 3 500 miles to the west and in the words of the victory at sea treatment of the battle for guam it is said that guam became the supermarket of the pacific struggle after the recapture in july of 1944 from guam admiral nimitz set up his headquarters for the balance of the war in the islandhopping strategy of the pacific the marianas islands were not to be leapfrogged since they were an integral part of japans defenive structure the ferocity of the marianas campaign was an indication of the blood that was to be shed in later campaigns on saipan the americans encountered a phenomenon that had never been encountered before but they would subsequently see in greater and greater numbers the site of hundreds of japanese soldiers and civilians committing suicide by jumping off of cliffs rather than surrendering at places that are now called suicide cliff and banzai cliff on saipan american soldiers and marines could only watch helplessly as civilian noncombatants chose death over surrendering to an enemy that they believed would commit atrocities against them and while sporadic kamikaze raids had been encountered in some air battles naval air battles nothing could compare to the mass suicides that stunned the american forces all of these factors weighed into the decision to avoid an invasion of japan and the eventual use of atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki again as we all know the marianas played a pivotal role in providing the airfield in tinian where the bombers loaded with the worlds first atomic bombs were launched as i have indicated before there is a special dimension to the battle for guam which was not present in any other pacific battle indeed any other battle during world war ii if you look at it historically guam was the only unitedstates territory inhabited by civilians that had been invaded and occupied by an enemy power since the war of 1812 this special relationship between the liberated and the liberators the people who suffered and endured and the people who remained loyal and the people who came to liberate them and free them from their occupiers is really reflected in this very very special portrait this is a painting of a picture taken by a serviceman who stumbled onto two young chamorro boys and liberated them and these two young chamorro boys have two flags that are basically replicas of what they think an american flag should look like it was clear that when the servicemen first saw this and they first had the experience of this it was reported that many battlehardened american servicemen broke down at the sight of these people and sobbed at the sight of the children with the handmade american flags imperfect in their design yet perfectly clear in what they were representing this was these boys presentation of that same flag which had earlier laid on the ground in guam and which the japanese commander waved the flashlight over as a sign of victory the people of guam had endured much during the occupation of their island there was forced labor particularly in the last few months as the japanese hurriedly built defense fortifications and air strips on the labor of men and boys as young and 13 and 14 there was confiscation of food to feed the thousands of japanese soldiers brought in from manchuria as garrisoned troops to fight off the invasion this led to some form of malnutrition affecting all of the population of guam especially the children in a postwar study of the children of guam those who were born after the war were on the average two inches taller than those children who were born right at the beginning of the occupation or just before the occupation those who had grown to adolescence prior to the war were also taller than the children of the occupation and there was the forced marches and eventual internment in camps near places called maimai and manengon manengon was where most of the people went and manengon today still is a testimony to that it has a river running through it has lots of bamboo lots of coconut palms it is a very heavily wooded area as people were marched many were shot or bayonetted or executed or beaten for moving too fast or too slow as whole families young and old made their way in ox carts and carabao water buffalos and just on foot and carrying each other and in the camps the people stayed for weeks with no food waiting for their deliverance and hoping that the japanese would not carry out the threats to kill them all which of course were numerous and in many instances the japanese did try to carry out some of these threats in this entire panorama of experience there were naturally heroic stories and very dramatic tales but most experienced the war as a time in which their families were put at risk my parents lost three children during the war two were buried in areas that my mother can remember but which we cannot really find today my elder brothers and sisters became soill one was so malnourished the stomach walls almost became transparent i am the only child in my family that was born after world war ii for most people this was a very typical experience a very common experience for most chamorros the war challenged them in these very direct ways there is an element to this story which does have a legislative end to it and which needs some resolution to it a lot has been said about the sacrifices made by unitedstates citizens and our allies during the war in the pacific world war ii the story that i just told about the people of guam has not really been fully understood in the context of how what do you do with the experiences of these people the people of guam at the time of the japanese occupation were not unitedstates citizens they were in a category of people called unitedstates nationals that is to say they were in political limbo fully anticipating that one day they would become unitedstates citizens because they were in this particular situation in 1948 the unitedstates congress passed a law that compensated unitedstates citizens for their experience during world war ii including forced labor and internment the people of guam were not included in that legislation because a they were not unitedstates citizens at the time and there was a bill that congress had passed in 1945 designed to give them property compensation but not compensation for the trials and tribulations the way the law that was passed for guam worked was that if you wanted to make a claim beyond 5 000 you had to personally come to washington d c and present your claim to a navy committee with some congressional involvement of course in 1945 most people on guam were simply trying to piece their lives togethe so not much happened so what happened with most people in guam is that the navy officials who were adjudicating these claims on guam would simply offer a dollar amount for an injury in one instance a real life example a gentleman got 90 compensation for loss of his thumb another family got 300 compensation for loss of their father when the 1948 law was passed it offered of course a whole range of different options and an unending time period in which to resolve these claims that would arise out of the activities of the japanese government at the time the theory was that the unitedstates government had confiscated much japanese property had frozen all japanese assets this was the pool of money through which people who suffered at the hands of the japanese were going to be compensated the people of guam were not included in that legislation in 1950 the people of guam were declared unitedstates citizens a few months later japan and the united states signed a peace treaty which then stated that unitedstates citizens could not file claims against japan for the experience of the war it was kind of a hold harmless which is very common in peace treaties so here we have a situation where in a very literal sense the people of guam fell through the cracks on this war reparations effort because they were not unitedstates citizens they were not included in the 1948 law two years later they were declared unitedstates citizens a few months later they were not allowed to submit claims against japan and they were still not included in the 1948 law in 1962 this law was then reamended in congress but at that time the people of guam were still not included in the law there was no representation of anyone from guam in 1962 here in the house of representatives as a consequence that effort did not include the people of guam so what i have done is there is a piece of legislation which has the support of members of the committee on the judiciary i am proud to say that the gentleman from illinois who is himself a veteran of the conflict in the philippines fully understands and supports this effort i am proud to say daniel inouye over in the senate has a companion measure which is basically identical to the measure which has been reported out of the committee on resources which is to create a commission to study the claims of the people of guam those who still remain of the original 20 000 who survived the occupation probably less than 6 or 7 000 remain today as living embodiments of that experience to study the claims and for the commission to make recommendations regarding that i am hopeful that this legislation will see the light of day and that it will bring to light and bring honor and memory to the people who did suffer many names come to mind in this effort that we have undertaken and we have tried to move this legislation over many years i cannot let this rest without again bringing honor to one individual in particular a young lady atthe time by the name of beatrice floris who later on married mr emsley beatrice floris emsley who as a 13yearold survived an attempted beheading by japanese soldiers they attempted to behead her she felt a thump she was dumped into a shallow grave left for dead for 2 days finally dug her way out it was a shallow grave so she could still breathe and for the next 3 days kind of wandered aimlessly until american soldiers discovered her the interesting thing about mrs emsley and she was a great woman is that she never liked to talk about this experience of course it was a very painful experience there are not very many people who would survive an attempted beheading and if any of us have ever seen stories of these atrocities that was a favored method of execution simply a big samurai sword would come down and basically make a fatal cut in your neck sometimes decapitating people right on the first stroke this young lady at the age of 13 did not like to talk about it i remember when i was in high school i used to see her and we would always say did you get to see mrs emsleys scar sometimes young people not being as sensitive as they should be would take note of it mrs emsley proved to be the most courageous spokesperson for this generation of a very courageous people because we would ask her to come to congress to tell her story and she would she did so at great personal sacrifice and discomfort for herself but her words were remarkably free of any bitterness she never said anything that could be considered unkind she never said a hostile word she only recounted the experience and the brutality of the war and then made a special plea for recognition of the chamorro people of quam the very first piece of legislation that i was able to pass as a member of this body and i did so with the assistance of the gentleman from minnesota"],

from her achievements as a legislator but also because we share a family connection albeit somewhat distant senator neuberger was my great uncles sisterinlaw maurine neuberger served one term in the unitedstates senate from 1961 to 1967 one of the most significant periods in our nations history she was known as an outspoken advocate for consumers candid and brutally honest in her views and unafraid to take on even the most entrenched interests the author of a 1961 saturday evening post article described her as quote a woman of independent spirit who feels it is more important to be herself than to bow to the demands of conformity maurine neuberger was born in 1907 in cloverdale oregon the daughter of a doctor and dairy farmer she became a teacher in the portland school district it was there that she met her husband and future political partner richard neuberger dick neuberger was already making a name for himself as a journalist and a legislator and after serving in world war ii as a captain he ran for and was elected to the oregon senate when the couple was returning from an east coast trip a year later dick mentioned that the state house seat in their area was opening up and maurine said i wish id known that i would have run for it dick took the offhand comment very seriously and after a long conversation over a few hundred miles of road the couple pulled over and they called a friend back in oregon who filed the necessary papers to make maurine neuberger a candidate for the oregon legislature maurine won that house seat making the neubergers the first husband and wife team in unitedstates history to serve in the state legislature at the same time they were both progressive liberals of the day fighting for consumers the environment and civil rights maurine never stayed in her husbands shadow and even got more votes than him when they ran for reelection in 1952 maurine championed many causes as a state legislator but became known as the champion of the housewife for one cause in particular overturning a ban on food coloring in margarine this may sound like a frivolous cause to take up in these days but to a woman in the 1950s this was no silly battle the oregon dairy industry had lobbied for a ban on yellow food coloring in margarine this required housewives to add the coloring themselves to improve the look of the whitish margarine for the dinner table this was a hard and cumbersome task and virtually unknown to the allmale oregon house so in 1951 she walked into a crowded agriculture committee hearing room donned an apron and proceeded to demonstrate the difficult process of adding a pellet of food coloring to a pound of margarine the act made the statewide papers and the ban on food coloring was soon repealed when her husband dick neuberger was elected to the unitedstates senate in 1960 maurine came to washington not just as a spouse but as a political adviser and aide she often attended hearings on her husbands behalf during absences and advised him on pending legislation but even as a senatorial spouse maurine could not hide from the limelight she created a miniscandal in 1953 when she participated in a charity modeling show with other senate wives wearing a bathing suit as it was described in the articles of the day the somewhat leggy picture caused a stir back home in oregon maurine found the incident amusing brushing off criticism by saying well what do people think senators wives wear when they go swimming dick neubergers death in 1960 on the eve of the elections filing deadline came as a shock to both his wife and the state maurine was urged to run for the seat by columnists state politicians and even her husbands colleagues in the senate minnesota senator hubert humphrey in an appeal for her to run for the seat sent a telegram saying i cannot imagine the senate of the united states without a neuberger in it she decided to put her grief aside and filed the necessary papers within hours of the deadline maurine neuberger easily beat the caretaker replacement who had been appointed by the governor to fill out the term of her husband and in january of 1961 she was sworn in as the third woman in unitedstates history elected in her own right to serve in the united states senate in an early interview as senatorelect she demonstrated her forwardthinking values favoring medical coverage for senior citizens federal aid for more teachers and classroom construction pollution controls for automobiles and a strong civil rights bill in her 6 years as senator she fought for environmental protections challenged the meat industry for adding water to hams and took the bedding manufacturing industry to task for selling flammable blankets but she will probably be best known for her early and outspoken opposition to the tobacco industry 1963 was a time when the dangers of tobacco were just becoming clear the industry the government and even the medical profession fought controls against its sale senator neuberger fought these interests in every arena and even wrote a book onthe topic smoke screen tobacco and the public welfare she said in the text i have undertaken to write this book because i believe that the moral and intellectual poverty that has characterized our approach to the smoking problem must no longer be shrouded in the pressagentry of the tobacco industry nor the fancy of bureaucratic footwork of government agencies charged with the responsibilities of guarding our nations health she called for major legislation to combat what she considered a national health risk her program included an education program to convince children not to take up smoking expanded research into making cigarettes safer reform and curtailment of cigarette advertising and warning labels on cigarette packages as an early advocate for a common sense approach to tobacco policy she would persuasively lobby her smoking colleagues of the senate often describing in vivid detail the results of the latest medicalstudy on the hazards of tobacco maurine neuberger decided not to run for reelection dissuaded by the amount of money she said she would have to raise to win the seat a lesson that even this congress could well consider as we ask ourselves how many other great americans turn down the responsibility of public office because of the demands of our current campaign finance system after remarrying and leaving the senate citizen maurine neuberger went back to the classroom she taught at boston university and radcliffe college then she became an opponent of the vietnam warand supported robert kennedy in his 1968 presidential race eventually she moved back home to portland oregon but stayed active in public affairs serving on presidential commissions for presidents johnson and carter friends say she remained interested in politics and lived an active life up until 2 months before her death at age 93 senator ron wyden said he talked to former senator neuberger after he had crossexamined tobacco executives with tough questions before a congressional panel and she told him stay after them maureen became well known in portland circles not just for her political acumen and her bridgeplaying but as an avid gardener in fact she became so well known for her green thumb that a rose was named after her a miniature rose called the maureen neuberger the american rose society describes it as red a reliable bloomer the seeds that this reliable bloomer planted in congress have taken many forms in the 34 years since she served here in stronger civil rights laws protections for consumers and honest recognition about the dangers of smoking i am honored to share a family connection to this remarkable woman and public servant and i applaud the spirit that she brought to this congress and to her life"], [0.4990590810775757, 0.5009409189224243, 1, "yesterday in the other body the senate the appropriations committee marked up the foreign operation appropriations legislation for fiscal year 2000 the legislation reported out yesterday addresses several key issues concerning unitedstates policies and priorities for the caucasus mountain region of the former soviet union an area of vital and growing importance for the unitedstates in the 21st century here in the house action on the foreign operations bill is not expected until later this summer i wanted to take a few minutes to cite some of the key provisions in the senate legislation that i hope the house will address as well as to cite some additional areas where the senate did not act but i hope the house will as cochair of the congressional caucus on armenian issues i plan to put my suggestions into a letter to the house subcommittee on foreign operations and that subcommittee i should point out has many good friends of armenia and i look forward to working with them first the good news the senate foreign operations bill earmarks 90 million in assistance to the republic of armenia this represents an increase over the slightly less than 80 million that was reported in fiscal year 1999 and is certainly an improvement over the 71 5 million requested by the administration in its budget i believe it is important for the united states to maintain our support and partnership with armenia which continues to make major strides towards democracy as evidenced by last months parliamentary elections as well as market reforms and increasing integration with the west however armenias strides towards providing a better life for its people at home and being a partner for peace and stability with the west continue to be challenged by the blockades imposed by the neighboring countries azerbaijan and turkey provisions of unitedstates support provides at least some relief from the difficulties imposed by the blockades and represents a moral statement by our country that we should try to offset the effects of the illegal blockades imposed on armenia by its neighbors i would urge the house subcommittee to provide the same 90 million earmark that has been included by the senate another area where i will be working to have the house follow the senate language is with regard to something that is not there and that is repealing section 907 of the freedom support act which restricts aid to azerbaijan until that country lifts its blockade of armenia and nagorno karabagh last month secretary of state albright called on the senate appropriators to repeal section 907 when the freedom support act was adopted in 1992 establishing our postcold war unitedstates foreign policy for the newly independent states of the former soviet empire section 907 was included as a way of holding azerbaijan accountable for the blockade of its neighbors azerbaijan has continued its strategy of trying to strangle armenia and nagorno karabagh i am glad the senate appropriators resisted the administrations proposal to lift section 907 as i just indicated azerbaijans blockade is against both the republic of armenia and the republic of nagorno karabagh nagorno karabagh is an historically armenianpopulated region that stalins mapmakers included as part of azerbaijan because nagorno karabaghs independence has not been officially recognized by the united states it was a tremendous breakthrough when congress approved 12 5 million in assistance for nagorno karabagh in the fiscal year 1998 legislation unfortunately much of that assistance has yet to be obligated and while the senate is silent on this issue i will be working with my armenia issues caucus colleagues to ensure the house bill also provides report language directing the agency for international development to expedite delivery of this assistance another area where the senate bill is silent is on the issue of the peace process for nagorna karabagh the unitedstates has been one of the countries taking the lead in the peace process under the auspices of the organization for security and cooperation in europe and late last year the unitedstates and our negotiating partners put forward a proposal known as the common state proposal as a basis for moving the negotiations forward despite some serious reservations the elected governments of both nagorno karabagh and armenia have accepted this common state proposal to get the negotiations moving forward but azerbaijan has flatly re jected our peace proposal i will work to include language in the house foreign operations appropriations bill to urge the administration to stay the course in the nagorna karabagh peace process and not let the rejectionist policies of the azerbaijan cause us to back down in the search for a just and lasting solution to this conflict providing for the full selfdetermination of nagorno karabagh i do appreciate the fact that the senate did not buy into the administrations inexplicable proposal to increase aid to azerbaijan and decrease aid to armenia as i indicated the senate language provides for an increase in assistance to armenia it does not provide any specific mention of aid to azerbaijan with the breakup of the soviet union as the countries of the collapsing empire attained their independence azerbaijan attempted to militarily crush nagomo karabagh and drive out the armenian population but the karabagh armenians ultimately won their war of independence and a ceasefire was signed in 1994 american humanitarian assistance to azerbaijan via nongovernmental organizations ngos has not been affected by section 907 in recent years further exemptions to section 907 have been carved out it is important that at a time when azerbaijan continues to reject goodfaith efforts to achieve a negotiated settlement to the nagorno karabagh conflict while illegally blockading supplies of fuel food and other essential supplies to its neighbors that we not reward this country with additional unitedstates assistance i look forward to working with my friends on the subcommittee on foreign operations export financing and related programs to craft legislation that supports armenia"], [0.4990708827972412,

respond to this issue in the authorizing committee but we were denied by the republican majority i would like to support this legislation it is an important piece of legislation but i think it is important to reunite families the same as we did for eastern european families a few years ago this legislation now is the only vehicle to be able to answer the concerns of haitians hondurans and guatemalans and others who were left out we need parity in addition this is the only vehicle that we can support the hate crimes legislation that has been denied to many states in this country i think james byrd jr s heinous murderous deceased condition obviously warrants us passing both the hate crimes legislation and as well this legislation with the immigration fairness act included i ask for my colleagues to vote against this legislation i rise to express my outrage that this house has brought forth the important commercejusticestate conference report to be voted on yet the republican leadership has not felt the need or importance to include language to address the dreadful acts of hate crimes this move by the republican leadership is a slap in the face to the many people here in the united states who have historically been subjected to hateful acts resulting in death bodily harm as well as mental and physical anguish only due to a persons race ethnicity gender age or sexual orientation how can we as elected representatives for the american people ignore our duty to ensure that all people are treated equally how can we ignore our moral oath to protect people from hateful acts that arise because of a person race ethnicity gender age or sexual orientation how can we allow hateful skeletons of this countrys past to be revived and allowed to infect our society today this chambers silence on the need for hate crimes legislation would do just that and the absence of hate crimes language in the cjs conference report sends the message that this countrys stance on crimes of hate is not a top priority this issue is very dear to me and i am ashamed that after two years from the date of james bryd juniors vicious murder on a paved road in my home state of texas that a bipartisan hate crimes prevention act has not become law time and time again i have come to the floor and asked the republican leadership to support meaningful hate crimes legislation i have introduced my own hate crimes legislation and have supported legislation and resolutions introduced by my colleagues in both the house and the senate yet i find myself coming before the american people once again to compel the republican leadership to include hate crimes language in the cjs conference report in order to increase penalties on perpetrators of hate crimes before the 106th congress comes to a close the same tactics that have been used in the texas state legislature to run out the time in the legislative session to defeat the passage of hate crimes legislation have been used here in the united states congress as well when the james byrd jr hate crimes act was introduced in my home state of texas in january 1999 it was hastily defeated in the state senate and when state democrats attempted to negotiate with republicans in the state senate and the governors administration to get a bipartisan hate crimes bill passed political games were played to extend the process until the end of the state legislative session as i have stated this political ploy was not only used in my home state of texas but it has been used here in both chambers of the united states congress as well we have attempted to negotiate with members of the republican party to get hate crimes legislation passed within the 106th congress however political games and wizardry have been used to delay the process until the congressional session comes to an end i therefore call on the republican leadership with the american people as my witnesses to once again ask for the passage of hate crimes legislation to address senseless killings and crimes of hate and to make a statement that the united states will no longer tolerate these acts since james byrd juniors death our nation has experienced an alarming increase in hate violence directed at men women and even children of all races creeds and colors ronald taylor traveled to the eastside of pittsburgh in what has been characterized as an act of hate violence to kill three and wound two in a fast food restaurant eight weeks later in pittsburgh richard baumhammers armed with a 357caliber pistol traveled 20 miles across the west side of pittsburgh where he killed five people his shooting victims included a jewish women an indian vietnamese chinese and several black men the decade of the 1990s saw an unprecedented rise in the number of hate groups preaching violence and intolerance with more than 50 000 hate crimes reported during the years 1991 through 1997 the summer of 1999 was dubbed the summer of hate as each month brought forth another appalling incident commencing with a threeday shooting spree aimed at minorities in the midwest and culminating with an attack on mere children in california from 1995 through 1999 there has been 206 different arson or bomb attacks on churches and synagogues throughout the united statesan average of one house of worship attacked every week like the rest of the nation some in congress have been tempted to dismiss these atrocities as the anomalous acts of lunatics but news accounts of this homicidal fringe are merely the tip of the iceberg the beliefs they act on are held by a far larger though less visible segment of our society these atrocities illustrate the need for continued vigilance and the passage of the hate crimes prevention act it is long past the time for congress to pass a comprehensive law banning such atrocities it is a federal crime to hijack an automobile or to possess cocaine and it ought to be a federal crime to drag a man to death becauseof his race or to hang a person because of his or her sexual orientation these are crimes that shock and shame our national conscience and they should be subject to federal law enforcement assistance and prosecution therefore i would urge my fellow members of the united states congress and the american people to be counted among those who will stand for justice in this country for all americans and nothing else we must address the problem of hate crimes before the 106th congress convenes its legislative business"], [0.49907147884368896, 0.500928521156311, 1, "i

of a trip that also includes stops in california and new york and accompanying the president on his first visit to the united states is ms naira melkoumian the foreign minister of the nagorno karabagh republic yesterday i took part in a meeting with president ghoukasian and foreign minister melkoumian that was attended by several of my colleagues in the house from both parties the president also held private meetings with several other members of the house and the senate and representatives of the armenian assembly of america and the armenian national committee of america also took part in those meetings the president also had meetings with the state department and met with some of washingtons leading think tanks and the media nagono karabagh is a region in the caucasus mountains of the former soviet union that has now and always has historically been populated by armenians unfortunately nagorno karabaghs independence has not been given recognition by the united states or the international community neighboring azerbaijan continues to claim nagorno karabaghs territory a bloody war was fought over this region and the karabagh armenians successfully defended their homeland a ceasefire was declared in 1994 which has more or less held despite ongoing violations by azerbaijan but a final resolution of the conflict has been elusive the united states is a leader in the effort to help the parties to this conflict achieve a just and lasting resolution of the conflict the unitedstates is a cochair along with france and russia of the minsk group of the organization for security and cooperation in europe established to resolve this dispute the united states and our minsk group partners last year put forward a new plan known as the commonstate proposal for resolving the conflict armenia and nagorno karabagh have both agreed to accept the proposal as a basis for negotiations despite serious reservations but azerbaijans response to the constructive proposal by the united states and our partners has been a flat no the unitedstates nonrecognition of nagornq karabagh creates issues about who in the state department should meet with president ghoukasian or other representatives of nagorno karabagh and last week i was joined by 19 of my colleagues on a bipartisan basis in writing to deputy secretary of state strobe talbott asking that in his capacity as the american cochair of the minsk group he personally meet with mr ghoukasian during his visit to our nations capital unfortunately secretary talbott was not in washington at the time of president ghoukasians visit and president ghoukasian met instead with donald keyser who is special negotiator for nagorno karabagh and the nis regional conflicts mr keyser i should say is doing a fine job in trying to win the confidence of the parties to the conflict but i believe it is important to stress the need for the highest level contacts possible which are appropriate and provide a sign of goodwill that would help encourage progress in the negotiations president ghoukasians status as the elected leader of one of the parties to the conflict argues in of according him highlevel recognition and indeed our two minsk group partners france and russia provide a stronger degree of recognition for the karabagh government than the united states does last month a bipartisan group of members of congress and our staffs met with special negotiator keyser at that meeting and in our followup letter to secretary talbott we urged that the united states stay the course in terms of the compromise commonstate approach and as i mentioned this approach has been accepted by armenian nagorno karabagh as a basis for direct negotiations but thus far azerbaijan has rejected this approach we hope that this rejection will not be the last word and we urge the administration to take proactive steps to reverse azerbaijans rejection last week i testified before the subcommittee on foreign operations of the house committee on appropriations on the fiscal year 2000 legislation and i called for assistance to both the republic of armenia and the republic of nagorno karabagh and to offer some proposals for how we can advance the peace process through this legislation the subcommittee i should say has been extremely attentive to the concerns of armenia nagorno karabagh and the entire caucasus region and thanks to the subcommittee unitedstates humanitarian assistance is flowing to nagorno karabagh i urged the subcommittee on foreign operations to express its strong support for the unitedstates position in the minsk group negotiations on nagorno karabagh and i hope the subcommittee will adopt language calling on the state department to stay the course and to press azerbaijan to come back to the negotiating table there are strong indications that azerbaijan believes that it can maintain its rejectionist policy by playing the oil card given the interest in developing petroleum resources in the caspian sea although recent test drilling indicates less than expected quantities of oil are causing some major american oil companies to pull out of azerbaijan and there have been also been troubling statements from azerbaijans president aliyev that he considers renewal of military conflict a viable option for settling the dispute if i could just submit the rest of my statement for the record i just want to say it is very important that we send a message to azerbaijan that their intransigence in opposing the minsk group proposal is a matter of concern here in washington finally i am concerned about the aid numbers for armenia and azerbaijan that were included in the administrations budget request which provide for a decrease in aid to armenia and an increase in aid to azerbaijan this is strange since armenia as well as nagomo karabagh has accepted the compromise proposal supported by the unitedstates while azerbaijan has rejected it but the administration budget proposed cutting aid to armenia while increasing aid to azerbaijan the unfortunate message to azerbaijan is that their intransigence in opposing the minsk group proposal is not a matter of concern here in washington that is not the signal we should be sending"], [0.49907487630844116, 0.5009251236915588, 1, "i thank the gentleman from ohio for yielding this time i rise in strong support of h r 1901 to designate the united states border station located in pharr texas as the kika de la garza united states border station i want to join with my colleague the gentleman from texas from mercedes in his comments kika de la garza was clearly an institution in this body he served the state of texas in this body for 32 years from the 15th congressional district in the rio grand valley prior to that having served in the state legislature as my colleague the gentleman from texas stated mr de la garza was known perhaps more than anything else for his work as chairman of the committee on agriculture and the ranking member of the committee on agriculture and the work that he did on drafting and writing successive omnibus farm bills as both the chairman and the ranking member but i think it is also important to note that congressman de la garza fought for much legislation that would help the constituents of what is also one of the poorest congressional districts in the united states he fought for legislation to provide affordable housing programs for rural home buyers he pushed for hunger relief measures to feed hungry children and he helped launch a full scale federal offensive against the spate of devastating birth defects in the rio grand valley in texas it is a special honor for me because not only was mr de la garza a close family friend of my grandfather lloyd bentsen sr who was a rancher and farmer in south texas for many years until his death in 1989 but kika held the seat that my uncle lloyd bentsen jr the past secretary of the treasury and senator from texas held so our families have had a very longstanding relationship and i was really pleased and proud to have the opportunity to serve with kika during my first term in congress i spent a great deal of time with him not just on the house floor but also sitting next to him on the flight from houston to washington as he would catch it from mcaiien and he would tell me stories going back to his early days in the house of representatives when things certainly were not as they are today i also want to commend not just kika but his wife of many years lucille who has clearly been his partner in his days in congress she was always very kind to all of the spouses i believe up here in telling them how things are done and in particular whereas she was close to many of my relatives in south texas also became close not only to my wife but to my daughters as well having gotten the opportunity to spend time flying back and forth to texas with them so i think this is a tremendous honor for one who has been a tremendous public servant for the people of texas not just the rio grande valley and i strongly endorse it and urge my colleagues to adopt it i rise in support of h r 1901 to designate the united states border station located in pharr tx as the kika de la garza united states border station i believe this is an appropriate way to honor congressman de ia garzas many years of service to the united states and the state of texas during which he provided tremendous leadership in support of agriculture improved relations with mexico a better quality of life for residents along the border among many other issues i am honored to have had the opportunity to serve in congress with kika de la garza even if for only 2 of his amazing 32 years in this body he is an example to all of us of a true gentleman and public servant who brought honor to this house through the civility respect and commitment to doing what is right that he brought to conducting the peoples business he is also a true texan who worked with his colleagues from both sides of the aisle to further the best interests of our state throughout his tenure in congress congressman de la garza never forgot the people he represented who live in a district considered to be the poorest in the state and which is now ably represented by my esteemed colleague rubn hinojosa congressman de la garza fought for legislation to provide affordable housing programs for rural homebuyers he pushed for hunger relief measures to feed hungry children and he helped launch a fullscale federal offensive against the spate of devastating birth defects in the rio grande valley when he was named the texas legislative conferences texan of the year in 1991 congressman de la garza said i bring with me centuries of people who at times were not recognized properly from the conquistador on the trek north to the most humble of migrant workers they stand with me here naming a border station after congressman de la garza is a fitting tribute to an individual who is a true son of the lower rio grande valley of south texas congressman de ia garza is perhaps best remembered for his leadership on behalf of american agriculture he served as chairman of the agriculture committee for a longer uninterrupted period than anyone else in history and presided over the drafting and successful enactment of three major omnibus farm bills 1981 1985 and 1990 that have reformed our nations agricultural policies he also guided efforts to reduce the cost of agricultural programs through several deficit reduction bills that have been approved by congress his other legislative accomplishments include legislation to streamline the agricultural lending system strengthen federal pesticide laws and various other measures to assist american agriculture encourage rural development and improve human nutrition congressman de la garza was also one of congress leading experts on united statesmexico relations and a proponent of

experiences of the people of guam that i had intended to do last night yesterday july 21st is a very special day in guams history it is the day that the third marine division united states marine corps and first provisional brigade of the unitedstates marine corps and elements of the 77th infantry division of the unitedstates army landed on guam to begin the liberation of guam from the japanese occupation annually on guam and certainly for the past few weeks we celebrate this event with parades and solemn speeches a carnival and commemorative festivities which honor both the veterans who came to guams shores to liberate the people of guam and for the people of guam themselves my people the people who endured a brutal enemy occupation for over 2 years now world war h of course is a very seminal event of this century and guam plays a very unique part in that i want to talk a little bit about that this evening on december 8 1941 the japanese began bombing guam and they landed about 5 000 army troops on december 10 of 1941 this attack was carried out simultaneously with attacks on pearl harbor and the philippines of course guam being on the other side of the date line the attack which was carried out at the same time as pearl harbor actually was on december 8 and not the japanese occupation featured a serious time of deprivation suffering and brutality which the people of guam who are ethnically referred to as the chamorro people who were at that time not unitedstates citizens but occupied a political category called unitedstates nationals endured and survived my purpose this evening is to give an historical perspective to those events which occurred some 55 years ago in july of 1944 on a distant unitedstates territory to enhance the understanding of the members of this body and the american people in general about the wartime experience of guam and the postwar period which helped shape the relationship between guam and the federal government guams experience is not unique if measured against the general experience of occupied peoples during a time of war whether it was in europe or china or the philippines guam after all did not have a monopoly on human suffering but it is a unique and special story about dignity in the midst of political and wartime machinations of large powers over small peoples and of a demonstrated loyalty to america the kind of loyalty which was tested the kind of loyalty that has not been asked of any civilian american community under the flag at any time during the 20th century in earlier years it may not have been necessary to give this kind of speech in congress two or 3 decades ago the members of this body were themselves the majority of members of this body were themselves world war i veterans who understood what the battle of guam was and who probably remembered it personally if not directly from war time experience but certainly just being part of world war ii today unfortunately most people know very little about guam most members know very little about the battle of guam and perhaps think of guam only occasionally probably more for exaggerated stories about snakes than for the historical experience of a great and loyal people when the japanese landed in december of 1941 the 5 000 japanese soldiers faced 153 marines 271 naval personnel 134 pan american workers and some 20 000 natives that i referred to earlier who were commonly called chamorros all of the americans meaning unitedstates citizen civilians had been evacuated on october 17 1941 in full expectation a few months before pearl harbor that something was going to happen in the pacific in the aleutian islands in alaska all of the islanders were evacuated with the full understanding that the japanese may occupy those islands and so therefore all of the civilians were removed but the people of guam remained the only american civilian community open to and eventually experiencing enemy occupation during world war h at the time the only units that attempted to engage the japanese in a very brief but symbolic and several people died was a unit known as the guam insular guard and insular force which were really people who had joined the unitedstates navy it was kind of a navy auxiliary force composed primarily of well entirely of men from guam and they were the only ones who willingly engaged the japanese and several of thern died during the time of the occupation the people of guam stood steadfastly loyal to america and its ideals despite the best efforts of the japanese occupiers to propagandize the people that it was better for them to be under and be part of the far east greater coprosperity sphere and the people of guam were loyal to america at the risk of their lives and certainly their livelihoods symbolic of the loyalty of the people of guam were several songs written during the course of the japanese occupation some mocking the japanese emperor and occupiers and others praising things american over those things that were japanese and the most wellknown song was uncle sam sam my dear old uncle sam wont you please come back to guam it is a song that was certainly in my upbringing and i was born after world war ii those people of my generation and even the later generation were all taught this song in one form or another the most visible symbol were the seven american sailors and there were seven who refused to surrender to the japanese forces and decided to take their chances hiding in the jungle until the return of unitedstates forces which sadly many of them expected to be a couple of months at the most one by one each of those sailors were hunted down and executed by the japanese except for one lonely sailor who survived the entire occupation assisted greatly assisted by the artero family this mans name was george tweed and his heroic saga was eventually made into a movie in the 1960s called no man is an island and for all those 32 months the people of guam suffered now in july of 1944 admiral ainsworth actually in june of 1944 admiral ainsworth began his preinvasion bombardment of guam for the anticipated landings in guam which were expected to take place in june after about 2 hours he was called back and he was called back and they rerouted all of his vessels to help with the battle in saipan the general plan was that of the three islands in the marianas islands which were heavily fortified saipan guam and tinian saipan was to be invaded first by unitedstates forces because it was acknowledged that that would be the most heavily fortified since those marianas islands had been under a japanese mandate since the end of world war i and were heavily populated not only by japanese military forces but indeed by japanese civilians the battle for saipan proved much more difficult than anticipated so the invasion of guam was postponed and instead admiral ainsworth and his naval forces were turned northward to deal with a couple of battles one the battle of saipan and the other a naval air battle called commonly called the marianas turkey shoot the invasion of guam was therefore called off for 5 weeks and during that intervening time the most brutal time of the japanese occupation was endured by the people of guam as they suffered forced labor and forced marches and the whole population was marched all over the island countless beheadings and civilian massacres largely for unknown reasons the increased brutality was over and above the forced labor for the construction of defense fortifications for the construction of air strips in places called orote and tiyan japanese army units several divisions had landed had arrived from manchuria in april of 1944 to defend guam from the anticipated american invasion in july of 1944 operation forager began and this was the whole operation meant for the invasion of guam and 13 days of sustained bombardment on guam an island of some 212 square miles was given by the navy partially as a result of their experience in the battle of saipan and even the normandy experience so that the bombing on guam which of course is a much smaller area than the invasion of the coast of normandy actually endured more preinvasion bombardment this extensive preinvasion bombardment even acted more as a stimulus for even more acts by the japanese military against the civilian population army air force planes b24s from recently taken islands in the marshall islands and navy carrier base planes had been bombing guam periodically for several weeks underwater demolition teams spent 4 days sweeping the shoreline in a way the navy took great pride in these underwater demolition teams and on guam they planted a sign welcome unitedstates marines from the unitedstates navy before the marines actually landed on guam and the marines did and they landed on july 21 1944 and they landed on narrow beaches on asan and agat and asan the people who assaulted the beach of asan had to face cliffs once they landed and those who landed in agat faced the only japanese counterattack of the day one of the heroes of that day was senator former senator howell heflin who was wounded and has repeatedly over the years that i have known senator howell heflin has repeatedly told me that the guam experience was the most important 6 hours of his life and the battle for guam raged for nearly 3 weeks and the island was declared secured on august 10 1944 nearly 18 500 japanese soldiers were killed and some 1 900 american servicemen were killed and although no specific statistics were kept about the civilian population hundreds of chamorros died during the battle or were executed and hundreds more died for reasons related directly to the war but not combat and even after the island was secured japanese stragglers continued to be a serious threat to security and a guam combat patrol organized by the unitedstates marine corps and soldiered by men from guam was established to find japanese stragglers who refused to surrender incredibly the last straggler was discovered in 1972 after spending some 28 years in the jungle by himself battles sometimes bring out the worst in human beings but they also bring out the inner strength in people of courage extraordinary heroism was common in the battles which occurred in the marianas and in guam and two medals of honor were awarded one was to a captain lewis wilson who was commanding officer of company f second battalion 9th marine regiment fought off repeated japanese counteroffensives on the fonte plateau had the lines been breached it would have spelled disaster for the marines in the rear captain wilson later on became commandant of the marine corps another was granted to private first class frank witek who distinguished himself in handtohand combat provided cover for the withdrawal of wounded comrades and singlehandedly put out an enemy machine gun position over the internet and because of the fact that many of the veterans who fought on guam have a very special relationship to guam over the internet i received the story of a private first class jack walker and staff sergeant harry kolata who landed in agat as members of the 306th infantry 77th army division they volunteered to go behind enemy lines to make contact with the villagers of merizo and they did so and they brought successfully brought back 1 500 people into the american lines and these are just a few of the stories of the heroism exhibited by the marines and the soldiers who liberated guam and on behalf of the people of guam i say si yuos maase and the veterans of the battle for guam continued to have an excellent relationship with the people of guam and return to guam every year although obviously in decreasing nurhbers every year and during this years celebration some 60 veterans have returned to guam to visit guam and to see the progress that they have helped make possible earlier this month on july 9 i laid a wreath at the tomb of the unknowns at arlington national cemetery as i have done so every year that i have been in office in order to commemorate the battle of guam and to express the gratitude of the people of guam to the veterans the servicemen this year i did so along with commonwealth of the northern marianas which includes the island of saipan and tinian representative juan babauta together we laid a wreath in order to express the gratitude felt by the people of our respective islands for the sacrifices of every marine sailor airman and soldier who helped in the liberation of guam and as i said repeatedly there was something very special about the battle for guam which was not present in any other pacific battle indeed any battle during world war ii guam was a unitedstates territory inhabited by civilians who were unitedstates nationals at the outbreak of the war it was in fact the first time that a foreign power had invaded unitedstates soil since the war of 1812 this special relationship is demonstrated in this painting based on a picture of two young chamorro boys who waved handmade american flags the stars are all wrong the stripes are all wrong but these two young boys that we think were aged maybe 8 and 6 at the time made flags which were imperfect in their design yet perfectly clear in their representation and their faces reflect the difficult times that they had had experiencing battle not as grown men in uniform with weapons but as young boys confused by all that was going on around them but despite the fact that their faces reflected the difficult times they also had their h6348 co hope for their future and their gratitude for their deliverance from enemy hands it was reported that service men who bore witness to the display and to the spectacle of chamorros who made their way down from the hills and the camps which the japanese placed them in broke down and wept at the sight of the people broke down and wept at the sight of these two young boys and seeing the people and their condition and their displays of red white and blue i know that we cannot ever recapture that moment in time but we must make every effort to do so because it has established a bond which has lasted for generations between those in uniform and the people of guam the people of guam came down from the mountains to tell the stories of brutality and the tales of suffering which they endured during the last few months of the occupation the japanese authorities had herded them into camps in maimai and talofofo malojloj and especially manenggon a name which today continues to stand for suffering thousands of people were placed into a valley without food and only a stream from which to drink and they found a way to survive and they found the will to survive and they expressed their gratitude of their deliverance with laughter and tears with hugs and screams all reportedly at the same time some experienced horrific events massacres at malesso tinta and faha where japanese soldiers herded families into caves and threw hand grenades and delivered small arms fire until dozens were killed a similar event occurred at fena cave and for the first time in many years speaker tony unpingco of the guan legislature led a commemoration of this event this event took place in what is now referred to as naval magazine a highly secured area where lots of weaponry is stored and this is very special for the people of guam and i certainly congratulate speaker unpingco for making this possible this tragedy was most manifested by an enormously brave woman i would like to tell you about who passed away a few years ago she was beatrice flores emsley beatrice was a woman who as a 13yearold was told to kneel by japanese soldiers and then struck by a sword across the back of her neck this attempt to behead the young lady was unsuccessful for reasons we do not know but we can only guess at the soldiers buried her in a shallow grave and miraculously she emerged from that grave and wandered for several days before she was treated lived to a ripe old age had children and grandchildren for years i remember this mrs emsley was a curiosity for many people understandably she did not like to talk about the war because the experience was so very painful so very few people asked her but eventually she started to speak out about her experience in order to bring honor and dignity to the experiences of the people of guam and she came to testify in congress on several occasions she was a remarkably gifted woman devoid of bitterness who never spoke harshly about her captors or the people who tried to behead her but only spoke compellingly about how her experience and how she hoped that the people of the united states would understand what guam went through as always mrs emsley was dignified as we asked her to recount her painful experiences recounting that we knew caused her so much pain and she came to symbolize what the people of guam went through several years ago at the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the liberation of guam the half century mark secretary of the interior bruce babbitt referred to the veterans who landed on guam as the liberators from without and the people of guam as the liberators from within it is their interaction that we bring honor to today and it is their struggle in the beaches and in the concentration camps it is their common fear and their common bravery it is their common love for freedom and it is their common bond that we bring honor to today in light of this i will enter into the record two newspaper articles one on the fena cave massacre which was commemorated recently in guam and the other is about darryl dass one of the marine liberators from iowa who was a parade grand marshal in our recent liberation day festivities in guam"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.5009728074073792, 0.5009728074073792, 0, "i rise to speak on the last day of the session about the introduction of a small bill related to what some might argue is a small event involving the loss by the federal government of an amount of money that would be considered gargantuan in every respect except its relative size to the united states government budget given all the budget decisions involving issues like medicare defense spending and u n funding this congress should be aware that threequarters of 1 billion has just become obligated outside the budget process because of regulatory laxness related to the failure of one rural bank the first national bank of keystone west virginia the facts revealed to date suggest that this failure may cost the bank insurance fund far more than the federal deposit insurance corporation estimated the fund would lose from all bank failures this year indeed the expected loss is so high that it could make keystone not only one of the 10 most expensive bank failures ever but also one of the most spectacular for any institution of any size with losses approaching an astounding 70 percent of the banks assets the public first learned of the failure of first national bank of keystone september 1 1999 when the office of the comptroller of the currency occ announced it was closing the bank and appointing the fdic as receiver bank examiners had discovered that loans on the banks books totaling 515 million were missingitems that represented roughly half the banks 1 1 billion in total reported assets other overstated assets questionable accounting practices and credit quality problems push the total expected losses toward the 750 million dollar mark the picture that is emerging is of an institution which in recent years reported high profits at the same time management pursued dubious investment strategies and ultimately mischievous techniques to hide massive losses from the scrutiny of examiners it will take some time for criminal investigators and federal bank regulators to unravel the full story of this bank failure but it is not too early to ask if federal regulators properly supervise the institution and prudentially stewarded the deposit insurance fund which backstops risks in the banking system for 5 or 6 years red flag practices should have alerted regulators that the highrisk asset management strategies employed by keystone were hardly of the kind expected in a rural institution situatedin a west virginia town of 627 residents and warranted vigilant supervisory measures from 1992 to 1998 keystone increased its assets tenfold to over 1 billion as it offered depositors up to 2 percentage points more in interest than competitor institutions rather than expanding small business and agricultural loans in its west virginia market area keystone engaged in a highrisk strategy of buying securitizing and selling subprime loans made to and by people the bank hardly knew management practices were reminiscent of those witnessed during the s l crisis of the 1980s rapid asset growth risky investment activity and the practice of paying hypercompetitive interest rates were augmented by legal and administrative tactics designed to thwart regulatory oversight a combination of lax management and weak supervision by the banks board were conducive to the imprudent and allegedly fraudulent activities that have been uncovered over the past several years the occ made futile attempts to curb keystones gogo activities with various enforcement actions and civil money penalties but in hindsight the measures were too weak and too late the occ pushed for management changes but the banks board resisted several experienced officers were hired in 1999 however the board gave them the cold shoulder and they quickly resigned in may of 1999 an external accountant grant thornton conducted an independent audit as required by the occ and issued an unqualified opinion of the banks 1998 financial statements the firm detected no fraud just a few months later however federal examiners found that a halfbillion dollars were missing from the banks claimed assets the delay in uncovering the losses apparently occurred in part because bank management engaged in a sustained pattern of obfuscation another tactic of keystone management was not unlike that employed 15 years earlier by charles keating one of the hallmarks of the keating tenure to the s l called lincoln was the hiring of many highpowered attorneys to represent his interests when challenged keating and his people had a habit of threatening regulators and the united states government with lawsuits in keatingesque fashion keystone went so far as to hire a former comptroller of the currency to contest the occs supervisory activities in an escalated twist examiners on bank premises were so harassed and felt so threatened that the occ had to request united states marshals to protect them when they were going over bank records in addition to similarities with respect to the 1980s gogo activities of s ls that cost american taxpayers approximately 140 billion the keystone case adds new elements the profile of questionable bank leadership is no longer simply the smoothtalking male huckster but it would now appear that keystones cops federal banking authorities were taken in by a scam perpetrated by an institution headed by a grandmother with the threats to examiners and recent discovery that three truckloads of bank documents were buried on the property of a senior bank official indictments have been issued for obstruction of a federal examination an unusual legal precept which some may find humorous others chilling keystones failure has not only revealed costly inadequacies at the field supervisory level but also flaws in interagency cooperation in washington for this reason i have today introduced h r 3324 a bill designed to bolster the independence of the federal deposit insurance corporation by background state chartered banks are regulated primarily by state banking agencies with the federal reserve erving as the primary federal regulator for state members national banks are regulated by the occ and holding companies of all banks are regulated by the federal reserve analogously state agencies regulate state chartered savings and loans and the office of thrift supervision ots serves as the federal thrift regulator the fdic is a backup regulator for all federallyinsured institutions banks and s ls because it is responsible for stewardship of the deposit insurance system it is also the primary federal regulator for state chartered banks which are not members of the federal reserve system in order to avoid to the maximum extent possible duplicative regulation the regulators are expected to cooperate and coordinate their examination activities on the whole this cooperation works well in part because americas banking system is so strong but just as there is private sector competition for profits there can at times be public sector competition for power in this case regulatory jurisdiction from a congressional perspective the keystone failure is worrisome because it appears that the fdic was stymied at key points in its desire to conduct reviews of the banks activities the regulatorsthe occ and the fdicfailed to cooperate closely although satisfactory communication among the fdic the occ and other federal regulators in routine cases appears to be the norm the keystone case reveals some potentially serious flaws in the federal oversight system the tension between the occ and the fdic over keystone was particularly evident in the period leading up to the 1998 examination of the bank instead of welcoming fdic expertise and assistance in analyzing the increasingly complex operations of the bank the occ initially denied the fdics request to participate in a bank examination the occ says its decision was based in part largely on concerns that the inclusion of additional fdic examiners might exacerbate the increasingly difficult environment for the examiners at the bank and heighten managements resistance to examiners requests for information retired examiners like old soldiers and athletes sometimes have a tendency to exaggerate reminiscences in a discussion about keystone one opined to me the other day that the old rule was if a bank ever displayed reluctance in cooperating with examiners a swat team of accountants should immediately be brought in and if intransigence continued the bank should immediately be closed this perspective may be callously insensitive to law and to a system where agencies because of their extraordinary authority have an obligation to act with great caution but one truth is selfevident bank intransigence is a reason for more not fewer examiners in this regard it is noteworthy that the occ itself has acknowledged that by september of 1997 it considered keystones extensive problems required a significant amount of examiner expertise for it then to suggest that its objection to having fdic professionals join the occ in examinations of keystone related less to turf concerns than to apprehension that feathers would be ruffled at the bank is profoundly indefensible concerned that keystone posed a serious risk to the insurance fund f6ic staff decided to elevate their request to take part in the 1998 examination to the full fdic board of which the comptroller is one of five statutory members in the end they chose not to present the case to the board because after a lengthy delay the occ eventually acquiesced to limited fdic participation but what has become apparent in extensive discussions with fdic and occ staff is clear resistance on the occs part to fdic review of banks in certain difficult situations and of some timidity of fdic staff to challenge treasury department hegemony although the occ reversed its original position just one week before the june 30 1998 fdic board meeting at which this issue was to be discussed it would appear that the occs reluctance to involve the fdic in the examination and other important meetings may have contributed to a lesser fdic involvement than was warranted for example in february of 1998 the fdic asked for three examiner slots for the upcoming 1998 examination but the occ agreed in the week before the june board meeting to allow only one although the occ later agreed to permit two fdic examiners its basis for wantingto limit fdic involvement is not clear less than a year later after keystones condition had further deteriorated the occ agreed to allow seven fdic examiners to participate in the 1999 examination it was during that examination that the stunning losses were uncovered the turf battle over the number of examiners reflected the substantive disagreements the two agencies had over the banks operations the fdic in 1998 questioned the valuation of the residual assets on keystones books and the potential loss exposure of the banks subprime lending activities in particular the fdic believed that keystones valuation of its residual assets which comprised over 200 percent of keystones capital was not supported after the occ agreed to limited fdic participation in the 1998 examination the fdic contends that its examiners were to remain on site until all questions about the banks accounting and recordkeeping were answered the occ however completed the onsite portion of the examination in 15 workdays without obtaining sufficient support for the residual valuation and without completing the reconcilement of balance sheet accounts leaving fdic examiners with no resolution to this critical concern when the banks accountant finally provided the missing information to the occ at a meeting in january 1999 the fdic reports that it was neither invited nor even informed of the meetingthis despite the fact that the fdic had specifically asked to be kept fully informed as insurer and backup supervisor on issues relating to keystone similarly the occ did not invite the fdic to an april 1999 meeting with the developers of the banks residual valuation model which was a primary fdic concern because it was central to determining the risk to the bank insurance fund the bureaucratic turf battle over keystone disturbingly reveals flaws in the current system while the fdic to the maximum extent possible should coordinate examinations with other regulators it has long been the assumption of legislators that the fdic could at its discretion fully participate in examinations with other regulators or conduct special examinations of any federallyinsured institution without delay or interference whenever it identified a risk of loss to the insurance fund the keystone incident shows the fdic to be coerced not by the regulated but by its fellow regulators who have a shared accountability with the fdic to the american taxpayer the fdic has a unique role in our financial system and it must be insulated from regulatory turf battles and political considerations it is instrumental in maintaining the safety and soundness of the banking industry and is responsible for safeguarding the deposits of customers of all insured financial institutions implicitly the fdic also has a role in assuring competitive equity by safeguarding the insurance funds it keeps insurance premiums as low as possible and protects wellrun institutions from assuming liabilities associated with high flyers it would appear that the fdic in its role as guardian of the insurance funds should have taken a more aggressive stance in insisting on its authority to examine keystone in response to a letter of mine on the subject the fdic made a strong case that it should have been given a more active role in keystone examinations yet the agency did not rigorously pursue its rights and obligations in the matter for example the fdic initially agreed to the occs terms of allowing only one fdic examiner in the 1998 examination of keystone despite its judgment four months earlier that it needed three if the fdic had serious concerns about keystones threat to the fund it had a fiduciary obligation to press its case to the board that three examiners were needed and should be approved concern also exists about the length of time that elapsed between the fdics february 1998 request to participate in the keystone examination and its planned presentation of the case to the board in june while this delay allowed the agencies time to negotiate before the start of the examination the fdic should have acted on a more forceful and timely basis to resolve the disagreement while coordination among the agencies is important cooperation should not overshadow the fdics primary responsibility to protect the safety and soundness of the insurance funds in attempting to understand the interagency conflict that existed in the supervision of keystone it i instructive to review the legislative history of the fdics authority to examine national banks and other insured institutions prior to 1950 the fdic could utilize its special examination authority to examine a national bank only with the written consent of the occ this veto power over the fdic proved untenable and the house passed legislation that year which permitted the fdic to examine national banks as backup supervisor without the occs written consent in conference with the senate however the bill was modified to require the full fdic boardof which the occ is a memberto authorize any special examination requests this provision has survived to this day as section 10 b 3 of the federal deposit insurance act while more restrictive of fdic independence than the original house language the 1950 change in law ended the ability of other agencies to veto fdic participation in examinations as backup supervisor as was possible from 1935 until 1950 in 1950 the fdic board consisted of three members only the comptroller was from the treasury department the other two directors were affiliated only with the fdic in 1989 the board was changed to the current fivemember format there are now three independent members plus the heads of the occ and the ots who represent the treasury department this arrangement does not give treasury agencies majority control under normal circumstances when however there is a vacancy in one of the three fdic positions half of the four remaining board members represent agencies of the treasury department if two of the independent seats were to be vacant the treasury department would effectively control the fdic board this is not an insignificant matter considering that the current statutory language regarding fdic backup examination authority was written at a time when the majority of the fdics original threemember board reflected control by an independent agency rather than a cabinet department however when there is a vacancy on the fdic board the treasury department assumes a larger role than congress intended and the fdics backup authority can be subject to challenge from 1983 until 1993 for example the occ and the fdic operated under an agreement whereby the occ would invite fdic participation in examinations of banks with composite 4 and 5 ratings indicating a troubled bank additionally the occ would allow fdic participation in examination of higher rated banks with an emphasis on 3rated banks in september 1993 this collegial arrangement changed two of the independent seats were vacant and the fdics board then dominated by the two treasury representatives voted to end this longstanding agreement the new policy reserve to the fdic board all decisions regarding concurrent or special examinations regardless of the rating of the institution this change in policy was entered into despite an explicit written communication to the fdic by thenhouse banking committee chairman henry b gonzalez and me the thenranking member that congress had serious reservations that the proposal under consideration would have the effect of the fdic improperly derogating its authority while the occ board member seemed sympathetic at the time to the need for fdic special examinations for 4 and 5rated institutions he clearly had concerns about fdic involvement in higherrated institutions yet the fdic acting chairman and fdic staff who attended the meeting insisted that under certain circumstances it may be more important to involve the fdic as backup supervisor in examinations of deteriorating 3rated banks than in the examinations of 4 and 5rated institutions with already identified and addressed problems keystone is a case in point two years later in 1995 the fdic board delegated authority to its division of supervision to authorize participation in certain backup examination activities of institutions when the fdic is invited by the primary regulator or when the fdic asks and the primary regulator does not object in cases such as keystone however when the primary regulator objects fdic policy dictates that the case must be brought to the full fdic board regardless of the rating or conditions of the bank unfortunately the fdic board has not had its full complement of five directors since an independent director resigned over a year ago which results in treasury having influence disproportionate to congressional intent during this period of time the administration has failed to submit a nominee for this current vacancy on the fdic board the result is that proposed actions or policies supported by the two independent fdic directors can be blocked by the two directors who are affiliated with the treasury agencies the occ and the ots this is not good governance by failing to nominate a person for the unfilled board position the administration has forced the fdic to operate without clear independence from the power considerations of the qcc and ots such a situation could have been a factor in the fdics decision not to vigorously pursue in the spring of 1998 its original request in the keystone case the bottom line is that all regulators share a common responsibility to protect the safety and soundness of the unitedstates financial systema responsibility that should not be affected by turf concerns the occs principal response to date in the aftermath of the keystone failure has been to declare that all fdic requests to participate in an occ examination or conduct a special examination of a national bank will now be considered directly by the comptroller himself while this procedure is certainly better than having occ staff deny a request and forcing the fdic to ask the board for approval the response is still inadequate because it would do nothing to address the potential for undue treasury agency influence on the fdic board when a vacancy exists the treasury is in effect in control it has veto power over fdic participation this is clearly contrary to congressional intent that the fdic operate as an independent agency and that it alone be able to determine whether an examination is necessary for insurance purposes without undue influence by another federal regulator from a broader perspective i might add that since looking into the details of the keystone case i have learned that a lack of cooperation is rare but not isolated despite the generally constructive working relationship among federal bank regulators in some 90 instances of badkup examinations over the past four years there have been in addition to keystone four other cases in which the primary regulatory agency initially rejected the fdics request to participate in an examination three of these cased involved the occ and the other the ots in all four instances as with keystone the primary agency ultimately agreed to some form of fdic participation without formal board action the record of these five cases confirms that disagreements among agencies are the exception rather than the norm there are also no indications that the fdic is capriciously using its backup authority nevertheless the keystone failure makes a graphic case that the current process needs improving accordingly to reinforce fdic independence on matters affecting the insurance fund i have introduced today legislation to give the fdic chairman authority in special circumstances to direct fdic examiners to examine any insured institution instead of the current provision vesting such authority with the fdic board of directors this authority will continue to be used only when in the words of section 10 b 3 of the federal deposit insurance act an examination is necessary to determine the condition of such depository institution for insurance purposes the legislation would require that in exercising this authority all reasonable efforts be made to coordinate with any other appropriate regulator and to minimize any disruptive effect of a special examination on the operation of the depository institution the intent is not to press new fdic regulation on the banking system but simply to stress that in unusual special circumstances the fdic must be able to act as an independent rather than subordinate agency of government i believe this legislation will help assure the safety and soundness of the american financial system and protect the insurance funds by underscoring statutorily the longterm intent of congress that fdic backup authority must be of an independent nature the chairman would be required to notify other fdic board members and the federal reserve and state banking authority as applicable whenever he or she makes such a decision as the custodian of the insurance funds the fdic must be allowed to perform its role as a backup regulator on a timely basis whenever circumstances warrant it is worth noting that the inspector general ig of the fdic has come to similar conclusions in an october 19 1999 memorandum to the fdic chairman the ig recommended that the fdic board delegate its special examination authority to the fdic chairman or that the law be amended to vest that authority in the chairman the legislation i am introducing today would address the igs concerns as well as my own the ig argued that the agencys backup examination authority was particularly critical in this era of increasing bank consolidation while the megabanks created by recent mergers pose the greatest risks to the insurance funds the fdic is the primary regulator for only two of the nations 39 largest institutions obstacles to future fdic access to relevantinformation about megabank operations in its role as backup supervisor could have consequences far greater than the keystone case to assess risk in large institutions where it does not have an ongoing presence the fdic requires timely information and records on important aspects of operations therefore the bill i am introducing also includes language emphasizing the right of the fdic to prompt access to information from other regulators and requiring the federal banking agencies to establish procedures for sharing other information in addition to examination reports whenever such information is relevant to the fdics responsibility to protect the insurance funds this provision of the bill underscores the importance of interagency coordination and information sharing to ensure that the fdic has the necessary data to assess risk to the insurance funds it is intended to have the practical benefit of potentially minimizing the number of occasions in which the fdic must exercise its special examination authority the vast majority of institutions will not be affected in any way by this legislation for most institutions the fdic does not need any special information other than that already available to it nor does it need to perform any form of backup examination but clearly in cases where the potential risk to the fund is greatbanks with significant weaknesses especially if they are megabanks with exceedingly complex activitiesthe fdic should be able to function as congress expects it to function and receive from the primary regulator the information it needs to assess relevant risk i might add before closing that my concerns in the keystone case extend beyond the issues of regulatory cooperation and fdic special examination authority there are also troubling questions here about the regulators ability to identify and stem high risk bank activities in a timely fashion there was another bank failure involving extremely high losses relative to assets just over a year ago on july 23 1998 colorado state banking authorities closed bestbankan fdicsupervised state bank located in boulderafter state and fdic examiners found 134 million in losses in highrisk unsecured subprime credit card accounts although the fdic initially estimated the cost of that failure to the insurance fund at about 28 million by years end the estimate had risen 6fold to 171 6 million i mention the bestbank case because of its striking similarities to the keystone case like the junkbond investments of s ls in the 1980s both bestbank and keystone were disproportionately involved in highrisk activities namely subprime loans both banks relied heavily on outside third party servicers both banks had experienced extraordinarily high asset growth both banks had high public profiles in the mid1990s bestbank was labeled in one banking publication as the best performer among unitedstates banks and keystone captured the title of the nations most profitable community bank for three straight years keystone and bestbank also engaged in similar tactics to frustrate federal examiners and fraud is alleged to have played a part in the failure of both unfortunately i suspect we may also find some parallels in how federal regulators handled the two cases the fdic ig in conducting the material loss review in the bestbank case concluded that the fdic could have been more effective in controlling the banks rapid asset growth and thus curbing losses to the insurance fund while we do not yet know the final outcome of the investigations into either of these recent bank failures it is clear that the banking agencies need to continue to review their supervisory strategies for banks engaging in inherently risky activities such as subprime lending accordingly i am asking each of the federal banking regulators to keep the committee informed of any new policies and procedures for identifying institutions with profiles similar to those of keystone and bestbank and any changes in their supervisory practices with respect to such institutions also i am interested in any initiatives that would assist examinersin the detection of fraud which is becoming a factor in an increasing percentage of failures in this regard i am pleased to note that fdic chairman donna tanoue recently announced that the fdic is developing guidelines to require additional capital for subprime portfolios and reviewing potential increases in insurance premiums for banks that continue to engage in high risk activities of this nature without appropriate safeguards in closing the insurance fund should not have to suffer an excessive loss during this era of generally favorable economic conditions expensive failures impose unfair costs in the form of higher insurance premiums on honest law abiding community banks around the country failures also impose costs on depositors whose accounts exceed insurance limits and as illustrated by the keystone case failure can take a heavy toll on the local community and those whose jobs depend on the survival of the bank clearly it is critical that federal regulators cooperate with each other and pay particular attention to unusually rapid asset growth and potentially risky banking practices if future keystonesand bestbanks are to be averted"], [0.5009626746177673, 0.5009626746177673, 0, "today the house considers legislation regarding unitedstates policy toward the crisis in yugoslavia under our constitution congress has an important responsibility to be involved in the conduct of foreign policy and this is no exception today i will vote for h r 1569 and s con res 21 and against h con res 82 and h con res 44 there are four issues that the house of representatives must decide today whether the united states should declare war on yugoslavia whether the united states should withdraw its forces from the nato led strikes whether congress must pass legislation to approve any ground troops that may be deployed by the president and whether the president has the support of the congress to continue to participate in the nato led air campaign these are not easy or simple decisions h con res 82 would require the president to remove unitedstates military forces currently participating in operation allied force the other proposal h con res 44 would declare a state of war between the united states and the federal republic of yugoslavia i intend to oppose both of these proposals passage of either bill would have severe consequences for united states foreign policy withdrawing unitedstates troops participating in operation allied force would hand yugoslav president slobodan milosevic a victory and a signal that he was free to continue the policies of ethnic cleansing and genocide in addition withdrawing troops would destroy hopes for a positive outcome of current air strikes against serbia finally the withdraw of unitedstates troops may break apart the nato alliance withdrawal of troops could cause milosevic to question our resolve to achieve the objective of a multiethnic democratic kovoso in which all can live in peace and security conversely declaring war would have equally devastating consequences the situation in kosovo though extremely serious has not developed to the point that the united states as a sovereign country should declare war declaring war carries legal consequences that include the nationalization of factories for wartime production as well as foreign policy consequences such as the military involvement from other countries such as russia the united states has only voted to declare war 11 times in its history and none since world war ii the united states should continue its participation in the nato led effort but at this time there is no compelling reason why we as a sovereign nation should independently declare war on yugoslavia i do intend to support h r 1569 which would prohibit the use of funds appropriated to the defense department for deploying unitedstates ground forces in yugoslavia unless the deployment is authorized by law this prohibition does not apply to ground missions that deal specifically with rescuing unitedstates military personnel or personnel of another nato country participating in the mission normally i do not advocate limiting the presidents options in his conduct of unitedstates foreign policy and i do have some concerns about this legislation for example requiring congressional approval of ground troops by law could be misinterpreted by beth milosevic and our allies as a potential step back from the solidarity expressed at the nato summit in addition there could be practical problems in carrying out the intent of this legislation because there are some unitedstates ground troops already in the region as part of peacekeeping forces however the question of enaging unitedstates ground troops in combat in kosovo is so serious that congress must take an active role in making that decision unfortunately in initiating the air campaign the administration left the impression that it would be over in a matter of days and that milosevic would immediately capitulate initiating the use of ground troops is an even more serious decision and there must be full consultation with congress if that decision has to be made while the potential use of ground forces cannot be completely ruled out the best scenario would be that a nato ground forcepredominantly made up of europeannato forceswould escort refuges back to kosovo after the yugoslav forces voluntarily withdraw or they are forced to withdraw as a result of the nato air campaign the ramifications of the use of ground forces must be fully studied and debated by congress and conveyed to the american people regardless of what steps are necessary and what measures are passed by the house of representatives today i would urge the president to make sure he prepares the american people for any role he may ask of our military personnel finally i also intend to support s con res 21 which authorizes the president to conduct military air operations and missile strikes against yugoslavia the united states must continue to work to insure that our nato allies do their part and that our burden does not grow disproportionately at the same time we cannot escape the fact that we are the worlds only real superpower and thus the only nation that has certain military logistical and humanitarian capabilities each day brings more grim statistics regarding the treatment of ethnic albanians in kosovo since february of 1998 milosevic has used force to kill more than 2 000 ethnic albanians and has displaced at least 400 000 since natos air campaign began milosevic has escalated his violence against ethnic albanians and they have been killed and tortured and driven from their homes and families the united states as a member of nato has a responsibility to step in to try to stop the killing of innocent civilians in our constitution the founding fathers envisioned full consultation by the president with congress whenever the unitedstates would send troops into a conflict it is never easy to ask american men and women to leave their family and friends to risk their lives to protect the peace of another country when the president decides to send unitedstates troops into harms way he should seek the full backing of congress and the

pallets similar to this little baby here unfortunately about half of the reconstructive surgeons in the country in the last couple of years have had proposed surgeries to correct conditions related to this birth defect turned down by hmos because they are cosmetic when you have a normal process like aging and you do an operation to make it better that is cosmetic but when a baby is born with a birth defect in the middle of their face like this that is not a cosmetic procedure i can give you many functional reasons why this should be fixed but there are children in this country in the last several years who have been denied medically necessary treatment by hmos i closed my medical practice when i came to congress but i still go overseas to do surgeries to correct birth defects like this i remember a few years ago i was down in guatemala and a 30 year old man came in with an unrepaired cleft lip just like this he lived all his life with an unrepaired cleft lip so we fixed him the next day he had come in with his mother who was probably about 50 but she looked like she was about 80 they were of indian extraction when we took him back to the recovery area in this small hospital up in northeast guatemala his mother broke down and started crying she said in spanish ahora el va a dios con felicidad now he will go to heaven happy now one of the members of this congress the gentleman from texas should be commended because he has helped raise funds for those surgical trips abroad many of them done by dr bill riley to help correct this type of birth defect but we have a situation in this country where even if you are paying a lot of money for your insurance you are getting turned down because your hmo arbitrarily declares this not medically necessary when hmo reform comes to the floor i hope my colleagues who have participated in helping children get charitable care to correct this type of birth defect will vote for legislation that makes it necessary for insurers in this country to cover correction of this type of birth defect the clock continues to tick another week has gone by without legislative action in the house on hmo reform the gentleman from virginia the chairman of the committee on commerce has promised the gentleman from georgia that we would have a subcommittee markup sometime in june but where is a firm commitment to a date certain and where is the commitment for a full committee markup and where is the commitment from the republican leadership in this house to move hmo reform to the floor or do we just continue to delay managed care reform should be on the floor by july 4th there are four weeks until the july 4th recess so colleagues let us get moving now why is it so important to move this legislation in a timely fashion because people are being hurt every day by decisions by managed care health plans that they make when they know they cannot be held responsible for those decisions i recently read an account of a gruesome crime and i saw an analogy in that crime to what we have with fed eral law as it relates to hmos in late 1978 a woman by the name of mary vincent made a fateful decision she jumped into a blue van on a freeway while hitchhiking in berkley california later the driver pulled off the highway and in a flash mary saw a hammer swinging at her head her attacker then tied her hands behind her back and he raped her viciously repeatedly she screamed for her release finally he untied her hands only to sink an ax an ax into her left forearm then he did it again and again and her left arm was off in three blows four blows later and he had cut off her other arm this sadist then dumped her molested and violated afid mutilated body into a culvert off of a lonely road where she was found the next morning miraculously still alive mary was in the hospital for a month and was eventually fitted with prosthetic arms that have crablike pinchers for her hands she later testified against her attacker and when she left the witness stand he swore at her if it is the last thing i do i am going to finish the job eight years later mary was living in puget sound when she heard on her wedding day that her attacker had been freed from san quentin after serving only eight years she lived in fear for years that this rapist would return to finish the job finally in february 1997 her mother called her with more bad news her attacker had killed a florida woman last year she flew to florida to testify against her attacker again this time he got the treatment he deserved he is now on death row parenthetically it is crimes like those done to mary vincent that caused me and many other of our colleagues to support the death penalty any person who is not criminally insane should be responsible for his or her actions so what does the horrendous tragedy that befell mary vincent have to do with managed care reform unfortunately it reminded me of an equally tragic event that happened to a little 6monthold baby named jimmy adams at 3 30 one morning lamona adams found her 6monthold boy jimmy panting sweating moaning with a temperature of 104 so she phoned her hmo to ask for permission to go to the emergency room the voice at the other end of the 1800 number probably 1 000 miles away told her to go to scottish rite hospital where is it asked lamona i dont know find a map came the reply it turns out that the adams family lived south of atlanta georgia and scottish rite was an hour away on the other side of the atlanta metro area lamona held little baby jimmy while his dad drove as fast as he could twenty miles into the trip while driving through atlanta they passed emory hospitals emergency room georgia baptists emergency room then grady memorials emergency room but they still pushed on to scottish rite medical center still 22 miles away because they knew if they stopped at an unauthorized hospital their hmo would deny coverage for any unauthorized treatment and they would be left with possibly thousands of dollars of bills they knew jimmy was sick they just didnt know how sick after all they were not trained medical professionals while still miles away from scottish rite hospital jimmys eyes fell shut lamona frantically called out to him but she couldnt get him to respond his heart had stopped can you imagine jimmys dad driving as fast as he can while his mother is trying to keep him alive they finally pulled into the emergency room entrance lamona leaped out of the car she raced to the emergency room with jimmy in her arms she was screaming help my baby help my baby the nurse gave him mouthtomouth resuscitation while the pediatric crash cart was rushed into the room doctors and nurses raced to see if modern medicine could revive this little infant he was intubated intravenous medicines were given and he was cardiopulmonary resuscitated this is little jimmy adams tugging at his big sisters sleeve before he got sick well little jimmy turned out to be a tough little guy he survived despite the delay in treatment caused by his hmo but he didnt survive whole he ended up with gangrene in both hands and both feet and doctors had to amputate both of jimmys hands and both of his feet now jimmy is learning how to put on his leg prostheses with his arm stumps but it is tough for him to get on both of his arm hook prostheses by himself for the rest of his life this anecdote quote unquote as hmo defenders are so likely to call a victim like jimmy they just say they are just anecdotes well little jimmy will never play basketball and little jimmy will never caress the face of the woman that he loves with his hands a judge looked into this case of james adams and he said that the hmos margin of safety was razor thin i would add it is about as razor thin as the scalpel that had to amputate little jimmys hands and his feet what do little jimmys amputations have to do with mary vincents amputations the person responsible for cutting off her arms is now on death row but if your child had an experience like little jimmys and you received your health insurance through your employers selfinsured plan the health plan would be responsible for nothing the health plan let me repeat that as we look at little jimmy if jimmys parents received their insurance through their employer who has a selfinsured plan and that plan has made the medical decision that has resulted in a little jimmy adams losing both hands and both feet under federal law that plan is responsible for nothing other than the cost of care given in this case the amputations we say how can that be how can a health plan that makes medical decisions that result in the loss of hands and feet be free of responsibility we would say that is an outrage we do not allow that to happen with victims of crime like mary vincent how do we let an insurance company off scotfree when they make the kind of medically negligent decision that results in this do not get me wrong i am not advocating criminal prosecution of medical malpractice but just as i as a doctor am responsible for my actions hmos should be responsible for their actions there are many members of congress like myself who support the death penalty because we believe in personal responsibility how can i ask the members how can we not at least support financial responsibility for an hmo when they make a medically negligent decision that results in the loss of a limb like this should they not at least be responsible for damages under a current federal law called erisa the employee retirement and income security act if you receive your insurance from your employer and you have a tragedy like jimmy adams your plan which makes decisions is liable for nothing other than the care that was not given not only did congress give hmos legal immunity for their decisions but erisa allows those health plans to define as medically necessary any damned thing they want to say it is do members not quite see the parallel between mary vincent and jimmy adams yet listen to the words of a former hmo reviewer as she testified before congress it was may 30 1996 when a small nervous woman testified before the committee on commerce her testimony came after a long day of testimony on the abuses of managed care this woman was linda peeno a claims reviewer for several health care plans she told of the choices that plans are making every day when they determine the medical necessity of treatment options i am going to recount her story for the members as she testified i wish to begin by making a public confession in the spring of 1987 i caused the death of a man although this was known to many people i have not been taken before any court of law or called to account for this in any professional or public forum in fact just the opposite occurred i was rewarded for this it brought me an improved reputation in my job and contributed to my advancement afterwards not only did i demonstrate i could do what was expected of me i exemplified the good company doctor i had saved a half million dollars her anguish over harming patients as a managed care reviewer had caused this woman to come forth and bare her soul in tearful and huskyvoiced account the audience in that room shifted uncomfortably and they became very quiet as her story continued industry representatives averted their eyes she continued since that day i have lived with this act and many others eating into my heart and soul for me a physician is a professional charged with the care of the healing of his or her fellow human beings the primary ethical norm is do no harm i did worse i caused death instead of using a clumsy bloody weapon those are her word instead of using a clumsy bloodyweapon i used the simplest cleanest of tools my words this man died because i denied him a necessary operation to save his heart i felt little pain or remorse at the time the mans faceless distance remember that 1800 number that lamona adams little jimmys mother had to phone because of that faceless distance it soothed my conscience like a skilled soldier i was trained for the moment when any moral qualms arose i was to remember i was not denying care i was only denying payment she continued at the time this helped me avoid any sense of responsibility for my decisions now i am no longer willing to accept the escapist reasoning that allowed me to rationalize this decision i accept my responsibility now for this mans death as well as for the immeasurable pain and suffering many other decisions of mine caused at this point mrs peeno described many ways that health care plans deny care but she emphasized one in particular the right to decide what care is medically necessary she said there is one last activity that i think deserves a special place on this list and this is what i call the smart bomb of cost containment and that is medical necessities denials even when medical criteria is used she continued it is rarely developed in any kind of standard traditional clinical process it is rarely standardized across the field the criteria are rarely available for prior review by the physicians or the members of the plan and we have enough experience from history to demonstrate the consequences of secretive unregulated systems that go awry the man who cut off mary vincents arms sits on death row but hmos which deny care with similar consequences what happens to them they increase their profits under federal laws hmos can cause a jimmy adams to lose his hands or his feet and then they can justify their decision by defining medically necessary any way they choose when i think of mary vincent and jimmy adams i rail at the injustice of their pain but at least in mary vincents case we know that her attacker is getting his just due his just desserts but does it not send a chill up our spine to hear an hmo medical reviewer describe how she caused the death of a man and then got rewarded for it does it not cause a sense of outrage to find out that for years congress has been shielding health plans from the consequences of their decisions like those that affected jimmy adams it is time for congress to defuse the smart bomb of hmos it is time for congress to repeal the liability protection for erisa health plans they should function under the same liability that insurers in the individual market operate under under regulations that would prevent tragedy like this those protections should apply to everyone now personal responsibility has been a watchword in this republican congress and should be applied to this issue health plans that recklessly deny needed medical service should be made to answer for their conduct laws that shield entities from their responsibility only encourage them to cut corners congress created the erisa loophole and congress should fix it so i have now come full circle to what brings me to the floor tonight i find us at a crossroads hmo reform will either suffer slow legislative death as the house continues to do nothing or we will take our responsibility for past congressional mistakes and pass a bill like my managed care reform act of 1999 h r 719 i urge my colleagues to cosponsor h r 719 the managed care reform act of 1999 it would fix the type of conditions that have caused this type of loss to a little boy this bill is endorsed by the american cancer society and other consumer groups it is endorsed by many professional groups including the american academy of family physicians this weekend it was endorsed by the american college of surgeons i beg my colleagues no i implore my colleagues we cannot let even one more little boy or girl become a victim for the sake of making profits for an hmo let us have a fair debate under an open rule on the floor of this house by the july 4th recess we should all be for the little guy we should not be in the pockets of the hmo corporate ceos"],

question of travel to cuba in grants it is nowhere near the percentage rezemel v rusk the court again ruled that the ceived by those states where the eradication right to travel is guaranteed in the

in the state to selffinance the cost of because it was supported by the weightiest most of the eradication program the federal consideration of national security however governments percentage of support for these according to a unitedstates defense intelligence programs has steadily declined over the last agency report issued on may 5 1998 c uba few years and today the federal contribution is no longer a military threat to the united is only a few percentage points of the cost of states the overall program in lieu of direct federal number three i believe we should look the grants the congress has provided these reissues of fairness and severity let me say maining states with access to low interest that i do support the idea of permitting sales usda loans some grant money and inkind of unitedstates foods and medicines to these nations federal assistance in most instances the but if you weight the pros and cons of the state governments have been required to sales versus travel i dont think this agree step up to the plate and provide significant ment passes the common sense test lets financial support to replace the lost federal look at the four other nations this agreement aid permits sales to north korea iran sudan in oklahoma our state legislature created and libya the oklahoma boll weevil eradication organiamerican citizens are permitted to travel to zation or obweo as a state agency in 1993 north korea and sudan north korea is devel to coordinate the statewide effort in 1995 the legislature amended the powers of the obweo to enhance its financial capabilities so that obweo could apply for and receive usda lowinterest loans as well as issuing state bonds the interest from which would be exempt from federal income tax shortly thereafter obweo organized the states growers and began its eradication efforts unfortunately neither of the two financial tools with which obweo was equipped proved to be useful due to quirks in usda loan regulations obweo has never been eligible for usda loans moreover obweo has not been able to issue federal taxexempt bonds because of a restriction in the internal revenue code regarding private activity bonds the inability of obweo to use the taxexempt feature has resulted in additional interest costs as well all told obweo has seen its financing costs increase by almost 2 million which is a tremendous amount in light of a total program cost of just under 17 million in other words obweo is experiencing a more than 15 program cost overrun because it cannot get access to loan programs available to other states this bill takes the necessary steps to get the eradication program in oklahoma back on track with that in other states furthermore it provides the necessary resources for the cotton producers nationwide to implement aggressive successful eradication programs to rid their crops of these destructive pests other benefits for the cotton producers across the country include an increase in the limitation on loan deficiency payments ldps and market loan gains mlgs to 150 000 for 2000 crops of cotton grains and oilseeds 78 million for the federal cost share contribution to boll weevil eradication and 100 million in lending authority for the eradication program also included in this bill is funding for the retired educators for agricultural programs or reap reap is an organization which was established in 1994 to address the diminishing numbers of african american agricultural education teachers in oklahomaand the scarcity of african american youth enrolled in vocational agriculture and progframs such as the future farmers of america initially reap was operating in five counties in oklahoma it has since begun to operate in other areas throughout the state the mission of reap is to build a foundation that promotes personal and economic opportunities in agriculture for african american youth through project development and partnerships with educational and other community resources one of the primary goals of reap is to emphasize citizenship economic development leadership and scholarship to the african american youth involved in the program reap extends its outreach to the parents and community members by means of programs forums and opportunities to chaperone student activities the program encourages this participation in the hope that the adults will become better informed more involved and more supportive of the reasonable and achievable aspirations of their young people reap exemplifies a model that can be easily replicated it is a program of vision partnerships and commitment that is timeless in focus and limited only by the parameters of the imagination field trips to areas in my district in southwest oklahoma have ignited great interest in expanding the program into this area of our state parents and teachers in lawton altus frederick and tipton assure me that there is a great need for reap in our area of the state where limited financial resources have precluded service reap is an important program which could be used as a model for similar programs in other states this program is vital to the further development of rural america i am honored to have the opportunity to play a role in furthering the efforts of this very important program the bill also includes 3 5 billion for emergency assistance to farmers and ranchers who have suffered economic losses associated with weatherrelated yield and or quality losses this alone will not address all the disaster assistance needs of our producers for instance in oklahoma alone the damage from the summer drought and wildfires is estimated at over 1 billion however this is a step in the right direction to providing muchneeded assistance for our farmers and ranchers i rise today in strong support of this bill and ask my colleagues to join me in supporting our nations farmers and ranchers by casting their vote in favor of h r 4461"],

state and urges the president to do the same as far as the comments that were just made regarding the intentions of the sponsor or the cosponsors i am glad that the gentleman did not question the motives of this cosponsor since it would implicate over 280 members of the house and 98 senators in the senate who voted for this resolution who believe that this is an idea whose time has come who believe that rather than spout rhetoric it is time to be ahead of the curve and make sure that the palestinian authority understand that our intentions are clear so that we can avert bloodshed the consensus on the need for this resolution is clear as i mentioned over 200 members of the house have cosponsored h con res 24 i worked diligently with democrats as well on this bill i believe that the gentleman from new york the gentleman from california the gentleman from new jersey the gentleman from new york the gentleman from california and some of my other friends on the other side of the aisle can attest to this language that criticized the administration was removed even though we all know that the administration had the administration reacted sooner against the possibility of a unilaterally declared palestinian state chairman arafat would probably not be meeting with president clinton this week to discuss the matter there is also no reference in the resolution about the first ladys damaging comments on the subject which may have encouraged a belief with many in the palestinian authority that the unitedstates might support and recognize such a unilaterally declared state we must act now the palestinian authority plans to unilaterally declare parts of israel including jerusalem as their own state as early as may 4 of this year the target date the oslo accords set for a permanent accord to be reached doing so would obliterate oslo and would mark a repudiation of the commitment of chairman arafat to negotiate all permanent status issues at the start of the oslo process 4 days before the famous september 13 1993 white house lawn ceremony that publicly launched the peace process chairman arafat wrote a letter to then israeli prime minister yitzhak rabin in which he pledged that the plo commits itself to the middle east peace process and to a peaceful resolution of the conflict between the two states and declares that all outstanding issues relating to permanent status will be resolved through negotiations clearly if arafat plans to declare as his own land land that belongs to another country outside of the oslo process then he is inviting war upon the region the president himself has suggested that such a move would be catastrophic and assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs martin indyk warned in october of dire bonsequences of unilateral declaration of independence in the process of the palestinians seeking to assert the sovereignty of their socalled independent state and the israelis seeking to deny it a clash would seem inevitable i can see a movement from a kind of declaration of independence to a war of independence that would be the absolute antithesis of the peace process arafat has been planning for many months now to declare unilaterally a palestinian state and reject the oslo process in late february arafat said we assure the whole world that the establishment of the independent state of palestine with holy jerusalem as its capital is a sacred and legitimate right of the palestinian people it is a goal that our people will not accept to advocate or to give up no matter what the difficulties and the challenges other palestinian leaders have been echoing arafats announcements as recently as sunday this last sunday a senior adviser to chairman arafat said quote the palestinian position is still that may 4 is the fixed date op declaring statehood but he also added that the palestinian leadership will study all proposals and ideas another key palestinian official said in late february that we are moving forward in our preparations for the day may 4 the date of declaration of palestinian state more specifically on september 24 chairman arafats cabinet announced that at the end of the interim period the palestinian authorities shall declare the establishment of the palestinian state on all palestinian land occupied since 1967 which jerusalem is the eternal capital of the palestinian state the provocative statements by arafat and his ministers show that his intentions are real and imminent however arafat knows that he cannot simply choose to declare another countrys land as his own so he has been trying to gain the support of other countries arafat has already visited with leaders of several other countries including muammar kadafi the terrorist leader of libya in his worldwide tour to gain acceptance arafats courting of kadafi should in itself make clear to the unitedstates policymakers that a unilaterallydeclared palestinian state could result in the development of an alliance that is detrimental to the unitedstates interests let us also remember that arafat supported saddam hussein during the gulf war and many palestinian citizens took to the streets a few months ago to burn american flags in protest of americas bombing campaign of iraqi military targets in any event on march 23 arafat will be visiting president clinton to press the united states to support his move and the united states must not succumb to his tactics when president clinton and the administration confront arafat on this issue they must be firm that the united states will never recognize a unilaterallydeclared palestinian state this is timely i hope that we can receive cooperation the bulk of the people in this body republican and democrat support this measure let us move forth in a good faith effort of bipartisanship to get this done"], [0.50090491771698, 0.50090491771698, 0, "tomorrow on the other side of the capitol in the senate debate begins on managed care reform legislation i would like to take my colleagues back to may 30 1996 when a small nervous woman testified before the house committee on commerce her testimony was buried in the fourth panel at the end of a long day about the abuses of managed care the reporters were gone the television cameras had packed up most of the original crowd had dispersed she should have been the first witness that day not one of the last she told about the choices that managed care companies and selfinsured plans are making every day when they determine medical necessity this woman linda peeno had been a claims reviewer for several hmos here is her story i wish to begin by making a public confession in the spring of 1987 as a physician i caused the death of a man although this was known to many people i have not been taken before any court of law or called to account for this in any professional or public forum in fact just the opposite occurred i was rewarded for this it brought me an improved reputation in my job and contributed to my advancement afterwards not only did i demonstrate i could do what was expected of me i exemplified the good company doctor i saved half a million dollars as she spoke a hush came over the room the representatives of the trade associations who were still there averted their eyes the audience shifted uncomfortably in their seats both the gripped and alarmed by her story her voice became husky and i could see tears in her eyes her anguish over harming patients as a managed care reviewer had caused this woman to come forth and bear her soul she continued since that day i have lived with this act and many others eating into my heart and soul for me a physician isa professional charged with the care or healing of his or her fellow human beings the primary ethical norm is do no harm i did worse i caused death she went on instead of using a clumsy bloody weapon i used the simplest cleanest of tools my words this man died because i denied him a necessary operation to save his heart i felt little pain or remorse at the time the mans faceless distance soothed my conscience like a skilled soldier i was trained for this moment when any moral qualms arose i was to remember i am not denying care i am only denying payment by this time the trade association representatives were staring at the floor the congressmen who had spoken on behalf of the hmos were distinctly uncomfortable and the staff several of whom subsequently became representatives of hmo trade organizations were thanking god that this witness came at the end of the day dr peenos testimony continued at the time this helped me avoid any sense of responsibility for my decision now i am no longer willing to accept the escapist reasoning that allowed me to rationalize this action i accept my responsibility now for this mans death as well as for the immeasurable pain and suffering many other decisions of mine caused she then listed the many ways managed care health plans deny care to patients but she emphasized one particular issue the right to decide what care is medically necessary she said there is one last activity that i think deserves j special place on this list and this is what i call the smart bomb of cost containment and that is medical necessities denials even when medical criteria is used it is rarely de veloped in any kind of standard traditional clinical process she continued it is rarely standardized across the field the criteria is rarely available for prior review by the physicians or the members of the plan we have enough experience from history to demonstrate the consequence of secretive unregulated systems that go awry after exposing her own transgressions she closed by urging everyone in the room to examine their own consciences one can only wonder how much pain suffering and death we will have before we have the courage to change our course personally i have decided even one death is too much for me the hearing room at that time was stone cold quiet the chairman mumbled thank you doctor linda peeno could have rationalized her decisions as many do oh i was just working within guidelines or i was just following orders or you know we have to save resources or this is not about treatment it is really just about benefits dr peeno refused to continue this denial and she will do penance for her sins the rest of her life by exposing the dirty little secret of hmos determining medical necessity if there is only one thing to consider before our colleagues vote on patient protection legislation i urge our colleagues to consider the following before we vote on any patient protection legislation we must keep in mind the fact that no amount of procedural protection or schemes of external review can help patients if insurers are legislatively given broad powers to determine what standards will be used to make decisions about coverage as dr peeno so poignantly observed insurers now routinely make decisions by determining what goods and services they will pay for the difference between clinical decisions about medical necessary care and decisions about insurance coverage are especially blurred and because all but the wealthy rely on insurers the power of insurers to determine coverage gives them the power to dictate professional standards of care make no mistake along with the question of health plan liability the determination of who should decide when health care is medically necessary is the key issue in patient protection legislation contrary to the claims of hmos that this is some new concept for over 200 years most private insurers and third party payers have viewed as medically necessary those products or services provided in accordance with prevailing standards of medical practice quote unquote this is the definition that i use in my own managed care reform bill the managed care reform act of 1999 and the courts have been sensitive to the fact that insurers have a conflict of interest because they stand to gain financially from denying care and have used clinicallyderived professional standards of care the courts have to reverse insurers attempts to deviate from those standards that is why it is so important that managed care reform legislation include an independent appeals panel with no financial interest in the outcome a fair review process utilizing clinical standards of care guarantees that the decision of the review board is made without regard to the financial interests of either the hmo or the physician on the other hand if the review board has to use the health plans definition of medically necessary there is no such guarantee now in response to a growing body of case law and the hmos own need to demonstrate profitability to their shareholders insurers are now writing contracts that threaten even this minimal level of consumer protection they are writing contracts in which standards of medical necessity are not only separated from standards of good practice but are also essentially not subject to review here is one example of many of a health plans definition of medically necessary services this is directly from the language of a contract from an hmo medical necessity means the shortest least expensive or least intense level of treatment care or service rendered or supply provided as determined by us the health plan contracts like this demonstrate that some health plans are manipulating the definition of medical necessity to deny appropriate patient care by arbitrarily linking it to saving money not the patients medical needs now on the surface some might say so what is wrong with the least expensive treatment well let me give my colleagues one example out of thousands i could cite before i came to congress i was a reconstructive surgeon i treated children with cleft palets a fissure on the roof of the mouth clinical standards of care would determine that the best treatment is surgical correction but under this hmos definition the one that says shortest least expensive the plan could limit coverage to a piece of plastic to fill the hole in the roof of that patients mouth after all that plastic obturator would be cheaper however instead of condemning children to a lifetime of using a messy prosthesis the proper treatment reconstruction using the childs own tissue would give that child the best chance at normal speech and a normal life and let me warn my colleagues paradoxically insurers stand to benefit from misguided legislative changes that can displace case law last year legislation passed this house and the gop bill in the senate would have granted insurers the explicit power to define medical necessity without regard to current standards of medical practice this would have been accomplished by allowing them to classify as medically unnecessary any procedures not specifically found to be necessary by the insurers own technical review panel the senate bill also would have given insurers the power to determine what evidence would be relevant in evaluating claims for coverage and would have permitted insurers to classify some coverage decisions as exempt from administrative review i know that many of our colleagues who supported those bills last year had no idea of the implication of the medical necessity provisions in them that is why i hope my friends in both the house and the senateare listening as i said tomorrow the senate starts to address this issue specifically insurers now want to move away from clinical standards of care applied to particular patients to standards linking medical necessity to what are called population studies on the surface this may seem to be scientific and rational however as a physician who is a former medical reviewer myself and who worked with many insurers large and small let me explain why i think it is critical that we stick with medical necessity as defined by clinical standard of care first sole reliance on broad standards from generalized evidence is not good medical practice i will explain these second there are practical limits to designing studies that can answer all clinical questions third most studies are not of sufficient scientific quality to justify overruling clinical judgment let me explain these points and i also recommend an article on this by rosenbaum in the january 21 1999 edition of the new england journal of medicine first while it may seem counterintuitive it is not good medicine to solely use what are called outcomesbased studies of medical necessity even when the science is rigorous let me explain why the reason is because the choice of the outcome is inherently value laden the medical reviewer for the hmo is likely as shown by the abovementioned contract to consider cost the essential value what about quality asa surgeon i treated many patients with broken fingers merely by reducing the fracture and splinting the finger and for most patients this inexpensive treatment would restore adequate function what about the musician the piano player who needs a better range of motion for that patient surgery might be necessary which outcome should be the basis for the decision about insurance coverage playing the piano or routine functioning my point is this taking care of patients requires a lot of variation and a lot of individualization definitions of medical necessity have to be flexible enough to take into account the needs of each patient onesizefitsall outcomes make irrelevant the doctors knowledge of the individual patient and is bad medicine period second there are practical limitations on basing medical necessity on what is called generalized evidence particularly as applied by hmos much of medicine is a result of collective experience and many basic medical treatments have not been studied rigorously furthermore aside from a handful of procedures that are not explicitly covered most care is not specifically defined in health plans because the number of procedures and the circumstances of their application is limitless in addition by their very nature many controlled clinical trials study treatments in isolation whereas physicians need to know the benefits of one type of treatment over another when they are taking care of an individual patient prospective randomized comparison studies on the other hand are very expensive given the enormous number of procedures and individual circumstances if coverage is limited to only those that have scientifically sound generalized outcomes care could be denied for almost all conditions come to think of it maybe that is why lmos are so keen to get away from prevailing standards of care third the validity of hmo guidelines and how they are used is open to question medical directors of hmos were asked to rank the sources of information they used to make medical decisions industry guidelines generated by the trade associations representing health plans were ranked ahead of information from national experts government documents and nih consensus conferences the most highly respected source medical journals was used less than 60 percent of the time industry guidelines are frequently written by a firm by the name of milliman and robertson a strategy shop for the hmo industry this is the same firm that championed drivethrough deliveries and outpatient mastectomies many times these practice guidelines are not grounded in science but are cookbook recipes derived by actuaries to reduce health care costs here are two examples of the errors of their guidelines in reference to outpatient mastectomies a national cancer institute study released in june found that women receiving outpatient mastectomies face significantly higher risks of being rehospitalized and have a higher risk of surgeryrelated complications like infections and blood clots in regard to drivethrough deliveries in 1997 a study published in the journal of the american medical association showed that babies discharged within a day of birth faced increase risk of developing jaundice dehydration and dangerous infections objectivity of medical decisionmaking requires that the results of studies be open to peer review yet much of the decisionmaking by hmos is based on unpublished proprietary and unexamined methods and data such secret and potentially biased guidelines simply cannot be called scientific this is not to say that outcomesbased studies do not make up a part of how clinical standards of care are determined they do but we are all familiar with the ephemeral nature of new scientific studies such as those on the supposed dangers of alar remember the apple scare a few years ago clinical standard of care the standard that we should use for medical necessity does take into account valid and replicable studies in the peerreviewed literature as well as the results of professional consensus conferences practice guidelines based on governmentfunded studies and guidelines prepared by insurers that have been determined to have beeri free of conflict of interest but most importantly they also include the patients individual health and medical information and the clinical judgment of the treating physician congress should pass legislation defining this standard of medical necessity because one the employee retirement income security act erisa shields plans from the consequences of most decisions about medical necessity two under erisa patients generally can only recover the value of the benefits denied three even this limited remedy is being eroded by insurance contracts that give insurers theauthority to make decisions about medical necessity based on questionable evidence to ensure these protections congress must provide patients with a speedy external review of all coverage decisions not merely those that insurers decide are subject to review it is time for congress to defuse the smart bomb of hmos the issues of managed care reform should go from the drawing board to the signing ceremony this year last year i joined with the gentleman from michigan and offeredthe patients bill of rights as an amendment on the house floor while i regret that it did not pass there may have been at least one good thing about that in the last few weeks many hmos have announced double digit premium increases we can be sure that if the patients bill of rights had passed there would be a whole lot of hmo fingers pointing at congress blaming us now for those skyrocketing premiums which are really due to hmo mismanagement i think it is important to remember why it is so important that congress should pass hmo reform legislation i will bet that every one of our colleagues has heard from constituents describing their own hmo horror story we have all seen headlines like hmos rules leave her dying for the doc she needs or exnew yorker is told get castrated so we can save dollars or how about this headline what his parents did not know about hmos may have killed this baby consider the 29yearold cancer patient whose hmo would not pay for his treatments the hmo case manager told him instead to hold a fundraiser a fundraiser well we just had an hour of debate about campaign fundraising i certainly hope that campaign finance reform will not stymie that mans chance to get his cancer treatment during congressional hearings 2 years ago we heard testimony from alan demeurers who lost his wife christy to breast cancer when a specialist at ucla recommended she undergo bone marrow transplant surgery her hmo leaned on ucla to change its medical opinion who knows whether kristi would be with her two children today had her hmo not interfered with her doctor patient relationship other plans have placed ridiculous burdens on those seeking emergency care ask jacqueline lee how bad that can be this 28yearold lady was hiking in the mountains just west of washington d c in the shenandoah mountains when she fell off a 40foot cliff she fractured her skull her arm her pelvis she was comatose lying at the bottom of this 40foot cliff fortunately her hiking companion had a cellular phone and she was airlifted to a local hospital and she was treated in the icu for a month on morphine drips now one will not believe this her hmo refused to pay for the services because she failed to get preauthorization i ask what was she supposed to do with her fractured skull her broken arm her broken pelvis lying at the base of the cliff maybe wake up from her coma with her nonbroken arm pull a cellular phone out of her pocket dial a 1800 phone number and say hey i just fell off a 40foot cliff i need to go to the hospital there are countless other examples a pediatrician who worked in this area took care of a pediatric icu she told me about how a few years ago a 6yearold boy came into her icu after drowning prognosis was terrible the little boy had been in the unit about 5 hours they had him intubated they had the drips running doctors and nurses and family were standing around the bed praying for a sign of life when the phone rings it is a medical manager from the hmo well tell me about this littleboy well he nearly drowned the prognosis is not very good now one can almost picture the computer screen and the algorithm from this medical manager a thousand miles away ventilator patient poor prognosis well came the next question have you considered sending this little boy home on home ventilation after all it is cheaper think about that does not that just about make the hair stand up on the back of your head that is what we are dealing with because our friends and our neighbors and our fellow workers and our own families have had these types of experiences countless polls show that people want congress to pass managed care reform a recent kaiser family foundation survey found that 78 percent of voters support managed care reform and a similar percentage support allowing consumers to go to court to sue their health plans when those health plans are negligent no public opinion poll however conveys the depth of emotion on this issue as well as movie audiences around the country who spontaneously clapped and cheered helen hunt when she gave an obscenitylaced evaluation and description of her hmo in the oscarwinning movie as good as it gets audiences across the country responded to the plight of her little boy with asthma because they see the same thing happening to their friends their neighbors and their family members the industry responds by saying christy demeurers jacqueline lee this little boy who has just drowned they are just anecdotes we do not legislate because of anecdotes well to paraphrase shakespeare hath not these anecdotes these hmo victims eyes hath not these anecdotes hands organs dimensions senses affections passions if you prick the anecdotes do they not bleed and if you cut short their care for profits do those anecdotes not die i hope we never hear that word anecdote when we debate this issue on the floor this year last year i and a few other brave souls crossed party lines to push for passage of the patients bill of rights it was a good bill and it would have done a great deal to end the constant stream of hmo horror stories it contained for example very strong language ensuring that health plans pay for emergency care consider the plight of james adams aged 6 months old at 3 30 in the morning his mother lamona found him hot panting and moaning his temperature was 104 degrees lamona phoned her hmo and was told to take little jimmy to the scottish rite medical center quote that is the only hospital i can send you to the hmo reviewer added how do i get there lamona asked i dont know the nurse said i am not good at directions well it turns out that scottish rite hospital was about 70some miles away so at 3 30 in the morning lamona and her husband wrap up little jimmy put him in the car picture this it is a stormy night they start their drive to the hospital 20 miles into their ride they passed emory university hospital a renowned pediatric center nearby were two more of atlantas leading hospitals georgia baptist and grady memorial but the adams did not have permission to stop there and so they pushed on they had farther to go to get to scottish rite hospital while searching for the hospital james heart stopped there is a scene in the movie that is out now a civil action showing a mother and a father in a car on the side of the road on a stormy night administering cpr to their child think of jimmy adams when you see that movie well lamona and her husband eventually got jimmy to scottish rite it looked like the boy would die but he was a tough little guy and despite his cardiac arrest due to delay in treatment by his hmo he survived however the doctors had to amputate both of his hands and both his feet because of the gangrene that resulted from his cardiac arrest all of this is documented in the book health against wealth and as the details of baby james hmos methods were emerged it became clear that the margins of safety in that limo were razor thin maybe as thin as the scalpel that had to amputate both this little boys hands and both of his feet for the rest of his life this little boy will never be able to play basketball i talked to his mother last week he has learned how to put on his leg prostheses without his bilateral hooks but he cannot get on his bilateral hooks unless he has help from his mom he will never be able to touch and caress the cheek of the woman that he loves some day think of the dilemma an hmo places on a mother struggling to make ends meet in lamonas situation if she rushes her child to the nearest emergency room she could be at risk for hundreds or even thousands of dollars because she was not given authorization it was not medically necessary to go to that nonprovider hospital or she could hope that her childs condition will not worsen as they drive past one hospital after another an additional 20 miles to get to the nearest emergency room affiliated with their plan madam speaker a strong limo reform bill would ensure that consumers would not have to make that potentially disastrous choice now in recognition of problems in managed care three managed care plans joined with families usa and other consumer groups in 1997 to announce their support of an 18point agenda here is a sample of the issues that the groups felt required nationally enforceable standards guaranteeing access to appropriate services providing people with a choice of health plans ensuring the confidentiality of medical records protecting the continuity of care providing consumers with relevant information covering emergency care and banning gag rules these health plans and consumer groups wrote together we are seeking to address problems that have led to a decline in consumer confidence and trust in health plans we believe that thoughtfully designed health plan standards will help to restore confidence and ensure needed protection after listening to some of these examples of the victims of managed care i would certainly agree with them that we need some federal standards to correct the abuses and from the viewpoint of the plans they certainly have a public relations disaster these plans said that they noted that they already make extensive efforts to improve the quality of care and the chief executive officer of the one plan said quote we intend to insist on even higher standards of behavior within our industry and we are more than willing to see laws enacted to ensure that result let me repeat that the chief executive officer of one of these nonprofit plans said we are more than willing to see laws enacted to ensure that result however i am sad to say that despite strong public support to correct problems like these and the support of some responsible managed care plans legislation stalled in washington last year that is truly unfortunate since the problem demands federal action while historically state insurance commissions have done an excellent job of monitoring the performance of health plans federal law puts most hmos beyond the reach of state regulations now how is this possible well more than two decades ago congress passed the employee retirement income security act as i have said before this is called erisa it did this to provide some uniformity for pension plans in dealing with different state laws health plans were included in erisa almost as an afterthought but the result has been a gaping regulatory loophole for selfinsured plans under erisa even more alarming is the fact that this lack of effective regulation is coupled with an immunity from liability for negligent actions now personal responsibility has been a watchword for this republican congress and this issue should be no different healthplans that recklessly deny needed medical service should be made to answer for their conduct laws that shield entities from their responsibility only encourage them to cut corners congress created this erisa loophole and congress should fix it now many of the opponents to this legislation say well we will end up if we pass this with nationalized health insurance it is always the big bogeyman nationalized health insurance but i ask my colleagues think for a moment about buying a car federal laws ensure that cars have horns and brakes and headlights and seatbelts they also ensure that they do not pollute yet despite these minimum standards we do not have a nationalized auto industry instead consumers have lots of choices but they know that whatever car they buy will meet certain minimum safety standards one does not buy safety a la carte the same notion of basic protections and standards should apply to health plans consumer protections will not lead to socialized medicine any more than requiring seatbelts has led to a nationalized auto industry in a free market these minimum standards set a level playing field that allows competition to flourish before closing let me share some thoughts on how i think this issue will evolve in the coming months as we know we came close to passing the patients bill of rights last year in part because i and some other republicans crossed party lines to support the better bill already i see signs this year that the fight could break out the same way we simply cannot let the issue of managed care reform die on the cross of partisanship so i decided not to cosponsor the patients bill of rights when it was introduced earlier this year instead i introduced my own bill the managed care reform act of 1999 h r 719 while my bill shares the best features of other leading managed care reform proposals it also eliminates some provisions that would add regulatory burdens on health plans without providing much in the way of added patient safety in addition the bill has a new formulation on the issue of health plan liability i continue to believe that health plans which make negligent medical decisions should be accountable for their actions but a winning lawsuit is little consolation to a family who has lost a loved one the best hmo bill ensures that health care is delivered when it is needed and i also believe that the liability should attach to the entity that is making medical decisions many ielfinsured companies contract with large managed care plans to deliver care if the business is not making discretionary decisions they should not face liability this is true of folks like thirdparty administrators if they merely perform administrative functions but if they cross the line and determine whether a particular treatment is medically necessary remember this brings us back to the medical necessity issue that i started this speech about if they cross that line in a given case then they are making medical decisions and they should be responsible for their actions to encourage health plans to give patients the right care without having to go to court my bill provides for both an internal and an external appeals process but unlike last years republican bill the external review is binding on the plan it could be requested by either the patient or the health plan the review would be done by an independent panel of medical experts frequently patients pursuing cases through appeal win they win their treatment but many times also the plans decision is proven to be the right one my bill provides that if the plan follows the definition of the external review panel there could not be punitive damages liability on either the health plan or the business after all there cannot be any malice if they have bound themselves to the decision of an independent panel of experts i suspect aetna wishes they had had an independent peer panel available even with the binding decision on care when it denied care to david goodrich earlier this year a california jury handed down a verdict with 116 million in punitive damages to teresa goodrich his widow if aetna or the goodriches had had the ability to send the denial of care to an external review with a binding decision on the plan where that independent panel has the authority to determine clinical standards of care as medical necessity then they could have avoided the courtroom but more importantly david goodrich might be alive today that is why my plan should be attractive to both sides consumers get a reliable and quick external appeals process that will help them get the care that they need they can go to court to collect economic damages like lost wages and future medical care and noneconomic damages like pain and suffering if the plan fails to follow the external reviews decision the patient can sue for punitive damages but if it has gone in a timely fashion through the review process to that independent panel for a binding decision on the plan that plan then knows that it has no punitive damages liability that is the big unknown to an insurance company that eliminates for them the risk of a 50 million or 100 million punitive damages award but they have to follow the recommendations of that independent review panel i have heard from insurers that they fear that this legislation will cause premiums to increase i think there is ample evidence that this would not be the case last year the congressional budget office estimated that a similar proposal which did not include punitive damages relief would only increase premiums around 2 percent over 10 years when texas passed its own liability law 2 years ago scott and white health plan estimated that premiums would have to increase just 34 cents per member per month to cover the cost these are hardly alarming figures the low estimate by scott and white seems accurate since only one suit has been filed against a texas health plan since texas passed legislation similar to this that is far from the flood of litigation that opponents predicted i have been encouraged by the positive response my bill has received i think this could be the basis for a bipartisan bill this year in fact i spoke with the ceo of a large blue cross plan who confided to me that his organization is already implementing virtually all of the recommendations of the presidents health care quality advisory commission for little or no cost one part of the health care debate that concerns him is the issue of liability he has indicated that shielding plans from punitive damages when they follow an external review body would strike an appropriate balance passage of real patient protection legislation is going to require a lot of hard work dedication and some compromise my new bill represents an effort to break through this partisan gridlock and move this issue forward i hope to work with all my colleagues to help break the logjam keeping patient protection legislation from becoming law this issue is vitally important to families acrossthis country to my fellow legislators please do not let the insurers define medically necessary or someday my colleagues or a family member or a friend will find themselves defined out of a treatment that is a clinical standard of care that could save their life or the life of somebody else"],

under the rule of josip broz tito the death of tito and the ensuing breakdown of the communist world led to the partitioning of the yugoslav federation into semiautonomous states the partitioning of the federation led to increased instability and animosity between the different ethnic groups in 1987 slobodan milosevic came to power as yugoslav president the different provinces of yugoslavia had been treated as equal entities but in 1989 milosevic abolished the semiautonomous status of kosovo which is comprised of 90 ethnic albanians although albanians are the overwhelming majority the serbs consider kosovo to be an historic landmark where their ancestors attempted to fend off the assault of the ottoman empire and these conflicting interests have led to great controversy and fighting in 1991 slovenia croatia and bosnia declared independence from yugoslavia although milosevic had sought to protect the serb influence in those countries the serb populations were so small in slovenia and croatia that it was not feasible to fight for political control milosevic was however a major instigator of the allout war for control of bosnia where there was a very large serbian population a peace agreement to end the bosnian war was signed by the warring parties in late 1995 the conflict over kosovo has continued to heighten when milosevic revoked its autonomy many kosovars said they would settle for nothing less than complete independence and since 1995 the kosovo liberation army kla and serb policemen have been fighting for political control milosevics desire to maintain the integrity of the yugoslavian territory and the historical value of kosovo coupled with the kosovar albanians drive for independence has evolved into todays conflict aggression has continued to escalate and after failed attempts at a diplomatic resolution nato air strikes began on march 24 1999 the air strikes however have neither prevented nor hindered milosevics violent reign indications are in fact that violence has accelerated since the air strikes began while humanitarian issues are of grave concem the effectiveness of the nato air strikes remains questionable having recently traveled to tirana albania and skopje macedonia i have witnessed firsthand the humanitarian crisis facing europe i have also participated in extensive briefings on the crisis by supreme allied commandereurope saceur general wesley clark there is no question that the situation on the balkan peninsula is grim the question that remains is what the united states and its european partners in nato should do to end the violence and help rebuild the lives of hundreds of thousands of kosovar ablanians that have been driven from their homes slobodan milosevic is a shrewd and experienced military commander who has used military power to expel the kosovar albanian rebels the kosovar liberation army or kla from kosovo and to put extensive defenses in place in kosovo significantly enhancing his military position on the ground president clinton and the other 18 nato leaders have on the other hand allowed political considerations to govern military decisions in the air campaign in spite of the campaign ethnic cleansing has accelerated and the fry military has now fortified its southern defenses presenting a greater threat to a potential invasion force today than was present when nato bombing began because nato air strikes have little chance of accomplishing their stated goals and because the human and economic costs of launching a ground campaign far outstrip the potential benefits of such an action i believe that the nato air campaigns must stop immediately it is time for nato to seek a negotiated settlement that will allow the kosovar albanians to begin to rebuild their lives i have represented the views of many of my constituents throughout this crisis and have exercised my conscience and judgment in doing everything possible to end the balkan conflict i voted against sending ground troops to the area i voted against continuation of air strikes i voted to withdraw our troops and i voted to prohibit the president from sending ground troops without the express authorization of congress however despite the clear messages of opposition form the unitedstates house of representatives the war continues now only two people can stop it president clinton or yugoslav president slobodan milosevic congress has no means of direct recourse against milosevic so we are left to deal with the other leader our commander in chief who has chosen to continue the engagement i believe the presidents actions are dangerous to this country he has placed our men and women in harms way yet continues to oppose providing the resources to support them he has yet to recognize the ramifications of his drastic downsizing of our military but his deployment in the balkans has exposed the critical nature of the situation the armed forces ability to prevail in two major theaters of conflict in a reasonable amount of time and with minimum casualties has long been the acceptable level of defense the president has created a third combat theater of contingency operations which the military is not prepared to handle it has bee6 reported the unitedstates army conducted 10 operational events from 19601991 31 years since 1991 the army has conducted 26 operational events at the same time the president has drastically reduced our military capabilities since 1987 active duty military personnel have been reduced by more than 800 000 in 1992 there were 18 army divisions today there are 10 in 1992 there were 24 fighter wings today there are 13 in 1992 there were 546 navy ships today there are less than 330 on recent inspection of one base lemoore naval air station in california it was found that 43 of the hornet strike fighters were not flyable due to a lack of parts the squadrons had 61 fewer jet engines than needed to keep all their aircraft flying in order to carry out

applaud the sections of the bill providing increased flexibility to states to ensure that child support payments go to benefit children rather than government bureaucrats other provisions of h r 4678 present grave dangers to individual liberty privacy constitutional government and the sanctity of the american family i am particularly disturbed by the language expanding the use of the national directory of new hires popularly known as the new hires database in order to more effectively administer the unemployment compensation system and deny visas and residency to noncitizens who are delinquent in child support payments identifying persons who are failing to fulfill their legal obligation to pay child support is a worthy goal as an obgyn who has delivered over four thousand babies in my over thirty year medical career words cannot express the contempt i hold for those who would refuse to support their children similarly preventing fraud in the unemployment program is obviously important to the nations employers and employees whose taxes finance the unemployment insurance system however much i share the goals meant to be accomplished by the expanded uses of the database i must remind my colleagues that the road to serfdom like the road to hell is paved with noble purposes and good intentions expanding the use of the new hires database brings us closer to the day when the database is a universal tracking system allowing government officials easy access to every individuals employment and credit history providing the government with that level of power to track citizens is to invite abuse of individual liberties the threat of the expansion of the new hires database is magnified by the fact that it uses on the social security number which has become for all intents and purposes a de facto national id number in addition to threatening liberty forcing americans to divulge their uniform identifier for inclusion in a database also facilitates the horrendous crime of identity theft in order to protect american citizens from both private and public criminals i have introduced legislation h r 220 restricting the use of the social security number to purposes related to social security administration so that the govemment cannot establish databases linked by a common identifier i would also remind my colleagues that the federal govemment has no constitutional authority to be involved in the collection of child support much less invade the privacy of every citizen in order to ferret out a few wrongdoers constitutionally there are only three federal crimes treason counterfeiting and piracy on the high seas for congress to authorize federal involvement in any other law enforcement issue is a violation on the limits on congressional power contained in article 1 section 8 and the 10th amendment of the united states constitution no less an authority than chief justice william renhquist has stated that congress is creating too many federal laws and infringing on the proper police powers of the states in a free society constitutional limits on government power and the liberty of citizens must never be sacrificed to increase the efficiency of any government program no matter how noble the programs goal again i ask my colleagues to keep in mind that the dangerous road toward the loss of liberty begins when members of congress put other goals ahead of our oath to preserve the constitution and protect the liberty of our constituents while the expanded use of the new hires database provides sufficient justification for constitutionalists to oppose this bill h r 4678 also must be opposed as it furthers the intrusion of the federal government into family life through the use of federal funds to support fatherhood programs the federal government is neither constitutionally authorized nor institutionally competent to promote responsible fatherhood in fact by leveling taxes on responsible parents to provide special programs for irresponsible parents the federal government is punishing responsible fathers federal programs promoting responsible fatherhood are another example of how the unintended consequences of government interventions are used to justify further expansions of state power after all it was the federal welfare state which undermined the traditional family as well as the ethic of selfresponsibility so vital to maintaining a free society in particular the welfare state has promoted the belief that the government re taxpayer has the primary responsibility for childrearing not the parents when a large number of citizens view parenting as proper function of the central state it is inevitable that there will be an increase in those who fail to fulfill their obligations as parents without the destructive effects of the welfare state there would be little need for federal programs to promote responsible fatherhood instead of furthering federal involvement in the family congress should stop pumping the narcotic of welfare into americas communities by defunding federal bureaucracies and returning responsibility for providing assistance to those institutions best able to provide help without fostering an ethic of irresponsibility and dependancy private charities and churches certain of my colleagues will say that this bill does promote effective charity through expansion of the charitable choice program where taxpayer funds are provided to faithbased institutions in order to administer certain welfare programs while i have no doubt that churches are better able to foster strong families than federal bureaucrats i am concerned that providing taxpayer funding for religious institutions will force the institutions to waterdown their messagethus weakening the very feature that makes these institutions effective in the first place furthermore providing taxpayers dollars to secular institutions violates the rights of taxpayers not to be forced to subsidize beliefs that may offend them as thomas jefferson said to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical in conclusion h r 4678 the child support distribution act violates the constitution by expanding the use of the new hires database thus threatening the liberty and privacy of all americans as well as by expanding the federal role in family in the misguided belief that the state can somehow promote responsible fatherhood by expanding the socalled charitable choice program this bill also violates the conscience of millions of taxpayers and runs the risk of tuming effective religious charities into agents of the welfare state it also furthers the federalization of crime control by increasing the federal role in child support despite the fact that the federal government has no constitutional authority in this area i therefore urge my colleagues to reject this bill and return

a conflict in the balkans last wednesday we debated that issue at the end of the day we had declared no policy approved no policy condemned no policy i think that is an evasion of our moral if not constitutional responsibility so today i will introduce a resolution which seeks to declare a policy with reference to that conflict and how it should be conducted as well as how the cost of it should be borne and shared among our allies and how we should deal with the question of indicted war criminals as a part of any agreement and termination of that conflict i solicit the review and hopefully the copatronage of this resolution by my colleagues the united states congress has been debating whether and to what extent our country should be involved in the confict between nato and the federal republic of yugoslavia i cannot find words strong enough to condemn the miserable performance of the congress thus far no american to date knows whether the congress of the united states approves or condemns the policy of the commander in chief our fellow citizens will not know because we as their collective national leadership have steadfastly refused to either approve or disapprove condemn or condone any policy we have done this even in the context of a solemn debate by some about our constitutional responsibility and the war powers act last week we ensured that the house of representatives would bear no responsibility for the military action against yugoslavia we declared no policy we disapproved of no policy we didnt accept the reality that our nation has led the nato alliance into a conflict by a majority vote we asserted that our commander in chief could not commit ground forceswhatever that meanswithout our specific prior approval we then by a tie vote failed to approve even the continuation of the ongoing conflict into which we had been injected by our president i cannot tell you how much i have agonized over the sorry inept and clumsy failure of those who determine our national security policy in this latest phases of the ongoing balkan crisis even the prior administration so confident during the gulf war failed to lead when it could and should have in the balkans without direction or credible leadership we have become deeply embroiled in this conflict we are without any clear delineation of the reason or importance of our being involved or of what represents a successful conclusion to the conflict we are in this conflict with an announced policy that we will not commit ground forces a position that serves our enemys interest but undermines our objectives whatever they are i submit that it is the height of irresponsibility for the congress of the united states to abdicate their responsibility to either approve or disapprove a kosovo policy if the president and his to use the most charitable reference national security team have produced a national policy disaster we should say so we should not evade the issue if the administration is correct in its assertion that the barbarism attributed to the leadership of yugoslavia demands a military response we should endorse this conclusion there are those whose political judgement tells them congress should not act on this matter because if we do we might have to assume responsibility i categorically object to any such notion our president may have failed to call upon the congress to support his policy in the balkans but the congress has a duty to speak out anyway we have a constitutional duty whether the president ask us for our approval or not perhaps the constitutional duty is higher when the president seeks to evade us and his policy is muddled last wednesday i voted no on all four resolutions regarding the conflict against the federal republic of yugoslavia i seriously considered voting no even on the rule regarding our debate because under the rule we could not make approve or disapprove any policy we trivialized the role of the congress and that is fraught with dire consequences for the future the congress of the united states makes policy and our politics ought to crystallize conflicting views of good or bad policy last week we failed in this for this reason i am offering a joint resolution regarding the conflict in the balkans the resolution is critical of how we came to the sorry choices before us but recognizes that our country is confronted with certain realities which it must confront the choice the resolution makes is to give congressional authorization to the ongoing military conflict against the regime of slobodan milosevic it does not presume to give political guidance to how the conflict is waged and bespeaks a concern only that it be waged with sound military judgement consistent with the earliest victory and least casualties most importantly it enunciates a policy and identifies goals which if correct fully justify our involvement and leadership into this conflict if not correct clearly the resolution should not be supported and should fail how dare we on a matter of such consequence stand by and declare neither war nor even any policy are not our armed forces entitled to know that their congress approves or disapproves of what they are doing on the orders of our commander in chief certainly they must hope that the elected representatives of our people will not choose to abdicate their responsibility the resolution i offer speaks to the financial burden of this conflict in the bosom of europe and asserts a policy that the costs should be fairly allocated among the entire nato alliance my resolution also asserts that any agreement that concludes this unhappy chapter in our history should exempt no one from prosecution who is or may be indicted by the appropriate judicial authority as a war criminal it is not an easy resolution it is not meant as political confrontation it nonetheless confronts all of us with the inescapable duty to declare a policy and decide whether we should be

chairman i want to respond to the gentleman from rhode island of course we should be concerned about our children i think that we are in this body but this issue that we are addressing today is to protect a woman who wants to carry a child all the way to term and to have that child and that is what we speak of in the right to choose if someone decides to have an abortion that is protected under the constitution it is not inconsistent because we might be prolife and we cannot change that and so we look at this law as an opportunity to protect the mothers right to have a child when she makes that decision surely someone that believes in the right to abort a child would concede that if a woman makes a decision to carry a child to term that that decision should be respected then the gentleman from new york previously said well why pass this law because it does not cover state law and that is where most of the assaults against women occur well obviously that is true and many of the states are addressing that but it is important that we do what we can in this body to protect women our responsibility is to look at the federal law and that is what this bill does then there are those that argue well present law is sufficient well under the present law under the federal system a perpetrator of violence against a woman can only be charged for assault and battery this brings it to another level so that if the unborn child is killed then it can be actually a homicide case the present law is not adequate there are those that argue that sentence enhancements is sufficient well it is not let me tell my colleagues about the case from arkansas that has already been referenced in arkansas we did not have a fetal protection law until the last session of the legislature where the legislature wisely adopted a law that would protect that unborn child in the event of assault upon a woman this year it came into play when shiwana pace was assaulted brutally by three assailants who were hired by the father of the child the father of the child says i do not want this child to live so he hired three hit men to go and to beat that child and while they were beating the woman in the stomach they said today your child dies and the ninemonthold pregnancy was ended and the unborn child died under the old law they could only be prosecuted for assault and battery upon the woman but because arkansas adopted the fetal protection law an actual murder case was able to be lodged by the prosecutor to protect the woman and to really reflect the loss that she suffered because she wanted to have that child the old law was not sufficient sentence enhancement was not sufficient it was arkansas new law that really brought thecriminal justice system to bear on the true loss to that woman who decided that she wanted to carry that child in her womb all the way to birth and so a federal law is needed as well to accomplish the same thing to protect the woman fully"], [0.0, 0.5, 1, "during

doing what we need to do putting more money here at home and attack the problem here with at least as much vigor considering the demonstrated failure of militarized eradication efforts to date why should we believe that investing more money in this type of plan will achieve a different result according to the general accounting office despite unitedstates expenditures of 625 million in

that this amount of money this effort is going to do anything to seriously reduce the supply according to the united nations profits from illicit drugs are so high that threefourths of all drug

the delays and the shuttle managers tell me that as we go back up to eight and nine flights a year as is hoped as the space station program gets back on track that they may need to actually go out and hire additional people to keep the program flying safely so i believe that to me it was really an insult to the working men and women out at kennedy space center for the agency to be laying off hundreds of people on one day and then finding tens of millions of dollars to fulfill a vision for the vice president i have a chart over there that i would like to show later that clearly spells out that we can right now using current technology produce ap image of the earth using existing satellite images and this program was just not necessary and therefore i would encourage all my colleagues to support not funding it"], [1.1920928955078125e-07, 0.49999988079071045, 0, "i know you know that this house is very attuned to the ongoing debate over reining in the abuses of the managed care industry in general but today i would like to bring attention to a more specific injustice one that is not addressed by the managed care reform legislation under consideration by the housesenate conferees committee before this session is out we need to pass legislation that will address the worst hmo in the country our military health care system as is the case with all managed care abuses our military system is failing to deliver the benefits for which its beneficiaries have paid these patients were promised fully funded health care for life in exchange for 20 years of military service that is a defined benefit just like those benefits defined in civilianmanaged care plans you pay the premium and you should receive the benefit our military retirees paid for their benefit with 2 decades of service in return they were guaranteed that they would not have to pay out of pocket for health care by having access to military health care facilities or supplemental insurance champus that would pay the bills at civilian hospitals if military facilities were not available that is the coverage that sergeant first class john nation and his wife barbara of southport north carolina thought they had after john served 21 years in the army that service included two tours in vietnam with the artillery sergeant nation was certified by the veterans administration as suffering cancer from exposure to agent orange during that war here is the benefit that sergeant nation received because there was not an army or va hospital within 21 2 hours of their home they had to seek civilian treatment because barbara had private health insurance through her job at carolina power light champus refused to accept primary responsibility for johns treatment when champus received the portion of johns bills not covered by the private insurance they still refused to pay for the vast majority of the care they told barbara his wife that the charges exceeded their rate schedule so they were not obligated to pay anything on bills that were within their rate schedule champus rejected the majority of chemotherapy radiation and hospital charges on technical grounds john passed away barbara was forced to surrender her entire retirement savings to pay the bills rejected by champus now i ask every member of this house is this fully funded health care for life as promised does the treatment that sergeant first class john nation received from the unitedstates government qualify as having provided the benefits that he and his family were promised john nation honored his part of the contract we failed to honor ours it is time we made good on our promises to the nations military retirees and i urge each and every one of you to support h r 3573 the keep our promises to americas military retirees act 260 members have now cosponsored this bill so that we may keep our word it is important that the federal government keep its word you cannot expect retention to improve in the military you cannot expect that people are going to stay in as a career when we will not keep our word to them this should be one of our top priorities because it is the right thing for the united states government to do for the men and women that risked life and limb to defend this nation"], [1.1920928955078125e-07, 0.49999988079071045, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i rise in strong support of the resolution many of us have read press accounts of children stolen from their american mothers or fathers and whisked away to a foreign country by the noncustodial parent the heartbreak of the leftbehind parent is too often compounded by the realization that the country to which the abducting parent has fled is actually helping that parent to hide the children this assistance to the abductors by countries like germany austria sweden and mexico is contrary to the letter and spirit of the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction in at least 30 cases in germany for example german judges have flouted the basic tenets of the hague convention and have allowed the fleeing par ent to continue to hide the children from their american parents and even to deny them the most minimal contact with their children germany is a signatory to the hague convention resolutions like the one we have before us and i compliment the chairman of the committee for expediting this matter and the fine work done by my colleagues particularly the gentleman from ohio and the gentleman from california and the gentleman from texas resolutions like the one we have before us today are one way that congress can send a message to these countries most of which are friends and allies of the united states that we will not be silent in the face of these tragedies make no mistake these cases are tragedies tragedies of broken families traumatized children bereft mothers and fathers who are left behind with precious little hope of ever seeing their children again these cases are sadly not rare every year it is estimated that at least 1 000 boys and girls are taken from their american parents there are as many as 10 000 cases of children wrongfully retained by their noncustodial parents currently on file the hague convention clearly states that custody disputes should be decided in the country in which the child habitually resides but time and again foreign courts have intervened and decided custody cases even though the children in question are americanborn and have spent their lives up to the point of their abduction in america in the case of joseph cooke whose story was so movingly described recently in the washington post german courts even gave the german foster parents of his children greater rights than they accorded mr cooke himself the childrens father the resolution before us urges our friends neighbors and allies to live up to their commitments in signing the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction it asks countries to enact effective implementing legislation to educate their judicial and law enforcement authorities to return abducted and wrongfullyretained children to their place of habitual residence without reaching the merits of any underlying custody dispute and to ensure parental access rights by removing obstacles to the exercise of such rights and to further educate its central authority and local law enforcement authorities on the hague convention the severity of the problem of international child abduction and the need for immediate action when a parent of an abducted child seeks their assistance this is the very least we can do to address the heartbreak of thousands of american leftbehind parents and i strongly urge its adoption i reserve the

take an important step forward in recognizing the importance of youth financial education to the future of our nations children todays global economy demands more of our young people than ever before young people are making important financial decisions long before they enter the workforce in order to make informed choices regarding personal finances our children have to have proper skills and experience to managetheir money and prepare for their future this resolution expresses the sense of congress that personal financial education plays an important role in securing our childrens future this is not just a lofty goal it is an urgent priority because survey after survey has demonstrated average high school seniors in this country lack even basic knowledge of personal financial affairs a nationwide survey conducted in 1997 by the jumpstart coalition for personal financial literacy looked at the basic financial information of 1 500 high school seniors one in five answered seven out of ten questions successfully not a passing grade for our seniors because of their lack of financial knowledge many american students run into financial trouble in college an estimated 50 to 70 percent of all college students own at least one credit card with debts ranging between 580 and 725 yesterday the washington post ran a story about a student who had to drop out of school to pay off 2 500 in credit card debt youth financial education could help prevent this situation young adults who understand the cost of credit will not fall prey to the high cost of interest rates and mounting credit card debt the crisis of course in financial literacy goes far beyond our high schools american investors lack basic knowledge of financial concepts a 1996 poll showed that fewer than one in five americans are what we call financially literate only half of all adults in this country for example understand that investment diversification actually reduces investment risk so it should come as no surprise that personal bankruptcies are at an alltime high adults in this country need to understand basic financial concepts in order to provide for their families and prepare for their retirements and we need to get the information out there starting in the school years i would hope in following up on this resolution this body would also adopt a piece of legislation that the gentleman from california and i have introduced h r 2871 the youth financial education act that bill would commit 500 000 to carry out the financial education programs in elementary and secondary schools this legislation encourages state and local education agencies to integrate financial education into existing courses such as economics or mathematics and devotes resources necessary to develop teacher training and professional development activities in personal financial education i look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to include h r 2871 in the elementary and secondary education act later this year clearly we must do a better job of preparing our children to make informed decisions about money how to use it and how to prepare for their future the question then becomes how we concentrate our efforts and i believe the answer lies in our schools with our children and their teachers and not enough to rely on the ad hoc the wonderful but

the president to focus on neighborhood crime prevention programs community policing programs and reducing school crime it also highlights national night out which is coming up on august 1 as a successful national program which exemplifies the goals of crime reduction through neighborhood and community efforts national night out is a nationwide event which combines a nationally coordinated

member the gentlewoman from new york and many other members of the committee on small business who are dedicated to providing critical services to the countless men and women who have fought to preserve and protect our nation as we approach the 4th of july holiday to celebrate this nations independence we recognize our veterans and the tremendous sacrifices and contributions they have made to this country in their honor we are here today to pass legislation that ensures veterans that once their service is complete they can continue to apply their hardworking ethics strong leadership skills and determination to succeed in small businesses currently out of a total business population of 23 2 million people 5 5 million are veterans in addition there are 104 000 disabled veterans it is estimated that veterans constitute almost a quarter of the business population today however many veterans face tremendous barriers when trying to create and grow their businesses particularly when their military service has caused them to leave their businesses specifically the obstacles facing our veterans can range from a lack of training to difficulty in securing adequate capital to launch their small business the obstacles are even greater for service disabled veterans who may have additional handicaps that prevent them from securing employment or starting their own business the veterans entrepreneurial and small business development act creates a number of new programs designed specifically to help these veterans and service disabled veterans to join the ranks of entrepreneurs i would like to commend the small business administration for creating the small business administration veterans affairs task force for entrepreneurship in july 1998 this task force examined sba programs to determine how sba might deliver services to americas veterans more effectively in october of n998 it made recommendations to sba many of which have been included in this bill the veterans entrepreneurship and small business development act designates a position onto sba of veterans business development to be the advocate for veterans and to ensure that veterans needs and concerns are represented and being addressed in addition to this new position this bill creates a public private partnership called the nati6nal veterans business development corporation to provide access to technical assistance and an advisory committee on veterans business affairs to serve as an independent source of advice for congress and the president and to increase outcome and outreach to veterans this bill also directs the sba administrator to enter into a memorandum of understanding with the service corps of retired executives called score an organization that provides advice and technical assistance to small businesses free of charge through a nationwide network of volunteers finally this bill establishes a 5 percent government procurement goal for veteranowned business and authorizes sba to make loans to selfemployed individuals or owners of small businesses who are called to active duty to assist them with potential losses and disruption caused by their return to active duty i encourage all of my colleagues when this bill comes to the floor to come together during this historic time of year and vote for legislation that provides our veterans with the opportunities they need and deserve to succeed the veterans entrepreneurship and small business development act is a comprehensive approach to ensuring that the backbone of our nation no longer shuts off but hence forward embraces and reaches out to americas service men and women"]]}
