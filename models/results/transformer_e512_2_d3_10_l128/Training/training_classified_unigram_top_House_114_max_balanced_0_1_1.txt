opportunity to really move to protect americans presently if you are on the nofly list which is not easy to get onthere has to be some very specific reason why you could be a threat to american citizens to the airplane on which you might be traveling or you might be entering this country for some nefarious reason like terrorism but if you are on the nofly list and you do happen to be in america you can go to a gun store or to perhaps any fairground where there is a gun show and you can buy a weapon virtually any gun an assault weapon a handgun a shotgun and the question arises if you are too dangerous to fly are you not too dangerous to buy a gun but under american law today you can indeed be too dangerous to fly you could be a threat to the other passengers or to a tower to an airplane but apparently you are not a threat to buy a gun in fact there are some 16 000 people a very small portion of the american citizenry that are on the nofly list since 9111 in 2001 more than 2 000 men probably women who are too dangerous to fly on the nofly list have been able to purchase guns here in the united states so lets see if we get this straight you have been designated by the department of homeland security and the various federal government agenciestsa fbi quite possibly the cia and othersas being a threat to the security and safety of america and americans and you are put on a nofly list meaning you cant get on an airplane you are not able to buy a ticket you are not able to travel and yet you find some way to go down to the local gun store in those states that do not have background checks or maybe a gun show where there are no background checks you present yourself and say oh that is a pretty goodlooking ar14 id like to have it sure you got the money i got the money here is the gun this makes no sense whatsoever somehow i think the american public gets this if you are too dangerous to fly then you are too dangerous to be able to buy a gun in america it is that simple there ought to be a law but there is no law here in the house of representatives many of us have been trying for actually several years to deal with this crazy loophole in our gun safety laws yet we have been unable to have a bill come to the house floor where 435 of us that represent all of the american citizens will have an opportunity to vote on whether we believe that if you are too dangerous to fly you are too dangerous to buy a gun so today my fellow democratic representatives and iabout 135 of us thus farhave signed what is known as a discharge petition so that a bipartisan piece of legislation introduced by representative king of new york who is a republican could be brought to the floor and all of us face the responsibility of selecting whose side do we stand on do we stand for the safety of americans and prevent people that are too dangerous to fly from being able to buy a gun or do we stand with those on the nofly list that are presumably dangerous and say oh yeah you ought to be able to buy a gun even though you are too dangerous to fly now for my american friends out there all of you voters and nonvoters dont you think it is time for your representatives 435 of us to stand before you in this house and say we agree that if you are too dangerous to fly then you are too dangerous to buy a gun and you cannot buy a gun or stand here before all the american public and say no no no if you are too dangerous to fly go ahead and buy a gun so that is what a discharge petition will do it will take our republican friends bill mr king of new york bring it to the floor and put the issue before your representatives before the representatives of the american people and cause us to make a choice for your safety or for the presumed right of a person who is too dangerous to fly to be able to buy a gun it is pretty simple stuff we will see what happens that issue is now bubbling around here on the floor today there were four motions to adjourn which is a way of disrupting the normal procedures of the housewhich are terribly abnormal to begin withand causing the attention of the membership of the house and the press from the press box or wherever they happen to be to focus on this oneoneissue whether those 16 000 or so people that are on the nofly list can also go out and buy a gun two thousand already have by the way we ought to quickly discuss this issue of well there is a constitutional issue here an issue in which these people are on a list but they have no ability to get offno not so not so when the nofly list was first put together following 9111 the issue was raised of the constitutionality of it by the american civil liberties organization it went to a federal court and the federal court said no we disagree with you we believe this is a constitutionally authorized protection of the american public and there is a procedure for an individual to petition to get off the list so this issue of constitutionality was decided some years ago by a federal court so the arguments that you will undoubtedly hear here about this being oh an infringement of the constitutional right for an individual to buy a gun no this issue has already been resolved if you are on the nofly list and you think you shouldnt be there you have got a procedure a program underway and available to you to remove yourself from the nofly list and the court said it meets constitutional muster so taking it a step further we know a lot of americans of certain classes that cannot buy a gun criminals convicted felons people that in some states have been involved in domestic violence and people that have exhibited mental health issues those people are barred in many cases from not being able to buy a gun so we would add to that category people that our law enforcement agencies have deemed to be dangerous quite possibly terrorists or abiding and assisting terrorist organizations if you cant fly we just simply say that you cant buy a gun alsopretty simple my republican colleague mr king is correct the issue is not resolved the issue will be back before us tomorrow the 9th day of december for those of us that believe that if you are too dangerous to fly you are too dangerous to buy a gun those of us that believe this to be the right policy will continue to push this issue for the safety of americans 16 000 people may not be able to buy a gun if this becomes law and that is a good thing because we know already 2 000 people that are on that nofly listactually more than 2 000have been able to buy a gun what did they do with it well maybe they went out and shot quail or maybewe pray not but we dont know do we so the issue is before us as are many many important issues but i dont think there is any issue more important than the safety of the american people we know that if somebody is thought to be dangerous then they ought not have a gun i hope that this house will see the wisdom of taking a small step and denying some 16 000 people many of whom are probably not even american citizens the opportunity to buy a gun i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.001846611499786377,

millions of americans by refusing to address the epidemic of gun violence in our communities yesterday we honored the courage that millions of americans have demonstrated throughout our history by standing up in defense of their fellow citizens but today this congress will not muster the courage to hold a vote on two proposals that are supported by roughly 90 percent of this country and that can save american lives the american people deserve to be heard they deserve a vote if the unitedstates homeland security community places a person on the fbi terrorist watch list or determines that a person is too dangerous to board an airplane then surely we can agree that person is too dangerous to buy a firearm this week the majority will introduce a bill that pretends to close this gap in our homeland security laws but in reality it would create a system in which it is both legal and likely for suspected terrorists to buy a firearm the republican measure takes no fly no buy and turns it into no fly no problem under their proposal if a known or suspected terrorist attempts to buy a weapon they will be denied that ability for a mere 3 days from the moment they attempt to purchase that firearm the following things must happen all within 72 hours to prevent that purchase the attorney general must file a petition in federal court the court must schedule a hearing the suspect must be provided actual notice and the opportunity to appear at that hearing with a lawyer the court must rule on the petition and if all those things do not occur in 3 days the suspect is legally entitled to buy a weapon not only does the republican bill set an impossible timeline it also requires the justice department to meet an extremely high burden of proof a sale would only be prevented if the court finds probable cause that the suspect has committed or will commit an act of terrorism the republican proposal is specifically designed to ensure the justice department fails and the suspect is allowed to buy a gun it is a fig leaf to cover up the republicans refusal to take any meaningful action on gun violence it is no surprise that this bill is supported by the gun lobby instead of spending our time on toothless ineffective proposals we should vote on the original no fly no buy bill that will keep guns out of the hands of suspected terrorists we are also demanding a vote on a bipartisan proposal to require that commercial gun purchases include a background check background checks for all i have yet to hear one good explanation on why this should not be the law of the land if a dangerous person cannot pass a background check at a licensed gun dealer they should not be able to avoid a background check by going to a gun show or purchasing a firearm over the internet in states that have closed loopholes in their background check laws 48 percent fewer onduty police officers are shot to deathbut my colleagues across the aisle still refuse to hold a vote 33 000 people were killed by gun violence in america last year the american people deserve more than moments of silence they deserve action to keep dangerous weapons out of the hands of dangerous people 1300 they deserve to have their voices heard they deserve to send their kids to school without fearing an assaultstyle weapon will be waiting for them but at the very least they deserve to know where each

forward to tonights special order hour congressman jeffries and i along with our colleagues from the congressional black caucus will have scholarly debate on how our democracy is in crises because of the assault on the right to vote in america as we just heard from mr jeffries and we will hear from others voting is the voice of the people the voting rights act of 1965 passed with bipartisan support established strong federal protections for the freedom to vote banning or limiting many of the discriminatory election policies and practices of the jim crow south combined with subsequent legislation such as the national voter registration act which requires state agencies to provide opportunities for voter registration the voting rights act has helped our nation make significant progress in boosting voting for african americans and other historically marginalized groups but we find ourselves today facing our first presidential election in 50 years without the full protection of the voting rights act as mr jeffries referenced in shelby the supreme court decision reversed over 50 years of progress made to expand access to the voting booth and opened a pathway to new voting laws that discriminate against african american voters as a result of shelby new voting restrictions have been put in place in 22 states 18 of them republicanled since 2010 making it harder for millions of americans to exercise their right to vote the way states have been able to reduce the voting power of minority communities and put in place new voting restrictions in an effort to make it harder for millions of americans to vote is appalling our democracy is in crisis our right to vote is under assault why would we want to make it harder for americans to vote i believe we should be making it easier for americans to have access to the ballot box but apparently some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle do not agree we need to put forth a vote on the voting rights act now new laws range from strict photo id requirements to early voting cutbacks to registration restriction among these 16 states with new voting restrictions is my home state of ohio in ohio in 2014 lawmakers cut 6 days of early voting and eliminated the golden week during which voters could register and cast a ballot all in one trip of course ohio is not alone in its efforts to make it harder for americans to vote the freedom to vote is one of americas most constitutionally guaranteed rights and it should be easily accessible to those who want to exercise it that is why i am honored this congress to serve as the deputy vice chair of the newly created congressional voting rights caucus a caucus dedicated to protecting our democracy by ensuring the fundamental right to vote is safeguarded for all americans however after a longstanding tradition of bipartisanship on voting protections house republicans now refuse to bring either bill to the floor for a vote this is unthinkable the voting rights act of 1965 has been reauthorized with bipartisan support five times congress has a duty to ensure elections are free and transparent so that all eligible voters feel comfortable and welcome i would echo president obamas february 13 2013 statement on the voting rights act and let me quote we must all do our part to make sure our godgiven rights are protected that includes one of the most fundamental right of a democracy the right to vote when any american no matter where they live or what their party are denied that right we are betraying our ideals there are 168 days until the presidential election and our democracy still has far too many missing voices particularly among those who are already at a disadvantage due to deeply rooted racial and class barriers in our society we must ensure that voter suppression is not the new normal in order to have a truly vibrant democracy the united states must take steps to ensure inclusive voting by reducing barriers to voting efforts to suppress voting turnout undermine democracy and those efforts are on the wrong side of history as i close the time is now i am calling on all people including our community and national leaders to join me in working to eliminate voter suppression and to restore what so many people fought for marched for died for that is the voting rights act human rights

have simply had enough they have had enough gun violence they have had enough moments of silence and they have had enough carnage and devastation the orlando shooting was the latest in a seemingly endless series of horrific mass shootings that have shocked us all all of which we agree in hindsight were committed by people who should not have had access to a gun the individual in orlando had committed horrible acts of violence against his exwife he exhibited such derangement and rage that he frightened classmates and coworkers he was even investigated as a potential terrorist by the fbi

have 247 votes house democrats only 188 and not every democrat might even vote for these bills with the 59member majority the republican progun position would certainly prevail or would it how many moderate republicans in swing districts might actually vote against their constituents desires or vote for their constituents desires we cited polls again and again that 85 percent of americans dont want people on the terrorist watch list to be able to buy guns and 90 percent of unitedstates citizens want to close the background check loopholes this is what political scientists call a tough vote

can be sure your democratic proponent will let all voters know this fall that you voted with the terrorists yes a tough vote do what is right and moral and sensible and just and you are in political trouble do what paul ryan and the nra want you to do and you are in political trouble this is why the republican leadership will do anything they can to keep from having a house vote on these issues

for ending hunger among children in this country and i believe no conversation could occur about hunger without having the indomitable mr mcgovern with us this evening the child nutrition reauthorization is really a critical opportunity for us to talk about the importance of improving access to healthy meals in schools and for maintaining strong nutrition standards for too many kids the only sure meals that they can count on on any given day are provided in school yet unfortunately the majority on the other side of the aisle are talking about how to make it harder for children especially lowincome children who are eligible for free and reducedprice meals breakfast and lunch to access these programs we should be using this reauthorization to address known gaps and to help children connect to these healthy meals nearly 10 000 more schools offer school lunch than offer school breakfast programs and we should be trying to expand school breakfast rather than restricting them the healthy hungerfree act in the nationwide implementation of the community eligibility program was so insightful but yet we need to do more over 162 000 kids in my state qualify for free or reduced meals for lunch and we need to reach them now what does the reauthorization that republicans are bringing before us entail what does it talk about it talks about scaling back the successful and proven community eligibility provision which we just implemented nationwide last year and really havent scaled up to what it could be this innovative program actually works we have proven it we have metrics that prove that the program increases access and participation for lowincome students and it helps to reduce administrative burdens and costs for school staff now you have heard my colleagues here talk about obesity now obesity is not just a cosmetic problem it is a major health problem we also last year put new nutrition standards in to ward off obesity ninetyseven percent97 percentof the schools have successfully met these new standards and usda has shown great eagerness to work with those who have not of course these new requirements require more servings of fruits vegetables whole grains fatfree and lowfat fluid milk in schools while cutting sodiumsaturated fats and trans fats i can tell you that when you introduce these foods to children at a young age they will start to prefer them and we can really transform their lives i want to skip over many of my comments and just add them to the record because i just want to focus on one little disease that is associated with poor nutrition and that is diabetes the burden to individuals and families is gargantuan you hear of people losing their limbs because of diabetes but i want to talk about the burden to the economy and to the budget by allowing diabetes to run amok diabetes is a budgetbusting disease it is an epidemic that is affecting an increasing number of americans including more and more of our youth right nowright nowin 2014 29 million people in the united states 9 3 percent of our population have had diabetes that is about 1 in 11 people according to the cdc by 2050 that number could be as high as 100 million or 1 in 3 persons 1900 the time to stop this is now while we are reauthorizing the child nutrition bill we can help our children develop healthy eating habits i have seen kids love avocados love grapes and love these things that are introduced to them while they are young our investment in school lunch and school breakfast pales in comparison to the cost of treating diabetes in 2012 diabetes and its related complications accounted for 245 billion in total costs now that is 176 billion in direct medical coststhink medicaid and medicareand lost wages and work the cdc estimates that the growth in theseif their predictions hold if we dont do something just think this will go from 1 in 11 people having diabetes to 1 in 3 so we are looking at 20502050 i dont think i am going to be around in 2050this is clearly a clarion call to feed our children properly now in the school year 2016 we spent 12 5 billion on the school lunch program and 4 3 billion on the school breakfast program compare that with the 245 billion that we have spent on diabetes for just 1 year with that i will add the rest of my comments to the record i would just say mr scott and that school breakfast school lunch and wic it is a doggone good deal when you think about it child nutrition reauthorization is a critical time for us to talk about the importance of improving access to healthy foods in schools and for maintaining strong nutrition standards for too many kids the only sure meals they can count on on a given day are the ones provided in school yet my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are talking about how to make it harder for children especially lowincome children who are eligible for free and reduced price meals to access these programs the draft republican child nutrition reauthorization bill is an assault on the programs that help to ensure that our children and get the nutrition they need to be active and engaged learners a growling stomach does not advance educational achievement they want to roll back programs that have been proven to help eligible children get access to school breakfast and school lunch programs it is reportedly titled the improving child nutrition and education act of 2016 but it really should be the increasing child hunger and hobbling education act we should be using child nutrition reauthorization to address know gaps and help connect more children to healthy meals nearly 10 000 more schools offer school lunch than offer a school breakfast program participation in school breakfast programs though improving since the enactment of the healthy hunger free act and the nationwide implementation of cep still lags drastically behind participation in the school lunch program only about half of students who eat school lunch nationwide eat a school breakfast my state of wisconsin is at the bottom when it comes to the number of schools that participate in school breakfast nationwide over 162 000 kids that qualify for free or reduced meals are eating lunch but miss breakfast and wisconsin loses 22 million federal breakfast reimbursement dollars annually we need to be discussing how to help the states and schools do better we just passed the every student succeeds act last year reauthorizing federal elementary and secondary education policy let me tell you no child can succeed when theyre hungry any teacher can tell you that so can a range of experts who have conducted studies on this issue and found overwhelmingly that hunger does not promote academic achievement so what are republicans talking about doing in this reauthorization scaling back the successful and proven community eligiblity provision cep which just went into effect nationwide last year this is an innovative program authorized in 2010 that makes it easier for high need schools and school districts to serve free meals to all students by eliminating traditional free reduced priced applications with all the rhetoric about wasteful government spending and duplicative programs what happens when we have successful and proven federal programs and policies that work like cep like snap republicans want to cut them and roll them back this program has been proveni emphasize that word againto increase access and participation in the school meals programs for the lowincome students while helping to reduce administrative burdens and costs for school staff school meal programs benefit from the economics of scale the more kids who participate the cheaper it is to serve each child thousands of schools have adopted cep and are seeing benefits including the 156 schools in the milwaukee public school system in its first year mps reported serving 22 more school breakfasts school lunches also saw a gain cep means fewer kids are going hungry in milwaukee and nationwide enacting the gop bill would means that 7 000 schools that now currently participate would be dropped that is a gigantic step backwards for the health and nutrition of tens of thousands even hundreds of thousands of school children who are at key stages of development physically and academically not to mention the students in thousands of schools currently eligible to participate in cep but would be kicked off under the republican bill we have put in place new nutrition standards for school meals97 of schools have successful met these new standards and the usda has shown great eagerness to work with those that have not to do so these new requirements require more servings of fruits vegetables whole grains and fatfree and lowfat fluid milk in school meals while cutting sodium saturated fat and transfats now some are trying to block the new rules and the savings to our nation both short term and long term for helping kids develop lifelong healthy eating habits let me just talk about the burden to individuals and taxpayers of just one disease diabetesa budget busting disease this is an epidemic affecting an increasing number of americans including more and more of our youth the number of americans with diabetes is estimated to drastically in the next three decades in 2014 29 million people in the unitedstates 9 3 percent had diabetes about 1 in 11 according to the cdc by 2050 that number could be as high as 100 million americans or 1 in 3 the time to stop this trend is right now when we can help our children develop healthy eating habits that will stay with them for the rest of their lives and a taste for healthy and nutritious foods through the school nutrition programs i want to compare our investments in school lunch and breakfast programs and helping to provide nutritious meals that will support lifelong eating habits to young people with what it will cost us to treat diabetes diabetes is an extremely expensive condition for our healthcare system given that it is associated with a number of complicated health effects in 2012 diabetes and its related complications accounted for 245 billion in total costs including 176 billion in direct medical costs think medicaid and medicare and lost work and wages if the cdc estimates about the growth in cases holds the cost of just this one disease will grow dramatically over the next three decades these costs will be picked up by all of us including through medicare and medicaid in contrast in fy 2016 we will spend 12 5 billion on the school lunch program and 4 3 billion on the school breakfast program maintaining healthy and nutrition meals and standards and ensuring that all who are eligible can participate in these programs seems like a very wise investment to me the gop proposal would bar schools from including the eligibility requirements for school meals on the school meal applications absolutely absurd what public policy purpose is served by such a requirement other than to make sure people dont know about a benefit to which they are entitled i also want to emphasize the need to further strengthen wic during this reauthorization wic works thats what the research tells us the program helps improve health and nutrition outcomes for at risk women infants and children wic breastfeeding rates are rising we all know the benefits of breastfeeding for both mother and child we can make wic better by increasing the certification period for infants and women taking steps to ensure that children a better transition by wic eligible children from the program to the school meals programs under current law children that age out of wic may not be enrolled in school and participating the school meals programs risking gains to their health and wellbeing from having participated in wic how about making wic work better for our men and women in uniform yes there are members of our military who receive wic in fact i know of efforts in the last year to close a wic clinic located on a military base in washington state serving over 700 people including navy families there is room for bipartisanship the senate agriculture committee reported a bipartisan billwhich while not perfect and i dont support every elementreflects an honest effort to reach across the aisle that is simply nonexistent in this chamber at this point and that is a shame for the children who rely on the school meal programs to meet their nutritional needs for the schools and school administrators who fight hard every day to put the students under their charge in a position to succeed for the american taxpayer who expect us to govern i know the will is there on this side of the aisle to work together on things like increasing the breakfast and lunch for that matter reimbursement rates to support grant programs to help increase access to school breakfast which remains woefully undersubscribed compared to the school lunch program we can provide grants to support innovative and proven models such as breakfast after the bell and in the classroom as well as school equipment grants to help offset some of the costs"],

the 3 years since the terrible tragedy at sandy hook elementary school there have been over 1 100 mass shootings more than 34 000 lives have been cut short by someone using a gun the house of representatives has held 30 moments of silence for the victims of mass shootings since sandy hook and yet we havent taken a single vote on legislation that would help keep guns out of dangerous hands i think that is shameful the american people deserve more than silence the american people deserve a congress that is willing to stand up and do whatever it takes to keep our communities safe that starts by making sure that terrorists criminal domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill dont have easy access to purchase guns in our country today suspected terrorists can legally buy guns in our country individuals who are on the fbis terrorist watch list can walk into a gun store pass a background check and walk out with a gun or the guns of their choosingand they can do it legally since 2004 more than 2 000 suspected terrorists were able to purchase guns more than 90 percent of all suspected terrorists who tried to purchase guns in the last 11 years walked away with the weapon that they went in to buy now in the wake of the horrific attacks in orlando congress must make it a priority to keep deadly weapons out of the hands of suspected terrorists there is bipartisan legislation that would prohibit those on the terrorist watch list from being able to purchase firearms in our country this bill is common sense if you are too dangerous to fly you are too dangerous to buy a gun it is long past time for the republican leadership to bring that bill up for a vote we also need to pass my bipartisan bill to require background checks for all commercial gun sales

background checks now the republican house is going on with business as usual without giving the american people a vote to help prevent gun violence in our country if the republican leadership agrees

people who elected us not the interests of the gun lobby with 33 000 friends and family members dying by a gun every year it is truly upsetting that these bills fail on very short or real reform that would protect american lives during the civil rights movement when legislation was slow in moving dr martin luther king asked the question how long he said no matter how difficult the moment or how
