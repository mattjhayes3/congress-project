will have before us since 1962 on 75 different occasions the united states congress has chosen to increase the debt ceiling to ensure that we paid our past obligations it has been done 75 times without ever having any strings attached whatsoever last november we all know that there was an overwhelming message that was sent by the american people to washington dc and that message was number one create jobs get our economy back on track and in so doing rein in the dramatic increase in the size and scope and reach of government that we witnessed in the past several years we all know that in the last 4 years weve had an 82 percent increase in nondefense discretionary spending and so the message that was sent was that has to come to an end so speaker boehner when asked by the president of the united states to move an increase in the debt ceiling said that he was willing to do that he recognized as i believe an overwhelming majority of both democrats and republicans in this institution recognize it is absolutely essential that we increase the debt ceiling we have to do everything that we can to ensure that social security checks get to those retirees we have to make sure that the many other obligations that we have are in fact met and on that one issue of social security we know that on july 12 the president of the united states in a speech said that if we dont see an increase in the debt ceiling by august 2 he could not guarantee that on august 3 those social security checks would go to our retirees and so what happened was speaker boehner said we want to make sure that those social security checks get out we want to make sure that we increase the debt ceiling so our nation doesnt default and follow the pattern of greece portugal ireland and other countries in the world that have gone through tremendous economic devastation but what the speaker said is that while we are going to in increasing the debt ceiling meet those obligations of the past we are not going to do it the way it has been done the last 75 times we are going to get to the root cause of why it is that we have to increase the debt ceiling and that is the runaway spending that democrat and republican alike decries regularly and so the speaker said that he would increase the debt ceiling but he wanted to ensure that we cut spending in an amount that was greater than the level of the debt ceiling increase and so he began discussions recognizing that republicansthose who won this majority last novemberonly controlled the united states house of representatives speaker boehner does not look at the world through rosecolored glasses he knows that the republicans dont control the united states senate and he knows that he has to work with president obama but he does know that the last statement that was made by the american people in november of last year was weve got to have a dramatic change in the course that we have been on and so he began negotiating he began discussions he began working over the past several weeks and months to try to put together a bipartisan effort so that democrats and republicans alike could come together and ensure that those social security checks get out and that the other obligations that we have are in fact met and that we do increase our debt ceiling weve all followed and the american people are following very closely the global markets are following closely this debate and the discussions that are taking place it came to a head last weekend when we know that the president of the united states had requested a 50 percent increase in the level of taxes to be increased from 800 billion to 1 2 trillion and the speaker of the house said that that was a nonstarter so the speaker said that he wanted to work with the bipartisan leadership of the united states congress both houses of congress and so last weekend we know that speaker boehner and the democratic majority leader of the united states senate harry reid came together and fashioned by and large the measure that is before us today now im the first to say that harry reid no longer supports this measure harry reid has indicated that he does not support it we have this letter from the 53 senators we have word that theyre going to table this measure when it passes the house of representatives but its important for everyone to recognize that what is before us today is by and large a measure that is not what speaker boehner would write if he were doing it on his own its a measure that is the byproduct of bipartisan discussion and as the speaker likes to say the ability to find common ground we are today in a position where we face in just a few days the prospect of those social security checks not going out and thats why i dont like this measure but im voting for it im voting for it because i want to get those social security checks out i want to make sure that the united states of america does not default and i believe that thats the responsible thing for us to do what we have before us in the house of representatives is the closest thing to a bipartisan agreement first of all we know that by and large there have been no other plans put forward but the plan that does existthere are very few plans put forward the plan that has been put forward by senator reid is one that does not enjoy bipartisan support and it was not put together in a bipartisan way this one was by and large even though it does not have the support of senator reid any longer was put together based on the discussions they had i believe that this measure is deserving of strong bipartisan support here in the house of representatives and from our colleagues in the united states senate as well so i urge my colleagues in the name of sanity and in the name of ensuring that we maintain the solvency and the strength of the greatest nation the world has ever known that we pass this measure and that we send it to our colleagues in the united states senate so that they can do the same and so that when its placed on the desk of the president of the united states he will have his opportunity to ensure that what he predicted as a possibility for august 3 that being that social security checks do not go out will not happen i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.4091399610042572, 0.4091399610042572, 0, "i have an amendment at the desk the

minutes weve had the majority leader for the republicans and the minority whip for the democrats lay out in intricate detail the differences that were facing here as well as the commonalities that were facing here that hasnt happened in a little while it was a little more spirited today than it sometimes is as they come down on friday afternoons to share with each other what the schedule will be going forward but thats always a treat to see and i hope folks enjoyed being able to be a part of that what i have on my mind today is twofold were talking about jobs all day every day in this body were talking about jobs and much like you saw the majority leader and the minority whip lay out competing opinions competing views of what america should look like going forward we have competing views about what creates american jobs and i will tell you that we sometimes spend too much time talking about the creation side that we ignore the destruction side because its absolutely about creating jobs but its so much easier to stop killing jobs creating jobs we can disagree about how to make that happenlots of different proposals on the tablebut destroying jobs should be something that we agree today should never happen should be something that we say day in and day out were not going to let happen and thats the case as we talk about energy independence energy independence im going to quote my georgia colleague jimmy carter he was giving a speech in 1979 he said in a little more than two decades weve gone from a position of energy independence to one in which almost half of the oil we use comes from foreign countries at prices that are going through the roof sound familiar does it sound familiar this was a speech given in 1979 in a little more than two decades weve gone from a position of energy independence to one in which almost half the oil we use comes from foreign countries at prices that are going through the roof ill tell you what else my georgia colleague president carter said i am tonight in his 1979 speech setting a goal for the energy policy of the united states beginning this moment he said this nation will never use more foreign oil than we did in 1977never hear that the speech given in 1979 by the president who created the department of energy whose sole mission was to wean the united states from foreign oil and create domestic capacity to meet all of americas energy needs not just because of jobs but because of national security is what the president said beginning at this moment this nation will never use more foreign oil than we did in 1977never well sadly that has not come to fruition and were going to talk a little bit more about why that is quoting again from president jimmy carter from now on every new addition to our demand for energy will be from our own production and our own conservation the generationlong growth in our dependence on foreign oil will be stopped dead in its tracks folks this is president jimmy carteri would argue one of the more liberal presidents that weve had in our lifetimefrom my great state of georgia im going to be one of the most conservative members that we have in this unitedstates house of representatives and i agree with absolutely everything he said i was 9 years old when he said it never use more foreign oil than we use at this moment in 1977 every new demand for domestic energy will come from domestic energy production who disagrees with that who disagrees with one of our most forwardthinking energyindependent presidents that weve had who disagrees lets move forward lets look at unitedstates oil consumption 1973 to 2004 are the numbers i brought down today this top line unitedstates oil consumption unitedstates oil consumption here we are in 1979 when the president was giving his speech all the new demand he said will come from unitedstates energy supplies the red lines are oil imports red line is the amount of oil that we are bringing in from overseas heres the presidents speech in 1979 heres that peak year in 1977 he was giving the speech in 79 but he said lets look at 1977 a peak year for our imports across the globe we will never import that much oil again well look out there look right out there 1996 1997 1998 through today we absolutely are and why and why the why is because of unitedstates oil production you know we talkand again you saw it with the majority leader and the minority whip when they were talking about their competing visions for a direction for america they were talking about jobs and the minority leader asked he said name one economist who will tell you that reducing regulation creates jobs that was an honest question name one economist who agrees that reducing government regulation creates jobs folks look at the gulf of mexico look at the gulf of mexico you know as i do as you are from that part of the world that americas largest shallow water oil drilling company declared bankruptcy in the midst of some of the highest costs per barrel of oil that the world has ever seen why why would a unitedstates oil producer the largest in the country declare bankruptcy when the price that were getting for a barrel of oil is among the highest in world history ill give you the answer because the united states government wouldnt give them a single permit to drill hear that more oil imports from around the world than ever before in american history focus on both sides of the aisle on creating jobs and the largest shallow water oil producer in america goes out of business because the american government wont give them permits tell me who believes that that didnt cost jobs that that regulatory decision to refuse to allow americans to drill for american oil in american waters as they have for decades who believes that didnt cost us a job now good news good news those rigs that we would have been using to drill for american oil theyre not being mothballed theyve just gone overseas to drill for foreign oil that well then be able to pay top dollar to get back in america folks why why this is an energy independence issue and it is a jobs issue and it is a national security issue look back 1980 after president jimmy carters speech that said we will never import more oil importing here six million almost seven million barrels a day fast forward 2008 that numbers almost doubled to 13 its almost doubled to 13 folks were rich with energy in this country you know as i do we have been blessed there are countries around this world that dont have access to fresh water we do there are countries around this world that dont have access to beaches and to mountains and to waterways and we do there are countries around this globe that dont have access to energy but we do who is it who decides that we cant harness unitedstates energy who is it is it some sort of natural law of nature that says we cant harness unitedstates energy no its the folks who sit in these chairs its the folks who sit in these chairs day in and day out who decide no no you cannot harness american energy you know where you ought to get your energy get it from overseas get it from overseas now you might ask where is it we have to go overseas to get our energy and i think thats a fair question something that we dont talk about very much when we talk about free trade you know every single nation that america has had a free trade agreement with we have a manufactured goods surplus we talk so much about the trade deficit that we have with the world youve heard it you hear it all the time a trade deficit that we have with the world why its energy its importing energy that creates the trade deficit those jobs we talk about manufacturing jobs good highpaying manufacturing jobs in everybodys district in the country we have a trade surplus with every single nation with which we have a free trade agreement what we dont have is an energy surplus these are the top oilproducing countries in the world top oilproducing countries in the world our green line up top is the former soviet union it changes over to russia you see its right up there at the top even as we enter 2010 this beige line is saudi arabia it is also up there at the top as we enter down here you see the next biggest oil producers china in purple and iran in blue you tell me if thats who you want to import our energy resources from and here in red is the united states of america this is production in millions of barrels per day this line should be going up this line should be going up and this line is going down and the question is why why look again to the seats in this room look again to the policymakers in this country bill after bill after bill we have passed in this chamber that would free up the american energy production that would create jobs not tomorrow not a week from tomorrow not a year from tomorrow but today that would create jobs today and those bills languish in the senate do not tell me that regulations dont impact jobs asking the question does an economist agree that regulation removal would create jobs folks we dont need an economist we need any mom or dad in the country we could get a sixth grader to come and say whats going to happen if regulations put people out of business removing those regulations will let them come back in largest oilproducing countries in the world russia saudi arabia iran and china and the united states of americawere in good company we are in good company in the top five oilproducing countries in the world but were going down while every other country is going up we are producing less while folks with whom we have fundamental disagreements about a world view their production goes up and so who do we get our oil from mr speaker are we able to find enough oil in this global market to buy only from our friends no were not we buy from anybody wholl sell to us and i dont need to speculate on what they do with the dollars we give them i think we all have suspicions of our own this chart is american oil production unitedstates field production of crude oil we had a slow start back in the 1800s we didnt know how powerful it was going to be im not going to fault us for that we started to sort out the technology we started to put it to good use you see that spike running right up into the 1970s when president carter was giving his speech in fact theres a little jog in the chart here you cant see it but oil production went down and jimmy carter gave a speech he said we are going to find domestic sources for american energy we are not going to sell our future away to the world for the price of a barrel of oil we are going to do it ourselves and so you see an uptick president carter you know hes known for oil oil embargoes this energy speech but really solar energy for which i would say i remember president carter most fondly he began that huge push for alternative sources of energy and he was focused on that throughout this time but his commitment to energy independence was every bit as large as his commitment to solar energy and we began to produce more oil now follow that line from 1990 straight down through 2010 straight down its not that were not blessed with energy its that were also blessedill use the word looselywith a congress that believes or at least believed before this freshman class got here that theyre the smartest folks in the room and if only the rest of america will do what they want them to do america will be better off the decisions in my community about what makes the families in my community better off are made around the family dinner table not 640 miles away in washington d c the decisions about how to make ends meet are made around that dinner table not 640 miles away in washington d c the decisions about the environment about transportation and about jobs are happening at that local level until we destroy that opportunity from washington d c we have the oil we could turn this chart around today but regulatorily we wont allow it to happen next time someone talks about a jobs proposal i hope youll direct them to jobs gop gov because you know as i know at jobs gop gov you will find the list of more than 20 pieces of legislation that we have passed in this chamber that sit idle in the senate that will create jobs again not tomorrow not next week not next year but today today wheres an economist that believes reducing regulation creates jobs folks thats not the question the question is is there a family in america that doesnt know for a fact that reducing regulations creates jobs were not talking about thwarting clean water folks i drink out of the same spigot everybody else does were not talking about thwarting clean air i sniff out of the same air that everybody else does were not talking about those public health and safety issues were talking about national security when you look at this chart it talks about the nations that produce oil the oil that we need to run this country russia saudi arabia iran and china is there an environmental issue when it comes to energy production you bet there is but i propose this give us energy independence give us energy independence in this country by whatever means necessary by hook by crook you drill you dig you put the solar panels on the roof do whatever you have to do give us energy independence today and ill be glad to have the discussion that the president from my great state of georgia started in the late 1970s about having enough alternative energy sources to fund this country folks who doesnt love green greens wonderful i saw a study the other day that said its the most soothing color for children greens wonderful greens not what we get when we have to bargain with russia with saudi arabia with china and with iran to get the lifeblood that keeps the american economy going green is not what we get folks drill dig do whatever you have to today to achieve energy independence to reduce this imported number twice as much oil being imported today as we were when president carter gave his speech that it would never rise again we can do it were americans were the greatest engineers on this planet we have the hardest working workforce on this planet we have folks who are willing to save and sacrifice like nobody else on this planet we can do it the question is are we in the unitedstates house in the united states senate down at 1600 pennsylvania avenue in the white house are we going to free the american people to pursue that goal you know i came to this congress about freedom i dont actually view my job as the job of being the smartest person in the room i view my job as protecting the freedom of folks back home because if youve not been down to the seventh district of georgia ill tell you youre going to find some of the smartest folks in the land right down there its kind of the north metro suburbs of atlanta and folks run this country from there with the decisions they make every day of the week we dont need a federal law that tells you whether to buy a snickers or a twix im sure we could have a spirited debate about that here in this chamber but we dont need a law to do it because folks just make that decision every day are there enough peanuts in snickers mr speaker do you think we should have them add some more you know those are the kinds of things we decide were going to regulate out of this body in the name of making everybody happy the children when they get their trick or treat bags on halloween that have the minisnickers in there how much happier would they be if each of those minisnickers bars had eight peanuts in them instead of just seven theyd be so much happier and it would help peanut farmers in georgia it would be a home state jobs creation initiative we should regulate that from washington dc no because families regulate that if you dont like the peanuts on the snickers youre going to get a payday bar if there are not enough peanuts in payday youre going to go on to the next one we as americans not as congressmen as americans we sort out these decisions a thousand times a day how do we get more freedom then back into individuals hands were talking about jobs and thats again energy independence its a national security issue it should be the focus of everything we do in this house because its a national security issue if you dont believe we would make different foreign policy decisions if we were not dependent on people who hate us to fuel this economy with their oil id have to disagree because im absolutely certain of it we would make better foreign policy decisions if we produced our own energy resourcesand we can were the saudi arabia of coal for petes sake what has this body over the past several years been trying to regulate right out of existence coal the one resource that we have in abundance more than anyone else on the planet and folks in their wisdom have decided that it would be better not to harvest our coal and instead import oil from people who hate us folks thats not freedom thats decisionmaking going on right here and i promise you well get it right in the seventh district of georgia more often than not and when folks believe theyre the brightest people in the room they start to make mistakes that brings me to the fairtax oh you know the fairtax is a tax bill but at its heart its a freedom bill what the fairtax is if you havent looked at it recently its a fundamental change in the way we tax america today we tax income and of course the power to tax is the power to destroy i ask young people when i go to schools to speak i say who wants to come to work for me im going to work you hard and im going to work you long and im going to give you 10 an hour i get a couple of hands that go up apparently 10 an hour is not as much today as it was back in my day i would have jumped at 10 an hour but i get hands that go up for 10 an hour then i say but im going to have to tax you 9 of that so youre only going to be able to take home 1 now who wants to come work long hours for me all of the hands go down the power to tax productivity is the power to destroy productivity the power to tax income is the power to destroy income why why do we want to destroy that which makes this country great so the fairtax shifts that paradigm instead of taxing what people produce we want to tax what people consume a consumption tax youve all seen it its in your sales tax back home in your state you get taxed on what you consume and we could do it ill tell you the fairtax is a jobs program because when we stop taxing productivity we get more of it that creates jobs ill tell you the fairtax is about transparency you know the payroll tax that 15 3 cents out of every dollar that comes out of your paycheck that fica line that you see now 7 65 percent comes from the employee the other 7 65 is hidden as an employer tax but its a 15 3 percent payroll tax did you know that 80 percent of american families pay more in the payroll tax than they do in the income tax eighty percent of american families pay more in the payroll tax than they do in the income tax now i just got back from thanksgiving ive got doctors in my family ive got teachers in my family ive got all sorts of folks so i can assure you i got an earful throughout the entire thanksgiving dinner it was more of a threeday festival for me different sides of the family coming into town and i got lots of good advice about how we should do things differently up here but you know not one person mentioned the payroll tax the income tax was a hot topic but nobody mentioned the payroll tax and its the biggest tax that 80 percent of americans pay why because the payroll tax is hidden in every single paycheck that you get you dont feel it the government gets its share first you get your share second you dont feel it go away unless youre one of the selfemployed folks in america and instead of paying the 15 3 percent payroll tax you pay the equivalent 15 3 percent selfemployment tax and then you feel the bite of that tax each and every day you know thats the biggest tax that you pay the fairtax instead of allowing all of those taxes to be hidden hidden in business taxes hidden in income taxes hidden in payroll taxes separated out so you dont feel the pain the fairtax takes your entire federal tax burden and sticks it into one rate a sales tax on everything that you buy one rate now that rate would have to be 23 percent thats a big number twentythree percent is what the sales tax rate the fairtax rate would need to be in order to replace federal income taxes on businesses on individuals federal payroll taxes on businesses on individuals the gift tax the death tax the capital gains tax the dividend tax all of those federal taxes on income the fairtax could replace them all with a 23 percent personal consumption tax there at the cash register and youd see it can you imagine today i can just raise an excise tax here raise a quarter of a percent on income tax there i can do lots of funny math as they like to do in washington dc because folks cant feel the pain they always think its not going to tax me its going to tax somebody else yes i vote yes because its going to tax him instead of me the fairtax puts us all in the same boat and lets us see how much the united states government costs us im a costconscious shopper i brought a marker down here with me today in case i had to write any big red marks on my chart this was free with rebates at office max last week i dont know if anybody else got it free with rebates for this marker dollars and cents matter we make different decisions in our personal purchasing life when we experience those costs transparency lets you know how much your government is costing you does everybody want a free marker yes does everybody want to pay the 6 95 it would have been if it werent free with a rebate i think not it puts the entire cost of government out where you can see it most importantly the fairtax is about individual freedom folks have you thought about how the tax code manipulates your life it doesnt matter whether you sit on the far right over here with the republicans or if you sit on the far left over there with the democrats sometimes something happens when you show up in washington d c and you do you believe youre the smartest person in the room everybody tells you how wonderful you are you think your ideas are so great then you decideyou know what that i should reward people for doing this behavior and that i should punish them for doing that behavior and if i do it theyll be happier and america will be better so what am i going to do im going to put a tax on gasoline because i dont want people driving to work thats bad then im going to put a tax credit on electric vehiclesright because thats green we were talking about green earlier im going to put a tax credit on electric vehicles so im going to punish those people who buy oil at the community gas station and im going to reward those people who go out and buy these 60 000 70 000 80 000 electric vehicles i dont actually think thats very good tax policy but we have the power to do that we can manipulate your behavior every day of the week by changing how the tax code touches your pocketbook i was talking about that electric vehicle tax credit that wasnt just an example that wasnt just something i made up do you remember when this president passed his energy bill it included in it a tax credit of 6 500 for everyone who would go out and buy an electric vehicle well again the volt was not on the market at the time in the 40s and the only vehicles out there were in the 80 000 90 000 range but americans are industrious which is why if you leave america to americans were going to be just fine americans are industrious what they found out was if they put brake lights on their golf carts as well as some side view mirrors some good seatbelts up front some headlights and windshield wipers that the department of transportation would certify those golf carts as roadready vehicles and they could get the 6 500 tax credit ah now it turns out you cant buy an americanmade golf cart for 6 500 our golf carts are a little more expensive than that yet our friends in china are not only willing to share their oil with usguess what theyre willing to share their golf carts with us too so it turned out at the end of tax year 2009 americans were literally standing in line for vin numbers for chinese golf carts so that they could claim this tax credit free golf carts for all did anybody get one mr speaker did you get that free golf cart dont tell me if you did i know some folks who did im not proud of it but i know some folks who did free golf carts for all from the united states tax code folks when we bring all that power and all that authority here it gives us the power to manipulate your life and we dont always manipulate it for the powers of good i would tell you even when were trying to manipulate it for the powers of good as the president was trying to manipulate it for the powers of good in his energy bill we run afoul why do we need to pay people to engage in behavior we make those decisions each and every day the fairtax abolishes the income tax code so that no longer can people who think theyre the smartest people in the room in washington tell you how to live your life its not just a crazy conservative republican idea no we have that idea from folks on the other side of the aisle too let me quote president obama youve got too many companies ending up making decisions based on what their tax director says instead of what their engineer designs or what their factories produce and that puts our entire economy at a disadvantage you were here when the minority whip asked is there any economist who believes that regulations destroy jobs or that removing regulations would create jobs we dont need an economist weve got the president of the united states too many companies make decisions based on what their tax director says based on tax regulation instead of what their engineer designs or what their factories produce and that puts our entire economy at a disadvantage president barack obama well go more we need to make america the best place on earth to do business a barrier government can remove is a burdensome corporate tax code with one of the highest rates in the world the minority whip asked where is the economist that believes that repealing regulation is going to create jobs its the president of the united states a barrier that government can remove is a burdensome corporate tax code with one of the highest rates in the world we can do that we dont need world approval we dont need to shop that around for a decade we could do that here and we have legislation drafted to make it so ill quote senate majority

that i work with im honored to be a part of it for the past 32 years ive been here i really came up here to stay 4 years and thats what my wife and i agreed on i just didnt say which 4 i was talking about but she was always one to encourage me to run because i had a son who was a district judge and i think she felt that me being in congress helped that son mommas always love their little cubs i think he was really helping me because he was running on the republican ticket then and i was running on the democratic ticket i soon saw the light and i came over but i left good friends over here and theres good people on both sides of the docket theres a lot of talk about the parachute there are things you have to do in politics sometimes i had a race that started this last time with 78 percent of the votes it looked like a gentleman from houston spent 450 000 against me he didnt know me didnt know the two people running against me but spent that amount of money to defeat me for some reason because he thought i was too old to be here he picked five of us and the other four didnt take him on i tried to take him on some but in taking him on i had to assure my people that i wasnt the old goof that he was saying i was that i was capable of the work the only way i could think of doing iti run a couple of miles every morning and when i was running i looked up and there was an airplane up there i thought if i could jump up and touch that airplane theyd think i was agile enough maybe to keep on being their congressman if running 2 miles every morning voting 99plus percent of the time if that wasnt enough i had to do something else so i decided if i jump 2 miles maybe that would be it we got in an airplane i got this guy and he really was great he trained me and showed me how to get in and out of course i had flown probably a couple or 300 hours or 400 hours during the war and i had made one jump during the war but it wasnt a forced jump i knew what it was and i knew that it was okay i also knew that it would tell people i had not had a stroke and thats what they were putting out i wanted them to know i was able and capable of representing them they had to know that and they were entitled to know that so i decided to jump out of that airplane we got right over the opening there and i looked down i had maybe a couple of hundred people on the ground waiting there he said as you jump out reach with your heel and kick me in the rear i was glad to do that right at the last i almost decided not to jump but i was too close and i knew i had to i might have been pushed a little i dont even know i did jump and he held on to me so tightthere were two of us there he was holding tight and that kind of struck me i turned around and asked him do you mean it he said what do you mean i said youre holding me so tight do you care for me whats the deal theres a preacher down there and the president said men can marry men maybe hell just marry us when we get there he said shut up the ground is going to be here in just a few minutes it was a pretty thing to see the earth coming up to us there and seeing good friends down there that waited in hope for me even my undertaker was there my undertaker meets me every time i go home with a tape measure and tells me he has one in store for me he also tells me not to worry about flyers if you dont like them theyll finally grow on you its kind of a smart aleck way to do it but hes my close friend he was an intern when i was in the texas senate and one of the fine leaders of rockwall for the past 32 years ive had the honor and the privilege of representing the fourth district of texas here in congress and i think its just an honor to know that there have been 10 747 men and women elected to serve and that i may be the oldest to ever serve or to ever vote on the floor there are others that have been here but didnt vote i think that date comes up sometime around the 21st day of december my first impression of the house of representatives when i got here began with speaker sam rayburn whose district i represent speaker rayburn and my wife were good friends at mayo college thats what the college name was before it was east texas state teachers college when i was in the senate i changed it to east texas state university my wife graduated from there and i had the privilege of handing her her diploma those are good things and thats a great institution over there mr rayburn was called by my mother who had known him back in the earlier days and was at mayo college with him to give me some kind of a recommendation to be an officer in the army or the navy or the marine corps or something he didnt call her back he didnt write her a letter back he came to the breakfast table to tell her maude i cant appoint that boy to anything theres four reasons she said what on earth can that be he said all four of his grades that was kind of true because i always thought everything over 70 was wasted not a good student not a good football player we lost our car early in the depression one guy in the depression said hed eaten so many rabbits he was afraid of his own dog we didnt have that kind of a problem but we knew what the depression was i fear for this country right today in that if we dont get together and maybe forget that were more republican than we are democrat or more democrat than we are republican our children are going to suffer we need to make a move and think of them we owe our children an opportunity and they owe us the effort its just that simple i think in this next session were going to all have some give that were all going to get together and try to work something out in our leader we have a good speaker hes a guy i admire and respect a kind speaker a guy who means the things that he says he is a speaker who cares about us i dont agree with everything he says but we need to forget any little pettiness that we have get behind the leadership here

the white house the white house isnt the presidents house its our house every time i drive by every time i go past i think you know what i own that i may live in a little old apartment of my own but when i drive by the white house i think i own a piece of that that house belongs to me i do hope every american believes that same thing it is our house so if you have not gone to your member of congress to try to get a tour of the white house i encourage you to do it i encourage you to do it because it belongs to you and presidents republican and democrat alike open up those doors so that we can see our white house in america its a symbol of freedom around the world i printed this one up in full color i spent a little extra im pretty thrifty in my budget if you know anything about me not only do we cut our budget here in the united states house of representatives but i cut mine another 10 percent beyond that were going to give back about 300 000 to the american taxpayer but we spent the extra money to put down the blue sky of optimism because this is the presidents election night victory speech in 2008 do you remember it do you remember it mr speaker because i remember it i remember the promise of a better day and here it is as hes talking about bipartisanship because it gets a lot of lip service in this body but it takes hard work it takes hard work here we go he is talking about bipartisanship and about partisanship in particular he says i will resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has poisoned our politics for far too long he hadnt been sworn in yet the inauguration hadnt happened yet his victory speech 2008 i will resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has poisoned our politics for far too long that inspires me would that it be true lets move past full color to the stark black and white which is the world were living in today here is the president from last month giving up on that commitment of bipartisanship when questioned about the partisan angle that he took throughout the social security debate throughout the doc fix debate throughout the unemployment debate he concluded it was gonna take more than a year it was gonna take more than 2 years it was gonna take more than one term probably takes more than one president you know as well as i know weve only been in this institution just over 1 year now it does not take time it takes courage to make things happen in this body it does not take hours it takes i dos it takes somebody standing up and saying i will be responsible for that which the president did he said i will be responsible for ushering a new era into washington d c as a freshman legislator i took him at his word four years later here we are cant do it in a year cant do it in 2 years he couldnt do it in 3 years and now he says it probably takes more than one president it might take a different president but he says its going to take more than one let me take you back to sunshine and apple pie because thats what were about here in america we thrive on challenges we thrive on opportunities to do better we want one generation to do better than the previous generation and we want the next generation to do better than our generation here is what president obama says in august 2008 in talking about his vice presidential pick after decades of steady work across the aisle i know hellin talking about senator biden now vice president bidenbe able to help me turn the page on the ugly partisanship in washington so we can bring democrats and republicans together to pass an agenda that works for the american people who doesnt believe in that mr speaker who doesnt believe in that who doesnt believe its not necessarily compromise and that it can be consensus who doesnt believe on coming together to pass an agenda that works for the american people you do i do ill take you back to the stark black and white of where weve come of president obama in november 2010 a year ago when talking about why it is his administration has taken on such a partisan tone he says this i neglected some of the things that matter a lot to people and rightly so that they matter maintaining a bipartisan tone in washington im going to redouble my efforts to go back to some of those first principles you and i came here for the same reason we came here to get stuff done for our constituents back home we came here to uphold the constitution and the freedoms that it preserves for our constituents back home weve been stuck in an environment in washington d c where the senate refuses to act on any of the legislation that we put forward and where it refuses to act on any of its own legislation then we have a president who says this about his leadership in this town i neglected some of the things that matter a lot to people and rightly so that they matter maintaining a bipartisan tone in washington im going to redouble my efforts to go back to some of those first principles thats the funny thing about principles youre not supposed to have to go back to them youre supposed to stick with them day in day out in good times in bad times its easy to have principles in the good times whoo its easy its when times get tough that principles really matter this was a year ago the president is going to redouble his efforts to go back to some of those first principles of his which is ending the partisan tone in washington d c in now folks know what happened in november of 2011 we began the discussion of what to do to solve health care issues for our seniors because medicare reimbursement rates were on their way down and seniors might not have had access to care and we wanted to protect our seniors to make sure that that access to care existed we had unemployment benefits that were getting ready to expire and we had folks who were depending on those benefits and who were trying to sort out how it was that we would continue those and reform that program so it wouldnt just provide a check but provide a way back to employment we had social security the payroll tax break that the president instituted in december of 2011 which was right after he made this comment that reduces the social security contributions of every working american by a third but does nothing to change the benefits that those working americans get back when they retire thus accelerating the bankruptcy of the social security trust fund not to mention breaking that link that has been omnipresent in this country with social security it is not an entitlement in the welfare sense of the word it is an entitlement in that you paid into it and so you have earned it you deserve it were changing that linkage for the very first time following that debate i wake up in the morning down in the seventh district of georgia in the northern suburbs there of atlanta i was in gwinnett county i wake up to find out the president has made recess appointments ah ive got to tell you i went through the roof but you might not have gone through the roof i dont know where everybody was all 300 million americans where they were when they woke up to that news that morning or where they were with regard to their constitution i carry mine i know you carry yours and i would encourage any body who doesnt have one to contact another member of congress we can absolutely get you the united states constitution the rule book by which everything we do here should be judgedshould be judged its why recess appointments matter what i have here is article ii section 2 of the united states constitution its clause 3 ill back up just a little bit and make it clear for folks who havent studied their constitution recently that article i delegates the legislative powers to the united states congress article i the very first order of business of our founding fathers in framing our republic was to protect the peoples powers here in the peoples house and in the united states senate article i article ii vests power in the executive article ii section 2 clause 3 the president shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the senate by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session it seems pretty straightforward but it is not that is what it so wonderful about our constitution our founding fathers had the wisdom to say enough without saying too much shortly after the ratification of the constitution alexander hamilton was writing on this topic when he read this very same clause he read this the president shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the senate what alexander hamilton saw is that the only vacancies that can be filled are those vacancies that occur during a recess of the senate not vacancies that are getting filled then but vacancies that actually occurred then this is important language it is important language because i live 640 miles away from the united states capitol i happen to travel with my friends at delta and they get me here in an hour and a half but if i had to get on my horse and ride it would take a little while there is good reason there was recess appointments going on in the founding of this republic i hope we can get back to having more recesses here why in the world we have let this congress evolve into a fulltime job that takes place year round i do not know the general assembly in georgia meets for 40 days out of the year i tell folks back home i will have achieved success when it is we in washington d c who only meet for 40 days out of a year because we have sent that power that has been gradually stolen from the people stolen from the community stolen from the states and return that power to those communities but it was a real issue in the early days of our republic that if there was a recess we wanted to give the president the power to continue the republic even when you couldnt get a hold of the united states senate for confirmation well in the age of ipads and blackberrys and fax machines it is not that hard to get in touch with folks it is easy to reconvene the senate but still on the books today the president shall have the power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the senate you may be asking rob why do you even care about this you are in the house this doesnt concern you let me tell you this concerns me and it concerns every american because it concerns the rule book by which our republic is governed if we decide that the rule book doesnt matter it will be something small today and it is going to be something mediumsized tomorrow and it is going to be something huge a year from now and the freedoms that our constitution has so ably protected for over 200 years will soon be gone this isnt a partisan fight this is an american fight i will tell you that when we had a republican president in the white house and republican members controlling this unitedstates house and republican members controlling the unitedstates senate power left this house and went down to the executive branch republicans allowed legislative power to leave this house and get transferred to the executive branch we have got to be on duty all the time it is not republican democrat it is executive unitedstates house why because when our framers were framing the constitution they knew tyranny of the executive was what was to be feared king of england tyranny of the executive was what was to be feared and so they invested most of the power in the congress in the house in the senate this is where our framers trusted that power to reside but they gave the president the power to make appointments in recess of the senate why is this important at all article ii section 2 clause 2 which is known as the advice and consent clause the president shall have the power by and with the advice and consent of the senate to make treaties provided twothirds of the senators present concur and he shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate shall appoint ambassadors other public ministers and consuls and judges of the supreme court and all other officers of the united states whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for hear this the president absolutely positively has the power to appoint whomever he wants by and with the advice and consent of the united states senate if the senate is not in session clause 3 takes over during those times the president shall have the power to fill those vacancies and it shall not extend past that one session well what happened over christmas as the rights and privileges of the american people were stolen out from under us here in the united states house and senate and transferred to the executive branch is that the president saidand you will remember the quote he said if i cant do it with congress i will go around congress do you remember that if i cant pass my agenda with congress i will go around congress tyranny of the executive the most fundamental fear our framers had the most fundamental fear was that an executive would decide that he or she could do whatever they wanted without the consent of the government we have to stand up as republicans and democrats and say there is a right way and a wrong way to run this town that there is a rule book by which this town is governed that there is 200 years of precedent that tells us how appointments must occur how that advice must occur when those appointments can be made if you followed any of thisand well talk about this more in the weeks to come because it goes to the bedrock of our republic again if you let your reverence for the constitution slide when it is convenient for you youre going to find it pulled out from under you when you need it most i know that when you swore your oath to the people of this country you swore your oath not to protect the constitution from democratic presidents not to protect the constitution from republican presidents but to protect the constitution from all enemies foreign and domestic your oath whether there is a republican in the white house or a democrat in the white house is to make sure that the peoples power remains here with the people we legislate and the president executes this isnt a mystery this isnt something i came up with in the seventh district of georgia this is something president bush and senator harry reid struggled with during the bush administration this is something all congresses and presidents struggle with the struggle is not new the complete abdication of constitutional responsibility that is new the deciding that if you cant do it with the constitution you will go around the constitution that is new let me tell you what harry reid said i hold in my hand here a copy of that page from the con"], [0.4334011375904083, 0.4334011375904083, 0, "its always an honor to speak here on the house floor and theres been a lot of interesting attention thats been given to an issue of whether or not the obama administration supports israel doesnt support israel is more supportive of its enemies and apparently according to an article in the weekly standard this week may 30 2012 by daniel halper and im quoting from the article here it says obama stressed he probably knows about judaism more than any other president because he read about it haaretz reports he wondered how come no one asks speaker of the house of representatives john boehner or senate minority leader mitch mcconnell about their support to israel similarly he said to the group i am not going to tell you again how i even feel about israel but why are we still talking about it he then suggested that he should not be questioned about his commitment to the jewish state because all his friends in chicago were jewish i think theres a lot to be learned when we read peoples comments or learn of peoples comments that were not scripted that were said just off the top of the head nobody put it in the teleprompter its not somebody elses words its words directly from the individual in question so ive got to say you know the president says all his friends in chicago were jewish i learned a lot from that i didnt know that jeremiah wright was jewish i mean i meet people all the time and it never crosses my mind you know what descent is this person so its fascinating for me to find out from the president that apparently jeremiah wright was jewish tony rezko that got the lot right next to the president and got them a sweetheart deal of some kind that real estate deal even though rezkos gone to prison i didnt know tony rezko was jewish and bill ayers who unashamedly blew up a bomb hoping that he would kill people back in the seventies the man that gave barack obama his first fundraiser at his home i didnt know what lineage bill ayers was but according to the presidents comment all his friends in chicago were jewish apparently bill ayers must have been jewish as well so its interesting to find out about peoples friends and who they are and what their background really is my background having been at one time early on a prosecutorive been a judge ive been a chief justice it helps me some of us that are a little slower to work through and plod through material methodically it helps me to make a chart i know having collected the notes of jurors after they had heard long casesi guess the longest case i tried was about 10 weeks long a murder case as a judge but it was always interesting to read notes that jurors had left so often they would take evidence and they would make notes of evidence and try to decide what category that evidence fit intodid it support what the prosecution was saying since they had the burden of proof or did it support a defense contention or an affirmative defense that kind of thing so i found this week since i read that article about the presidents defensiveness that it would be interesting to take and just run through some evidence so that we could try to decide since the president says hes not even going to comment how he feels about israel anymore i think it would be helpful to go through and look at the evidence and decide whether it supports the notion that the president is very proisrael or that hes not when the president said that he wondered why no one asked speaker of the house of representatives john boehner about his support for israel well i know that speaker boehner and i have had some rather profound disagreementsand that im sure will continuebut when it came to the issue of israel i couldnt come up with anything that indicated any lack of complete support for the nation of israel in fact 2 years ago i started pushing to get prime minister netanyahu invited to address a joint session of congress here in this very hall i know when i approached speaker pelosi about itthis was june of 2010she thought it was a nice idea but there just wasnt going to be time to get that done before the end of the year we just had so much on our plate and i think we did have a lot of courthouses we hadnt named yet so we got those done then when the republicans took the majority in 2011 i redid a letter and got lots of republicans to sign on the speaker asked prime minister netanyahu to come and address the house here and as best i understand it got the majority leader down the hall harry reid to go in on it so that it would be a joint session so all the evidence indicates complete support by speaker boehner for israel i really havent been able to find anything to the contrary but again since the president says hes not going to comment anymore about how he feels about israel i thought it would be goodand it sure helps meto go through and just chart out evidence and which notion it supports so i went through and we took points from storieswhether on television in the news media on the internetthat appeared to have a good basis for being factual and just decided to chart out is this evidence that president obama is for or against israel does he love israel or does he love israel not we know that back in 2011 most of us heard the commentsapparently they didnt know that microphone was livewhen prime minister netanyahu came up in the comments by president sarkozy of france when he made a comment something about what a problem netanyahu was and president obama made comments to the effect that oh yeah well i have to deal with him every day it was clearly belittling of prime minister netanyahu i know people that heard the comment thought ooh if youre prime minister netanyahu thats got to hurt to hear the guy that you may talk to quite a bit agreeing with another leader that netanyahu is just a real pain to deal with so it really doesnt show a love for israel really that was more of a loves israel not then the comments in 2011 when prime minister netanyahu last year was on his way coming to the united stateshe was going to speak to an aipac convention hereand it seemed to be rather short notice the president hurriedly consulted with people that he trusted imam magid who is president of the islamic society of north america of course they are a named coconspirator in the holy land foundation prosecution for supporting terrorism isna islamic society of north america hes the president of that organization and we heard on the news that imam magid had been consulted in fact imam magid the president of this coconspirator supporting terrorism was even invited to the inner sanctum of the state department to hear the speech that he had apparently according to sources had helped give advice to president obama on so during his comments president obama says that israel should return to its 1967 borders and people that are familiar with israel and know the history of that area including going back to 1000 or so b c when king david was the ruler in that land1 500 1 600 years or so before a man named muhammad came to earth anyway hes suggesting that israel in those comments should return to those borders which military people indicate make israel indefensible thats why they were so subject to attack in 1967 so that really was not a comment suggestive of a love for israel thats really more of a loves israel not then the obama administration they have wholly failed to condemn any of the palestinians building of illegal settlements here the palestinians keep building and building in areas theyre not authorized that are illegal settlements being built and we hear not one single word from the obama administration about the illegal settlements being constructed by palestinians that also included his criticism of israeli housing plans for east jerusalem so thats really a loves israel not on that one as well youve got the obama administrations decision to eradicate missile defense programs that would have helped israel there are articles and information about that obviously since it didnt help israel to have eradicated missile defense programs that would have helped israel despite some that would that actually is an act that indicates loves israel not now i think it was a wonderful thing that prime minister netanyahu in 2010 was invited to the white house that was a great thing very good of the president to invite him but all of the reference to that visit seemed to make very clear that when the president intentionally snubbed the prime minister who had traveled all this way to meet with the president and he was left waiting for an hour or so while the president went off with his familythey knew that prime minister netanyahu was coming he came by invitation and yet the president created an intentional snub unless his staff of course is so incompetent they didnt let him know that the leader of our dear ally israel was waiting in the white house to visit but anyway he went and dined with his family also it was considered by most who know about internal relations to be quite a snub that although the presidents been pictured with all kinds of folks in the middle east that would just as soon israel be eliminated from the map to refuse to have a picture with him which was the norm really was an indication of loves israel not now secretary of state hillary clinton announced that the obama administration planned to send 147 million to the west bank and to the hamasrun gaza strip well congress had made very clear since we have the purse strings under the constitution that there should not be money being sent to any organization that is supportive of terrorism hamas is a named organization that supports terrorism and yet this administration has decided to send a group who has made very clear they want to see israel eliminated wiped off the mapsending them 147 million is not really evidence of a love for israel so that would go in that category over here you also have president obama stating that all his friends in chicago were jewish and that he was sometimes accused of being a jewish puppet well for those people who accused the president according to the president only of being a jewish puppet and that always his friends in chicago were jewish well that is some indication of a love for the jewish nation of israel the presidents administration though earlier this year leaked to the washington post of the time window in which israel would take out irans nuclear program well any ally is supposed to know that if you go leaking information putting it out there in public that damages an effort of your close ally to defend itself thats not a good thing its not a sign of love and affection for an ally when you leak information that would prevent or harm the efforts of that ally in defending itself so that was not a good indication of a love for israel more of a loves israel not and then also the obama administration had a leak to the media that israel was going to use the azerbaijan airspace to take out irans nuclear program well if thats the kind of thing you do for friends americas not going to have a lot of friends for very long because our friends will know wow israel is said to be one of americas closest allies and yet theyre leaking information about private deals that their socalled ally has made to try to defend themselves that surely would fall into the category of loves israel not and then also you have the immense pressure that was placed by this administration on israel not to defend itself without the united states permission does a friend really do that i thought we believed in the sovereignty of our friends our nation friends so they could make their own decisions about selfdefense i thought thats the case and yet we keep hearing reports reading reports about pressure by this administration on israel not to take action to defend itself so thats really in that category as well loves israel not then also the obama administration has never rejected or condemned the racist hateful teachings about jewish people going on in the palestinian schools in the middle east and in some muslim schools here in the united states no condemnation or rejection at all could be found anywhere and yet anyone that cares to see the kind of hateful biased nasty things that are being said about jewish and israeli people just need let our office know there are people in israel there are web sites that can provide that information theyve gotten copies of textbooks there are commercials that are run there are great events that palestinian areas in factthat are even named for palestinian terrorists islamic jihadists that blew themselves up and killed a lot of israelis and yet we have no condemnation from this administration of any of that type activity israel of course is repeatedly warned by this administration to be nicer to the palestinians and we cant find any evidence that this administration has ever warned the palestinians quit inciting hatred in your children for jewish or israeli people and the list goes on helping us assess the evidence of whether president obama is for or really against israel since his comment this week hes not going to tell us any more how he feels about israel well just look at the evidence continuing we remember not long after president obama came into office he traveled to turkey to iraq saudi arabia egypt apologized to them on behalf of the united states somebody uses really good word choices a beautiful group of words about the united states being divisive and dismissive anyway really nice words in what many dubbed as the apology tour that really was not a strong sign of love and affection for israel and then we have the fact that this president although he went on an apology tour all around our socalled ally israel he never actually went to israel i dont know you cant blame him maybe hed be concerned that prime minister netanyahu would leave him sitting around twiddling his thumbs while prime minister netanyahu went and had dinner with his family but ive met with prime minister netanyahu im not anybody and yet he took time and was very punctual in his meeting so i really dont think the president should have to worry that prime minister netanyahu might try to snub him the same way i think president obama would find prime minister netanyahu to be very congenial as he normally is although again we go back to the presidents comments when he didnt know the mic was open indicating he didnt have a lot of love for having to deal with prime minister netanyahu every day so as for now until we actually have a visit from president obama to israel that really has to go into the loves israel not category and then of course we have the obama administrations support for the muslim brotherhoods rise to power in egypt this administration was encouraging mubarak to step down get out of the way and actually made quite interesting quotes about the radical islamist protesters in egypt but anyway they supported the muslim brotherhoods rise to power in egypt and have reached out in numerous ways to the muslim brotherhood thinking that this may really be a good thing indicating a great thing for the middle east well it may be a good thing for the muslim brotherhood but we have the documentation the quotes are easily accessible about what the muslim brotherhood truly stands for and they want to see israel gone so some would say well its a good thing when any administration reaches out to a people but if that people if the leaders of a group are demanding that a dear close friendly ally be wiped off of the map and have to live under a caliphate not judaism which the president says he knows more about than any other president apparentlybut live under a caliphate which of course as ahmadinejad believes the 12th imam the mahdi will be coming back anyway that really wasnt showing a lot of love for israel of course israel expressed a great deal of concern they had concerns about what was going on in egypt mubarak was a problematic man a problematic leader but at least he was trying to keep up the agreement the treaty with israel he at least made some pretense that he was trying to protect the egyptianisraeli border now we have the muslim brotherhood who has no such intention and it didnt take an intelligence department to advise this administration of that it certainly should have been clear yet in 2011 president obama was calling the radical islamist protesters in egypt an inspiration to people around the world and he stated he supported a new regime in egypt well you had radical islamists you had the muslim brotherhood and as we see in these elections as they go forward the muslim brotherhood is taking charge and they have no interest in agreeing to the treaties that have long since been made with israel although they have come back and said well we might put it up to a vote the same people who are voting the muslim brotherhood into power because they know the muslim brotherhood wants to see israel gone will obviously not be supporting a treaty so those kinds of comments that put israel at such extreme risk on their border just cannot be deemed to be an indication of a loves israel its more a loves israel not then we have the fact that though syrian leader assad has been ruthless in killing and abusing his people and has not been helpful to israel to the extent egyptian leader mubarak was this administration the obama administration has failed to support the syrian rebels the way it did the egyptian rebels that has really been interesting to see how that developed for example in libya gosh the president says he didnt need support from congress because there were people like nato and the muslim brotherhood there were folks who wanted us to help get rid of qadhafi well qadhafi was sure no angel and he certainly had blood on his hands but qadhafi was not a threat to israel and this administration militarilymilitarilysupported the people who are a threat to israel unapologetically now there were some games some wordsmanship gameswordsmithing went on by this administrationsaying look look this is really a nato action guess who makes up 60 percent or more of the nato military guess who gives more to nato than anybody else its the united states so it was a little bit of sleight of hand to say you know libya really is more of a nato action its not really us it is very clear this administration has not demanded the ouster of a leader with blood on his hands who continues to abuse and kill syrians who want some freedom this administration hasnt supported those rebels the way they did in libya and the way the administration called for mubarak to be goneforcefully so thats also a loves israel not then youve got to note that the obama administrations support for giving israels enemies money and weapons has been at the same time israel has been given assistance thats not showing a lot of love for israel but the obama administration has supported providing israel financial aid that they can use to buy unitedstates weapons for israels defense well now theres a good one to show some love for israel so this administration has shown some love for israel by pushing to provide them with financial aid to buy unitedstates weapons for their own defense unfortunately that comes at the same time the administration keeps supporting israels enemiesgiving them money pushing to give them money and weaponsat the same time israel is getting that same assistance then there is one other thing that i think is worthy of note i believe it was 2 years agoin may 2 years ago i believethat the obama administration voted with israels enemies to require israel to disclose any and all nuclear capabilities or weapons israel is a tiny country in the middle of a number of countries and of hostile peoples that want to see israel gone and nobody has made that more clear than ahmadinejad it is certainly worthy of note that it was right after this administration parted from decades of tradition of support for israeland their very tenuous situation there in the middle eastthat it sided with all of israels enemies and voted to require them to disclose all they really had that could protect them it brought to mind that story from the old testament about king hezekiah and how king hezekiah was confronted by isaiah those of us who believe whats printed there believe that god sent the prophet to confront hezekiah and he basically said what have you done with these people from babylon with these leaders that came over from babylon this is a texas paraphrase but basically king hezekiah said oh i took these babylonian leaders around and i showed them all our treasure and i showed them all the defenses we have in the armory in essence hezekiah was told by isaiah you fool because you have done this youre going to lose your country and he did actually he begged the lord to let it not be on his watch and it ends up being under his sons but thats another story the point here that came to mind though is we were demanding that israel do what hezekiah similarly did which made their country vulnerable and caused them to lose their countryand we voted with israels enemies to demand that this administration did congress would never have voted in the majority to do such a thing but this obama administration did its a dangerous time in the world and its time for america not to be stupid some have referred to israel as being the free worlds miners canary because as people know in the old days before sensitive electronic equipment canaries were taken into mines so that if noxious poisonous gas began to fill the air the canary would die before the miners would and if the canary keeled over dead the miners would know theyve got to get out or they could be next our assistance to israel is as a democracy in the middle of a hostile world a hostile area with people who want to see our type of freedom and liberty gone whose very definition of the word freedom means freedom to worship under a joint caliphate under sharia law but israels definition of freedom is like ours we should be supporting israel we should not be supporting israels enemies those who have studied history you know that when a nations enemies see that nations strongest ally pulling away from him thats when their enemies move against them so was it any surprise that after the obama administration voted with israels enemies to make israel more vulnerable that all of a sudden here came a flotilla to challenge the lawful blockade of the gaza strip that israel had to at least try to ensure their own protection of course that was a disastrous and embarrassing time for israel but i cant help but believe it goes back to this administration telling israels enemies were standing with you and not with israel yes this administration has gone back and issued statements to the contrary but when you look at the evidence look at the unguarded evidence look at the leaks look at the support for whom it still keeps coming back that even though this president says im not going to answer any more questions about whether or not i support israel the evidence is clear i hope in the ensuing months between now and the next inauguration that this administration will go out of its way to assure israels enemies that despite the overwhelming evidence that israel is not loved by this administration from past actions and comments that it will take action if for no other reason than to try to help this administration win some votes that its been losing i dont really care what the reason is i care about supporting our allies supporting those who stand for liberty who will allow freedom of worship by muslims freedom of worship by christians freedom of worship by other groups in israel that jews and christians are not afforded in other countries that this administration keeps sucking up to the evidence seems pretty clear it keeps coming backdespite some minor indications to the contrarythat this administration loves israel not with that i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.43649348616600037, 0.43649348616600037, 0, "i thank the gentleman for bringing this issue before the house it is rare that a person can impact your life in a very strong way it is almost never that a person can impact your life in a very strong way on different ends of the spectrum in 1970 i graduated from college i had drawn a very low draft number earlier in my college career i had joined the air force rotc in order to avoid going to vietnam in the middle of my college career but as an rotc graduate i then had an obligation to go to pilot training i attended pilot training and then went overseas i was assigned to the c130s we were stationed at clark air base in the philippines but most of our missions were in vietnam for the next year and a half thats where i was on one particular mission there in that time of 1971 and 1972 i was a copilot who was flying into cambodia now at that time we were supposedly not going into cambodia and we were supposedly not going into laos but we were in and out on several trips that day that evening when i got back to the boq to the quarters there at korat air force base which i think is where we were stationed at that time for 2 weeks i was interested to see that president nixon was on tv the camera zoomed in very close to him and he described that american soldiers were not in or around cambodia that that mission was not one that we as soldiers were fulfilling now having just been in and out around cambodia the entire day that struck me as unusual that a president would say things that were completely untrue that i knew to be untrue in my heart i began to believe that he could have said i dont think the american people have a right to know he could have said its secret and thats classified information but he came out with the camera looking him square in the face and he said that we were not there now maybe he did not know ill give him that yet when i got back to the unitedstates and had found out about watergatethat was beginning to unravelthe idea of who to vote for in those 1972 elections was ever present on my mind his opponent there was no chance i would vote for him his opponent was eugene mccarthy i would not vote for him but i ended up filling my ballot out that neither man was qualified or deserved this office i did not vote for a president that year simply because of my personal experience then in watching this whole problem with watergate chuck colson haldeman those guys who were insidethe plumbersit began to give me a sense that this was a very bad point in my life and that mr colson was a part of that group that was willing to mislead a nation that was willing to say things that werent true at the end of the day president nixon as you know stepped down he gave up his office because of misdeeds that a small group of them pulled together now it was with that background that i knew chuck colson for most of my life then in 2003 when i arrived here at the capitol when being first elected to the unitedstates house of representatives i started going to just a very small lecture series and it was hosted by a gentleman named chuck colson it didnt take long to make the association but he was bringing in some of the best christian worldview thinkers in the entire country and i was able to experience mr colson in a far different way than that remote acquaintance i had made in the early seventies in this way he was one of the most compelling thinkers in the country it was he who said that he lived in the dark until he saw the light it was he who committed himself to a different view of the world one that said that we must have redemption that we must have a savior that there is no hope for us as human beings if we are not to deal with those problems that each one of us faces in our lives as he began to develop his insights and began to be one of the premier organizers of the christian worldview bringing in literally people from around him he established his pillars for glorifying god through the works that we do those pillars are one prepare well two keep an eye on the horizon rather than up close to you three engage and enlist others four run assessments five seek the abiding fruit not just that that is temporary and finally have guidelines that you have applied it is in those principles of glorifying god that mr colson really developed a presence that affected the world and affected my life significantly he began to compel those of us attending this lecture series in this house of representatives in one of the rooms beneath us to enlist those around us to be a light that shines out to others to let our lives be different to let our lives be the equivalent of salt and light which are rubbed so to speak into the fabric of the american mindset so that those around us will know that they have embraced a lie it was mr colson who told me the most dramatic thing his perception wasand i believe it is still the greatest problem facing america he said is truth we dont know the truth in this country anymore its not revered as we dont know the truth then we see the fragments of society beginning to come loose around us i hear my own daughter and grandchildren say which side is right theyre all saying different things when we as a nation walk away from the concept of truth when we as elected officials fail to honor our obligations to speak the truth as we know it when our courts declare that there is no truth then the nation truly does suffer he made that extraordinarily clear and lived it in his life its at that point that i began to be compelled that i should be more honest and transparent in my own faith not that i would go out and be interrupting people and thrusting myself into their consciousness but that they would look and see theres something different they would say maybe we can trust that viewpoint so it is with sincere appreciation to my friend who is honoring chuck colson with this time tonightbecause i believe that the nation has lost one of the premier thinkers one of the premier people who would guide us along a path who would give us a wakeup call saying that we must find that salvation we must find that way back when things have gone wrong he was speaking from his experience of having gone so desperately wrong at a young age being upheld and lifted into the very white house in this country and having stumbled so badly he could speak with experience saying we all have to come back there are things that every single one of us slip into that eventually were going to want to change course its through his example through his words through his values through his ideas that i know there are many here in this congress who have lived a different life because of those ideas he came to new mexico a couple of years ago they had a large conference on the weekend again i remember the same clarity the same professionalism the same looking toward the horizon there at that conference in new mexico as we heard in this building here he was a constant he was refreshing to speak so openly about his problems he was never able to let them loose never get them away from him never get that stain off of him but he embraced that yes thats who he was and now he was different that he had lived in the dark until he had seen the light each one of us if we were to make those same understandings and give those same acknowledgements i believe would live better and more transparent lives with truth being a greater part of that life and i think the nation would be better off for us living as it is for him having lived we mourn his passing but we also glorify god that he was placed into our midst that he might truly shine the light of truth into the darkness that he found around him my friend i will stay around to hear what else we have thank you very much"], [0.4365719258785248, 0.4365719258785248, 0, "on the 8th day of march 1956 a scientist geologist by the name of m king hubbert spoke to an audience in san antonio texas the audience was a bunch of oil people he gave what i think is going to be recognized as the most important speech of the last century it was really a very audacious speech at that time the united states was king of oil we produced more oil we sold more oil and we consumed more oil than any nation in the world m king hubbert told that group of oil geologists and company executives that in just 14 short years the united states would reach its maximum oil production that no matter what they did after that their oil production would decline this was an incredible speech essentially no one believed it because as i say at that time the united states was the king of oil producing more shipping more consuming more than any other nation in the world for a number of years m king hubbert was a pariah nobody believed him he was kind of relegated to the lunatic fringe in 1980 10 years after his prediction that the united states would reach its maximum oil production you could look back and what you saw is shown on this chart this of course goes out beyond that year what you see is what happened then the united states did reach its maximum oil production in 1970 after that the production fell off no matter what we did now there was a little blip on the downside because we found a lot of oil in alaska you can see it there on the chart and we found a lot of oil in the gulf of mexico the yellow that you see there there was a little blip on the down slope and m king hubbert had not included in his predictions the oil that we would find in alaska and the gulf of mexico he included only the lower 48 this chart shows where that oil came from a lot of it came from texas the biggest single source of oil the first oil of course was found in pennsylvania and part of the rest of the usa then you have natural gas liquids on the top as we found and used more and more natural gas the natural gas liquids increased thats not gas in your gas tank thats propane and butane and things like that this is something that could have hardly been believed how could a country as creative and innovative as the united states possibly not be able to continue to produce more and more oil when they needed more and more oil what m king hubbert did was a pretty simple thing oil had been pumped for long enough50 years or soby that time that they had some idea of what went on in a field and the production in an individual oil field followed kind of a bellshaped curve as you pumped the field you got more and more and then when you reached the top it became harder and harder to get the oil and so it fell off as you went down the other side of the bell curve and so what he reasoned was if i can make some estimate of how many oil fields there will be in the united states and i add up all those little oil fields all those little bell curves ill get a big bell curve and that will tell me when were going to reach our maximum production in the united states just about a year later another speech was given i dont know if these two gentlemen knew each other at all but this other speech was given by the father of our nuclear submarine hyman rickover hyman rickover spoke to a group of physicians the audience is irrelevant he spoke to a group of physicians in st paul minnesota and he said something that should have been selfevident but obviously they werent because nobody else was saying them and nobody has said them much since then what he said in this speech was that in the 8 000year recorded history of man the age of oil would be but a blip and he referred to it as this golden age here are a few quotes from that speech by the way you can find it on the internet if you simply google for rickover and energy speech it will come up it was lost for a number of years and a few years ago it was found and put on the internet and what he says here seems to be axiomatic there is nothing man can do to rebuild exhausted fossil fuel reserves they were created by solar energy he says 500 million years ago and took eons to grow to their present volume in the face of the basic fact that fossil fuels are finite they will run out the exact length of time these reserves will last is important in only one respect the longer they last the more time do we have to invent ways of living off renewable or substitute energy sources and to adjust our economy to the vast changes which we can expect from such a shift now this would seem to be as i said axiomatic obviously the moon isnt made out of green cheese and the earth isnt made out of oil it is finite one day it will run out and so it is obvious that one day one will have to come to grips with this you will have to find alternative energy sources just when is that time for the world when we ran out of our ability to produce more oil when we wanted more oil was in 1970 but the united states was the first great industrialized nation and so we would expect that we would reach that point before the rest of the world just when would the rest of the world reach that point i love this statement fossil fuels resemble capital in the bank a prudent and responsible parent will use his capital sparingly in order to pass on to his children as much as possible of his inheritance a selfish and irresponsible parent will squander it in riotous living and care not one whit about how his offspring will fare i have 10 children 17 grandchildren and two greatgrandchildren particularly my greatgrandchildren and some of my grandchildren will look back and they will ask themselves how could they have done it how could they have gone on feverishly looking for and drilling for oil when it was obvious that it was finite when it was obvious that there would come a time when we would have to transition from oil to alternative sources of energy now this is a warning from the past but that wasnt the only warning that we were going to have because your government has paid for four separate studies of this problem and the phenomenon is called peak oil thats the time at which you reach your maximum production capability and after that no matter what you do production will fall off as we saw earlier that happened in the united states in 1970 by the way by 1980 it was painfully obvious that m king hubbert was right because looking back those 10 years we say gee we really did peak in 1970 didnt we and were tipped over and starting down the other side now your government paid for four studies why four because they didnt like what the first one said and so they ordered another one and didnt like what that one said so a third and then a fourth i have quotes here from two of those studies the first of those studies was a study by saic and the primary author of that study was robert hirsch and its usually referred to as the hirsch report it was issued in 2005 these are just a couple of quotes from that world production of conventional oil will reach a maximum and decline thereafter that maximum is called the peak a number of confident forecasters project peaking within a decade others contend it will occur later prediction of the peaking is very difficult because of geological complexities measurement problems pricing variations demand elasticity and political influences peaking will happen but the timing is uncertain the world they said has never faced a problem like this without massive mitigation more than a decade before the fact before peaking occurs the problem will be pervasive and will not be temporary we had a temporary problem with the arab oil embargo in the seventies this will not be temporary previous energy transitionswood to coal and coal to oilwere gradual and evolutionary oil peaking will be abrupt and revolutionary the report said we were very comfortable living in this golden age as it is referred to by the father of our nuclear submarine hyman rickover he noted that the incredible amount of energy and oil permitted us to live a very highquality life as compared to our ancestors who had not yet found how to tap into the enormous riches of fossil fuels when i first heard this statistic i was stunned i said to myself it cant be true one barrel of oilthats 42 gallonsone barrel of oil has the energy equivalent of 25 000 manhours of effort thats 12 people working all year a barrel of oil has the energy equivalent of 12 people working all year long wow that seems incredible doesnt it and then i thought i drive a prius and it takes me about 50 miles on a gallon of gasoline not very big a gallon of gasoline now i could pull my prius that 50 miles but it would take me a long time with the comealongs and the chains and hooking to the guardrail and trees i could get the prius that 50 miles wow i said maybe there are 25 000 manhours of work in one barrel of oil now it wasnt very long ago that oil was worth 12 a barrel that means that you could buy the lifeenhancing effects of having a fulltime servant work for you all year long and you could buy it at the well head for 1 if you look around the world and see the quality of life that most of the worlds people live it is really quite incredible compared to the quality of life that our ancestors lived before they found how to tap into the enormous potential of fossil fuels there was another report which issued in 2005 and that was a report by the corps of engineers and here is a quote from that report in general all nonrenewable resources follow a natural simple curveproduction increases rapidly slows reaches a peak and then declines at a rapid pace similar to its initial increase this is the bell curve the curve that m king hubbert had noted that permitted him to make his prediction as to when the united states would reach its maximum oil production the major question for petroleum is not whether production will peak but when it will peak there are many estimates of recoverable petroleum reserves giving rise to many estimates of when peak oil will occur and how high the peak will be a careful review of all the estimates leads to the conclusion that world oil production may peak within a few short years after which it will decline your government didnt like what these two studies said and so there were two more studies ordered one from the government accountability office and the fourth one from the national petroleum council i do not have quotes from these two but they say essentially the same thing that the peaking of oil is inevitable with potentially catastrophic consequences since your government didnt want to hear what these reports said it didnt pay any attention to what the reports said and we have gone on with policies of drill baby drill just recently there have been two more reports that tell us where we arethey also look at where we have beenand they make their prediction of where we are going the first of these reports is the one on top that issued in 08 and the people who issued it were the iea the international energy agency they are a creature of the oecd a consortium of major industrial countries there is a similar organization the energy information administration which is a part of our department of energy and they do similar things and have published similar curves but this is the iea the international energy agency the blue part of the chart here represents conventional oil now if they had a long enough chart it would go back here about 100 or more years we started pumping way back here when we didnt need much and so we didnt pump much and every time we needed more oil we could find more oil and we could pump more oil and weve been doing that now for right at 150 years and so here we are now and what they show in this chart is the total liquid fuelsthats the line up herehas been plateaued you can see its flat there at 84 million barrels a day weve been stuck there for 5 years now were in a recession worldwide we arent using as much oil as we might use and still oil hovers near 100 a barrel a couple 3 years ago when the worlds economy including ours kind of had a momentary collapse the oil prices dropped down to 40 a barrel but the reality of the supply compared to the demand the prices steadily rose until oil is right at 100 a barrel now what this chart showed was a fairly significant dropoff in the production of oil from our conventional oil field this is following the same curve you note that was followed by the united states after 1970 so our 1970 plateau is the worlds plateau that occurredwhat 05 to 09 something like that was roughly when their curve occurred the chart here has several other contributions to our liquid fuels the top on here is natural gas liquids and you saw that in the previous chart thats propane and butane and liquids like that the green one under it is nonconventional oil that is growing and that will grow thats oil from places like the oil sands of alberta canada where they have a lift there a shovel that can lift 100 tons at a time it dumps it into a truck that hauls 400 tons and then they haul it to a big cooker and they heat it up so that the oil will flow it wont flow otherwise they have a large amount of what we call stranded natural gas stranded natural gas is natural gas that is where you dont have very many people and since it cant be movedits not a liquid its a gas and its difficult to move long distances so its cheaper when its stranded and so theyre using this stranded natural gas as an energy source to warm this oil up so that it will flow the next little wedge there a dark red wedge really is a part of the dark blue one down here its enhanced oil recovery its the additional oil we get by pumping live steam down there or pumping seawater down there or pushing c02 down there to push it out enhanced oil recovery that is growing that will grow because were finding more ways of doing that then they show two wedges to keep this production line going up because they think it should go up and so well just find some oil so that it will go up the light blue here is oil from the fields that weve found but are too difficult to develop like the field in the gulf of mexico that is under 7 000 feet of water andwhat 30 000 feet of rock its way down there as the price of oil goes up why more and more of these fields will be feasibly economically developed the bright red wedge there is a wedge of fields yet to be discovered because they predictably cannot get enough oil from the fields that we have discovered theyre too difficult to develop now so well need to find some new fields notice that by 2030 they have predicted that we would rise from our current 84 million barrels of oil a day to about 106 million barrels of oil a day now this same organization the iea issued another chart 2 years later in 10 and this chart is pretty different it shows of course the same plateau actually they show a little dip here is it starting down or is that simply an undulation at the plateau they have reversed the top two contributions and given them different colors but theyre the same thing this is natural gas liquids the purple one and the yellow one is nonconventional oil production notice that they dont show the little wedge here for enhanced oil recovery they have included it where it ought to be simply as a part of the production from the current oil fields and notice they go out to 35 rather than 30 in this chart they go out 5 years further and they show a really precipitous reduction in the amount of oil that were going to get from the fields that were presently pumping and so to keep this curve going up because it must go up if the world is going to have any opportunity for a growing economy to keep the curve going up they are predicting two huge wedges that will come from the fields that we have now discovered the too difficult to develop and fields yet to be discovered there is little confidence that these prognostications will occur the united states could not do this we are the most creative innovative society in the world and we could not reverse the decline of oil production in our country and most of those who are serious students in this area do not believe that these two wedges will occur so it is very probable that what the world is going to do is what the united states has done and that is that it will tip over and there will be ever less and less oil harder and harder to get and more and more expensive the next chart kind of puts this in a global perspective this is a chart which shows what the size of the countries of the world would look like if their size were relevant to the amount of oil reserves that they have and you notice here that saudi arabia dominates the world thats because saudi arabia maywe arent really sure because they wont open their books saudi arabia may have 22 percent of all the reserves in the world you may remember oh 6 weeks or a couple months ago there was a wikileaks expose that said that maybe the saudis had overestimated their oil reserves by as much as 40 percent so the map might not look quite like this but relatively like this now why would they overestimate their reserves when opec couldnt produce more oil than they were producing and they were all anxious for more revenues opec decided that they would limit their production so as to keep the price of oil up and so they permitted each of the countries to pump a percentage of their reserves and so if you look back at the history of this you will see that without finding any new fields their reserves could go up 50 percent sometimes their reserves doubled it was kind of a contest amongst liars because the more you said you had the more you could pump because you could pump a percentage of what your reserves were so we really arent sure what these reserves are because they will not open their books but its roughly like this certainly the largest reserves of all the oil are in saudi arabia look at those countries around them iran and iraq and kuwait little kuwait that looks like a province down there in the corner of iraq and look how much oil they have the united arab emirates you can hardly find them on a map now i want you to look for the countries on the map that have the largest economic activity and thats the united states we represent a fourth of all the economic activity in the world were one person out of 22 and we have a fourth of all the good things in the world its really interesting to ask yourself how come what is so different about the united states that this one person out of 22 has a fourth of all the good things in the world that is a subject for another time and we will come and talk about that but its an interesting challenge why look at the united states here we have only 2 percent of the reserves of oil in the world and we use 25 percent of the oil in the world now look at europe its hard to find them on this map isnt it europe collectively is economically a bit bigger than the united states and theyre even in worse shape than we are as far as having oil reserves they are almost totally dependent on oil which is shipped in and now look to find the two countries that have between them better than 21 2 billion people out of our 7 billion people in the world china and india see them over here tiny tiny they have very small reserves of oil last year the chinese bought 13 million cars we struggled to sell 12 million cars china is now the worlds largest polluter they just passed us were number two in that category chinas economy is growing very rapidly their demands for oil are increasing rapidly i do not have the chart here but china is buying up oil all over the world i asked the state department why would china buy oil we have only 2 percent we use 25 percent were not buying oil anywhere i said why would china buy oil you see you get your oil today by going to the global oil auction and if you have the moneyits dollars today lets hope it stays that if it turns to yen or euros were going to be in a heap of trouble and if you have the money you get the oil so youre not benefited at all by owning oil today the state departments answer was im not sure china understands the marketplace wow a country at that time growing at 14 percent i think china understands the marketplace i think they understand that there is such a thing as peak oil well do they understand that five years ago i led a codel to china this holiday season i was in shanghai on new years eve nine of us went to talk about energy china began their discussion of energy by talking about postoil of course there will be a postoil world its not today were not running out of oil thats not what were running out of there is a lot of oil left there is more oil left than all of the oil we have used in all of the worlds history up to now what were running out of is our ability to produce that oil at the increasing rate to meet increasing demands were not running out there will be oil for another 150 years ever less and less more and more expensive harder and harder to get our time is running out if you have only one chart to look at this would be the chart this is when we discovered oil way back there huge amounts of oil this dark heavy line here is our consumption of oil you need to kind of thank the arabs or their arab oil embargo if they hadnt had that in the seventies look where this curve would be it would have gone off the top of the chart that woke us up your air conditioner now is probably three times as efficient as your air conditioner was then well we will return to talk about what can we do about this today we talked only about the problem its a huge problem were equal to that problem well be back and talk about how we respond to the problem i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.43709561228752136, 0.43709561228752136, 0, "i want to thank the gentleman from colorado for his leadership on this issue not only on the committee on energy and commerce but also as a leader on the house energy action team someone that understands that there is no national security without energy security its been said many times by not only members of congress but by leaders from all across the administration this administration and past and so its something i firmly believe in let me remind the american people that just recently the president of the united states decided that he was going to kill the keystone xl pipeline a pipeline that would come from our friends to the north in canada where technology has allowed them to harvest the oil from the oil sands in alberta and bring that crude oil down to refining capacity that we have here in this country thats why the keystone xl pipeline was so crucial not only would we be buying oil from a country that likes us our largest and best trading partner canada but we would also be bringing oil to the refineries in the gulf states the refineries in oklahoma the refineries in mississippi alabama louisiana and texas that have the capacity due to the policy of this administration creating a moratorium on expanded offshore drilling in the united states and the moratorium and poor policies that have kept us from harvesting american resources to meet american energy needs i believe in american energy security and american energy independence and lessening our dependence on foreign sources of oil lessening our dependence on middle eastern oil a lot of times from countries that dont like us very much but let me read you the presidents own words when he decided that he was going to kill the keystone xl pipeline when he was going to kill the hundreds of thousands of jobs that would have been saved and createdtruenot only shovelready jobs but jobs that exist today in the refineries in the gulf coast states so not only kill those jobs but hurt american energy independence outside of having american energy independence why not north american energy independence why not trade with canada but this is the presidents own words he said im disappointed that republicans in congress forced this decision but it does not change my administrations commitment to americanmade energy that creates jobs and reduces our dependence on oil not reduces our dependence on foreign oil not reduces our dependence on middle eastern oil but listen clearly the president said lessen our dependence on oil that is the policy of this administration to end our dependence on oil and promote green energy to throw your tax dollars at companies like solyndra instead of relying on the free market to pick the winners and the losers allowing what works to work and what doesnt to fall by the wayside and allow american ingenuity and american entrepreneurism to chase the things that work and throw their investment dollars personal investment dollars into the technologies that they believe in the free market the investors believe in instead of doing that he took your tax dollars america he decided that he was going to pick winners for you and he was going to invest those dollars in companies like solyndra and many others as the weeks unfold well realize that your tax dollars were invested in companies that you wouldnt have invested in yourselves because you would have made smart decisions america can make smart decisions thats what makes us great but his own words said that he wants to reduce our dependence on oil i go back to secretary chu the secretary of the department of energy in his own words that he thinks we ought to be paying the same for gasoline as those in europe are paying 8 9agallon gasoline and trust me were headed there last month was the most expensive january ever for retail gasoline as prices averaged out at 3 37 a gallon according to the oil price information service in new jersey thats compared with the previous record average for the month of january that was 3 091 2 cents a gallon and that was set last year in 2010 january gasoline prices averaged just 2 71 a gallon its the policies of this administration and its moratorium on us harvesting american resources were not talking just about offshore oil in the deep waters off the gulf of mexico or off the coast of alaska were not talking about just anwr and it being off limits were talking about the bakken oil fields were talking about oil reserves on federal lands that are currently offlimits from american energy development and american energy production but guess what that same bakken oil field spills over into north dakota that bakken oil field is on stateowned and privateowned property and you know what north dakota has a 3 percent or less unemployment rate its an energy economy that is booming because its on state and federal land and they said hey come harvest our oil resources north dakota is thriving on an energy economy and youll hear from the gentleman from texas momentarily they will show you in texas and oklahoma and other states that had energy that youre seeing an energy economy thrive but thats not the policies of this administration the policy of this administration is to chase green energy jobs to chase wind power and solar power and promote it in areas that really it shouldnt be promoted so let me just say one other thing that president obama is definitely being misleading when hes talking about that 75 percent of our offshore resources are open the real number should be in acres listen to this of the 1 76 billion acres on the unitedstates outer continental shelf only 38 million acres or a mere 2 16 percent is actually leased for energy development north america possesses 1 79 trillion barrels in recoverable resources enough oil to fuel every passenger car in the united states for 430 years more than six times approved reserves in saudi arabia in the last 30 years we produced over 150 percent of our approved resources but let me talk just quickly about jobs because when the attack from the administration is on big oil and on the oil industry and natural gas industry thats trying to help with american energy independence the attacks just not on big oil companies that are harvesting and exploring and producing oil offshore in the western gulf of mexico that image may be conjured up as we talk about that but its the attack on the jobs if you think about an oil platform thats out there drilling for oil youre thinking about an oil production platform thats out there producing the oil after the oil wells drilled and we put a moratorium in place and we say were not going to do anymore of that were going to cancel all the lease sales and keep in mind it takes years to plan the next lease sale i was on the 5year planning subcommittee that dealt with that and i know that its a multiyear process before the first lease sale happens and when that lease sale happens oil companies have to drag those rigs out there theyve got to first figure out where that oil might be on that grid square that they just leased and then theyve got to bring the drilling platform out there and theyve got to drill that well ofttimes going many miles down into the earths surface to find the oil and to decide whether its recoverable whether theres enough resources there for them to plant a platform and start producing that oil thats a multiyear process but set that aside a minute when we have a moratorium on that process heres what happens its not just big oil and the oil companies that are penalized in that its the guys that work on those drilling rigs out there in the gulf of mexico its also the guys that take them supplies their diesel fuel to run their generators their food to transfer the men back and forth that are doing the work from on shore out there to those facilities its the companies that manufacture the pipe and the casing that support that industry and as jeff landry will tell you louisianas economy is hurting its hurting not because of big oil hurting its hurting because of the little guys back home that dont get to supply that pipe they dont get to thread that pipe and fit that pipe they dont get to weld and they dont get to service that industry they dont get the opportunity to go out there and work on those rigs they dont get to take that drilling mud out there you know it takes a lot of effort to go out into the gulf of mexico and actually start harvesting those natural resources and its the little guy back home that is now bankrupt because his small company that provided the welding necessary for the piping he doesnt have that work now and so the gulf coast states due to the presidents moratorium out there not only lost the revenue that they would get from the royalties of offshore drilling that other states would benefit from as well as a side note if we allowed more drilling on the outer continental shelf on the eastern coast and off the coast of alaska but its the little guy louisiana is not getting the revenue and then the guys that are being put out of work that are providing the welding and the pipe fitting and the pipe itself and the offshore industries theyre not able to work either and so theyre drawing unemployment benefits which further cramps the strained budgets of the gulf coast states so theyre drawing unemployment benefits theyre not paying taxes so the state revenues in louisiana mississippi alabama texas are strained because theyre not receiving those tax revenues theyre not receiving the corporate revenues from thriving energybased companies that are providing jobs and payroll and paying into unemployment and providing corporate tax returns it is a tremendous trickledown effect when we stop harvesting resources its a tremendous trickledown effect to those gulf states economies but i will tell you in south carolina when my constituents have to pay more and more of their hardearned dollars to put fuel in their vehicles whether its gasoline or diesel fuel in their vehicle to go to work and theyve got to think about that first hour that theyre working just went to pay the gas that it took them to get there when theyre digging deeper into that wallet to take out money to buy more and more gasoline just to go earn the money that theyre going to turn around and use to buy the gasoline its a vicious cycle weve got the ability gentleman from colorado weve got the ability to lower gas prices in this country and i simply look at natural gas and the prices have come down in natural gas because we found an abundance of it in this country we found new technology that allows us to harvest those natural gas resources as youll hear from the gentleman from new york later when he talks about the marcellus gas shelf and harvesting natural gas in new york and pennsylvania but we also talk about oklahoma and natural gas there we have an abundance of natural gas weve seen the price go down even in an adverse regulatory climate even in an adverse tax climate that weve got in this economy under this administration natural gas prices have gone down because theres two factors that affect pricing of any commodity supply and demand now world demand is down world demand is down on a lot of things because we have a bad economy but the number one driver for natural gas in this country is supply the supply is going out the roof were an exporter of natural gas america is sitting on the reserves to be energy independent and to provide other parts of the world with the natural resources that weve been blessed with here in this country so america needs to realize that the policies of this administration are keeping this country from harvesting its resources and being truly energy independent and providing the goodpaying longterm energysector jobs and if youre looking for a job america i recommend you go to one of these energyproducing states whether its oklahoma or texas or even to north dakota where the unemployment rate is 3 percent or less where you can earn up to 70 000 a year driving a water truck if thats any indication of the goodpaying jobs that are out there energy as a segue to job creation is the answer to get us out of this economy"], [0.43769368529319763, 0.43769368529319763, 0, "i appreciate my friend yielding its such an honor to pay tribute to such a great man as chuck colson i first read about chuck colson of course after the watergate event occurred and all of the events surrounding it and then i was in law school when i read his book born again it sounded like this was a brilliant man who really and truly had had a conversion experience life had been materially changed then again there are those who as a judge i saw that would get in trouble and grab a bible and say im changed so go easy on me things like that but this really appeared quite genuine with chuck colson and i knew as the bible teaches well be known by our fruits what incredible fruits this man produced amazing so over the years i stayed in touch he didnt know me personally during those years but i listened to cassettes of his sermons his lectures that tells you how far back it goesthey were cassettes then i listened to cds of him speaking and his lectures and sermons and i would read his books thank god he was so prolific that he was moved to write such extraordinary books in fact i came to realize with this kind of brillianceand others have pointed this out but it struck me back in the eightiesthis is a modernday apostle paul he has that kind of intellect that kind of ability and yet hes able to discuss anything with anybody on any level but his life is a living breathing walking testimonial i love the quote that steven curtis chapman used in chuck colsons own voice in heaven and the real world where you hear chucks voice say these things chuck said i meet millions who tell me that they feel demoralized by the decay around us where is the hope the hope that each of us has is not in who governs us or what laws are passed or what great things we do as a nation our hope is in the power of god working through the hearts of people and thats where our hope is in this country thats where our hope is in life as he pointed out on more than one occasion our hopethe kingdom of godwill not arrive on air force one and any hope of that happening is just misplaced well i have a brother about 8 years younger now a baptist pastor near richmond and bill had acquired chuck colsons new novel called gideons torch and as a man who had worked in the white house to have him write a novel which as you read it breathlessly you realize these things could easily happen every one of them just as he spells out it was an incredible book when i met chuck colson i asked him are you going to write any other novels that was just a fantastic novel and he said my publisher tells me people are not buying my fiction they want my nonfiction and i want god to use me however he can use me if its more productive more helpful to people to write nonfiction ill write nonfiction he also said writing gideons torch a novel was far more difficult than writing the nonfiction which he does im not sure that its still in print but i would hope that after his passing there would be a resurgence of requests and people would get that book and greatly grow and benefit from it i just wanted to share a couple of things from his book god and government he came to the hill to provide this to many of us as my friends here know one of the benefits of being in congressand there are plenty of things that arent benefitsbut one of the benefits is getting to become friends with people you have as heroes and chuck colson was one of my heroes he was someone i truly looked up to and i benefited from and even before he knew me he was a mentor at page 69 he says whether or not gods existence can be proved the evidence can be rationally probed and weighed author c s lewis does so compellingly and he cites moral law as a key piece of evidence clearly it is not man who has perpetuated the precepts and values that have survived through centuries and across cultures indeed he has done his best to destroy them the nature of the law restrains man and thus its very survival presupposes a stronger force behind it god or consider the most readily observable physical evidence the nature of the universe one cannot look at the stars planets and galaxies millions of light years away all fixed in perfect harmony without asking who orders them for centuries it was accepted that god was behind the universe because otherwise the origin and purpose of life would be inexplicable this traditional supposition was unchallenged until the 18th centurys age of reason when enlightenment thinkers announced with relief that the origins of the universe were now scientifically explainable but in the past few decades science has completely reversed itself on the question of the origin of the universe after maintaining for centuries the physical universe is eternal and therefore needs no creator science today has uncovered dramatic new evidence that the universe did have an ultimate origin that it began at a finite time in the past just as the bible teaches chuck colson will be missed but thank god and thank chuck colson that he has left us so much in the way of wisdom that we can draw from in the days ahead we will be remembering his family and all of those who loved and miss chuck in our prayers with that i appreciate being yielded to on behalf of chuck colson"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.5401188135147095, 0.4598811864852905, 1, "from the state of new jersey congresswoman ileana roslehtinen chairperson of the international relations committee and i spoke to dr biscet by telephone and obviously the first thing was we asked him about his health and he has suffered greatly in prison i can tell you that he has not however given up his efforts he said you know i am recuperating so i can continue the struggle for freedom we asked him about well what was his opinion about the policy the united states policy by the way the same policy that former president jimmy carter now has just criticized he said there are some that claim that if we just opened up trade and we just opened up and we got rid of the sanctions that freedom would come to the cuban people he was emphatic he was so emphatic he said no no no no no he said tyrants are always looking at ways to get more money tyrants are always looking at ways of getting more revenue but he further stated the only thing that would doand im paraphrasing what he saidbut he was very emphatic and very clear the only thing that would do he said would be to strengthen the dictatorship it wouldnt help the cuban people it would strengthen the dictatorship did former president jimmy carter meet with dr biscet the recipient of the medal of freedom no he did not he did not because he probably would have not liked to have heard what dr biscet would have had to say he would have not liked to have heard about the oppression and the lack of human rights and the lack of dignity that those who suffer in castros gulags have to suffer while former president jimmy carter calls the dictator in havana his good friend there are other such incredible heroes that are on the island i mentioned dr biscet but i also want to mention antunez as i mentioned before antunez served almost two decades in prison he received incredible tortures beatings multiple beatings while he was there and yet when released his attitude has been what his attitude has been one of great dignity of great courage of standing up and he continues to demand elections continues to demand freedom and he also would tell you if he could be speaking here today that we have to stay firm and we have to hold steadfast and show solidarity with the cuban people not with the regime not with those that former president carter calls his good friends not with those that former president carter says that they should continue to prosper when they were ill hoping that they would do well and fully recover no we have to hold firm and stand with the cuban people im so convinced so convinced that the cuban people will be free despite the apologists despite those that go out of their way to try to make the regime look good try to make the regime look like theyre this wonderful charitable regime because every once in a while they may free a political prisoner as a token gesture despite that the cuban people continue to stand firm their heroes are still there the mandelas and the havels of cuba are on the island theyre speaking out most of them many of them have been in prison many of them have been tortured and beaten but their spirit remains strong they continue to speak out and despite individuals like unfortunately former president jimmy carter who looks for every excuse and every opportunity to criticize the policies of the united states and yet refused to criticize the savagery of that dictatorship despite that im absolutely convinced that the cuban people will be free because of the heroes like dr biscet and antunez and many more so i am not discouraged i am not discouraged when i see these gestures of solidarity with the dictatorship i am not discouraged when people go down to havana and you know might have a mojito and relax and go to the beaches and tour the hotels where the cubans are not allowed to go unless theyre accompanied by foreigners im not discouraged because ultimately truth always reigns because ultimately the rights of individuals always surface ultimately those that sacrifice and that work hard and the heroes who by the way are the future leaders of a free cuba those heroes who are in the dungeons or who are in and out of the dungeons they dont give up and theyre not discouraged and theyre not quieted and they will not be intimidated so despite this what some would call a slap in the face to the cause of human rights and democracy in cuba i will tell you further than that the cause of human rights and human dignity around the planet despite that that former president jimmy carter has just attempted to do im not discouraged on the contrary i am as encouraged as ever i think i might end by reading a letter if i actually have it here no i dont think i have it i do want to mention though that one of our colleagues in the senate a democrat democrat from new jersey senator menendez wrote a letter to former president jimmy carter where he expressed and i will be submitting that for the record where he expressed what jimmy carter what former president jimmy carter should be talking about and he expressed how it was rather incredible that the former president would not demand the freedom of the cuban people and would criticize the policies of the united states and as senator menendez says in that letter the issue is not what the policy of the united states is with the cuban regime the issue is the policies of the regime and the oppression of the regime with its own people and once again senator menendez democrat from new jersey is right on with that i just want to again say that we do not forget the heroes in the island we do not forget those who are struggling and working and speaking out and suffering the consequences for their actions in the island we do not forget them we admire them we support them we are humbled by their courage we are humbled by their love for freedom and what they are willing to sacrifice for that freedom and we know that sooner than i think some may believe and clearly sooner than some would like they too will be free they too will be able to discuss the issues in public they too will be able to make the determination as to the future of their country i am encouraged and humbled by their leadership despite sometimes the sadness of what we have to listen to by those who still continue to call fidel castro their good friend hon jimmy carter the carter center one copenhill freedom parkway atlanta ga dear president carter i am writing to express my grave concern about your visit to cuba this week to discuss improving unitedstatescuba relations your visit suggests that the improvement of relations between the united states and cuba is contingent upon some action by the united states rather than acknowledging that it is cubas intolerant and tyrannical actions that continue to define the future of unitedstates cuba relations while you are visiting with president castro and other cuban officials to learn about new economic policies and the upcoming party congress the regimes thugs are in the streets harassing and arresting scores of political dissidents who dared to hope that you would hear their pleas and argue on their behalf for the adoption of political reforms the fate of american alan gross a usaid contractor who sought to assist the islands jewish community also hangs in the balance while you meet with the political elite that are directing the crackdown on cubas peaceful civil society

for democracy movement and boris rodriguez jimenez were arrested when they attempted to stand in front of the capitol with signs reading freedom without forced exile for cubas political prisoners and the streets belong to the cuban people i urge you to address with president castro the aspirations of cubas civil society to live in a democratic state whose laws are derived and implemented by their democratically elected representatives and are based on the core principles of respect for human and civil rights including the freedom of expression and freedom of assembly as we witness unprecedented movements for democratic change in the middle east i appeal to you to recognize that same heartfelt desire amongst the cuban people and to urge the regime to fulfill the democratic

clear to everybody im going to quote this i will not bring a bill to the floor that hasnt been posted online for at least 72 hours john boehner fox news americas news room 7 22 2010 we can have all the verbal gyrations that we can come up with here about how not to kind of get to the point which is that were not going to be able to have 3 days or 72 hours or 3 legislative daysor three anythingto look at this bill and the bill that were going to be debating later today or tomorrowwe dont really knowis going to be different and we know its going to be different because the chairman of the rules committee said in an interview that we have online to national journal that theres probably going to be another 100 million more in offsets and so where are those offsets coming from we know that one of the offsets that was in the continuing resolution yesterday was an offset that actually was a job killer that actually is something that not only democrats supported but the united states chamber of commerce supported everyone came together and agreed that this is a good program and it was cut and it is going to discourage job creation in this country so i think it is important to know where these offsets are going to be coming from and again let me repeat what ive said over and over this has not been a bipartisan process the only thing bipartisan about this continuing resolution was the opposition to it and again i would tell my republican friends that the reason why this promise by speaker boehner is important is because we do need to understand whats in the bill were beginning to understand that your rules dont live up to what you actually promised the other thing about this that i think is important for people to understand is that never ever ever have we ever insisted on offsets for emergency spending for disasters we dont know whether there will be one two three or no emergencies that hit our country next year or the year after or the year after that maybe my republican friends have now figured out a way to predict earthquakes and tsunamis and hurricanes and tornadoes but we dont know how to predict with any accuracy and this notion that were not going to be there that were going to insist on offsets in order to provide people who have been thrown out of their homes whose communities have been destroyed through no fault of their own that we can find an offset when we dont need any offsets for nationbuilding in afghanistan thats all on your credit card theres no offsets needed for that why is it that no offsets are needed to do that kind of stuff but when it comes to helping people in this country all of a sudden we become super fiscally conservative we need to have offsets for everything you want to reduce the debt put people back to work thats how you do it cutting programs that put people back to work doesnt put people back to work it slows down the economic recovery here we are in september and we have yet to deal with a single jobs bill on this floor i dont know what its like in california but i can tell you in massachusetts when i go home people want to talk about jobs and the economy yes they want to reduce the debt and they understand by ending some of these wars by cutting back on some of these overseas bases that we have by asking donald trump to pay his fair share theres something wrong in this country when a billionaire hedge fund manager pays a lower tax rate than his secretary its like no we cant ask that person that billionaire to pay his fair share everything is aimed at working people and those who are most vulnerable we should be talking about putting america back to work we should be debating every day about ways to stimulate this economy to provide incentives to put people back to work to find ways to stop incentivizing corporations to send american jobs overseas instead my friends on the other side of the aisle are protecting all that status quo i mean they are protecting those tax breaks those incentives that encourage jobs to go overseas enough enough ill close by saying this mr speaker when it comes to protecting subsidies for big oil companies my friends are there when it comes to rebuilding and nation building in afghanistan theyre there when it comes to maintaining a tax code that allows a billionaire hedge fund manager to pay a lower tax rate than his secretary theyre there but when it comes to disaster assistance when it comes to jobs when it comes to things that matter to everyday people it is a struggle it is a fight i would urge my colleagues to rethink their priorities to work in a bipartisan way when it comes to disaster relief and job creation lets bring the presidents jobs bill to the floor if you dont like it vote against it but allow us to have the opportunity in this new open house let us bring the presidents jobs bill to the floor let us see whether we can pass it here i think if this truly is an open house we ought to have that opportunity i will just say before i yield back the balance of my time i dont know when were going to get this bill i dont know where the cuts are going to be made i dont know what other jobcreating programs are going to be cut but again i will not bring a bill to the floor that hasnt been posted on line for at least 72 hours were not even going to get 72 minutes in all likelihood i urge my

the potential to affect every american from every state from every political party of every political ideology that issue relates to our national debt we have accumulated nearly 15 trillion in debt through the federal government which is a lot of money split up amongst 300 million americans it works out to close to 50 000 a head a lot of people dont make that much money in a year and yet that is what every man woman and child owes on a per capita basis the moment they are born if it is calculated out on the basis of debt per taxpayer the number is much larger anywhere between 120 000 and 150 000 per head depending on how you calculate it we are now approaching the august 2 deadline given to us by secretary geithner that has been identified as the time by which we must increase our national debt yet again a debt that has been raised time and time again resulting in our accumulation of about 10 trillion of new debt in roughly the last decade this is a problem and it is a problem that is only going to become more severe the longer we kick this can down the road without doing anything to change the way washington brings money in and the way washington spends money i want to talk for a minute first about how washington brings money in there are those who have suggested in this town very recently that what we need right now is a tax increase in order to address the debt crisis i could not disagree more and i need to state with the greatest emphasis i am able to place on this issue that a tax increase is something i would oppose something i would devote every ounce of energy in me to opposing the reason is we have in washington something that is not a revenue problem what we have is a spending problem spending is the crisis that we need to address but on a more fundamental level we have to remember what we do when we raise taxes when we raise taxes we chill investment it is investment that we rely on for the creation of jobs we have to remember that government doesnt have the power to create jobs because it cant create wealth it can create policies it can adopt laws and regulations designed to promote or deter certain kinds of behavior it can raise revenue through taxation but it cant create wealth all it can do is set in place certain circumstances that might allow wealth to be created or in other circumstances might deter new wealth from being created to have true wealth creation leading to true job creation you have to have a circumstance in which willing investors with capital are ready to invest have the reasonable assurance and promise that if they invest their money and thereby place it at risk any gains resulting from that risky behavior will be gains that inure to their benefit not taken away by some third party and not taken away by the government so when we raise taxes in effect what we are doing is deterring investment deterring investment at a time when we are hemorrhaging jobs and we can ill afford to lose any more not one job should be lost as a result of something the government does we need to find ways to get the government out of the way so job creation can occur but it cant occur whenever we punish the investor whenever we tell the investor invest at your own risk because if you dare to make a profit we are going to take away more of that money than we have previously been taking away in taxes for that reason i continue to emphasize the fact that i will oppose any attempt to address this debt limit crisis by raising taxes and i will continue to oppose any effort to raise taxes spending is the problem as to the question of how washington spends money if the definition of insanity is the practice of doing something again and again expecting to achieve different results than we have achieved every time in the past then we would be insane if we approach this debt limit discussion with the same kinds of tired malfunctioning unproductive strategies that have been employed in the past strategies that focus exclusively on immediate cuts or even longterm cuts let me explain what i mean as we approach the debt limit discussion there will be those who will want to focus a lot of the attention on longterm spending cuts in other words they might say if we are going to raise the debt limit by 1 trillion then we need to find 1 trillion in cuts that can be made if we are going to raise it by 2 trillion then we need to find 2 trillion to cut but of course we cant cut 1 trillion out of our budget immediately that is not possible we cant do that in 1 year that would have to be stretched over a period of many years most likely in this scenario as it has been discussed it would be stretched over a period of a decade or more we do have the power to control what we do in this congress but we cant bind the congress that will take power in january of 2013 january of 2015 or 2017 every 2 years we get a new congress in place and that congress has the power to make those decisions that will best fit what they decide is in order at that time we cant bind them permanently so any promise that we make right now to cut lets say 2 trillion relies on the promise that that will be honored by future congresses we cant bind them to do that there is one way however we can bind them that is by amending for the 28th time that 224yearold document that has fostered the development of the greatest civilization the world has ever known when we amend the unitedstates constitution that is the one credible way the one binding way in which one group of americans can bind a future group of americans that is why i have said that the only circumstance in which i think it is appropriate for us to raise the debt limit is a circumstance in which congress has first passed a balanced budget amendment out of congress by the requisite twothirds margin in this body and in the house of representatives and submitted it to the states for ratification in that scenario and only in that scenario can we proceed with any degree of confidence that the commitments we make now to the american people to make not just immediate cuts but longterm changes to the way we spend money it is only in that scenario that those promises can be and will be honored because it is only in that scenario that we can bind a future congress that is why i have pledged to vote against and to oppose in any way i can any debt limit increase that involves something short of prior passage of a balanced budget amendment in addition to any caps in addition to any immediate cuts that may be raised we have got to have cuts we have got to have some kind of spending cap where we cap spending as a percentage of gross domestic product every year and we have got to have a constitutional amendment requiring that and requiring the revenues and outlays match each other from year to year if we dont have this then we are at great risk for the practice of perpetual deficit spending in which congress year in and year out spends more than it takes in congress can sustain this for a period of time but where as is now the case the amount of money congress spends is in excess of 1 5 trillion a year more than it brings in we have reached a certain point of unsustainability at which if we continue with this practice a halt in borrowing will be much more immediate much more draconian than anything that could be within our control at some point those who would be willing to loan us that money who would be willing to buy unitedstates treasury instruments of one form or another to finance our debt will eventually start demanding a higher and higher yield that means that instead of spending about 250 billion a year on interest on our national debt as we are currently paying the time could very soon come in which we might have to pay something closer to 700 billion just to pay the interest on our national debt in fact if we were now required to pay interest rates on our treasury instruments consistent with the 40year average we would be about there mr president 700 billion is a lot of money seven hundred billion dollars in a year is roughly what we spend on social security it is roughly what we spend on medicare and medicaid combined in a year it is roughly what we spend in national defense in an entire year if we have to spend that amount of money every year as we could easily have to spend within just few years time if we continue spending at this rate that is going to crowd out funding for every federal program out there whether you are most concerned as many conservatives might be about protecting national defense or whether you are most concerned as many liberals are about protecting our entitlement programs you ought to insist as i have been insisting that we will not raise the debt limit until such time as the congress has passed a balanced budget amendment to the unitedstates constitution that is why i am pleased to support the cut cap and balance pledge and why i will continue to take this position in addition to standing firm on my position that we ought not even consider any tax increase at a time when we can least afford it i yield the floor and suggest the absence of quorum"], [0.5357988476753235, 0.4642011523246765, 1, "thank you so much i share with these dear friends today marking the passing into glory of mr charles chuck colson we new chuck as a dear friend and christian brother author radio commentator and also one who challenged us all to think more about our world view with his passing our nation has lost an uncommon leader a true example of the transformative power of jesus christ and a reminder of the beauty of second chances in life while some will forever remember mr colson for his role in the watergate scandal i will remember and honor him for the grace and perseverance with which he advocated for the least of these in our society those that were marginalized those who were seen as helpless with his work through prison fellowship the worlds largest organization for outreach to prisoners and former prisoners and prisoners families and through his inspirational books and commentaries chuck colson touched thousands of lives and advocated tirelessly for programs that would not only address the physical needs of those in our nations prisons but also their spiritual needs as well in addition mr colsons daily radio show breakpoint during which he would share a commentary on the life of christ and also on the christian world view on the issues of the day was such a challenge and an inspiration to me that as a young lawyer in southeastern north carolina in my hometown of lumberton i actually put copies of his breakpoint commentaries out on the coffee table so that those clients and prospective clients who came to our law office would take time to hear from this lawyer chuck colson whose life had been so transformed by the experiences he had gone through when i think about his insights its because they were so challenging and so clear in their wisdom that they were so touching his books challenge you to think deeply about your own calling in life what was god calling you to do and how could you take even the worst of experiences i remember him describing looking out on the south lawn of the white house thinking he was just one door down from the president and the neatly manicured lawn i remember chuck two or three times in different testimonies describing that experience and thinking you know ive made it but then chuck colson went from the white house to the very depths of understanding what it meant to be in prison but instead of letting that ruin his life after the watergate scandal he came out of that with his life being changed his great book born again was a bestseller back in the 1970s when i was in college and i still remember when my own father who passed into glory last year read that book along with other experiences that happened to my own father that book born again told a story that my dad could identify with and that helped to change his life having heard chuck colson speak at montreat where my own dad made his own christian commitment and hearing chuck colson speak at other events with the late dr d james kennedy down at coral ridge ministries down in florida and being with chuck so many times here on capitol hill being part of the lecture series that my good friend mentioned just a moment agothat i still remember he organized here on capitol hill and would invite members of congress to come and to think more deeply and challenge us to go beyond the politics of the issue then in his monthly newsletter called jubilee he would have an editorial at the back that i regularly read and made sure that often i ripped that out and put it in a file because his thoughts were so provocative and challenging in terms of our own world view i also had the opportunity to get to know chuck colson and count him as a brother in christ and as a friend participating not only in the lecture classes here on capitol hill but when he rewrote the book that he had written in 1982 kingdoms in conflict which greatly touched my life as i thought about the possibility of one day maybe coming to this place he rewrote that book on god and politics and challenged us to think about where we are in our faith as we deal with the tough times in the political world so much so that my wife dee asked me if for our 25th wedding anniversary that instead of a gift or going on a trip could we be in the centurion program that chuck colson had where he had 100 citizens from around this nation participate and spend an entire year studying the christian world view on issues ranging from health care to business from medicine to education from law and government to issues within religion itself and challenging us to study the biblical perspective and the christian world view and to think how we deal with those issues as christians in the everyday world so with those 100 citizens from across the country my wife and i spent a year studying under chuck colsons guidance and went to three different seminars that he hosted not too far from here in washington what an inspiration this man was because he didnt just teach and he didnt just talk but he walked the walk and he changed lives by gods power in the process i know some of you here with us todayso often we shared the night before the national prayer breakfast before we came and led the spiritual heritage tours here at the capitol that so many hundreds of people have now done over the years that we made it a regular habit to go to chuck colsons annual prison fellowship dinner that he had on the wednesday night before the thursday national prayer breakfast in february and we looked forward as much to that as being central to the celebration of what the national prayer breakfast was all about because we knew the night before chuck colson was having his annual dinner usually honoring some great religious leader or reformer in society before we had our spiritual heritage tour back here at the capitol he often also talked about his experience as a united states marine at camp lejeune just on the edge of my congressional district and he also talked about the practical ways that faith can change your life thats the great legacy i know chuck colson would be pleased with today were talking about a man not only who was a great author and speaker but a man whose life changed lives and made a difference thank you very much"], [0.535599410533905, 0.46440058946609497, 1, "there is a lot of discussion here on the floor around washington and across this nation about the american financial situation some people say america is broke there couldnt be anything further from the truth than that statement america is a strong vibrant economy that far and away is the largest economy in the world we are nowhere near broke we do have a problem we are running at a current deficit and that deficit is expected to grow but to understand the deficit and to begin the process of addressing it we need to understand from whence it came and so i am going to start this discussion out with hopefully an opportunity to get a sense of how it is that the american deficit has risen to the point where it is today really we need to look back to the ronald reagan period during the ronald reagan period he ended his presidency with a projected 1 4 trillion deficit for the 10 years beyond his presidency so we look at these things saying okay ronald reagan had 8 years and then what was projected as a result of the policies during his presidency well what was projected was that the american deficit would grow by 1 4 trillion the first george bush came into office and at the end of his presidency 4 years the projection for the 10 years after he left office continuing the policies that were in place at the end of his presidency the deficit would grow to 3 3 trillion similarly the clinton administration was in office for 8 years and the policies that were put in place during those 8 years were projected to literally wipe out the american deficitliterally gone a 5 6 trillion surplus as a result of the policies that were put in during the clinton period those policies were tax policies those were the expenditure policies a policy that we call today the paygo policy that is if you are going to start a new program how are you going to pay for it if you are going to cut taxes what are you going to reduce in the expenditure pattern so reagan a 1 4 trillion deficit projected beyond his presidency bush add another 3 3 trillion clinton comes along 8 years deficits turn into a whopping surplus and literally paying off the american debt george w bush comes in in 2001 and right off the bat major tax cuts not associated with spending cuts but just major tax cuts that was in 2001 followed up with a second round of major tax cuts in 2003 and in between a whole new medicare entitlement adding a new expenditure at the same time that taxes were being reduced and for those of you that remember that period in 2001 we did have 9 11 and immediately we started the afghanistan war i think most of us would agree that that was the right thing to do but it was not paid for it was actually borrowed money that paid for the early afghanistan war followed a couple of years later 18 months later with the iraq war which once again was not paid for but rather borrowed money the result of all of that and the total pullback of the american government from regulating the financial industry the housing markets was the great recession at the end of the george w bush period it was projected by the cbo nonpartisan budget office that the deficit would grow by 11 5 trillion if the same policies were left in place so where is todays deficit coming from it is coming from the reagan period the first bush period the clinton policies terminated and the george w bush policies put in place leaving us with a projected 11 5 trillion deficit for the next 10 years now the rest of the story is that as a result of the great recession the obama administration came into office looking at this situation an economy that was headed into not a recession but a depression and a huge deficit that was put on mr obamas plate the day he took office to deal with the great recession that could have become a great depression a stimulus program was put in place and it was expensive and a bailout of wall street was actually put in place during the last 2 months of the bush administration a combination of those was somewhere about 1 5 trillion to 1 6 trillion a huge whopping sum of money but done for a good purpose and i dont know many economists in fact i know of none who would say it was not necessary it was necessary that we deal with the wall street collapse and successfully stabilized wall street the financial industry it could have been done differently most of that money has now been repaid the money that was spent about 750 billion on stimulating the economy was similarly successful in stabilizing the economy and causing it to rebound slowly but nonetheless rebound here we are today debating the best way to deal with the deficit we have a proposal from the president that over the next 5 years to 6 years would significantly reduce the annual deficit not creating a situation such as ended the clinton administration but bringing the deficit back into a situation that is sustainable that is the presidents proposal based upon holding steady no growth in the federal budget over the next 5 years having the economy bounce back ending one of the tax breaks that was put in place by george w bush back in 2003 that is the high income that is the millionairebillionaire tax break which is still in place but would end under the presidents proposal it is following along closely the recommendations of the deficit reduction commission that was appointed now that is the presidents proposal what we are debating on the floor beginning early this year with h r 1 h r 1 a continuing resolution to fund the government for the remainder of the year was a 60 billion reduction in the discretionary expenditures of this government no one believed that that would have a significant impact on the longterm deficit problem but it would have a very significant impact on vital vital programs that are necessary to continue the operations of this government so what are we to do h r 1 passed this house and was rejected by the senate for me that was the right thing to do because h r 1 was estimated by two different economists not democratic economists but independent economists that it would kill 700 000 jobs across this nation immediately increase unemployment in america reducing tax revenuesunemployed people dont pay taxesbut simultaneously increasing the expenditures for unemployment insurance welfare and the like that is not a very wise thing to do but that is what our colleagues on the republican side suggested we should do and it passed with unanimous republican support i think there were three or four democrats that voted for it i think they were wrong i think the republicans were wrong that doesnt solve the deficit you cannot take 14 percent of the federal budget which happens to be the discretionary expenditures that were targeted by our republican colleagues in h r 1 and expect to do anything meaningful about the deficit the deficit has to be dealt with over a long period of time and it has to be dealt with in such a way that we actually put in place the foundations for strong economic growth what are those foundations well in my view there are six of them if this economy is going to grow soon midterm and late that is in the years ahead we have to have the best educated workforce in the world so in the republican proposal was an elimination of funding for higher education funding for the pell grants that allow young men and women and older men and women to go into the university system not a wise thing to do the second thing if we are going to have a foundation of good solid economic growth into the future we need to have the best research in the world once again the proposal h r 1 and the two subsequent continuing resolutions that have funded the government cut cut research critical research at our national laboratories nearly 800 million of funding for the department of energy research programs would be eliminated laying off some 6 000 researchers ph d s scientists at the national laboratories that are working on research for energy production no one in this nation would argue that we do not have an energy crisis check out the price of gasoline we have a serious energy crisis yet the proposal would go right at the heart of the research that we need in order to solve the energy problem conservation nuclear cleanup of nuclear research into photovoltaic geothermal all of the renewable energy research largely reduced and in some cases totally eliminated health care the fastest growing segment of our economy is health care research at the national institutes of health is wiped out largely reduced what kind of policy is that if we are going to have a strong economy we need to have a welleducated workforce we need the research thirdly we need to take up the issue of manufacturing we need to make the things that come out of research manufacturing really does matter if we were to take the american manufacturing sector as weak as it is today it would still rank as the ninth biggest economy in the world manufacturing in the united states took an enormous hit during the great recession about 25 percent of the jobs that were lost were in manufacturing we hollowed out our manufacturing sector if we are to grow this economy if we are to have a serious reduction in the deficit then we are going to have to make sure that manufacturing returns as a principal part of the american economy i am going to move on with the other three elements and then come back to manufacturing we need to have a very strong infrastructure this is everything from water to sanitation to transportation rail systems and air systems one of the things that will be brought up on the floor has to do with the air transportation system in the united states that infrastructure is critical yet in the proposal that we have had from our republican colleagues we are actually weakening the infrastructure system of this nation that is not a wise thing to do but nonetheless our economy depends upon that infrastructure international investments are necessary we need to export we cannot find our economy growing if we continue to rely on imports they may be cheap but in their cheapness they destroy the american manufacturing sector so we need to keep that in mind as a principal investment that we need to make it doesnt come cheaply it requires us to spend money on the department of commerce that is out there helping to open markets for america it requires us to finance the exportimport bank and other federal government agencies that actually support the export of goods and services from america and of course we have got to pay attention to the defense of this nation in the defense department we need to always strive for efficiency now i happen to oppose the war in afghanistan it is costing us about 120 billion a year my view is we ought to end that quickly and spend some money focusing directly on the real threat and that is the threat from al qaeda and other terrorist organizations we will come to that in a different discussion but those are the six critical investments education research manufacturing infrastructure international trade and defense are we doing well at those not if my republican colleagues get their way with regard to the discretionary budget cuts there are some things that we can do that are not expensive in fact they actually will create jobs with no additional federal expenditure let me turn to that at this moment my democratic colleagues and i have developed a program that we call make it in america make it in america if america is going to make it then we have to make it in america what are we making we need to make all of the things that this economy and this world needs for energy securityphotovoltaic geothermal the new biofuels the advanced biofuelsall of those things in the energy sector that allow us to prosper and to address the energy crisis includingand i know the problem of japan and the nuclear systems there but 20 percent of our energy presently comes from nuclear and thats going to be part of the future so we need to make sure that we make it well safely and that those systems are made in america manufacturing matters and we need to make sure that our manufacturing sector is up to speed and actually making things in america we cannot count on the chinese or the indians or any other nation to provide us with our manufactured goods and the reason is thats where the wellpaying middle class jobs are its been hollowed out over the last decade by i think unwise policies but nonetheless we can restore it let me tell you a couple of ways that were proposing to do this in the democratic caucus i love these charts they seem to actually make a lot of sense and help display what were talking about if were going to make it in america we need to make sure that we are educating and researching and so these are crucial investments that ive talked about beforeresearch the health sector science a welleducated workforce with teachers that are capable of doing what we call the stemthe science technology engineering and manufacturing kinds of education and we need to make sure that our workers are prepared to take on these jobs so thats the first step thats the education and the research step of it and these are investments and we need to make those investments let me give you a couple of other examples of where public policy really becomes important photovoltaic invented in america wind turbines they have been around a long long time windmills and the like but many of the modern technologies that are in the wind turbine system are american research and of course transportation it turns out that we dont really do much of thisor at least a year ago we didnt do much of this we were importing the solar systems the photovoltaic systems importing many of the wind turbines that are out there in the wind farms providing us with energy and importing from other countries buses and trains and light rail systems what we say in the democratic caucus is each of these are programs that are subsidized or paid for with your tax money there are subsidies for solar photovoltaic systems good weve need to do these kind of things for energy security and its a good place to spend tax money to encourage the development of those kinds of systems all well and good but where are those solar panels made are they made in america or are they made overseas our view and my own personal legislation is if you want to use american taxpayer moneys to help you buy a solar system either on your business or on your home then you buy americanmade solar systems if your transit district wants to buy a bus using our tax dollarsthis is the excise tax on gasoline1812 cents for gasoline and 25plus cents for diesel fuelif you want to go buy a bus from your local transit districtgood we need public transportation but if youre going to use the publics tax money to buy that bus then you buy a bus thats made in america make it in america if youre using our tax dollars as a transit district or as a business or as a homeowner with a solar panel or a bus then you use that tax money to buy an americanmade bus similarly with wind turbines this is a personal thing for me in 1978 i authored the first state legislation for wind solar tax credits to get that industry started and it did start altamont hills california which i currently represent has the oldest wind farm in america good were rebuilding those turbines putting in new modern turbines and were expanding the wind industry in this nation good we need to do that and were using our tax money to subsidize it thats good too but where is that wind turbine built is it built in europespain germany belgium or is it built in america too many of these have been built in other countries using our tax money and im saying with my legislation and the support of others that if youre going to use american taxpayer money to invest in wind turbines then you buy americanmade equipment period we dont need to buy chinese wind turbines when we can make those in america these are ways in which we can rebuild our manufacturing base it turns out that in the san francisco bay area there is the alamedacontra costa transit district that has within that district one of the last remaining bus manufacturers in america but until very recently that transit district refused to buy buses from a bus manufacturer in that district that was making buses that were every bit as good as buses made anywhere in the world they have recently changed that policy similarly in the san francisco bay area the bay area rapid transit district bart was buying trains and wanted to continue to buy over 300 million of trains from foreign manufacturers many of us said whoa whoa whoa stop time out dont do that lets buy trains that are made in america so siemens a german company has established a manufacturing plant and is upgrading a longexisting manufacturing plant in sacramento to prepare itself to successfully bid for the manufacture of highspeed trains in california and around the nation as well as light rail systems which they are now and have been for some time producing in the sacramento manufacturing plant good thats how we can use our tax dollars to rebuild the american manufacturing base as we do that we rebuild a vital part of americas economy that part of americas economy that was traditionally the heart and soul of middle america the great american manufacturing sector this is possible does it take new money it takes a redirection of money that we have been spending for some time let me add one more thing to it as we look at the renewable industry let us think about where we can find additional money to enhance the renewable energy industry for one century america has subsidized through various tax breaks the oil industry we did that for the purpose of creating a very strong viable oil industry that provided us with energy it was eminently successful the oil industry is the most profitable industry in america and probably around the world very very successful do they need a continuation of tax breaks well if you ask them of course everybody wants a tax break but do they need it not when theyre running over the last 10 years just short of a trillion dollars of profit the american oil industry in the last decade has earned 950 billion of profit do they need a tax break anymore i think not i think we take that tax break which depending upon how much and whose estimate is somewhere north of 10 billion maybe as much as 20 billion a year and use that money to build our renewable energy sector subsidizing these kinds of thingsphotovoltaic advanced biofuels algae fuels wind turbinesand to enhance our transportation sector these are strategies that we ought to employ however as to what is happening today instead of taking the longterm view and making critical investments that actually will give us the foundation and the start to rebuild the american economy we are going the other direction i should say my republican colleagues are going the other direction many of us think it is the wrong direction we should not shortchange those investments that actually will create shortterm and longterm economic growth its critical that we continue to invest in those six things education research transportation manufacturingobviously we have to continue to invest in national defense but wed better be very very wise as we do these investmentsand in fact in everything the government doeswe must always strive for two goals that every program be effective which is that it actually achieves its stated purpose and that it be done efficiently i call these the two es efficient and effective if its not efficient then change the program so that it would be efficient if its ineffective and inefficient it should be terminated its very simple but if it is effective and efficient then maybe we ought to continue it now in this recent week weve had our republican colleagues put forth four bills that literally terminate all of the federal government programs save two to rebuild the housing industry in america and more importantly to help those families that are in desperate trouble with their mortgages of those programs some of them were ineffective necessary but not yet effective and not up to the kind of efficiency that we would want that doesnt mean they should be terminated that means they should be modified because the problem continues to exist there is a homeowner mortgage problem in america of enormous enormous importance some 10 million american homes are underwater its a problem weve got to find a way of dealing with that not just ignore it and not just wipe out programs that we would need we need to have efficiency so we look for not a bill that would eliminate it but rather a bill that would modify create more efficiency and continue to address the problem to this date our republican colleagues have only moved to terminate not to replace not to rebuild similarly with health care there has only been a bill to terminate not a bill to improve when we know that weve got an ongoing problem im going to just wrap this up and let it go where we are but let me go back and review very very quickly there has been a raging debate here in congress about the deficit where did it come from how did we get to where we are how do we solve this problem in the future the deficit didnt start with the obama administration it started way back actually a little bit before the reagan administration the reagan and the george bush i administrations it was dramatically altered by clinton which actually would have if those policies had continued created a surplus almost wiping out the total debt of america then it was run up bigtime during the george w bush administration these are projections 10 years following if wed continued the same policies as to what would happen thats where it started then there was the great recession and the effort now to deal with that the obama administration has put forth a proposal that follows closely along with the recommendations of the deficit reduction commission that says dontdontdo anything that would harm the current recovery like make an austerity program like make massive cuts yet our republican colleagues have done and proposed exactly that fortunately the senate has not gone along with that but we are nickel and diming our way towards 30 billion of cuts that may in fact cause us to see a decline rather than a continued growth in the economy we must watch that very carefully so thats the deficit piece of it manufacturing matters we need to be sure that we rebuild our manufacturing sector there are many different pieces of legislation of tax policy i didnt mention this earlier but one of the tax policies put forth by the democrats last decemberit actually went into lawwas to encourage investment by private companies in capital equipment allowing those companies in the first year to write off immediately 100 percent of the cost of capital equipment a good idea unfortunately very few of our republican colleagues voted for that in the manufacturing sector lets make it in america lets use our tax dollars to make it in america with all of the energy programs transportation programs lets use our tax dollars to buy americanmade equipment finally research and education this is not where the cuts should occur yet our republican colleagues are suggesting that thats exactly where it should happen major cuts in research energy education health care you cannot make those cuts and expect this economy to be competitive one little fact that i just heard about today is that it is expected in the coming year that the chinese economy will produce more scientific advancements than will the american economy this will be the first time in perhaps threequarters of a century that the united states government will give up its lead in scientific advancements this is not the time for this nation to make cuts in our science agenda whether its in the medical health care area the energy area or in any of the other kinds of research in which we have always been the leader food for thought things for us to consider i would like the american people to be aware of the real deficit story you cannot solve it by making massive cuts in just 14 percent of the budget yet thats what our republican colleagues are doing we need a longterm plan one that is 5 years 10 years to bring our budget back into balance we can do it it was done during the clinton period this little chart here gives you some idea of one half of how the clinton period brought about a budget surplus this is the spending side and these are the expenditures of the american government as a percentage of the economy during the reagan bush period 2223 percent of the american economy was for government expenditures it dropped down to 21 but it basically bounced between 21 and 23 percent during the clinton period as a result of policies that were put in place during his periodpaygo reinventing government and other governmental policieswe saw a steady decline in the percentage of the economy that was going to the federal government at the same time we had very strong economic growth those are two of the three things that operate together there was also a clinton tax increase that took place that basically added an additional tax burden at the very very top of the income categories so the combination of those reductions in the percentage of the economy that was used good economic growth and a tax increase that occurred in the very early period particularly a tax increase on the very wealthy led to a surplus george w bush came in in 20012002 and things reversed first of all theres an increase in the percentage of the economy that went to government principally the medicare drug program and the wars and then this very very steep rise that occurred right at the end of the bush administration as a result of two things one a plummeting of the american economy as the great recession took hold in 2008 and the effort to deal with the great recession with the stimulus and right here at the end of the bush 2 the financial bailout and so thats why we saw this extremely high line now you notice that in the last period which is the 201011 period weve begun to see a decline once again in the percentage of the government of the economy that is government spending and if we follow carefully the budget thats been put together by the obama administration this line will continue to fall back into the 20 percent 21 percent range bringing back into balance the federal expenditure it cannot and will not happen overnight its going to take us 5 years maybe even longer to bring this thing back into balance keep in mind the words that were used by the recommendation of the budget deficit commission dont do anything immediately to harm the american economy by making rapid unnecessary unwise cuts in the federal expenditure that will put people out of work 700 000 people would lose their jobs immediately with the proposal that was put forth by the republicans but fortunately stopped by the senate if that had become law 700 000 jobs immediately lost and a spike once again in this ratio of government spending so weve got work to do we can do this but we need to take the long vision and we need to be very careful that we make the critical investments"], [0.5348279774188995, 0.46517202258110046, 1, "i just wanted to engage a little bit more in this conversation that we had both about the previous amendment and about my good friend from north carolinas concern about this particular program called know your farmerknow your food i have the great privilege of serving on the agriculture committee ive heard the secretary speak to us about his interest in increasing the number of farms in our country in getting to know our farmers better and in making sure people have more knowledge about where their food comes from i have to just stand back and say for a minute that its after 8 30 on a busy night were still in the middle of debating this bill at a time when our economy is in peril when we have huge challenges before us when we are at war in two countries i just personally have to say i am baffled about why we are even having this debate i was baffled about why this report language would be there that slows down research on local farming that tries to stop a program thats not even funded and that coordinates a lot of good efforts going on in the department of agriculture i will say i kind of think back to the way i look at our country we were based on agriculture and farming i had the good fortune to be born in minnesota even though i represent maine both sets of my grandparents were scandinavian immigrants they came because there was rich farmland beautiful opportunities my grandfather was a dairy farmer my uncle was a dairy farmer my cousin still runs a farm and works with livestock i went to college to study agriculture and i own my own farm today so i think about isnt this what america is all aboutknowing your farmer knowing where your food came from understanding what the basic principles are of growing and of using our land what in the world are we talking about its as if black is white and white is black and as if everything is turned upside down i grew up in minnesota and maine both states have a rich farming heritage we couldnt be more proud of the families and of the people who work hard on the land we couldnt be more proud of having vigorous farmers markets of having people who are able to go to a farm stand and say to the farmer how did you grow this whats behind this tell me about whats growing in your field i mean this is america this is how our country was built if there is one tragedy thats going on today its the reduction in the number of farms and in the families who can no longer hold onto their farms whose mortgages are being foreclosed on who dont have enough markets if there is anything the secretary is telling us it is that we want more people to know about their farms that we want to have local access to farming that we want to have people come to farmers markets i spend a lot of time visiting school cafeterias and many of the schools in my district are very engaged with buying food locally they realize that if theyre going to deal with childhood obesity one of the things they have to do is get kids to eat more vegetables one thing that really works is to have those young people know the farmers and many schools have little gardens out back i visited longfellow elementary school in portland maine just recently those kids have a little plot of carrots its not that every lunch has one of those carrots on the menu but its for those kids to say i grew a carrot and now i want to eat more of them i was at the bonny eagle middle school they have a little greenhouse i sat down to eat with those kids and they were eating kale kale and garlic and they were proudly showing it off to me about how they grow kale about how they know where it comes from many of them have visited with farmers theyve seen the farmers come down the road i cant possibly imagine why anyone would want to put language in that says you have to strike a program like this thats not even funded thats just a way of the secretary saying this is a good american tradition its a tradition in north carolina i am sure where people are proud of their farmers and in maine where we are exceptionally proud of the fact that the average age of our farmer is going down we have more young people who want to go into farming we have more and more acreage going into farming which is a reversal of the trend that has been going on in our country for a long time this is good for our health and its good for our environment fundamentally this is a jobs bill and thats what were supposed to be here talking about every young person who has an opportunity to go into farming today and every family that gets to hang onto a family farm increases the number of jobs that are going on in our country what do we want this to turn into big corporate agriculture where everything has to be trucked around the world where our carrots come from brazil and our strawberries come from somewhere else in south america and where we buy our food from china i mean this is america this is a tradition of our country how could we possibly think that anything is wrong with promoting or researching local foods and having a program that just coordinates it all"], [0.5347452163696289, 0.4652547836303711, 1, "im not sure the gentleman answered my question with condition two and three of the cut cap and balance pledge again i havent read the legislation so i see the pledge im not sure whats in the legislation i thank the gentleman for his observation that we need a meaningful and i would say robust addressing of the problem that confronts us in fact as you know because we have discussed it at the white house for 4 days now from sunday night through last nighti guess 5 daysthe president of the united states has been indicating that we needhe calls it a big a grand design if you will along the lines that have been suggested by two of the commissions which on a bipartisan basis recommended a grand design that grand design would have reached at least 4 trillion in deficit reduction and debt reduction and in fact that is a figure somewhere close to the budget that was passed through this house i might say to the gentleman parenthetically that its my understanding that the cut cap and balance might get closer to the rsc numbers than your budget number that was passed here the rsc number that i refer to of course was the amendment that was defeated on this floor by one vote but i would say to the gentleman that the president wants to do a grand design to reduce that deficit not by 1 trillion or 2 trillion or 3 trillion but by 4 trillion there was a commission or a groupthe biden group we call itin which the gentleman participated there were other discussions between your speaker and the president all looking at achieving a large deficit reduction the gentleman at some point in time decided that was not something that he wanted to continue working on and suggested that it be i suppose pushed up the line and it was so i said the president was for a grand design the leader of the senate mr reid was for that mr durbin was for it ms pelosi was for it i was for it and the vice president was for it but unfortunately we couldnt proceed on that discussion in a successful way at least because the gentleman observed and his colleagues observed that as long as there were any revenues attached to that it would not be acceptable to your side of the aisle notwithstanding that every bipartisan commission that has dealt with this issue has indicated that it needed to be a balanced package that it needed to include substantial cuts that it needed to deal with discretionary spending defense spending entitlement spending and that it needed to deal with tax expenditures the gentleman says correctly that we want to balance our revenues with our expenditures the problem is if you keep cutting revenues youre just going to be chasing yourself down obviously you want to bring revenue rates down i hope we can do that but if we bring them down to a place where we dont have the money to pay for what we buywhich is of course what happened in this past decadethen we will be confronted with a situation that the gentleman wants to avoid and that is raising the debt limit what we have done over the last 10 years is buy more than we can afford therefore we have a debt thats why the gentleman as i say voted for extending the debt limit thats why i voted for it i will tell the gentleman that i have a gallup poll here that says seventyfour percent of the republicans agree that a responsible deficit reduction plan should include both tax increases and spending cuts and 77 percent of independents believe the plan should include a mix of revenue and spending cuts i say that so that i can elicit from the gentlemani know there is sentiment on your side of the aisle i know there is sentiment on my side of the aisle and i told youand you know the president of the united states believes this as wellthat we have an opportunity a critical time in our history when we have the makings of a bipartisan agreement the creation of a bipartisan consensus that will move us in the direction that you and i know we have to move what is holding us up as i understand it is that your side believes that these 77 percent of independents and 74 percent of republicans are not correct that revenues ought not to be part of this package clearly we agree and have agreed that spending cuts need to be a part of it so i ask the gentleman is there any possibility that these 74 percent of republicans are correct that in fact if we are going to have a successful package it will be because it is balanced because my view is i tell my friend that if we do this its going to really create jobs now we havent done any jobs bills we believe in this congress we believe the only jobs bill you really did so far was the patent bill i know you are going to talk about all these bills that you did but we dont think that because you put jobs in the titles it makes them jobs bills but the fact of the matter is that if we can create confidence in the market if we can create confidence that we can deal with our fiscal situation in a responsible bipartisan collegial way it will have an extraordinarily positive effect on every household in america the confidence of america that we can work together in a bipartisan way and we will stabilize the markets and provide for paying our bills and bringing our deficit and debt down so i ask my friend again does he believe there is any possibility at this point in time that we can reach a balanced agreement on what is called a grand design along the lines of the recommendations of the bipartisan commissions recommendations"], [0.5346762537956238, 0.4653237462043762, 1, "i thank the gentleman from texas and i yield myself such time as i may consume i want to be perfectly clear about what were talking about here today from the moment speaker boehner walked away from the negotiating table last friday to the opening bell of the stock markets this morning shareholders in unitedstates stocks american retirees investors our middle class have lost 405 billion based on third ways analysis of data from the standard and poors 500 index and americans stand to lose more if we fail to resolve this crisis third way has put together a comparison between the interest rate paid on sovereign debt between aaa and aa nations this is why credit is important people understand that depending on your credit rating you pay a different rate on your home mortgage you might have different financing opportunities on your credit card if america misses a debt payment the rating agencies have let us know that it likely will result in a downgrade from aaa status to aa status i would also point out that this current bill before us would likely lead to that as well because it only contains a shortterm a 6month renewal of our debt ceiling having watched the dysfunction of congress over the last few weeks the global investment community those who loan us money will say the last thing we need to do is put ourselves through this again in 6 months to ensure stability countries that have aaa ratings have an average 10year bond rate of 2 98 percent countries that have aa have an average bond rating of 3 75 percent so threequarters of a percent difference what does that mean it means threequarters of a percent on your variable rate home mortgage it means threequarters of a percent on your automobile and yes it means more government expenditures bigger government expenditures just to cover the debt that we already have in fact that difference that 0 75 percent difference over the next 10 years will cost taxpayers in additional interest payments over 1 trillion so here we are with a bill that cuts spending cuts 915 billion of spending but because it will likely lead to a downgrade will cost over a trillion the bill before us today will increase the deficit by over 100 billion at a time of record deficits when we all know we need to enforce fiscal discipline the last thing we need is an irresponsible bill to increase the deficit by 100 billion which is what we have before us today now if we had this bill before us 2 weeks ago or 3 weeks ago i would still oppose itincreasing the deficit is the last thing we need to do nowbut it would have been an interesting discussion it would have been maneuvering and politics and all this stuff that this body does too much of in posturing in my opinion but here we are 31 2 days from the debt ceiling expiring and the gentleman from texas and the chairman of our rules committee and many others have said we want to we know we need to do this we know we need to do this if we know we need to do this why are we doing this 31 2 days before the expiration of the debt ceiling why are we potentially passing a bill that will increase the federal deficit that will almost certainly lead to a downgrade that the senate has said they will kill that the president has said he will veto i understand that the plan was to pass this bill last night i understand that the majority party was short of a few votes that would have been yet another window of opportunity for this speaker who has had many to negotiate a real solution to be the statesman to work with the president and the senate to come up with a bipartisan package to increase the debt ceiling cut spending decrease the deficit the president has talked about decreasing the deficit by 4 trillion instead we have a force of bill thats likely to increase the deficit by 100 billionthe last thing we need from congress at this juncture in time threeandahalf days is how long we have to get this right i ask you is this the step we need to take towards that outcome passing yet another ideological bill that will cost taxpayers 100 billion and cost middle class families another percentage point on all the debt that they have there is a route out of this and the route out of this does not involve the majority party trying to pull back the four or five or six people that they need over there the path out of this is the speaker engaging us engaging all members of this chamber engaging the president of the united states who has to sign this at the end of the day engaging the senate majority leader and the senate minority leader to go back to that table that speaker boehner walked out on last friday to negotiate a real solution to the deficit crisis and the spending crisis that has gripped this country that could very well lead to a downgrade and increased deficit spending unless we get our arms around it look i think many on my side of the aisle are open to a compromise president obama himself has called for a compromise and i know my office and the offices of many other members of congress have received hundreds of calls from constituents who echo that desire to reach a solution on this i fear that the step before us today is yet another example of the dysfunction of this institution under this leadership but its not too late i call upon the speaker to move away from this direction and get back to the negotiating table to establish a real solution to reduce the deficit retain our nations good credit and faith in our system and show that this institutionthe institution of the house of representatives and the institution of congresscan work and do whats right for our country i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.5344543159008026, 0.4655456840991974, 1, "let me thank the gentleman from florida he has certainly awakened a number of issues and members on his important discussion and i wanted to join in his commentary we will be leaving shortly and im glad that we will be returning on monday for very serious business many of us have been in meetings today engaging in solutions rather than distractions as relates to the business of the american people none of us have experienced i believe the attention to the issue of the budget as much as weve had that attention now from our constituents on will the debt ceiling be raised there has not been a time in these past couple of weeks that ive gone home when businesspersons students seniors working families have not asked the question will we get it done i am an optimist and ive said to them yes i expect that in fact ive already gotten it done i voted on the clean debt ceiling raise or lift some many weeks ago and that was the right thing to do the reason is that over the last couple of decades we have had 60plus increases in the debt ceiling starting with ronald reagan including bush i and bush ii president clinton and president carter its interesting that for some reason the tension in this discussion has really gone beyond understanding let me be very clear we have had such an intense couple of months that we have not had the opportunity really to engage as members of congress our committees have been fairly tense and rapid our schedules have been such that weve been here one week and gone the next i know that there are new members of the 87 members of the republican conference with whom i would have some things to agree on and i would appreciate having that opportunity but this is a time now without the opportunity to get to know all of the members of the republican conference who are new when we have to get to know each other around solving americas problem as i indicated when a clean debt ceiling was put on the floor of the house many democrats voted for it democrats and republicans were on the bipartisan simpsonbowles committee at one point in the discussion with president obama the leadership of the republican house agreed to do the larger package of 4 trillion as relates to the debt ceiling revenues and cuts it makes sense doesnt it thats what households do they look at where they can bring down their budgets but they also say now what can we do to increase that revenue people who are unemployed want to increase revenue by getting a job and so i dont fully comprehend why it is such a complicated process to participate in what makes it difficult is we have leadership in the other bodythat is republicanthat says their main job is to defeat president barack obama in 2012 i didnt hear that discussion from democrats during my fellow texans tenure as president george bush there were policies that we disagreed with including the iraq war but there was no concentrated continuous effort and statement my main job here is to bring down president bush that was not the language that we used so how did we get the leader of the minority in the senate suggesting that his main job is to bring down the president of the united states thats what mr and mrs jonesmom and popall over america dont understand they dont understand it we all take a pledge of oath and we all have the same constitution in our hands we know that this body of lawmakers is looked upon as the most powerful lawmaking body in the world we dont walk around with a lot of big shoulders but that is how we are perceived i happen to have been at the european union discussing the conditions in greece and portugal they are far different from that in the united states first of all economists will tell us this country is not broke that it has the ability to fix itself let us not cast out despair and desperation and frustration to the american people we are americansnot arrogant but we are patriots we can get this done why is there such a devastating attitude from my friends on the other side of the aisle that it is the end of the worldthe death knell those people who are looking forward to job creation and jobs are listening to this rancor this discourse and are saying to themselves there is no hope there is no hope i agree with that there has to be hope for the children of this country there has to be hope for the young men and women that are on the front lines of iraq and afghanistan and places around the world there has to be hope the reason why i know that there is hope is because my own industry the energy industry just created a program called veterans to jobs through the energy industry im asking them to create one for those who are 18 to 35 businesses are still alive and well the financial services or the banking entity must be involved in providing access to credit for our smaller businesses who are creating jobs but we are alive and well and so i believe what we should do is to go forward with a package that is reasonable that lifts the debt ceiling as we did for everyone else i would vote for a clean debt ceiling lift it up and then begin to with great common sense plan our budget and our cuts mark zandi has said that an economist that has worked for a number of republicans such as john mccain former presidential candidate why are we trying to reinvent the wheel all economists will say you dont make immediate cuts in this fiscal year you project them out just like a budget in households they move out they do what theyre going to do for the month of june and then for the month of july and then for the month of august but no i am particularly sensitive to the fact that only this president only this one only this one has received the kind of attacks and disagreements and inability to work only this one read between the lines what is different about this president that should put him in a position that he should not receive the same kind of respectful treatment when it is necessary to raise the debt limit in order to pay our billssomething required by both statute and the 14th amendment why isnt it addressed in the manner its all right to disagree or agree on the balanced budget amendment its all right to talk about how were going to appropriate in fact in this house the republicans are getting their way gutting and cutting everything that we can find its all right to have that disagreement that is the giveandtake of democracy when you win youre the majority and if we cant find a way to agree together then the majority wins i understand that but i do not understand what i think is the maligning and the maliciousness of this president why is he different in my community that is the question that we raise in the minority community that is the question that is being raised why is this president being treated so disrespectfully why has the debt limit been raised 60 times why does the leader of the senate continually talk about his job is to bring the president down to make sure he is unelected its 2011 its not 2012 you need to play those politics in 2012 not now and so we can move forward you may disagree with me i believe its important to preserve medicare medicaid and social security lifelines for our community and many of us believe that that will not dash the hopes and dreams of americans to make sure that seniors and the disabled and those who are retired and those who need these resources children who need medicaid its not unseemly to protect them in the course of our discussion on budget cuts its not unseemly to protect military families its not unseemly to be able to provide an increase in salaries for the young if you will enlisted man or woman who on some occasions have been on food stamps so i am prepared to do the hard things that we did in 1997 when we had a budget resolution crafted by a divided government if you will and we produced a childrens health insurance program and a balanced budget without a balanced budget amendment there are some fixes that we are still living with such as the physician reimbursement that came about as what happens when you do that something has to be fixed were still suffering with the physician reimbursement which came about through the 1997 balanced budget so balancing the budget on a balanced budget amendment is not all peaches and cream it can truly be destructive but i am willing in the long range with common sense coming from texas to look seriously at how we can work together for cuts but revenue enhancers i just had a meeting with industry representatives this morningone of the industries that happens to be in the eye of the stormand there was a consensus saying we are prepared to look broadly at tax reform we would like to give our ideas i said you deserve to give your ideas as you deserve to let everyone know that were in the business of creating jobs but we cannot do this in the background of the hostility of the inappropriate treatment and behavior around president barack obama so what are we prepared to support i believe again that we can come together around a reasoned response and that reasoned response again are revenues and cuts and i believe that we can move this before august 2 we only have to be able to convince the new members and the leadershipthe point man for the republicansthat it is better to stand as a whole nation than to bring us down there are those who believe this is what will happen before august 2 and frankly it is a challenge we have already lost 150 billion right now our colleagues need to know that by all of this fooling around were losing in the markets 150 billion to 200 billion you want to know where the unemployment came from weve been creating jobs in the private sector but its our states that have been laying off hundreds and hundreds of thousands upon thousands of public workersfire fighters police sanitation teachers that we will never get back for our children when they enter the fall classes 35 40 maybe 50 will be in a class what kind of america is this and what kind of an america would lay off the public sector employeeswhich by the way were the doors and opportunities that were opened to minority americans large numbers of minorities are public sector employees you are literally killing our community with the high number of unemployed we are at double digits in the african american community i frankly believe that as an american i should look out for all interests and thats why i believe we should stop the tomfoolery and come together as americans and yes i will have to make sacrifices we have laid out our parametersmine are medicare medicaid and social securitybut what can we do together and what can we do where the pain is distributed and what can we do with the respect given to everyonespeaker majority leader minority leader whip leadership in the other body how can we come as those entities respect the bodies that they represent and we who are members of congress represent our constituents in that respectful manner and most of all respect the office of the presidency and as well to respect this president president barack obama i hope someone will say that what it appears to be is not in fact accurate but historically it seems to be nothing more and i simply close in accounting for that attitude is the very visible debate and in my memory of the affordable care act and i have never seen the level of depicting of a president of the united states by americans as i have seen during that debate never seen it i did not adhere to the burning in effigy of any president during the iraq warat that point it was president bush the shoe throwing i spoke vigorously against that you do not disrespect our president you agree or you disagree but not in the way that i have seen i simply close this afternoon by saying that it gives me a great sense of affectionid say pride for lack of a better wordin what this country stands for i believe that america can solve any problem that she puts her mind to the tumultuous sixties is part of my history a segregated america is part of my history and during that time one felt could we ever come through this the bloodshed the hanging the brutality but isnt it wonderful that a man by the name of martin king rose along with others too many to name and carried the mantle of peace the drum major for peace and he came through all of the contentiousness and all of the conflict and raised his voice and said america can do better and a president who i am most proud of by the name of lyndon baines johnson used his political astuteness and crossed very difficult lines the dixiecrats and others in the united states congress who couldnt imagine supporting any manner of civil rights legislation isnt that a miracle what we thought we could not do and that president who i owe such a great debt of gratitude that master of the political process lyndon baines johnson the creator of the great society of which many of us now benefit from pell grants and medicare and housing that person we call the president at that time orchestrated groups that possibly would never speak to each other and voted to change and move america forward and so i ask the question what makes president obama different i cannot imagine coming this far in my life and that of my childrens life and that of others to come to a point where we would use the uniqueness and the difference of this president to treat him differently if that is not getting in our way then there is no reason that we cannot come together and solve this problem as some would say this is not rocket science it is voting for the right approach and that approach is revenue and cuts i will go home to my district and engage with anyone who desires to engage in these discussionswe see each other as we walk about and go about our dutiesand give them the sense of optimism that i have as i do that i will be in a meeting discussing why the north forest independent school district one of the last remaining districts with a 70 percent plus african american population has been closed by governor perry and the texas education agency why seven thousand students and parents now looking as to what is their next step why is it closed is it because you underfunded them and didnt provide them with the resources is it because we have no interest in getting our hands into the mix and trying to help bring up the scores with teachers and salaries that can meet the needs of students who are in a property poor area ill go home and deal with that in the course of dealing with that ill talk to those parents about hope about the greatness of this nation and about the fact that were going to do our job and as well ill talk to them about the sense of pride and respect we have for the president that this nation elected has come out of the history that i am very well aware of we would hope that the same respect that was given to the first irish catholic president the same respect and interest that has been given from any president that brings to bear a unique and valuable perspective would be given to president of the united states the american president our president he is no different from any other president that has served i beg this house and i beg this congress to treat him with the dignity that the office deserves get on with our work get on with solving the problems for the american people a vastly diverse and richly multicultural nation i am grateful for that god bless this congress god bless

states launched a fullscale attack on iraq many of us remember watching the images of shock and awe as violence was wreaked against the people of iraq and in particular the city of baghdad that moment at which america arrived to express its military might had antecedents that we should study this evening i want to review the climate that was created for this congress that caused this congress to make a decision back in october of 2002 to go to war against iraqa war that was executed beginning march 20 2003 it was 9 years ago to this date that vice president cheney said the following of iraq we know they have biological and chemical weapons that was march 17 2002 on march 19 2002 vice president cheney said and we know they are pursuing nuclear weapons on march 24 2002 vice president cheney said of saddam hussein he is actively pursuing nuclear weapons at this time later on may 19 2002 we know hes got chemicals and biological and we know hes working on nuclear that was vice president cheney on meet the press august 26 2002 speaking to the vfws convention vice president cheney said simply stated there is no doubt that saddam hussein now has weapons of mass destruction there is no doubt that he is amassing them to use against our friends against our allies and against us september 8 2002 again on nbcs meet the press vice president cheney said this based on intelligence thats becoming available some of it has been made public more of it hopefully will be that he has indeed hes speaking of saddam hussein he has indeed stepped up his capacity to produce and deliver biological weapons that he has reconstituted his nuclear program to develop a nuclear weapon that there are efforts underway inside iraq to significantly expand his capability on september 8 2002 on meet the press vice president cheney went on to say of hussein he is in fact actively and aggressively seeking to acquire nuclear weapons march 16 2003 a few days before the attack and we believe he has in fact reconstituted nuclear weapons i mention this because for those members who were not in the house of representatives at the time of the october debate and at the time that the attack commenced and for those who are just citizens watching these events unfold there was created in this country a climate of belief a certainty as to the grave peril which saddam hussein of iraq was alleged to represent that was the vice president now the president in various appearances and statements and in the legislation he presented to this congress the president made the following material representations with respect to iraq he said that iraq was continuing to possess and develop a significant chemical and biological weapons capability he said that iraq was actively seeking a nuclear weapons capability that iraq was continuing to threaten the national security interests of the united states and international peace and security that iraq had demonstrated a willingness to attack the united states that members of al qaeda an international organization bearing responsibility for attacks on the united states its citizens and interests including the attacks that occurred on september 11 2001 are known to be in iraq that attacks on the united states of september 11 2001 underscored the gravity of the threat that iraq will transfer weapons of mass destruction to international terrorist organizations president george w bush represented to this congress that iraq will either employ those weapons to launch a surprise attack against the united states or its armed forces or provide them through international terrorists who would do so that an extreme magnitude of harm would result to the united states and its citizens from such an attack and that the aforementioned threats justified action by the united states to defend itself we have an obligation as a nation to defend ourselves to provide for common defense is one of the foundational principles of this country in the preamble to our constitution those who are charged with the responsibility of guiding the affairs of our nation the president and the vice presidentin this case president bush vice president cheneyhad a responsibility to be totally clear and honest with the american people it is to their shame that they were neither honest nor candid with the american people and with this congress here we are on the eighth anniversary of the attack on iraq and i think it would be instructive for this congress to have the opportunity to review what it is we were told in early october of 2002 when we voted as a congress to authorize the president to take action against iraq action which commenced 8 years ago listen to some of these claims that were made i will state the claims that were made and then i will rebut them we were told that in 1990 in response to iraqs war of aggression against an illegal occupation of kuwait the united states forged a coalition of nations to liberate kuwait and its people in order to defend the national security of the united states and enforce united nations security council resolutions relating to iraq the thing that was said then at that time in response i pointed out that in the persian gulf war there was an international coalition world support was for protecting kuwait there was no world support for invading iraq the resolution that president bush submitted to this congress which resulted in the invasion of iraq 8 years ago said whereas after the liberation of kuwait in 1991 iraq entered into a united nationssponsored cease fire agreement pursuant to which iraq unequivocally agreed among other things to eliminate its nuclear biological chemical weapons programs and the means to deliver and develop them and to end its support for international terrorism whereas the efforts of international weapons inspectors united states intelligence agencies and iraqi defectors led to the discovery that iraq had large stockpiles of chemical weapons and a largescale biological weapons program and that iraq had an advanced nuclear weapons development program that was much closer to producing a nuclear weapon than intelligence previously had indicated in advance of any attack to answer what the president was saying i pointed out more than 8 years ago u n inspection teams identified and destroyed nearly all such weapons that president bush referred to in his resolution a lead inspector scott ritter said that he believes that nearly all other weapons not found were destroyed in the gulf war furthermore according to a published report in the washington post the central intelligence agency had no uptodate accurate report on iraqs wmd capabilities the president said whereas iraq in direct and flagrant violation of the cease fire attempted to thwart the efforts of weapons inspectors to identify and destroy iraqs weapons of mass destruction stockpiles and development capabilities which finally resulted in the withdrawal of inspectors from iraq on october 31 1998 i pointed out back then more than 8 years ago that iraqi deceptions always failed inspectors always figured out what iraq was doing it was the united states that withdrew from the inspections in 1998 the united states then launched a cruise missile attack against iraq 48 hours after the inspectors left in advance of a military strike the unitedstates continued to thwart the weapons inspections president bush went on to tell this congress whereas in 1998 congress concluded that iraqs continuing weapons of mass destruction program threatened vital unitedstates interests and international peace and security it declared iraq to be in material and unacceptable breach of its international obligations and urged the president to take appropriate action in accordance with the constitution and relevant laws of the united states to bring iraq into compliance with international obligations the president went on to assert to this congress whereas iraq both possesses a continuing threat to the national security of the united states and international peace and security in the persian gulf and remains in material and unacceptable breach of international obligations by among other things continuing to possess and develop a significant chemical and biological weapons capability actively seeking a nuclear weapons capability and supporting and harboring terrorists it was pointed out back then that there was absolutely no proof that iraq represented an immediate or imminent threat to the united states a continuing threat does not constitute a sufficient cause for war the administration refused to provide congress with credible intelligence that proved that iraq was a serious threat to the united states and was continuing to possess and develop chemical and biological nuclear weapons and there was no credible intelligence connecting iraq to al qaeda in 9 11 iraq didnt have anything to do with 9 11 iraq had nothing to do with al qaedas role in 9 11 the president went on to assert to this congress in the resolution which was a call to war against iraq that iraq persists in violating resolutions of the united nations security council by continuing to engage in the brutal repression of its civilian population thereby threatening international peace and security in the region by refusing to release repatriate or account for noniraqi citizens wrongfully detained by iraq including an american serviceman and by failing to return property wrongfully seized by iraq from kuwait it was said at the time that the language of this resolution was so broad that it would allow the president to attack iraq even when there was no material threat to the united states the resolution authorized the use of force for all iraqrelated violations of u n security council directives and the resolution cited iraqs imprisonment of noniraqi prisoners this resolution would have authorized the president to attack iraq in order to liberate kuwaiti citizens who may or may not have been in iraqi prisons even if iraq had met compliance with all requests to destroy the alleged weapons of mass destruction though in 2002 at the arab summit iraq and kuwait agreed to bilateral negotiations to work out all claims relating to stolen property and prisoners of war so this use of force resolution enabled president bush to commit unitedstates troops to recover kuwaiti property the president told this congress the current iraqi regime had demonstrated its capability and willingness to use weapons of mass destruction against other nations and its own people that the iraqi regime had demonstrated its continuing hostility toward and willingness to attack the united states including by attempting in 1993 to assassinate former president bush and by firing on many thousands of occasions on united states and coalition armed forces engaged in enforcing a resolution of the united nations security council it was pointed out back then prior to congress passing the resolution to authorize an attack on iraq that the iraqi regime had never attacked nor does it have the capability to attack the united states they couldnt attack us the nofly zone was not the result of a u n security council directive it was illegally imposed by the united states great britain and france and not specifically sanctioned by any security council resolution the president went on to say members of al qaeda an organization bearing responsibility for attack on the united states its citizens and interests including the attacks that occurred on 9 11 are known to be in iraq but back in october of 2002 when we were having the debate on president bushs war resolution there was no credible intelligence that connected iraq to the events of 9 11 or to the participation in those events by assisting al qaeda the president told congress back in 2002 iraq continues to aid and harbor other international terrorist organizations including organizations that threaten the lives and safety of american citizens it was pointed out back then in response to president bushs assertions that any connection between the iraq support of terrorist groups in the middle east is an argument and was an argument then for focusing great resources on resolving the conflict between israel and the palestinians it was not sufficient reason for the unitedstates to launch a unilateral preemptive strike against iraq the president went on to say that the attacks on the united states of september 11 2001 underscored the gravity of the threat posed by the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction by international terrorist organizations it was pointed out again that there was no connection between iraq and the events of 9 11 yet think about this there was a consistent effort to try to link iraq to 9 11 and to al qaedas role in 9 11 but there was no connection the president kept on insisting there was as did the vice president the president went on to say that iraq demonstrated capability and willingness to use weapons of mass destruction the risk that the iraq regime would either employ those weapons to launch a surprise attack against the united states or its armed forces or provide them to international terrorists who would do so the extreme magnitude of harm that would result in the united states and its citizens from such an attack combined to justify action by the united states to defend itself the picture that was painted for the american people for the congress at that time was that we had no choice but to get ready to attack iraq and yet back then prior to congress voting on a resolution to authorize use of military force against iraq an attack having occurred 8 years ago on march 20 2003 we knew back then that there was no credible evidence that iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction there was no credible evidence that iraq had the capability to reach the united states with such weapons in the 1991 gulf war iraq had a demonstrated capability of biological and chemical weapons but didnt have the willingness to use them against the unitedstates armed forces congress was not provided with any credible information which proved that iraq had provided international terrorists with weapons of mass destruction president bush went on to assert that the united states could unilaterally enforce u n resolutions and that we could do so with military force he went on to assert a chronology of international process and when you look at where we are today 3 trillion according to joseph stiglitz and linda bilmes will be the minimum cost of this war one has to ask what was going on in this congress at the time when we were told by the president of the united states and by the vice president of the united states that iraq had weapons of mass destruction it had the intention and capability of attacking the united states the implication was that iraq worked with al qaeda to bring about 9 11 thats what they led this congress to believe thats what they led the american people to believe but you know what way back then i didnt buy a word of it and there are other members of congress who didnt buy a word of it either we know that there was no proof we knew that there was no proof offered by the administration at that time that would give us a cause to go to war against iraq but we executed the war against iraq this is a great tragedy upon the iraqi people and upon the people of our nation too we executed the war against iraq that according to joseph stiglitz extrapolating from a study that was done by the lancet organization as many as 1 million innocent iraqi people have died in that war i want everyone here to wrap their thinking around this statement joseph stiglitz in his book the three trillion dollar war wrote it with his associate linda bilmes citing the lancet report on civilian casualties in iraq extrapolated from that report and the figure that comes up is approximately 1 million innocent civilians lost their lives as a result of the united states attack upon and occupation of iraq people will criticize the lancet study and they will say well you know that cant be true but what they did was they looked at how many excess deaths occurred during that period and they did a very comprehensive study and they were able to come to this determination that these were all deaths that should not have occurred or they attributed them to the war a million people why because this congress was told that iraq had weapons of mass destruction and was going to use them against the united states of america could i ask how much time is left mr speaker"]], "top_unsure":
