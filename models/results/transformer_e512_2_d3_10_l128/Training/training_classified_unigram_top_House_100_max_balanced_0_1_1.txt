legislative session they handle all of them together they are not permitted the opportunity to deal with one and put off the others until another day all right reformers you had your say and here we are tonight for the first time doing exactly what you wanted to do 10 years ago we are doing what most state legislatures do now there is one reason why we are here so late that is because we have had four budgets this year we had one in the house and could not get agreement in the senate we matched our appropriation bills to the one passed by the house and then we had to redo them because we did not get an agreement with the senate that was the second one then we had grammrudman ii and we had to redo the appropriation bills again then we had an economic summit and we have to do the appropriations bills the fourth time that is the reason we are here this late under this miserable budget process we have we would have been out earlier if we had not had four budgets this year if you want to get away from four budgets have only one next year we can get out by election time that is what we ought to do the department of agriculture has established a commission to study microbiological levels in all foods and the senate report on the continuing resolution contained language to the effect that bacterial contamination baselines would not be established until such report is made the house report for the agriculture department appropriations contained the following language the committee expects the food safety and inspection service to review and change the rules and regulations for inspection and reinspection standards so as to disallow the reprocessing or washing and selling for human food the part of any poultry carcass which has been contaminated with filth or otherwise adulterated as defined in section 453 g chapter 10 of title 21 united states code the departments action in this regard shall be reported to the committee a proposal was made by the senate to include language in the statement of the managers on this continuing resolution in the absence of any scientific support it would be inappropriate at this time to modify processing or inspection standards such as reprocessing and washing of carcasses that proposal was not accepted by the conference instead the conferees in the statement of the managers stated as follows the conferees also expect the commission to make recommendations on reprocessing and washing for selling poultry carcasses for human food consumption the commission findings areneeded and will be in accordance with existing law the poultry inspection act charged the secretary of agriculture with protecting consumers both against products that are injurious to health and also against products that have been handled in an unwholesome manner and the definition of unwholesome and adulterated includes any carcass or part thereof or any poultry product which may have become contaminated with filth at any time clearly sampling for bacterial levels is not the only purpose and they must also reject any poultry products which have touched fecal material contains sores or pus pockets touched a dirty floor or for any other reason is within the definition of unwholesome under the act if any carcass or part of a carcass has ever been adulterated it is not saleable no matter how much it is washed or reprocessed for example a diseased bird could not be reprocessed either by washing or by cooking thoroughly prior to selling it and a carcass that has been contaminated with filth likewise cannot be considered to have been reprocessed or saleable just because a processor later either cooks the carcass or washes it in a chemical solution i call attention to the fact that the language adopted in the statement of the managers does not either justify or authorize the department continuing to use any standard that permits the sale of poultry carcasses for human consumption which has ever been contamined with filth all the statement of the managers does is say that the commission findings will be in accordance with existing law and that it is expected that they will not establish new baseline levels related to that part of the law relating to bacterial contamination until the commission reports the statement of the managers does not in any way negate the language in the house report which provides that the department shall change the rules and regulations for inspection and reinspection standards so as to disallow the reprocessing or washing and selling for human food that part of any poultry carcass which has been contaminated with filth that language in the house report makes it clear that the house committee expects usda to comply with the law which by prohibiting reprocessing and selling for human food any carcass or part thereof which has ever been contaminated with filth in other wordsthe statement of the managers modifies and refines the senate report language referring only to bacterial contamination levels and in no way negates the language of the house report relating to selling carcasses for human food which are unwholesome because they have at any time become contaminated with filth does the chairman of the full committee who is also the chairman of the subcommittee on appropriations for the agriculture department agree with my statement of
