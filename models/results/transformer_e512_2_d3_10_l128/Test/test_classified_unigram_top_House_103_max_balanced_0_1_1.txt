presidents proposal is that he is going to increase spending in fiscal year 1993 i am not kidding as dave barry would say he is going to increase spending by over 16 billion of brandnew programmatic spending from 1994 through 1998 189 billion of brandnew spending the interest costs cbo estimates are going to be 38 billion for this extra spending for a total of 244 billion in extra clinton

is stop digging we are in a deficit hole we ought to stop digging and certainly we ought not to have a quarter of a trillion dollars of new spending which is what is prposed under this clinton budget

president in fact he did so there were cameras aboard air force one and a camera at the other end to interview him the president was so taken with this gift of the 14yearold boy from north dakota of 1 000 to reduce the deficit that he told usatoday and the associated press the following day that maybe every american should be asked to make this kind of sacrifice well there are about 110 million taxpayers in america if each of them anted up an additional 1 000 that would amount to 110 billion or 144 billion short of just the new spending that bill clinton is proposing here there is no question that this budget is going to be as my california colleague just said more borrowing and more spending it contains no spending cuts in the next fiscal year it contains real tax increases that are going to constrict job creation and economic growth it gives us much more government it is going to give us fewer jobs frankly i wish that we could see it but the president has not even sent it up

a matter many people are concerned aboutensuring that we prevent abuse and do not encourage misuse of official power or position under this bill during our discussion the distinguished chairman of the

committee felt that the congress should not consider the substance of some of the amendments being offered all americans should have equal representation on this floor in considering important matters for chairmen of committees to favor closed rules to shut out amendments they disagree with is to close off the rights of members and their constituents to decide for themselves on the merits of any particular amendment even some of the majority members of the rules committee are becoming uncomfortable with the role they are being asked to play in this strongarming process the majority leadership

immigrants and narcotics across the borders of the united states has grown by leaps and bounds there is absolutely a torrent of cocaine flooding through the land borders right now we have increased the interdiction of cocaine in the californiamexico border by 1 000 percent over the last several years according to the gao 20 percent of the federal inmate population are illegal aliens the social service costs for california and every state in the union has gone up markedly as a result of delivery of services to illegal aliens we have estimated in san diego county that we spend 143 million a year in unreimbursed costs for social and criminal justice costs for illegal aliens we have extrapolated that out to a cost that we feel is fairly reliable of 3 billion a year paid in california for social services and justice costs and other costs for illegal aliens we have had now an increase of 1 000 percent of chinese illegal aliens coming across the land border between mexico and the united states over just the last 4 months of the year that is over 500 chinese illegal aliens have been arrested coming across the land border lastly and perhaps most critical we have done an experiment in which we took illegal aliens who had been convicted of major crimes after they did their time in the united states we sent them in deep repatriation to mexico city so far 34 of those 300 criminal aliens have been recaptured coming back across the border between the united states and mexico if you consider that at any given time our border patrol is so small that we only have about 50 to 60 agents on the entire californiamexico border and if you consider the fact that in excess of 5 illegal aliens come through for every 1 that is captured that means that roughly half of these criminal aliens have already made their way back into the united states there are many reasons with our very liberal immigration policy for having a border that has integrity and that requires people we need

to fascism to do that mussolini rules in the house are those that want to make the house run on time but destroy democracy in order to do it let us see here during the 95th congress just a few short years ago about 85 percent of all the rules were open rules in other words allowed free and open debate allowed middleclass america to have their views heard on the house floor guess what as middleclass america has become more and more disgusted with the congress and has found what congress is doing undermining everything they believe in open rules have declined to tho point that in this congress they have plunged to nothing today we have another mussolini rule on the floor that gives us no chance for open debate whatsoever what has happened about closed rules as middle america has found that congress is not doing what they wish congress has more and more resorted to closed rules until we get to this congress when every rule brought to the floor is a closed rule what does that

going to become a part of a pattern here in a colloquy a few minutes ago and i was told that no such thing was said in the rules committee about this becoming a pattern now i am not allowed to quote

not like that long debate and i will tell members why because when they went into that debate they had a 100vote margin and they were going to win the thing by 100 votes after the debate and after that bill was defined for the american people they only won by four votes because the debate did change minds the fact is that that is what often takes place when you allow free debate on the house floor when middleclass america has their opportunity to be heard on the house floor every once in a while minds are changed every once in a while we move ahead the democrats know that if we are able to expose their legislation and their programs to the light of day that middleclass america will not agree with them and they will have a chance we will have a chance of reversing some of that

clearly the current patchwork of government and market forces that crisscross our health structure have left an imperfect situation in which millions of americans lack access to quality care and the cost of providing that quality care is skyrocketing but is more government controlsome of us might say interference the answer looking at the history of american health care spending we see alarming trends that raise serious red flags about the costs of governmentrun health care in 190 this nation spent 4 billion on health care in 1960 total national health expenditures were 27 1 billion in 1965 the year government became a health service payor for millions of americans through medicare and medicaid national health spending had increased to 41 6 billion over the next 15 years national health spending quintupled reaching more than 250 billion in 1980 over the next decade health spending more than doubled again and by 1991 this nation was spending 751 8 billion on health care put another way in 1960 we spent 7 8 percent of our gross domestic product on health care by 1991 that number was 14 1 percent not only has governments entry into a major portion of our health care market not had a positive effect on the cost of care but rather many of us believe governments intrusion into the marketplace has been a major factor in the enormous increase in health spending simply put government control tends to inflate rather than lower costs the president keeps telling us that his health reform plan will control health spending while ensuring that everyone has health care and bringing down the national debt if it sounds too good to be true that is because it is even the congressional budget office which was under enormous political pressure to provide a favorable review of the clinton plan has found that under the best of circumstancesthat is if price controls are 100 percent effectivethe clinton health plan will generate additional deficits of 130 billion over the next 5 years when has anything the government does been anywhere close to 100 percent effective a more realistic review conducted by the wellrespected policy firm of kpmg peat marwick found the clinton plan will likely add 579 billion to the national debt in the next 7 years if its price controls are 50 percent effectivewhich is also a stretch for the federal government as we look at other analyseslike those that predict massive job loss under the clinton plan and thosethat show the presidents approach has severely underestimated the costs of the new health entitlement he promisesits no wonder americans

i have two main concerns one a longstanding opposition to the unnecessary level of secrecy in which the intelligence budget is cloaked and two the abrupt change in direction that the intelligence conferees have taken in their report regarding two important intelligence programs first i will state to my colleagues once again my belief that the foreign policy activities of this nation taken by our government on behalf of its citizens should and is for the most part done in the open i believe it is wrong however that an arm of our government is given the authority to conduct operations other than intelligence gathering in support of foreign policy goals that are unknown to our citizens the people of the united states have a right to be engaged in the debate which yields our foreign policy activities i do not here refer to the important maintenance of operational secrecy but rather to the need to debate in the open whether and when we would engage in hostile operations against another country in this context my concern lies not specifically the overall budget level for intelligence although i believe that prudent savings in the intelligence budget can be realized with careful planning and a recognition of the many new and open ways in which information flows to policymakers additionally it is the right of the people of our country to know the funding level of its intelligence agencies i will continue to support legislative efforts that would bring these aspects into the sunshine my second objection to the report is concemed more with what has become ablurred relationship between the national foreign intelligence or nfip programs and tactical intelligence and related activities or tiara programs i think it is time we substantially change this arrangement i am disappointed and concerned that the conferees have increased the authorization for nfip above the budget request while authorizing a corresponding decrease in tiara programs this action is contrary to actions taken by the conferees on the fiscal year 1995 defense authorization and appropriations acts and contrary to agreements reached between the secretary of defense and the director of central intelligence resulting from their joint review of nfip and tiara programs we should be focusing on the interoperability of capabilities in support of military operations ensuring essential improvements for imagery support as well as developing a new unitedstates intelligence program and budget structure to better reflect user needs and priorities consistent with our changed strategic environment the blurring of national versus tactical intelligence was highlighted last year when the committee raised concern in its report on the fiscal year 1994 defense authorization bill the committee then observed that over the years the boundaries between tiara and nfip components of the intelligence budgets have become a source of confusion and contention the committee was and continues to be concerned that the lack of clearly established definitions for nfip and tiara have led to the sometimes arbitrary assignment of intelligence programs and functions within these categories as a consequence the armed services committee called on the secretary of defense and the director of central intelligence to review intelligence programs and activities and provide to congress a report identifying those programs which support first primarily national purposes second primarily defensewide theater activities and the unified command or three primarily a single service or agency the report was also to have identified those programs and activities that should no longer be included in the intelligence budget although we have seen fragments and or bits and pieces of what appears to be a concerted effort to address this matter a formal comprehensive report has yet to be provided an important review was undertaken by the department earlier this year to determine what if any programs or activities should be removed from tiara this effort was undertaken in response to the fiscal year 1994 house armed services committee language asking the department to identify programs and activities that should no longer be included in the intelligence budget as a result the department determined that indeed there were certain programs that fell outside the definition of tiara used by the congress and has subsequently proposed to delete these activities from the fiscal year 1996 tiara congressional justification book these programs include for example ballistic missile defense the defense meteorological support program tanker support to reconnaissance and the navys mapping charting and geodesy to name a few when added up funding for these programs totaled

missiles at a time when we are reducing expenditures on many other nuclear weapons programs the department of defense wants to continue spending billions of dollars on submarinelaunched nuclear missiles in addition the department of defense is tentatively planning to spend about 5 billion dollars to replace the c4 missile with the d5 missile on the eight trident i submarines the question before us today is whether or not we can justify spending billions of dollars in the next few years on additional nuclear missiles why do i believe that we can not afford to spend scarce taxpayer dollars on additional nuclear missiles first while the opponents of this amendment downplay the fact that the cold war is over and that the soviet union no longer exists the fact is that this missile was designed solely to penetrate the hardened targets found only in the former soviet union to illustrate the problem that the navy has encountered with the fact that the cold war has ended i have an article here from defense news of 3 months ago which explains how the navy is studying ways to use the d5 missile for conventional purposes can we really afford to procure d5 missiles at a cost of 30 million per missilefor conventional uses when a less expensive missile could perform this mission if the navy so badly needs additional d5 missiles for their strategic submarine fleet why are they studying ways to use this expensive missile for conventional purposes second there is the question of this amendment jeopardizing the start ii treaty this amendment essentially requires the navy to seek an agreement with the russians to allow the united states to decrease the number of missiles per submarinea procedure known as detubing and increase the number of warheads per missile only the detubing part of this action is not allowed under the start ii treaty the treaty counts 24 missiles per submarineand four warheadsper missilewhether there are 24 missiles on the submarine or not therefore in order to reduce the number of missiles per submarineand have it counted that waythe united states would need to seek an agreement with the russians on this issue of detubing does a requirement to ask the russians about this issuewhich would save american taxpayers billions of dollarsreally jeopardize the start ii treaty not in my opinion if we vote today to terminate the trident hid5 missile program the worse result of asking the russians to allow the united states to detube its trident h submarines would be for the russians to say no to this proposal sometime after termination of the d5 missile the congressional budget office discussed this scenario in its recent report on the trident iid5 missile according to cbo the united states could in such a circumstance deploy no more than 1 248 submarinelaunched ballistic missiles which is about 30percent fewer than what is permitted by the start h treaty yet even with a smaller deployment in that portion of the nuclear triad the united states would still retain a total of about 3 000 deployed nuclear warheads an arsenal which would be roughly equal to the number of warheads that russia is expected to deploy under the start ii treaty according to the congressional budget office i urge members to vote in favor of the pennywoolseyklug amendment i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.9997832425578963,

amendment invades the prerogatives of the local school boards as very few other amendments have done throughout all of our debate on goals 2000 where the federal government seeks to set certain standards in content and curricula and standards in performance everything has been voluntary everything has been in terms of we will state certain models and the states in the final analysis will decide what they want to do local control in curriculum has not been violated in any of the legislation for education that we have pursued so far if there are people who really want to have the federal government have a greater role in promoting values and preventing teenage pregnancies and providing more positive sex education then there are many things the federal government can do madam chairman let us be brave enough to take on the media be brave enough to use the power of the federal government through the federal communications commission the no i problem in america with respect

regulations or through the fcc regulation of cable i say to my colleagues if you are interested in having this body do what this body can do best and what local school boards cannot djo then try to promote more stringent requirements on the manner in which sex and the wanton participation in sex is encouraged via our media via the radio television and motion picture formats we have the power to regulate interstate commerce the movement of pornographic magazines there are a number of things we can do corporations are responsible for most of the progranming that appears on broadcast television and much of the programming that appears on cable television we have power with respect to the regulation of corporate activity we have power with respect to regulation of how they spend their advertising dollars if you want to be brave and do something about trying to influence teenage values then why not take on a greater regulation role with respect to the fcc with respect to corporate power and the kinds of things they finance why not take on a greater regulation role with respect to the motion picture industry the magazine industry there are a number of ways in which you can deal with and deal more effectively with your agenda to better promote more positive attitudes among teenagers with respect to sex educatiom we have no business in interfering and we hope that they will take the necessary steps to provide enough sex education to guarantee that the youngsters know how to protect their own health to guarantee they know how to survive madam chairman aids is a very

listen to every word that my colleague uttered this evening there are a number of remarks that the gentleman made that i would like to respond to but time does not permit let me go to the salient issue first let me raise this rhetorical question how many times i would ask my colleagues have we been asked to vote against rules that waive points of brder how many times more times than i can count it sets history on its head it takes me aback it is shocking to me to hear tonight on the floor of this body that the gentleman is asking us to oppose a rule that does not waive all points of order we cannot walk both sides of the street simultaneously unless your legs are pretty wide open and when they are you stand pretty vulnerable the gentleman from new york is my good friend and i respect him he says one person can rise to raise a point of order i do not stand here in the capacity of one person this is not an ego trip this is no personal issue i stand here as the chairperson of the authorizing committee charged with a responsibility it sets history on its head when you argue to sanction violations of a process that the gentleman from new york and i have already marched into the well on numerous occasions to defend that the integrity of the process must be maintained let us come specifically to the carrier let me say something to my colleague we asked for a point of order to be allowed against a 1 billion appropriation against a 4 8 billion weapons system now that is not an accommodation that is real money the bill says appropriation based on authorization first to simply say that is a prima facie case that that is a weapons system that is not authorized second i would say to the gentleman from new york this weapons system was not even requested in fiscal year now to the integrity of the process if authorized the house authorization bill did not authorize it it does not appear anywhere in the companion report of the fiscal year 1994 authorization bill just passed by the house further in the other body the companion bill of the dod authorization for fiscal year 1994 also did not authorize this weapons system their report does not speak to it to the gentleman from new york i would ask this question that he might answer in his time if the bill says appropriate upon authorization and the house authorization bill did not authorize it the senate authorization bill did not authorize it the only way that it can be authorized in fiscal year 1994 is both bodies to report back in a conference report s1 billion out of scope where is the precedent for coming back to a body 1 billion out of scope i would suggest that logic stands on this gentlemans side if you can authorize the bill in fiscal year 1994 and you say you cannot appropriate until you authorize and you cannot authorize until fiscal year 1995 then query why then encumber 31 billion in budget authority to appropriate in fiscal year 1994 saying that it is sitting there waiting so some businessman says well if i can take this money from 1994 sit it there until we authorize on october 1 we can rush to start signing contracts we on the house armed services committee take our jobs very seriously i will say to the gentleman from new york if we have rules here how can we argue to vote down a rule because it waives points of order we ought to maintain the integrity of the authorizing process but then when it comes to defense we say but let us set that aside do you want a kangaroo court here do you want rules that govern different subject matters in different ways then this would be a bizarre experience there has to be some continuity this would be a bizarre experience so there has to be some way you can say yes in the authorizing process you can say no in the appropriation process but you cannot turn that around you cannot say no authorization and yes in the appropriation that is the rules that were set up before i came here so i am not here on some

made a smart move when he decided not to include beer taxes in his proposed health care package now however its up to congress to follow the same intelligent path as it weighs the funding demands of major government programs particularly health care the reason higher beer taxes should be avoided has nothing to do with politics using such taxes to fund ongoing government programs is not smart budgeting because it simply doesnt work all we need to do is look toward the states to discover the growing inefficiencies of beer excise taxes last year the council of state governments called these socalled sin taxes a wom out tax source the council advised states to look for more stable revenues to fund vital programs such as health care and education the council is not alone in its contention that revenue for important social programs should not come from unreliable sources such as beer taxes other widely respected organizations including the federation of tax administrators and the national council of state legislators agree that the excise tax piggy bank has been raided too often the federal government should heed these omens and leave beer taxes off the table once and for all when searching for health care funding vehicles funding for any major social program especially national health care should not fall unduly upon the shoulders of beer consumers or any other single group tax fairness is a timehonored principle in our country and during the past few years responsible beer consumers have shelled out more than their fair share when the federal beer excise tax was doubled in 1991 moderate drinkersnot chronic abusers reduced their consumption not only did this prove beer taxes to be a shaky revenue generator but it also punished 84 million hardworking middle class americans whose only offense was purchasing a perfectly legal adult consumer product the minority of drinkers who abuse alcohol are not put off by higher costs they have serious problems which can only be cured through education and tougher law enforcement not excessive taxation punishing the many for the irresponsible behavior of the few is not just a bad idea its bad public policy period access to quality health care is a vital issue of our times but implementing a regressive tax to fund a program for every american doesnt jibe with common sense our task in congress is clear any

than being a nation dependent on foreign oil clearly the btu tax was heavily debated in committee and it has been heavily debated on the floor i should say it raises 70 billion out of about 350 billion of revenue or tax increases 70 billion of that is from the energy tax what is not taxed is very important alternative energy solar and wind is exempt from the tax so there is a tax incentive to invest in those kinds of technologies cogeneration energy that is produced from cogeneration an energy waste today but if you can harness that and use that steam plant that is maybe producing paper to also cogenerate electricity to run the factory that energy produced is not taxed so there is more incentive incentives for industries especially our energyintensive industries companies to move into this direction in addition the biomass conversion of biomass into energy is exempt from the tax as well so we have now in place as part of energy policy an incentive to go in those much more benign and energyefficient ways of producing generating energy in addition we try to reconcile the fact that different regions of this country rely on different sources of energy for transportation or home heating or electricity for their homes whether used for airconditioning or on the stove or the heating system so if americans stop and think about it the northeast is different from the northwest which is different from the southeast and the southwest we each have energy which comes from different sources we may have a major source such as nuclear power in the midwest or also use some coal where out in the northwest we use a lot of hydro and some coal how do you bring fairness nationally to this energy tax is a very difficult question compromise wa4 made and we did that but the fact is we are asking everybody to pay a little bit more not everybody i will get to that because of the earned income tax credit but we are asking a lot of americans to pay this is a tax also that people can have some control over because if they are using energy conservation devices in their home wrapping the water heater wrapping the hot water pipes putting plastic over the windows in the wintertime and

availability of urgently needed child care services for american families during the 101st congress we worked hard to help enact major child care legislation after a long and arduous struggle we finally enacted compromise legislation to provide much needed assistance to parents all over the nation however it goes without saying that the legislation that was approved falls short of solving the child care crisis in this nation the funding for child care programs is far less than what is needed and the bush administration complicated matters by issuing regulations which undermine the ability of these new programs to expand and improve child care services further one crucial proposal contained in the housepassed child care bill was unfortunately omitted from the final compromise my proposal to provide incentive grants to businesses for the purpose of expanding quality child care services the private sector has often been criticized for its lack of involvement in providing or subsidizing child care services it is often pointed out that only a small fraction of the nations 6 million employers currently provide some kind of child care assistance to their employees there is a clear trend however toward increased involvement on the part of employers in 1978 only 110 corporations sponsored or paid for child care services by 1985 that figure had risen to 2 500 and by 1989 it stood at 4 100 still much more needs to be done in a 1988 survey of 1 500 employers conducted by the american society for personnel administration 50 percent of the firms indicated that they are considering or actively planring for the provision of child care services to their employees this survey included a large number of small and midsized firms it shows the potential is dearly there to spur dramatic expansion of services moreover a survey conducted by the fatailies and work institute of 188 major corporations in 30 industries shows that 13 percent of major corporations now offer child care centers 5 percent offer child care discounts and 1 percent offer child care vouchers the report concludes that there is a dramatic change underway in american business with nearly all of the nations largest corporations offering some types of programs to help employees meet family needs according to eflen galinsky a coauthor of the report which is called the corporate reference guide to workfamily programs although most companies still have a long way to go innovative familysupportive programs are mushrooming the pace is accelerating and the trend is irreversible there are several reasons why there is so much corporate interest in providing child care services for one thing employees are increasingly making clear their needs for child care assistance however the response of many corporations is not only a manifestation of altruism toward their employees it is also based on an increasing realization that the provision of child care services and other familyfriendly policies are directly linked to enhance productivity and increased competitiveness according to dana friedman and ellen galinsky of the families and work institute employerprovided child care is directly related to improvements in recruitment retention and improved employee morale in a period of impending labor shortages the ability to retain a qualified and already trained work force is of the utmost importance the provision of child care services will help american businesses maintain and improve their productivity despite the fact that child care makes sense from the standpoint of the bottom line most businesses are still reluctant to become involved in providing or subsidizing child care however there is evidence that the provision of federal incentives can be a highly successful manner of expanding private sector involvement in the child care field business leaders themselves tell us that federal incentives are likely to spur corporate involvement in child care programs at a 1989 conference of 250 employers convened by resources for child care management in chicago business leaders were asked if government assistance would spur additional corporate involvement all of the respondents strongly indicated that government assistance would prompt additional action on the part of business and the majority cleariy preferred a program of incentive grants further the need for business involvement in providing child care services has long been acknowledged by members of congress from both parties in fact as long ago as 1984 the select committee on children youth and families issued a report recommending among other things that congress should develop incentives for employers to expand the child care options available to their employees this recommendation was endorsed by democratic and republican members of the committee from the standpoint of the federal govemment publicprivate partnerships are a costeffective response to the child care crisis because federal grants will be matched with private contributions a small federal investment will leverage a much larger sum for actual child care services at a time when federal resources are extremely limited the ability to leverage private sector funds must not be overlooked perhaps that is why almost every major child care bill in recent years has acknowledged the need for publicprivate partnerships in child care my proposal to provide federal support for expansion of private sector involvement in child care built upon the proposals contained in many of these bills and was also developed in cooperation with experts in the field the proposal received virtually unanimous support from both sides of the aisle during the consideration of child care legislation by the house during the 101st congress and it was approved by the house as part of the omnibus child care bill unfortunately it was not included in the final compromise later agreed to between senators and the white houseeven though no substantive objections were ever raised at the time many leaders in the child care field from both sides of the aisle expressed their intent to cooperate in advancing this specific proposal as part of future child care legislation therefore i am reintroducing my bill at this point i am joined in doing so by representatives susan molinari and george miller who are also deeply committed to the goal of expanding child care services for american families the bill we are introducing the child care publicprivate partnership act is identical to the version that was agreed to by members of the housesenate child care conference in specifically it authorizes 25 million for a program of matching grants administered by the secretary of health and human services these grants would be provided to businesses or consortia of small businesses to help them create or expand child care services for their employees and the surrounding communityeither onsite or at a nearby location grants could also be provided to nonprofit organizations to provide technical information and assistance that will enable businesses to provide child care service however the secretary is directed to give priority to grant awards which are designed to increase actual child care services small businesses have understandably been reluctant to become involved in providing child care services because of the capital shortages that they often face this legislation recognizes the special needs of small business by giving a preference to grant proposas involving companies with fewer than 100 employees grant recipients would be required to match every government dollar with two private dollars in addition grant applicants must provide assurances that child care services will be provided at affordable rates and on an equitable basis to all employees including lowand moderateincome employees finally applicants must provide assurances that child care services provided with grant funds are in compliance with state and local licensing requirements i would urge all of my colleagues to join as cosponsors of this bipartisan initiative publicprivate partnerships are clearly an important means of providing additional child care options to american families they minimize federal outlays while maximizing child care options we know that many businesses are providing child care services and many more are aware of the importance of child care clearly it is in the interests of our nations families for the federal government to help facilitate increased employer involvement if we can bring the private sector and the public sector together in partnership we can significantly expand the availability of quality child care at a minimal cost to the taxpayers this will not only brighten the future of countless children across the nation but it will also help us increase productivity and enhance our competitiveness for the benefit of my colleagues i would like to insert in the
