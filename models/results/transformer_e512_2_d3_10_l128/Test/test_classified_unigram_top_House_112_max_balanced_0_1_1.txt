energy gasoline in particular what kind of difficulty thats causing small businesses across the country because i hear this all the time from my small business constituents its not surprising that energy prices and gas prices in particular have been going up so much theyre doublethe gas prices alone at the pump are double what they were when the obama administration took over and thats most unfortunate but its really not surprising when you consider the person that president obama appointed to be the head of energy in this country the chief mind about energy and what we should do about it is the secretary of energy steven chu steven chu a couple of months before president obama appointed him to that position said that it was his goal what we ought to try to do what we ought to strive for is to raise the price of gasoline in this country energy costs prices of gasoline for example to european levels think of that now theyve got approximately it depends on the country youre talking about but its around 9 a gallonthey do liters over therebut its about 9 a gallon now were not there yet but unfortunately were well on our way its approaching 4 back in my district in cincinnati here in washington just the other day i had to fill up and it was about 4 50 so were not quite there yet but were approaching that its just unbelievable that were in this state but really i guess it shouldnt be surprising when you consider that the person that president obama put in control of our energy policy here in this country said that it was his goal to get energy prices up to european levels as i say unfortunately were well on our way those gas prices thats what the delivery trucks have to pay the small business folks that are delivering things to towns or getting products from other manufacturers when they come in they cost more so they cant charge the consumers as much or if they do they drive those consumers away so its a vicious circle we need to get energy prices down in this country and unfortunately theyre on their way up another i think terrible mistake that this administration has made is to basically shut the door on the keystone pipeline this is oil sands from canada our friendly neighbor to the north our largest supplier of petroleum by the way is canada and this is a pipeline that would mean a significant number of jobs here in the united states tens of thousands of jobs and if we ever needed jobs we know its now and those are goodpaying jobs many of them are union jobs but the president has decided that no were not going to make this decision until maybe after the election so tens of thousands of jobs are at risk here canada has been pretty clear about what theyre going to do if were not going to accept the oil in our country and build the pipeline its quite likely that theyll go ahead and build the pipeline through canada to british columbia and ship that oil that ought to be going to the unitedstates to china who is one of our biggest competitors in a lot of ways and if you know anything about china the environmental controls that they have over there are far weaker than what we have in the united states so if your goal is to make sure that youre protecting the environmentand thats what many of the presidents allies the really radical leftwing environmentalists who are fighting against the keystone pipelineif you buy their argument what theyre saying is they want to protect the environment by not having that oil come down here and be refined in the gulf but the controls we have here are much stronger than what they are over in china so youre not protecting the environment at all or climate change or anything else if youre going to allow them to spew out what they usually do in china when they handle refining and manufacturing oftentimes and a lot of other things we all know how the administration supported an organization like solyndra and how much tax dollars were wasted there and it goes on and on so the energy policy in this country by this administration is impacting consumers its impacting you and me and anybody who goes and fills up at the gas pump nowadays but its also adversely impacting small businesses and job creation another way that this administration i believe has made a mistake which is causing these high prices is to continue to keep off limits much of the outer continental shelf the gulf the moratorium was disastrous for jobs in the gulf region after the spill down there and yes it should have been investigated very thoroughly but a lot of those oil derricks ended up leaving that area they couldnt hold out with that cost the expensive capital costs over 6 months period of time so they ended up off the coast of brazil for example and the president famously said well be happy to buy your oil brazil well we can look at oil all around the world but we ought to be selfsufficient and the president said he was interested in being energy selfsufficient in this country but his policies are anything but that so he continues to put off limits much of the outer continental shelf we had the disaster in the gulf and anwr up in alaska the administration has continued to put off limits now we need to do all these things in an environmentally safe manner and we have the ability to do that now but again this administration has shut this down thats affecting all of us in higher and higher gas prices so its long overdue for this administration to take a look a long hard look at what their policies are doing to the country and to reconsider this to allow us to go after oil that we have available to us clean coal natural gas and a whole range of fuels that we have here in this country so we dont have to be buying that from countries that oftentimes dont have our best interests at heart it sends a lot of money over to regions and countries where unfortunately a lot of terrorism that has endangered the world and endangers us has come from so those dollars arent always spent in a way thats going to help the united states so its time for the administration to turn its policies around without further ado i will yield back the balance of my time"],

really inspired by american history in high school by sam parker my teacher my scoutmaster so i know a little bit about our history i know a lot about world history as well and its important to take things in perspective especially speeches here in washington and take them from the perspective of how it all fits together now we have been in this chamber and i was sitting right back there on the aisle and we had the president of the united states standing right there i was on a direct line of sight to eyetoeye with the president except his eyes cut right into the teleprompter each time he looked my way so i dont think we ever made eye contact but he kept telling us over and over 16 17 times i didnt count them ive been told but he said weve got to pass this bill right now right now this bill right now well unfortunately last thursday when the president was saying weve got to pass this bill right now there was no bill there was no plan he talked about his plan he talked about his bill they didnt have it quite ready yesterday until later and we kept harassing the white house saying we want to get a copy of the bill we need a copy of the bill youve said pass the bill now do we not get to even have a copy of the bill before we have to pass it or would it be okay if we could you know see it before we pass it you know it might be a good idea to file it at some point if were going to pass a bill thats just my thinking and so the white house was kind enough late yesterday to email a copy of the bill we got it up on our web site at gohmert house gov for others who are intrigued by the promises that have been made and what it actually does lets see its called saving obamas job no im sorry american jobs act is the name of it its interesting to hear somebody talk about their bill and then get it and dig through i think i finished about 5 this morning going through all 155 pages of the bill and its most interesting some of these things im going to have to talk to people who have more expertise in particular areas some things its pretty obvious what they say page 6 he gets right into payroll tax relief and again as the person who came up with the idea for a tax holiday as a way to stimulate the economy back nearly 3 years ago and as a person who in january of 2009 told the president personally about my idea for a tax holiday moodys rated a tax holiday as increasing the gdp it looks like more than other stimulus proposals that was back in 2009 before this president squandered 4 5 trillion above and beyond the amount around 2 2 trillion or so a year that was coming in its shocking that we could go through that much money of course we had 2 years the first 2 years with the same party in power in the house and senate as is in the white house and as i found in my first term in 2005 and 2006 sometimes when you have the same party in the white house and in the house and senate if the people in congress are not adequately restrained and cannot adequately restrain themselves there ends up being a big spending frenzy in 2006 again my second year in congress we spent over 160 billion more than we took in democrats across the aisle rightfully tore after republicans how could you spend 160 billion more than what we had coming into the treasury and they were right to do so we should not have spent 160 billion more than we had coming in ironically president bush in 2008 had a bill passed by the democraticcontrolled house and senate a stimulus bill that opened the door a bit to these stimulus frenzies and 40 billion of that 160 billion as i recall was going to be going to people who didnt pay any income taxes as a rebate which caused me to ask the president down here on the floor after the state of the union how do you give a rebate to people that didnt put any bate in then after that we had tarp president george w bush is a good man he is smarter than most of the people in this town wanted to give him credit for one of the wittiest people youll ever want to be around but he made the mistake of listening to until now the worst treasury secretary in the history of the country hank paulson and paulson said look give me 750 billion i can fix things well that was a mistake anybody that read that bill would understand that was not a bill that should have ever passed and if more people on the house floor had read the bill i am confident i know they couldnt have brought themselves to vote for it but they didnt read it many didnt well thats why i spent most of last night going through the presidents jobs bill he does have some payroll tax relief but compared to the payroll tax relief i was proposing we were told it would be close toif you just gave people all of their tax money in their check it didnt need to come back from washington it would be in the check if we passed it and the president had signed it on a thursday it would have been in their friday check all of the money all of the taxes they paid that would have stimulated the economy and we wouldnt have needed the government to say hey lets bail out gm and lets bail out chrysler because if people had had their own money they could have gone down and bought a car from the car manufacturer and dealer that they wanted to buy from instead of just throwing money at the car industry i appreciated the gm commercial saying we paid our money back unfortunately that was not true it was a misrepresentation still money owed anyway i guess he would do well in washington with that kind of mentality the payroll tax relief provided here is just a fraction of what i was suggesting in late 2008 2009 the president in fact when i told him the idea in january of 2009 said thats a great idea have you talked to larry talking about larry summers who was right behind him at the time i said id love to talk to larry summers about it summers reached around and gave me a card the card said give me a call he never took my calls i waited a week and then he didnt call me i felt hurt you know like high school days when youre trying to ask somebody on a date and they say let me get back to you well i was snubbed he didnt get back to me okay well not the first time so i relentlessly called and i was given eventually to some young man who sounded like his voice was still changing telling me to leave a message and i didnt leave messages and larry as the president referred to him never got back to me and i understand hes not over there now but they called a tax holiday back in those days that got just a few bucks in peoples pocket nothing like the stimulus would have been if people had been able to keep their own money all of it for a couple of months now this wasnt my motive my motive was to stimulate but there was a secondary occurrence that would have happened had we had a real tax holiday even for 2 or 3 months it would have been that workers across america including union workers would notice many of them for the first time it would really come home how much money theyre sending to washington every month and how much better their lives would be if they didnt send that much money to washington every month if they had their own money to give to their own charitable causes they had their own money to bail themselves out their own money to stimulate their own household everybody would have been better off but thats not the tack the president chose he got what was originally touted to be an 800 billion stimulus and he also had about 450 billion of the original tarp that he and secretary geithner were able to find ways to squander we were told if we did not pass the presidents stimulus package back in early 2009 he said the unemployment rate might go as high as 81 2 percent that 81 2 percent sounds pretty good people remember him saying well gee if youll pass this unemployment will be around 8 percent at the worst wrong but if you dont pass it it could go as high as 81 2 percent id take that 81 2 percent right now and have everybody that got that money give it back because it was for the most part wasted now people back then were told by the president its a stimulus bill its all about infrastructure were going to have this money go to infrastructure well there was only a tiny pittance of what may have been more like a trillion dollars that went to infrastructure that goes through page 16 with that part we get into first responder stabilization and there is 5 billion for one program 4 billion for another program 1 billion for the attorney general first responder stabilization fund oh i guess 4 billions for the attorney general to carry out the competitive grant program it keeps being lost on people here that americas better off if you dont force people at the point of imprisonment and irs persecution to give all of this money to washington and then well dole it out as we see fit the economy does better when you let people keep their own money and only bring just as much as necessary dont try to run everybodys lives but at page 17 were going to give all of this money to the attorney generals office and let them dole it out as they see fit and weve seen that if youre a friend of the administration youre going to do well if youre not theyre going to sic on you all of the power of the bureaucratic whether its epa all of these administrations tools and youll pay a price were finding that out in texas now you go to the next page page 18 youve got elementary and secondary schools theyre supposed to get money but of course its going to come through washington because we know best and were going to dole some money to the states were going to dole some to state and local applications as indicated on page 19 but you cant miss this its throughout the bill page 20 here we go again we saw it with the solyndra fiasco in california and this administration giving away 500 million that cant be accounted for nowjust squandered well were going to do that some more maybe if we keep throwing money at a bad idea it will somehow someday in some way get a little better so page 20 has got us prioritizing green practices kind of like a bankrupt spain has done now there is money in here page 21 this is nicemoney even for private schools but only if they have a child poverty rate of at least 40 percent then weve got community college modernization and more green jobs within the colleges page 23 and you go on and on i mean i went through this it does go on and on then were told were going to invest this time we really really mean it we said we really meant it back in january of 09 that were going to have infrastructure and thats going to bring us up we said it we didnt spend it on infrastructure we squandered it on acorn and all these different groups but this time we really really really mean it lets see that looks like its 2 billion for that program and on and onl its interesting weve got all this money were going to put toward highways and whatnot now anyone who believed this was all going to go straight to infrastructure missed the point because then we get over to page 40 and you get to the real jobs this is where the jobs are really created it starts on page 40 its called the american infrastructure financing authority if you love fannie and freddie youre going to love the american infrastructure financing authority on page 41 youll find out there are seven voting members appointed by the president well hes good at creating jobslook at all the government jobs he has addedso thats who i want having appointed i mean he has appointed all these people from universities who have never created jobs in their lives so theyre perplexed as to why their programs arent working he does have the head of ge whos helping him with that jobs program china is grateful china is very grateful to the head of ge because he has created lots of jobstheyre just in china and not here maybe hell get to be on this board as well but its another government program lets see i want to make sure i get this right the board of directors first appointees will be deemed the incorporators of aifathats the american infrastructure financing authoritybut that will make for some good reading i wouldnt read it right before going to bed because you might not be able to go to sleep then we get over to page 56 this talks about the funding of the american infrastructure financing authority and the administrative fees which is section 257 then we get into that it has hereby appropriated aifa to carry out this act for the cost of direct loans and loan guarantees except for the limitations under section 253 and for administrative costs of 10 billion that remain available until expended then youve got some other moneys there but thats good news because you can spend that for administrative costs fortunately in washington we dont run up much in the way of administrative costs now one thing that some people have talked about to raise a little bit of revenue is to sell some of our broadband spectrum then we also know that there are those in washington who are not happy that the fcc has not been able to have a fairness doctrine so they can dictate what goes on the air well not to worry because people it seems are going more and more to broadband than to radio waves and television waves were getting more and more broadband stuff so we have the answer to the lack of a fairness doctrine that the fcc has wanted under this administration but weve been able to avoid it so far there is nothing about a fairness doctrine in here but fortunately you get to page 75 and you find out were going to establishi love this namea public safety broadband corporation on the next page 76 you find out it has established a private nonprofit corporation and youre going to have some members who know how to run a government operation and create government jobs of course it killed jobs in the private sector but its creating government jobs thats down here youve got the secretary of commerce the secretary of homeland security the attorney generalwere talking real job creators hereand others who will be on that board so people can feel better about that if you dont think we have enough government control of things well this bill youre going to love it more government control more government corporations the thing that many missedand it jumped out at me as i sat back there and the president spokeis when he said we want to work side by side with business for people who have ears and can hear that means this president wants to be your business partner that scares some folks and thats why i think you saw the market go down the next day people who understand how real jobs in the real world are created know that the government being partners with people trying to generate jobs is a job killer we dont need a government to be partners side by side working with business the government as designed by the founders and as were supposed to be carrying out is supposed to be a referee to make sure people play fair if the government had made sure people were playing fair instead of dictating every detail of their existence then they would have noticed that bernie madoff was cheating people but the governmentour bureaucracywas too concerned with dictating how people live and they forgot about their job as referee i highlighted so much stuff as i went through the night but i wont bore you with all of this lets see public safety roaming and priority access the fcc is going to get the report on the efficient use of public safety spectrum oh extended benefit provisions theres good stuff there ive been a fan of retraining people when there are jobs in one sector and people have lost jobs in another and there are no jobs with the training they have thats a good idea its better money than just throwing out unemployment reimbursement if you can train people to have real jobs this bill spends billions of dollars weve got the reemployment now program thats a new federal bureaucracy a new federal program weve got the state plan at page 98 weve got the bridge to work program at page 99 were going to retrain people for jobs we dont have jobs that they can fill but were going to spend a lot of time training them for jobs that dont exist wouldnt we be better off encouraging the real job creators the small business folks to create jobs and then train them for that but no were going to suck more capital out of the financial community and into the government so we can retrain people for jobs that dont exist then we have on page 106 the shorttime compensation program the shorttime compensation program means a program in which the participation of the employers is voluntary and the employer reduces the number of hours worked by employees in lieu of layoffs such employees whose workweeks have been reduced by at least 10 percent are then eligible for unemployment compensation if you lose 10 percent of your work time guess what were now opening up a new avenue for unemployment compensation ten percent reduced is all it takes employersive talked to so manysay i dont want to fire anybody im asking my employees to hang on were all reducing what were taking in and were going to try to get through this without firing anybody but everybody has had to take a cut well this will make them eligible for unemployment compensation which raises their unemployment insurance rates they have to pay which means they are going to have to lay off somebody in order to pay the additional unemployment insurance rates of course then you have got temporary financing of shortterm compensation agreements at page 109 oh weve got grants weve got subsidized employment for unemployed lowincome adults you know instead of sucking all this capital out of the private sector it seems like we would want to help create more jobs well if youre not satisfied with all the jobs that are created by the new government programs new government agencies wonderful that we have got something better than fannie and freddie for infrastructure financing thats great but i understand that lawsuit filing is down significantly around the country our constitution tells you and we know in our hearts that its wrong to discriminate against people based on race creed color national origin gender those things make sense we shouldnt discriminate and those are protected classes weve also added no matter what your sexual preference your sexual orientation no matter what youre oriented toward sexually because the democratic majority would not allow us to define sexual orientation to exclude illegal activity we know sexual orientation is a protected class now we are adding in this bill a new protected class called unemployed the title on page 129 prohibition of discrimination in employment on the basis of an individuals status as unemployed it says right here in the findings that we find that denial of employment opportunities to individuals because of their status as unemployed is discriminatory and burdens commerce it goes on and explains this in the preceding pages so the good news is if youre unemployed and you go to apply for a job and youre not hired for that job see a lawyer you may be able to file a claim because you got discriminated against because you were unemployed now some would point out legitimately that will discourage people from doing interviews of people unemployed because if they do theyve got a claim or may have a claim to make against the employer for discrimination based on the fact that they were unemployed i think that this will help trial lawyers who are not having enough work because it can open the door we heard from our friends across the aisle in the preceding hour 14 million people out of work thats 14 million potential new clients that could go hire a lawyer and file a claim because they didnt get hired even though they were unemployed weve heard the president demonizing billionaires and millionaires you know why are the republicans so strong on trying to bail out their rich friends well what weve learned here in this town in recent years is that if the very wealthy dont mind being called names they will be enriched and even engorged for example we know that wall street executives have been called fat cats by this administration and demonized yet the little secret behind the scenes joke is dont mind being called names this administration has brought more profit to wall street than goldman sachs has ever seen in their history wall street executives and their families gave to president obama 4to1 over john mccain so of course theyve got a good little deal going on there and also demonize the oil and gas industry even though you know you love british petroleum because they were going to endorse the capandtrade bill and you demonize them and then you stick provisions in this bill that have no effect on the big major oil companies they will only affect these provisions at the back at pages 151 152 153 they will not affect the big majors like british petroleum except that because they will destroy the ability of independent producers that produce much or maybe most of the oil and gas in the continental unitedstates it will drive them out of business it will dry up investment this is repeal of the oil and gas working interest exception the passive activity so there are things in here that are going to dry up the independent oil companys ability to function and the payforwe were told over and over this is all paid foris on page 155 here it is get ready the budget control act of 2011 is amended by striking 1 5 trillion that the supercommittee is going to have to find in cuts and inserting 1 95 trillion hes saying its all paid for its all paid for and the way its all paid for is the new supercommittee is now ordered under the presidents bill to find another 450 billion to pay for his bill so its all paid for hallelujah amen now there are so many more problems i havent had a chance to get to and there are probably some things that i probably missed even as i went through this but there is such bad news for america in here union workers watch out this may be the end of your jobs but its okay because the unions are growing by getting more government employees not the hardworking folks in the regular unions these are the government unions it should say instead of american jobs bill saving the presidents job bill but this is a disaster for every other thinking person in america with that i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.4546017646789551, 0.4546017646789551, 0, "i appreciate the privilege and the honor to be recognized to address you here on the floor of the united states house of representatives and to follow the gentleman from illinois here in the well i want to first say that he makes clear sense with the argument he makes we dont hear these arguments enough too often this congress is dealing with superfluous issues political issues rather than practical solutions it brings to mind for me the presidents speech last night from in front of where you are right now very early in his speech the president said he wants to see a future where we are in control of our own energy part of that solution is encompassed by the delivery of john shimkus here a little bit ago with what to do with nuclear waste i would say also there are other things we can do from a technical perspective to utilize that recycle that some of the nuclear waste is tied up because of an executive order that was signed by president jimmy carter more than 30 years ago we havent cracked the code on how to resolve that even though the science has caught up we have a long ways to go and we need to have an administration that actually means this a future where we are in control of our own energy the instant that i heard that statement last night it occurred to me that the president is in control of our energy but the american people are not in control of our own energy i would point out the keystone xl pipeline as an example i heard an instantaneous rumbling here on the floor of the house of representatives when the statement was made that we were going to be in control of our own energy the president also said he wants to see an alloftheabove energy policy the alloftheabove policy includes responsible utilization of all of the nuclear fuel that we have and then responsible positioning of it when we can no longer utilize the energy within it but it also includes drilling offshore and it includes drilling the nonnational parks public lands in the united states and it includes bringing in energy from other places on the north american continent from our friends our number one trading partner canada our good friends to the north they are in energyexport despair right now because they have listened to what the president had to say for 3 years the study has gone on about the keystone xl pipeline 1 666 miles of pipeline that runs from canada down to the gulf coast it allows for a spur to go off of that to a future refinery that i hope is built in southeastern south dakota and which would be able to transfer refined oil that would come from the oil sands in northern alberta and be able to distribute that across the country primarily to points from there south and east the president has blocked the keystone xl pipeline he announced last night that he is opening up 75 percent of thei have forgotten the exact word he used75 percent of the federal lands that are eligible i think would be a fair way to characterize his statement to drilling for oil that is news to all of us it is news to the oil industry i believe in the previous state of the union address that he gave if i recall correctly he mentioned that he has opened up drilling in the gulf coast again in at least one of these addresses that he made thats what he has said but when you look at the permits it is a different story they say they are opening up permits again after the bp spill but we have lost a lot of deepwater rigs to other parts of the oildeveloping world including outside the western hemisphere the industry tells me that once you lose a big rig from a location it takes about 412 years to transition it back into the gulf coast again that has happened to rig after rig down off of the gulf coast the announcement that this is the most oil that we have produced or most petroleum that we have produced domestically in 8 years may be true i dont know anyone else that knew those numbers in this chamber either and i am wondering how they defined it how they quantified it in any case we have a lot of oil that is being produced up in the bakken region of north dakota the reason for that is because they found the oil up there it is on private land the federal government has not as many tools to obstruct the development of oil production in the bakken region of north dakota as they might have in 75 percent of the federal property that the president addressed last night i dont know that any of us believe that he is serious about wanting to develop american energy especially american petroleum energy if he were serious about it why would he not direct the secretary of state hillary clintonwhom he spoke kindly of last nightwhy would he not direct her to sign the agreement with canada so that we could go ahead and build the keystone xl pipeline the only federal procedural obstruction left in the way is the permit that is the agreement between canada and the united states all that is required to do is to drop that last section of pipe in place right there at the 49th parallel at the border of the united states and canada the rest of that is all green light and so if it werent for the fear that the billions that would be invested for a real returnnot to mention the 100 000 jobs that would be created if you look at the iterations that come forth from not just the construction of the pipeline but the operation of and the economic development that flows from it 100 000 jobs but his speech last night was about jobs and we cant have the 20 000 jobs instantaneously lit up by the keystone xl pipeline or the additional 80 000 jobs that flow from the economic development from the keystone xl pipeline why not because there is a legitimate environmental concern there is not one left not because as the president said he needs more time to study it there has been 3 years to study it think about how this works if youre the president of the united states youre constantly barraged with decisions that must be made and you have set up a network a pyramid of advisors that filter that youre only dealing with the most difficult problems that there are your subordinates take care of all the other decisions no oneno matter how smart no matter how quickreally has the mental space to deal with all of the things that go on here in the united states of america it is humanly impossible the president has a series of advisers they advise him the president has said i havent had time to study the keystone xl pipeline the president of the united states is never going to have time to study all of the nuances that have to do with all of the components of the keystone xl pipeline hardly any member of congress could dedicate a career to know all the things there are to know about the keystone xl pipeline it isnt how we make decisions in the real world it isnt how the president makes decisions in the real world what if the iranians launched a nuke and it was in the air would the president say i dont have time to make a decision i would like to think not id like to believe that the president would make that decision in a splitsecond heartbeat in fact id like to believe he had that delegated so there could be instantaneous action and a response and we could shoot that missile down before it could get over the continental united states and be within the cone of its target id like to think that would happen id like to think the president had failsafe systems in place to protect us for national defense and id like to think that he has a system in place where he can trust his advisers to look at something that is conceptually like the keystone xl pipeline and be able to say mr president weve studied this for 3 yearsif im listening to that briefing its already cleared a lot for me at that point and what have you found out would be my question if i had to ask it and the answer would be theres no environmental risk zero we have tens of thousands of miles of pipeline that pump a lot of things more toxic than crude oil through it underneath the ground of the united states of america and the average number of problems we have that i hear about is zero and so if we had had spills from an oil pipeline i guarantee you the environmental extremists would have let us know and they would have embellished it to the point where everybody in america would know about how horrible it might be if one of those pipelines got a crack in it and some oil seeped out but instead environmental extremists come with this argument my gosh it goes over the ogallala aquifer its an important aquifer a wonderful freshwater aquifer they pump water out of it to irrigate and water cattle and people thats all true but also its true that there are hundreds of miles of pipeline that run over the top of the ogallala aquifer now and some of them have things in it that are less digestible than the petroleum thats coming out of the oil sands in northern alberta so i dont have heartburn over that because we have already established we can build pipelines effectively and we can build them safely with a very very very minimal risk of any spills statistically its almost zero and by the way im not just speaking as someone who has an opinion having read a briefing document put together by someone else im actually a guy whos gone out and worked on a pipeline built pipelines ive been down in the ditch ive been up on the bank ive been a swamper on a bending crew ive been a welding helper ive built pipelines in kansas ive built them in iowa and i understand the mechanics of it and i understand the system i understand the labor structure the business component of it and by the way id say this to the keystone xl pipeline people lets do this lets take the risk theres a lot of money invested now anyway this country needs to move forward this pipeline will be built itll either be built with the approval of this president or itll be built after the disapproval of the american people elects us a new president so why wouldnt we just take this risk and move this ball down the field a little ways start that investment and build this pipeline in the united states build all of it thats appropriate the only thing that cant be done is you cant cross the 49th parallel you can come down from canada right up to that line we dont know how wide our border is you know its infinitely narrow at least in theory but lets say a 20foot section of pipethats what id leave out build it down from canada stop 10 feet from the 49th parallel take the gps locator out there drive a stake in the middle at the border step over to the other side oh wait a minute bring your passport then step over to the other side and start 10 feet south of the 49th parallel and build that pipeline all the way down to the gulf coast now we have it all built except for 20 feet and weve done it all within the law all within the regulations everything else is all cleared and wide open that 20foot section of pipe can sit there then on the spoil pile can just sit there and we can look at that for a while lets set up a web cam and a web site and then all the american people and everybody around the world including the oil sheikhs and the oil cartels and those tyrants that are rich with oil money that are getting more and more belligerent in proportion to the oil price they can watch too on the web cam on the web site as that piece of pipe 20 feet long sits there waiting for the president to let hillary clinton sign the agreement with canada so that 20foot section of pipe could be set in place and welded and then we could open up the valve and send that oil down to the refineries and oh what a breath of economic fresh air that would be thats what should be done and with the web site and the web camera watching this still piece of pipe sitting there on the spoil pile right at the 49th parallel what we need to have also is a little counter on there that is how many days theyve stalled how long does he have to think about it now and how much money is being lost and how many jobs are being lost three little counters there on that web site along with the web cam shot of the still photo ofwell we can make it a video cant weof the section of pipe 20 feet long thats sitting there 10 feet of it to go in canada 10 in the united states by the way somebodys going to sign that permit some day sooner rather than later whether it is the new secretary of state that will be appointed by the successor to barack obama or whether its hillary clinton that might sign that agreement im standing here saying this will happen the keystone xl pipeline will be built the american people support it they know its environmentally safe and sound the labor unions want it there is a tugging of war going on within the political support base for the president and he found himself in a situation where he had to decide between environmental extremists a very strong base for him or the labor unions another strong base for him he essentially said to america im making a political decision here and im going to go with my environmental extremist friends and the labor unions are going to have to just swallow this one for a while thats the answer he told us he didnt have time to study and congress said you shall come back with an answer within 60 days of whether this is an economic security risk for the united states this pipeline whether it needs to be built for economic security reasons or not national security reasons or not twentyeight days into the 60 days that he had to studynow remember he had all of those 3 years to study like everybody else did and all of those advisers to synthesize this for him boil it down and give him one or two or three points all he really needed to know but instead he opted to jump the gun go only 28 days into the 60day period of time he had and then say i didnt have time how would that be what if he had to go out and run a race that was 30 or say 60 laps long and you run that race for 28 of the 60 laps and then you go well i didnt have time to finish the race so im quitting now cut this thing off shut it down we know the difference the american people know the difference between reasons and excuses the president has given the lamest of excuses no thinking person in the country believes that it was a reason that he didnt have time to study the keystone xl pipeline it will be built we need to build it all within the united states and within canada leave out that 20foot section for the people that might want to set it as a 50foot section or a 10foot section im good with all that im not going to quibble ill just tell you heres what ill do personally if youll let me ill go up there and swing that section of pipe into place myself and ill go down there and grab the welder and ill weld it in place myself ill weld my initials on that pipe too while im there and the date and that date and the time will coincide with the last date and time that will be on the web site that will be ticker tape rolling through telling us how much money its costing not to complete that keystone xl pipeline how many days its been how many jobs its cost and this economic development piece so a president that comes to the floor and says last night im for alloftheabove energy policy well lets see except for the keystone xl pipeline except for drilling offshore if that means actually issuing permits except for this mystery that how much public lands hes going to hold off of the production i think we ought to drill all the nonnational park public lands where theres oil we dont know how much oil there is in the united states we havent been able to examine it we have not committed the resources to do the inventory we used to have an inventory that there were 406 trillion cubic feet of natural gas available in the united states we know that numbers a lot higher than that now weve learned how to develop it when we look at the fracking technology thats another thing that the president didnt speak to last night but if hes for all of the above the epa should not be turning over every stone looking at every geological nook and cranny trying to come up with a way to block fracking the fracking technology thats opened up so much energy to this country developed by americans we have about 1 2 million utilizations of fracking and now the epa has found some elements that could have been potentially used in fracking in a shallow water location someplace in wyoming that they say could have actually come from a fracking utilization in a well somewhere theyve not tied it together they just run that red herring up the flagpole and now the environmentalists can hyperventilate and they can try to find another way to shut down energy production in america why whats going through the fixed goals of these people and to the american people why do they have patience with that kind of thinking the effort that goes after the economic development efforts in the united states whats going on and heres whats behind it the president alluded to that last night too come to think of it he said he doesnt think the votes are in this congress to pass capandtax oh wait a minute i might have amended the presidents quote a little bit so id back up just a little and say he didnt think the votes were here to pass his proposal or his version in his speech last night of capandtrade no they arent they arent because the american people have wised up and so have a lot of members of congress and we have 89 new freshman republicans in this place many of them the result of what happens when you try to advance bad policies through this congress so the votes arent there for capandtax thats true the epa is looking to implement it by order of the president and his public statement that they could implement and promulgate rules and end up with the same thing as capandtax so underneath that is the almost religious belief by environmental extremists that if you burn petroleum products and these hydrocarbons release into the atmosphere co2and it does by the way i can concede that point the co2 in the atmospherethey believe that is the cause of global warming now first you have to come to a conclusion that global warming is taking place and then you have to come to the conclusion that its an unnatural global warming taking place caused by activity of man then you have to conclude the activity of man that causes it is the release and suspension of co2 into the atmosphere so i listened to all of that and i say theres a tough equation to make and it was really hard for the people in the university of east anglia and penn state michael mann and some of those other people to make that case they had to fabricate remember they had to fabricate the case for the actual data that would support even that the earth was getting warmer let alone the calculations that its being caused by co2 suspended in the atmosphere let alone that that co2 is sourced from industry let alone that that industry is primarily unitedstates industry so i just ask a fewyou might call them dumbquestions i might call them simple questions the basic questions that i sometimes find out nobody asks everybody is a specialist nowadays and they only deal with a component of the overall picture they dont look at the big picture be it generalist they say wait a minute arrange this all for me so a logical rational deductive mind can come to a conclusion do that first and then well get to the details and so the physicists deal with the formulae that are handed to them by the meteorologists and the data it comes from other places they accept what comes to them and they work within their zone and then who picks up the whole picture i dont know so i just ask this question tell me if co2 is suspended into the atmosphere by unitedstates industry is the cause of the theory that global warming exists then would you tell me how much co2 is in the atmosphere from the unitedstates industry because they propose they are going to cut it by oneseventeenth each year until the year 2050 so if they know the formula thats going to turn down the earths thermostatand by the way i spent a lot of my life cold so im not sure that thats a good ideabut i do know that on their comparison chart they have a whole list of bads on one side of the ledger and no list of goods good things that might happen from a warmer earth so i look at this and i say all right so show me i want to know how much atmosphere has the gravity of the earth attracted throughout all this time of it orbiting around the sun and floating through the galaxy so we get this answer back its not a disputed number the gravity is pulling it so many metric tons i dont have the number committed to memory but that is okay so fine now we know how much atmosphere there is now id like to know how much of that atmosphere is co2 suspended in it as a result of the cumulative effect of unitedstates industry since the beginning of the dawn of the industrial revolution so that calculated out to be when we did this 205 years of industrial revolution so we add this all up i said now take all of this atmosphere of the earth draw it in a circle for me two sheets of drywall so to speak an 8foot diameter circle a little bit higher in my hand all the way around thats the size of the earths atmosphere in your pie chart now id ask think about it how big a circle would you draw in the middle of that 8foot diameter circle in order to demonstrate the total volume of the co2 thats suspended in the earths atmosphere a cumulative effect for 205 years of the industrial revolution this thing that were going to reduce by oneseventeenth of its emissions each year by the way thats oneseventeenth of onetwo hundred and fifth the first year were going to adjust that and were going to use that to turn the earths thermostat down how big is that circle of co2 suspended in the atmosphere 8foot circle is all the atmosphere im not going to put you on the spot but ill just say heres the answer one might imagine that its a 4foot circle of co2 suspended or something that could really impact the earths temperature well its not it is 56 just a little over a half an inch in diameter thats the size of the co2 thats suspended in the earths atmosphere the cumulative effect for 205 years of unitedstates industry some of those times that we were belching a lot of the smoke out into the atmosphere from burning raw coal in ways that arent nearly as clean as they are now so i looked at that and i thought are you kidding me an 8foot circle is the earths atmosphere and were going to take this 56 circle of all the co2 thats in there from the unitedstates and were going to reduce that by oneseventeenth which is actually oneseventeenth of the 205 years that it has accumulated remember and were going to do that for the next 50 years and dial the earths temperature down what utter arrogance to think that we could do that havent the physicists looked at this also i dont think they have then i go back andsee im a generalist so go across some other studies i found a book called human universals and its written by a professor brown from the university of california at berkeley i dont usually go there to find my enlightened authors but hes the only one i could find that actually has written a book on human universals what are the common denominators of humanity what do you see in human beings that has been true since the beginning of time the first civilization what did adam and eve do and what did every generation of humanity do that was common to them then thats common to us now and common to every generation across all cultures civilizations continents and tribes there are a list of about 123 things in his book and he explains almost all of them but one of them this human universal is every generation of man has tried to not just worship the weather or was affected by the weather every generation of man has tried to change the weather to change the weather you know they sacrificed virgins down in central america and sometimes ripped their heart out and threw them down in the pit and that was going to change the weather and get it to rain or not rain as the situation called for i just wonder if this capandtax is not the modern version of the rain dance and the weather is probably not going to change because we argue in hereand its probably not going to change because we change the emissions i think we should though put our factories together and control our emissions and have the cleanest atmosphere we can have because its good for the air we breathe but i think its utter arrogance to believe were going to adjust the earths thermostat with the methodology that we have here we do know the methodology of capandtax that was advocated by the president last night is a methodology that will transfer our wealth in our industry to countries that care a lot less about the atmosphere which is my point i didnt really intend to go down that path but i thought it was important to bring it up and i make another point that came to my attention last night and it was in the very early part of the presidents speech he spoke of this being the first time in two decades that osama bin laden doesnt threaten the american people a very good thing i give the president maximum kudos for that and the seals of course it was the right decision it was the right order and it was the right result a very good thing but he went on to sayand by the way he delivered that in a subtle fashion that was becoming of the president of the united states in a speech he gave last nightbut he went on to say the talibans momentum has been broken i disagree to this extent the talibans momentum has shifted from military tactical to political they have a lot of political momentum its not been broken their political momentum has been accelerated i would make this point that if we look at the country of afghanistan and look back through its history starting at the end of the seventies and beginning of the eightieswell when the russians invaded afghanistan the northern alliance the mujahedin many of them at the time took on the russians and fought them through that decade with the help of charlie wilson and at least one member in this congress seated today the help from unitedstates missiles that took out russian helicopters but the tenacity of the northern alliance today the tribes from the northern part of afghanistan that took on that took on the russians and drove the russians out of afghanistan the northern alliance leaders today the men who mounted horseback and then themselves led the cavalry charge on horseback and attacked russian tanks with ak47s in their hands these courageous men are the men that drove the russians out of afghanistan and at that point there was a power vacuum the taliban filled up afghanistan and we remember what they did they blew up the buddhist temples and they drove the life expectancy of a woman down the only country in the world to have a lower life expectancy for women than men was afghanistan they treated them horribly afghanistan was digressing back to the stone age it was a fertile area for al qaeda training camps we got hit on september 11 the united states went in to help them with special forces the northern alliance rose up again and with our help drove the taliban out of afghanistan then they handed over their heavy weapons and embraced the constitution that was proposed by the united states state department accepting that we would look out for their political interests and what do they have these warriors who defeated the russians and the taliban who lost their political influence because they trusted the constitution to represent them and who gave up their heavy weapons are now watching the white house and president karzai negotiate with the taliban the talibans momentum has not been broken it has been transitioned into political power and they are looking today to hand political power over to the taliban in afghanistan so that the afghanistan government will reflect the wishes of the taliban and less reflect the wishes of the northern alliance i would inquire as to how much time i might have remaining"], [0.45493045449256897, 0.45493045449256897, 0, "we thank the gentleman from florida for yielding back and we thank him so much for his service to this house as we close for the christmas season i do want to make just a few comments about what has transpired today and i think it is so noteworthy that those members who are departing have stood on this floor tonight and have talked about what it means to serve in the unitedstates house of representatives and how grateful we are that they have chosen that service and we each have shared a commitment to make certain that we are committed to pushingpushingthe federal government to get its fiscal house in order indeed mr hensarling many times has said that that is our primary goal as conservatives because we know that the greatest threat to our nations security is our nations debt many of us talk about admiral mullens comments on july 6 2010 when he said that the greatest threat to our nations security is our nations debt this week as we have looked at the socalled fiscal cliff as we have looked at the expiration of the tax cuts as we have worked through the growing and just boiling and rolling debt that is sweeping over this government as we have watched this deficit climb higher every year we have sought to find a solution to this as i mentioned earlier in our remarks we have stood in this house and going back to may 10 we passed reconciliation august 1 we passed an extension of all the 2001 2003 tax reductionstheyre called the bush tax cuts we passed a sequester bill on the 2nd and on september 19 we passed a pathway to tax reform what is so significant about that is that those pieces of legislation left here some of them with a bipartisan vote all with a strong vote from this body and they traveled across to the senate and from may to september they found their place on harry reids desk what is so sad about this is that harry reid made his choice the senate made their choice and their choice was to not take up those pieces of legislation this crisis that we have had our socalled crisis the fiscal cliff crisis and taxmageddon all of this is a crisis of their making because it is a crisis of inaction but many times that is what happens here it is inaction what does not get done that causes the situation where there is a rush to the last minute we have had the american people watching closely and we have had the comments from the president the comments from different ones in the cabinet and the comments from the senate but i remind my colleagues that we took our actions here in the body we sent that legislation and we did it because we understand that 16 trillion worth of debt and annual deficits of 1 trillion are far too much for our children and grandchildren the speakers tonight who have joined me on this floor have talked about how we have hopes and dreams for our children for our grandchildren for the futures of our families you know what if youre facing 16 trillion 20 trillion 25 trillion worth of debt as a nation it is very difficult to see those hopes and dreams come true my concern as i look at my grandchildren is that the decisionsmaybe the selfishness evenof people in washington who want to tax too much and want to spend too much who are taxing and spending not their money but my children and grandchildrens money children of the next generation leaders maybe even a generation or more away they are spending their money because at this point we are borrowing 46 cents of every dollar we spend its not sustainable that is why we have very thoughtfully over the last several months approached this issue and its why this week we have worked with our leadership to find a solution to this to look at different angles and the decision came that the best decision for this the best way to approach it the best way to make certain we address this is to stand firm on the actions that the house has taken and for the senate to take up the legislation that theyve had the opportunity to take up since september 19 they could take up any bill and amend it they could vote on it they could send it back to us they could go to conference you see as we talk about our children and their future and as we talk about this amount of debt what we do not want to do is to cap our childrens future and trade to the people that hold our debt if were not careful thats exactly what is going to happen as we have gone through this process this week as my colleagues have all watched it and said exactly what has happened what are the decisions what are the consequences of the decisions we have made are we going to resolve it i do believe that you are going to see a resolution to this it will happen because the american people are saying to us and theyre saying to the president it is time to get this spending under control our children deserve better of us they have the right to live free lives to dream big dreams and to make those dreams come true i do want to say a thank you to our leadership i think the way that speaker boehner has handled these issues this week the way he has worked with the members in this body to show respect to them to show respect for their opinions and respect for their constituents i think that that has been a true sign of leadership that was willing to listen and then willing to move the way the body wanted to move and the decision was made by the body not to move forward on the plan b but i think in making that decision what you will see is our leadership moving forward more committed and with individuals even more prepared to get to work and to get this solved and to do what the american people are expecting us to do which is to get this spending under control they have sent the message loud and clear washington does not have a revenue problem it has a spending problem it has an outofcontrol spending problem and an insatiable appetite for the taxpayers money as we have worked through this week as weve talked to our constituentsand so many of us in this body have done telephone town halls and we have been on the phone and we have answered emails and we know that there is no limit to how much money how much of other peoples money government will try to spend theres no limit to how much of the taxpayers money so the american people have sent the message to us and we all have sent it to our leadership and they have listened and they have responded the time to get the spending under control is now the time to stop kicking the can down the road is now and we will head away for christmas and return i think with a strength and a resolve and a courage to address the fiscal issues of this nation the house where the spending bills and appropriation process begins we will tackle this with strength with resolve with courage to get the job done so that just as my colleagues have said here tonight so that future generations have a brighter future and so that we will continue to stand for the cause of freedom with that i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.4554881155490875, 0.4554881155490875, 0, "i appreciate my colleagues for their take on where we are and i wanted to offer kind of an alternative view on that and its not an alternative view in that it is one thats not commonly shared its a bipartisan view but we hadnt heard it much in this particular debate i want to take you back to john f kennedy hes a revered president for a whole variety of reasons i come from a rocksolid hardcore conservative district in the state of georgia but i absolutely see the wisdom of so much of what president kennedy was trying to do for the country he said this its a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run is to cut the rates now the purpose of cutting taxes now is not to incur a budget deficit but to achieve the more prosperous expanding economy which can bring a budget surplus john f kennedy november 20 1962 those words are as true today as they were then but we have a different kind of budget challenge today than we had then the largest budget deficits in your and my lifetime were run up during the george w bush administration again i come from a hardcore red state republican through and through in our part of the world and i can tell you the largest budget deficits in the history of this country were run up during a republican presidential administration and those recordsetting deficits have now been surpassed were not running 100 percent of those deficits today were not running 200 percent of those deficits today were not running 300 percent of those deficits today the deficits today are almost four times larger than what was formerly the largest budget deficit in american history weve got to get a handle on that there are revenue components there are spending components but it seems like this town is obsessed with the tax side of that ledger i want to talk about that because for petes sake i didnt come to congress to be a congressman i came to congress to make america better i came to congress to solve the problems that plague my family and my neighbors family and the families surrounding us in the community i came to congress to make a difference so its whatever we need to do here to make a difference and i dont mean just to change things change for changes sake has no constituency with me i mean to make a difference so that our childrens lives and our grandchildrens lives are better than they would be otherwise let me go again to john f kennedy and how he was trying to make a difference he said this lower rates of taxation will stimulate economic activity and so raise the levels of personal and corporate income as to yield within a few years an increasednot a reduced flow of revenues to the federal government he was right he was right then ronald regan was right when he said it president clinton was right in the tax cuts that he presided over as was president bush its absolutely true ill say it again lower rates of taxation will stimulate economic activity and so raise the levels of personal and corporate income as to yield within a few years an increasednot a reduced flow of revenues to the federal government it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise revenues in the long run is to cut the rates now why do i bring this up is there anybody in washington d c whos talking about cutting tax rates and the answer is no theres really not theres not one person in this chamber who comes to the floor and talks about cutting tax rates we might like to but were in a tough economic crisis right now and folks are concerned about the revenue side of the equation what folks are talking about though is not raising tax rates and for some reason for reasons that i cant understand the president has gotten wrapped around the axle on an insistence that actual rates go up speaker john boehner offered him revenue he said if you just want the money well find a way to get the money through taxes it doesnt have to be through higher rates we can do it by broadening the base by reducing exceptions and exemptions by eliminating loopholes and deductions the president said no i want actual higher rates president kennedy talked about the damage of those higher rates its as true today as it was then when were not talking about higher rates from the white house were talking about fairness and ive got to tell you you and i are freshmen in this body we came with the largest freshman class in modern times and we came not from folks who had dreams of being a congressman one day but folks who were from families back home that were struggling and people were running for congress then because they wanted to find a better way folks did not come to be congressmen they came to be agents of change to make a difference for america to make sure the promise of america continues for another generation and yet we find ourselves in this debate about whether now is the right time to raise taxes on familyowned businesses whether now is the right time to raise taxes on american job creators milton friedman is one of my favorite economists hes a nobel prizewinning economist he passed on from this earth but his words remain with us today he said this about taxes and i think its profound he said there is all the difference in the world however between two kinds of assistance through government that seem superficially similar two kinds superficially similar the first when 90 percent of us agree to impose taxes on ourselves in order to help the bottom 10 percent that happens all the time it happens all the time i love the generous spirit of the united states of america and ive got to tell you i know folks are from all parts of the worldim from georgia and youre from californiabut the people in georgia their generosity is second to none and i love being part of that community and milton friedman says its one thing when 90 percent of us in america agree to tax ourselves agree to bear the burden ourselves in order to help 10 percent who are struggling thats one thing or second he says the other thing is when 80 percent vote to impose taxes on the top 10 percent to help the bottom 10 percent hear that its one thing when 90 percent of us agree that we need to bear the burden such that the least fortunate among us can prosperthats the american way and i love that about this nationbut its something else altogether milton freidman says when 80 percent decide they want to tax the top 10 percent so that they can help the bottom 10 percent that is not who we are in america that is not who we have ever been in america where we let someone else carry the burden what makes this country great is the shared burden i heard the words shared burden from my friends on the other side of the aisle i hear the words shared sacrifice from my friends on the other side of the aisle and i see proposal after proposal after proposal that exempts most of america from bearing any part of that burden and continuing to place the burden on someone else milton friedman goes on to say this the first way may be wise or unwise talking about the 90 percent of us taxing ourselves to help the 10 percent that could be unwise it just depends on why youre doing it and what the purpose is youre doing it for it could be effective or ineffective as a way to help the disadvantaged but it is consistent with the belief in both equality of opportunity and liberty the second way milton friedman saysthats the way where 80 percent of the folks agree that theyre going to tax the top 10 percent so that they can help the bottom 10 percentthat second approach seeks equality of outcome and is entirely antithetical to liberty when we all come together to agree to help one another that is consistent with a belief in equality of opportunity and liberty but when we try to amass enough votes in this chamber or enough votes across the nation so that we can take from one group to give to another group that is entirely antithetical to liberty and so i come to the floor today not as a defender of the 1 percent im not in the 1 percent i do hope one day ill be fortunate to have those opportunities i think thats what all kids do in america you try to work hard apply yourself good work ethic good ideas you want to be successful one day but im not in the 1 percent but i recognize the immorality of passing on bills to our children and our grandchildren in the form of debt because we the 80 percent refuse to take on that burden and instead we try to thrust that burden off on someone else we have burdens in this country and it falls to every citizen of this country to shoulder those burdens because i do think its a moral case i think folks need to understand what it is the president is proposing and why hes proposing it i have two sets of figures here one is the percent of the income that each kind of strata of american income earner earns ive got the lowest 20 percent of income earners the second 20 percent the middle 20 percent the fourth 20 percent and the highest 20 percentin fact i have the top 1 percent pulled out on the side because they seem to attract so much attention these days i also have the share of the individual income tax burden that each of these groups are paying how many times have you heard the president of the united states say he just wants the top 1 percent to pay a little bit more he just wants the top 1 percent to do their fair share how many times have you heard fair share mr speaker ive heard it more times than i can count this is what i see for the most recent year for which the congressional budget office has numbers the top 1 percent of all income earners earned 13 4 percent of all the income in america ill got to tell you theyre doing well theres no doubt about it they are 1 percent of the population and they are earning 13 percent of all the income in america thats impressive they can afford to pay they can afford to pay you wont get any argument from me but today again with the most recent numbers the congressional budget office has available that top 1 percentthats earning 13 4 percent of the income in this countryis paying 38 7 percent of all the burden i ask you what incarnation of fairness leads you to believe that when you earn 13 percent of the money and youre paying 38 percent of the bills that you need to do more to do your fair share if you think for a moment that you might fall into that category let me take you to the other end of the spectrum where the we are im not trying to put the burden on someone else im trying to take the burden on myself we passed a bill in this congress that gave a payroll tax break to every single member of congresswell in fact it gave it to every single member of america every citizen in america got this payroll tax break this was a payroll tax break as you know payroll taxes are dedicated to social security and medicare all they do is fund those important programs every man woman and child in america knows those two programs are going bankrupt but this president and this congress in their wisdom passed a bill to give every american a tax break in that category reducing the amount of tax dollars going into that trust fund i voted no but i lost and i got a tax breakdidnt want one didnt need one i have obligations to contribute to the survival of this economy and this republic but i got one anyway look at whats happening here if youre in the bottom 20 percent of all income earners we want you to succeed if youre in the bottom 20 percent of all income earners we develop every single federal program around the idea that if you apply yourself if you put your ideas to work if we can give you enough of a helping hand here a hand up there that you will be able to change your economic future you will be able to improve your income lot tomorrow relative to today in the tax code today if youre in the bottom 20 percent of all income earnersin fact if youre in the bottom 40 percent of all income earners the tax code pays you money you get every penny of your pay back it pays you money i ask you whats becoming of our republic how are we defining fair share there is no no no constituency in this nation that wants to extend a helping hand more than my constituency does back home and you know where that comes fromand you see it right now in the tax rates mr speakerfolks are saying let me give away all the money i can right now because the tax code is going to change im not going to give away money next year because im going to get punished for it im going to give away money this year instead folks who can give do give folks who can support this country do support this country the top 20 percent of all income earners in this country earn 50 percent of all the income the top 20 percent of all income earners earn 50 percent of all the income we can talk about whether or not thats right we can talk about where those jobs come from we can talk about why we cant get more highpaying jobs why the highest corporate tax rate in the world is driving all those highpaying jobs overseas we can talk about all of that but the fact is that 20 percent of americans earn 50 percent of all the money so whats a fair burden of the bills for them to pay mr speaker top 20 percent earn 50 percent of the money so they should certainly pay 50 percent of the bills in fact they should pay more than their fair share right they should pay 60 percent of the billsmaybe even 70 percent of the bills the top 20 percent of income earners today in america pay 94 percent of all the bills94 1 in fact what that means then is that the other 80 percent of us the other 80 percent of us families here in this chamber 80 percent of america is only paying six percent of the bills when youre in a republic mr speakera lot of folks say democracy of course were not a democracy were in a republicbut when the people rule what becomes of you when 80 percent of the people are only paying 6 percent of the bills what kind of decisions do i make i know the answer to that because i love things that are free with rebate i dont know if you read the cvs and walgreens ads on sunday like i do mr speakerin fact i look them up online on saturday night just so i know what to pick up on the way home from church if toothpaste is free with rebate i dont care if i have 12 tubes of toothpaste in the closet at home im going to go by and pick it up because its free we make decisions based on how much things cost us right now if you think government is too big in this country if you think we waste government dollars in this country if you think we tax you too much in this country understand that when we go to the voting booths i get to vote for 100 percent of government benefits and i only have to pay for 6 percent of it thats true for everybody in the 80 percent is it american is it who we are as a people that 80 percent of us who all get to vote are not asked to shoulder the burden of todays bills the thing is its not as if theyre getting a free ride its not as if were getting a free ride we are passing the burden on to our children and our grandchildren you may not have to pay the bill today your family might not have to pay the bill today but your children and your grandchildren are going to have to pay that bill tomorrow its immoral its immoral i say that to my conservative colleagues back home in georgia i say if someone is willing to spend your money and theyre not willing to raise your taxes dont you dare applaud them because youre just going to have to pay those taxes later when the debt comes due we either need to stop the spending or we need to pony up the money to pay the taxes but dont you dare let it be said the top 1 percent they earn 13 percent of the income theyre paying 40 percent of the bills and the president of the united states thinks thats not enough they need to pay more be very careful about changing who has skin in the game in this country when we dont have skin in the game as voters we make bad decisions what has always made america great is there has been more that unites us than that divides us and one of the things that has always united us is that we all have skin in the game the changes that have been made to the tax code are changing that you know im not the first one to come up with this idea a man much wiser than i am much earlier in this countrys history benjamin franklin observed that very same thing hes cited to have said this when the people find that they can vote themselves money that will herald the end of the republic one of the great thinkers of his time what he observed is not rocket science its common sense but its worth restating that is when youre in a republic when youre in a democracy 51 percent of the people can get together and say i dont want to shoulder any of the burden i want to put it all on the 49 percent and lets live life that way that signals the end of the republic its always been true it always will be true what unites us as a country is that we are not shirkers of responsibility we are acceptors of responsibility and we want skin in the game i dont want to let it be said that the president today president obama is the first president to have ever come up with the idea that wouldnt it be neat if none of the voters have to pay for anything except for the top 1 percent wouldnt that be a good plan that has actually been the plan of every american president in my lifetime and every congress in my lifetime why because folks want to get elected folks want the voters back home to think nice things about them and guess what when i go home and i tell people they have to actually pay for government theyre less excited than when i tell them its free in 1979 the last president from the great state of georgia jimmy carter when he took office the bottom 80 percent most of us 80 percent of americans paid 35 percent of the bills eighty percent of us paid 35 percent of the bills in 1979 the top 1 percent at that time were paying 18 percent of the bills look whats happened in my adult lifetime this red line represents the burden that we placed on the 1 percent the blue line represents the burden that we placed on the 80 percent and it is so changed today that again the bottom 80 percent of us middle class america the bread and butter of this country are paying 6 percent of the bills we owe america better than that folks need to make informed decisions at the voting box and government isnt free we spend 3 8 trilliontrillion dollarsa year in this government when you are paying 6 cents out of every dollar you may think youre getting your moneys worth but if you were paying 10 cents out of every dollar or 50 cents out of every dollar or even 1 out of every dollar you begin to view your responsibilities for ensuring that government dollars are spent wisely differently i just asked you we are in control of our own destiny i tell the kids i talk to in schools all the time that whats so great about this country is theyre going to run it one day and its going to look however it is they want it to look within the bounds of the united states constitution is this the kind of country you want to live in where when times get tough when burdens have to be carried when bills have to be paid more and more often we say do you know what dont tax me tax him hes the one who should shoulder the burden its a dangerous dangerous precedent theres no question that the wealthy should pay more in this country they earn more they should pay more they have more disposable income ive never had a wealthy man or woman come to me and say rob i dont want to pay my fair share in fact folks come to me all the time and say rob im willing to pay more except i think youre going to throw it down a rat hole like you threw the last bit i sent to you down a rat hole and if you guys in congress ever get your act straight and put us on a path to a balanced budget ill be happy to pay a share in order to make that happen i love this countrylove this country this is not the country that you and i grew up in so why is it then if were talking so much about taxes why arent taxes the problem or the solution the truth is and you know this if we tax everything in america not at 10 percent not at 20 percent but at 100 percent if we took everything from every family in america if every man woman and child had all of their income confiscated if we sold your clothes your house and your possessions on the auction block if we liquidated every single company in america and we put all that money into a bank account in present value we still wouldnt have enough money to pay for all the promises that this congress past presidents past congresses and this president have made this is what i have here i have a chart of revenue versus spending this green line is revenue in this country as a percentage of the size of our economy it turns out that wealthy people are pretty smart and so if you start taxing part of their income at 90 percent and part of their income at 20 percent they just move all their income from the 90 percent category to the 20 percent category thats what happens here no matter what the tax rates have been over the history of this country the modern history of this country americans are willing to give about 18 percent of gdp in tax revenue its just the way its been tax rates have been as high as 90 percent we were only paying 18 percent tax rates have been as low as 28 percent we were paying 18 percent the red line represents spending and thats what i want to point out spending historically has been flat as well the red line comes up above the green line which shows you all the budget deficits that weve been running its been a common occurrence in the history of this country but we are spending todaythese are the promises if we close congress today if we never make one new promise not one new promise in this country this red line represents the costs of all the promises weve already made spending not taxes is the problem we are in a spendingdriven crisis if you dont believe it i have another chart here the green line again this one only goes from 2006 out to 2041 but the green line represents the current taxes that are on the books the red line represents the spending that weve already promised out of this body and the blue line represents the tax increase that the president is proposing the tax increase on small businesses on familyowned businesses a tax increase that economists agree is going to lead to slower growth in the jobs market and less hiring this blue line represents the sum total of that tax increase now i know enough to know that if im bringing in this much money and im spending this much money when i add this blue line to it i still dont have enough money this chart is labeled spendingistheproblem folks can tweet it out spending is the problem its not a revenue problem were bringing in about the same revenue that weve always brought in in this country the president can raise taxes all he wants to hell never be able to pay for the spending promises that he has madenever there is not enough money to do it spending is the problem current taxes the presidents tax increase and the presidents spending plan dont come to balance we can do better in fact heres the presidents 10year budget plan the president raises taxes by 2 trillion in his 10year budget plan and he doesnt lower the projected debt by one penny not by one penny from its projected levels in 2013 or 14 or 15 not in 16 or 17 and 18 not in 19 or 20 but just a little bitand i blew it up so everybody could see it because you cant see it as it is on the chart if you raiseif you agree to the presidents budget and you raise taxes by 2 trillion he predicts that way out in 2021 things will be just a little bit better for americajust a little bit better not 2 trillion better just a little bit better its not the right plan do you know what is the right plan the one that weve passed here in the house and by the one that weve passed here in the house i mean the one weve passed here in the house in a bipartisan way and by the one that we passed here in the house in a bipartisan way i mean the only budget in the entire city of washington d c that has been passed it doesnt just make a little bitty change that you cant see 10 years from now it takes us from this red path our current spending path our current debt and deficit path and it puts us on the road to balance on the road to balance not just on the road to eliminating our annual deficits but on the road to finally paying all the bills back taxes cant do it they can destroy the economy but they cannot pay the bills spending is the problem we can take that challenge on we have in this house with our budget passed in a bipartisan way we have taken on those tough challenges i say to the president again i know he wants to raise taxes hes been talking about it for 2 years where are his spending cuts they asked the folks in the presidential debate republicans would you agree to a 1 tax increase if wed cut spending by 10 and everybody said no i challenge the president to give that a whirl take all these tax increases he wants to create the ones that have absolutely no chance at all of solving the problem take those tax increases and couple them 10 to 1 with spending cuts couple them 9 to 1 with reforms and programs couple them 8 to 1 with things that will actually matter to american families and send that bill to the congress send that bill call our bluff are we serious about solving the problem or are we not the budget that we passed in this united states house says that we are and i challenge the president to be equally serious in 4 years of his budgets weve never once seen him introduce one that was balanced weve never once seen him introduce one that ever comes to balance weve never once seen him introduce one that pays back even a penny of our national debt the bipartisan budget we passed in this house does all of those things and i would love to see the presidents proposal for achieving that very same goal which is absolutely critical for the american economy for american families and i dare say for the american way of life with that i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.4566883146762848, 0.4566883146762848, 0, "its a privilege to be speaking on the floor here this evening here weve been talking for some time about the huge deficit spending thats going on in fact republicans have promised to make massive cuts and the old story that used to be told about the fellow texan sam rayburn about a young freshman democrat coming up and talking about how difficult things were here in the house and that gee as a democrat its obvious the republicans are our enemy theyre trying to stop us from doing what we need to and boy the medias not helping and speaker rayburn stopped him reportedly and said son the republicans are not your enemy the media is not your enemy at the other end of the hall the senate now theyre your enemy well i thought that was a strange story when i heard that about speaker rayburn but the longer ive been here the more we see so many great bills that have come out of the house in the last year have gone down the hall and are languishing for lack of action and so when i read that a friend down the hall leader reid was lambasting republicans for a donothing status it was remarkable to me that they could have so many house bills sitting down there waiting to do something and yet doing nothing with them now we have been trying to get bills passed into law that would make substantial cuts its still as our friend from east texas bo pilgrim used to say a mindboggling thing to have seen this president come in in 2009 with speaker pelosi in charge of the house and leader reid in charge of the senate and to know that we had been just vilified as majority republicans in the house in 2006 for exceeding the amount of income coming in by 160 billion vilified and yet when president obama became the president and leader reid and speaker pelosi were in charge we ran a deficit of 10 times that much in 1 year incredible now one thing that should not have ever happened is to have our national security out on the table as a bargaining chip in the debt ceiling negotiation but it was and we were told that gee neither side is going to allow those kinds of cuts to occur to our national security and lo and behold being in afghanistan seeing the new year come in with our military men and women in some remote operating areasi went with senator jim inhofe from oklahoma and joe barton from texasand being in remote areas it was amazing to hear some folks say were already being told amounts that were going to be cut because of the sequestration coming talking with some of our texas national guard folks ive been told over the last couple of weeks were already being told about moneys that are being cut these are people that are trying to protect and defend our country i went to the deployment ceremony of a unit leaving from lufkin texas being deployed as guard and theyre hearing as theyre being deployed about cuts to the amount of money they will have to protect them while theyre protecting us absolutely outrageous as we talk about doing whats best for america and as we hear from people around the world that think of the united states as the great satan one would thinkespecially if they studied historythat the last thing we would want to do is to hurt our national security yet that is where were going it seems also clear that those negotiating from the republican side during the debt ceiling bill made an assumption that turned out to be false that the democrats in the senate would never allow the sequestration of 100 200 300 billion from medicare that was a bad assumption because the same democratic leadership in the senate passed obamacare which brought about 500 billion in cuts to medicare so of course they were going to be willing to allow sequestration because this time they would be able to blame republicans for also being part of what caused the cuts cuts to medicare and cuts to our national security not a good idea not a good idea national review online had an article out in the last couple of days with some great information and we have taken that information and put it in short form from the article and double checked and apparently these are accurate numbers these numbers if anybody cares to contest them actually come from president obamas own office of management and budget it turns out that as this president and his administration have complained about not having money not having the ability to make cuts having to make draconian cuts to medicare and to our national defense his administration has been sitting on money hundreds of billions of dollars of money that they havent spent from 2010 and 2011 theyre complaining about not being able to even cut 5 billion or 10 billion when it turns out theyre sitting on hundreds of billions of dollars that have not been obligated have not been spent from 2010 and 2011 so lets take a look at the money that this administration has not been willing to cut even though its unobligated its unspent its been appropriated they have the ability to spend it or save it or spend it for something else and yet this administration just cant seem to want to cut loose from this money to reduce the deficit to cut down on the money we borrow from china to cut down on the deficit spending or the reduction in spending for the military reduction in spending for medicare how about that it turns out theyre sitting on all this money the department of the treasury under the direction of secretary tim geithnerhopefully he will be okay getting his tax return in this year he is sitting on 226 billion that was appropriated and yet it is sitting there unobligated unspent yet timothy geithner has told us you know theres just no money to do what he feels needs to be done he was out there this summer saying weve got to raise taxes because this poor gentleman was not going to be able to cut loose as we find out of the 226 billion hes got sitting in change and that is not even including the 125 billion that he still has in tarp assets or money and its estimated by some to be maybe about 50 billion in additional assets so around 170 175 billion remaining from tarp 226 billion sitting there appropriated i guess that means weve already borrowed 42 cents of every dollar from the chinese so were sitting on it then the department of defense since weve got 78 billion that the defense department has unobligatedit has been appropriated but unspentwhy couldnt we use some of that 78 billion to help eliminate some of the cuts that are being suggestedin fact being demanded of defense youve got the department of transportation with 45 billion in unobligated unspent money from 2010 to 2011 youve got 40 billion from the department of health and human services sitting there unobligated unspent from 2010 and 2011 department of housing and urban development 23 8 billion sitting there department of education 19 billion and the thought comes what if we did away with the department of education and all that money that comes pouring into washington every yearsome of it borrowedand it gets held here in washington and gets funded to administrators and bureaucrats that have nothing to do with actually teaching anything how about if we just turn that right around and send it right back to those states and say were taking our grimy fingers off of that money were not going to keep any of it because we think it is that important that it go for education and how about if we by doing that therefore encourage every stateas i believe it was newt gingrich who suggested to then let go so many of the administrators in each state capital that are not involved in any kind of teaching just involved in dictation to local school boards and of course for every bureaucrat that we have to have right now in washington they have to have at least one in every state capital because theyve got to carry out the assignments from washington and then for every one in the state capital youve got to have bureaucrats at each local school district to carry out those assignments i was shocked to go online and see that one of the best school districts in east texas was saying that they were proud to note that half of all their school district employees were actually teachers so when i went to look at that a little further you go back to before president jimmy carter created the department of education that number was closer to 75 percent in texas now its around 50 percent in texas but before there was a federal department of education about 70 75 percent of all texas education employees were just wonderful school teachers like my mother like my sister like my wife was now thats getting teachers thats getting people in the education system where they can do some good so you have the department of education sitting on 19 billion you go online and look up how many school districts there are in america and divide them into 19 billion youd have school districts that were not having to fire teachers right now that would do a world of good but weve got bureaucrats here in washington that think it is more important that they sit there with a slush fund 19 billion unobligated unspent funds from 2010 2011 youve got the department of labor theyve got 18 billion sitting there from 2010 and 2011 and we acknowledge it is important for them to sit on a slush fund because they have so many things they have to do like they have to run to states like south carolina and tell them you cant have a new boeing plant in your state because were trying to help unions in washington even though not one single union worker in washington was going to lose their job or be adversely affected were going to rush in and be not a referee were going to be a player referee and were going to dictate like used to be done by caesars kings czars emperors pharaohs they thought they had the authority to come into south carolina and play pharaoh and say nope youre not going to have these jobs well once the unions finally got satisfied then isnt it amazing that the nlrb backed off some i think weve seen the nlrb is something we could do away with and one of our colleagues in our party here in the house has a bill that will do just that i think its time to do that department of agriculture 14 billion sitting unspent unobligated from 2010 2011 the department of state they dont have quite as much money sitting there as some of these other departments but they still have 8 7 billion sitting unobligated unspent from the last 2 years department of homeland security 7 2 billion now they may want to use some of that to go buy some more of these machines from our friend secretary chertoff what a waste of money those were then youve got the department of the interior at 6 7 billion sitting unspent unobligated in their coffers department of energy the department of energy that was set up by president carter with the purpose of getting us off of dependence on foreign oil and every year the department of energy has existed one thing has been consistent and weve got to give them credit for this one thing has been very consistent from the department of energy every year theyve existed weve become more dependent on foreign oil so if youre in the private sector and you went all these years 32 years working on 33 years or so with a department in your business that got further and further from its original goal youd probably cancel that department get rid of it disband it not here in government not only are they not doing what would help america by getting us off dependence on foreign oil they are actually working in conjunc tion with the department of the interior to make us more dependent on foreign oil and to limit the amount of production here in the united states just today the president of the united states has had the incredible nerve to step up and say there are thousands and thousands and thousands of americans who i am going to deprive of the opportunity to have a good union job and there are thousands and thousands and thousands of more americans who would be suppliers for those people who would be working on the keystone pipeline everything from private suppliers to people that work in steel plants that would be providing the pipe to be providing the materials that would be used that would be building the heavy equipment that would be used all of those thousands and thousands and thousands of ripple jobs that would be coming this president today is saying i am not going to allow you to have that kind of job were going to keep pushing the president might as well have said to make sure you can get unemployment for 99 weeks and we can keep you from reaching your godgiven potential of actually producing because there is a great deal of satisfaction for doing something productive seeing the products of your hands thats why as my wife would tell you i actually enjoy getting out in the backyard on weekends kind of tough during the winter but actually getting out there and doing things so that when i finish i can see ive done something productive because we come up here and we pass some good legislation in the house it never becomes law we pass things and encourage the president to get the senate to help us pass off on things so people could become productive and they could get their own jobs and become productive and they wouldnt need to become so dependent on the federal government it gets pretty frustrating but youve got a department of energy sitting there 5 6 billion unobligated unspent from the last 2 years department of veterans affairs you would think that with all of the veterans who need assistance who need help who have problems both psychologically physically that some of that 5 2 billion thats been sitting there for the last couple of years it could have been used to help our veterans you would think our veterans need help president bush right before he left office had asked a retired military retired army general to do an assessment of the va and make recommendations he had some good recommendations unfortunately theyve not been carried out by this administration but one of the things he told me personally privately he said the problem with the veterans administration is theyre supposed to be an assistance organization and instead they think theyre an adversarial organization they should be assisting our veterans and yet so often every time a veteran comes through the door needing help they look at them as if theyre a thief coming in to steal something our veterans deserve better than that there are some va clinics va places you know in lufkin i keep asking our veteranseven though i did 4 years in the army im not entitled to this care but i want to make sure that our veterans get what they think is best for them people around lufkin that go to that clinic they say hey i would far rather go to this va clinic than any other medical facility other places i hear from veterans that go to other clinics that say id just as soon you give us a card and let us go to any doctor or any clinic we want but at the same time all of this is going on and we were told there now is a need to increase the contribution for veterans for tricare we find out theres 5 2 billion that has been sitting there unspent unobligated for the last couple of years department of justice 1 9 billion here that we have them coming in before our committee whining and moaning about all of the millions and millions of dollars they need turns out theyve got 1 900 million that they could use instead of coming begging here for more money from congress youve got other independent agencies and miscellaneous 82 billion unobligated unspent office of personnel management 55 billion i know that the administration spends more money than any other administration in history far and away a lot more but you would think that they wouldnt have to come demanding more and more money and put pressure on harry reid down in the senate to get more and more out of the house because they just cant live on the 55 billion slush fund they have from the last couple of years unspent international assistance programs 45 billion ive said it over and over but it is absolutely true ive seen it firsthand going around you could even see it in some areas of afghanistan you dont have to pay people to hate you theyll do it for free it would save a lot of money i still have a u n voting accountability bill i filed it my fourth time in this fourth congress ive been in it says unless you vote with the united states over half the time in the u n that you shouldnt get any foreign assistance from the united states again these people in foreign countries that hate us it is absolutely their right to do so but we dont have to pay people to hate us theyll do it for free environmental protection agency one of those things that was created when congress made the mistake of giving the nixon administration the power to consolidate and reorganize government and make it more efficient the nixon administration created the environmental protection agency and right now the epa is in the process of costing thousands and thousands and thousands of people jobs all over america and this administration is doing nothing to rein them in some people have said well can the congress do something about that sure we can we can get rid of the epa ive been told by some federal authorities but you dont understand even though texas has an environmental commission the tceq there are a handful of states that dont have environmental commissions for their states so we need one for the whole country what happened to the ninth and 10th amendment if it is just inside the state doesnt involve interstate commerce then why shouldnt we let the states take care of those issues instead the epa is spending some of their slush fund money to sue states like texas and others shutting down power plants and i would have thought today that when the president released his statement about why he was going to deprive tens of thousands of americans jobs immediately where they could earn their own way and own their own things without the government handouts that he would at least be able to say because i have a better plan of getting us off foreign oil thats not what he said apparently its the presidents position he wants to get us off oilnot off foreign oil just off oil he wants to put more people out of work increase the cost of gasoline and diesel which means increasing the cost of everything you buy in america because transportation costs have to be figured in the one good thing about the president killing the keystone pipeline that you have to acknowledge with money like the epa has 4 billion and transportation 45 billion sitting there in their slush fund unobligated unspent from the last 2 years different other agencies departments department of the interior by cancelling the keystone pipeline they wont have to spend money checking it out regulating making sure things are done appropriately they can spend these hundreds of billions of dollars if they care to do so on more solyndras isnt that a great thing we will be able to fund more crony capitalism somebody wants to come in and claim theyre going to create some kind of solar product then this administration will take a good look at it and theres a good chance if youre a republican you can forget it but if youre not you may very well be the next solyndra to get money appropriated for you and heck we may even have one of the administrations step in when the united states as a creditor wants to stand in line and get repaid for loans that are made and downgrade those loans and put other unsecured creditors in front just as the administration did in the bailout of the auto manufacturers turn the constitution upside down deprive people with property of due process theres a lot of good money to do those good projects that the president has been doing for the last 3 years so i hope that in the days ahead as people hear more and more complaining and whining from the administration about there not being any money gee were going to have to raise taxes i hope that there will be people in america that will look at these figures and say enough whining let us tell you about a shortage of money you keep taking our money in taxes and sitting on it in your departments enough is enough its time to be accountable its time to let money be in the hands where it is earned so we can get this economy going again one thing is for sure even though weve spent more money than any nation in history no matter how you want to look at it whether its in dollars or whether its in percentage of gdp this administration has been on a course for ruin and i just hope that as this administration continues to follow the lead of countries like greece italy spain others in economic trouble that hopefully before we go over the cliff with them there will be enough of us that can stop the wagon train and get us back on the right road to prosperity quick recap 687 billion that has been appropriated or unobligated unspent from 2010 and 2011 so we shouldnt hear any more bellyaching about there being a shortage of money by this administration its time to help the american people not the bloated government with that i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.4570118486881256,

place but its really the people and john dingell is the house of representatives as his father was before him pete visclosky is the house of representatives when i got here charlie johnson was the parliamentarian he was the house of representatives and john sullivan has replaced him and he is in fact an institution with the house i dont want to break the mood here but in my opinion the jury is still out on wickham well see how he does but i think things have the opportunity to be okay i just want to tell two quick stories that for me told the measure of the man the first was a number of years ago when we had a member who was going to be expelled from the house of representatives it was only the third time in modern history that that occurred the last one was in the 1970s nobody had really had a chance to study the precedents and things of that nature and i was kind of surprised that that process only took an hour of floor timean hour to basically end somebodys political life so i went to john and he gave me advice and then he told me to file something to postpone it to a date certain which i had never heard of and i bet most members never heard of but that gave members of the house an additional hour to discuss the case and i think at the end of that because of johns stewardship and knowledge of the rules the house as a body felt better at the conclusion of that 2hour debate it happened to be a member of ohio and we are celebrating in ohio that ohio state is in the final four our guy john boehner is the speaker of the house and it also marks the first time in 8 years we havent had a member of our delegation in prison so were pretty pleased about that as well but i will tell you that it was johns counsel that got us through that the second one was more recently a couple of years ago august on our side we call it the day of the stolen vote i think the distinguished minority whip mr hoyer called it a procedural hiccup but regardless if you were here that night it was wild people were screaming yelling and crying and i had the opportunity to watch the videotape about 300 times because we then had a special committee to look into it and always in all of the frames there was one rock like the rock of gibraltar standing there above the fray saying we need to be calm it reminded me a little biti dont know if you saw kevin bacon in animal house where he says stay calm stay calm and the crowd runs him over and hes nothing but a uniform in the end thats what was going on around john the place could have devolved into a very serious problem it looked messy and it was messy but the measure of johns stewardship of the rules of the housei would say that there was pressure on him and the rest of the parliamentarian staff to do what one side or the other wanted him to do or for his opinion to come out one way or the other the republicans we wanted him to say hey they stole the vote it was 215213 the gavel came down you hoodwinked us and from the democratic side the pressure was these things happen stuff happens that no rules were broken no harm no foul john as he has throughout his service both as deputy and now as parliamentarian didnt pick sides he called the game right down the line he told us what he thought based upon the rules the precedents of the house and i will tell you you knew it was a good decision because neither of us liked it the republicans didnt like what he had to say and the democrats didnt like what he had to say that to me is the mark of a fair ruling because he called it as he saw it theres one last thing that i want to say about his service i got here in 1995 and 1995 was the first time the republicans were in the majority for 40 years in the house of representatives i remember going to my first conference meeting and all these guyscharlie johnson was the parliamentarian at the time speakers would get up and say to mr gingrich were not going to keep the democrats parliamentarian are we i didnt know what the heck they were talking about of course mr johnson in fact stayed i imagine there were some discussions about that in the democratic caucus when things changed in 2007 and i imagine i know there were discussions about that when it changed again in the fact of the matter is john is the embodiment of the parliamentarians office hes not the democratic parliamentarian hes not the republican parliamentarian hes the parliamentarian for the house of representatives and thats what makes his service unique and unique to all of our parliamentarians in closing i dont know what john is going to do but if john writes a book and i have to pay 147 to get it on amazon com im really going to be honked off i hope john if you do write your memoirs or some tome with the speaker of the house over in great britain that you let it come out in paperback so that all of us can enjoy it and please make it a good read and not so dry to john and your family i really appreciate your friendship and your service you have gotten me out of a lot of messes and not into too many for your friendship and for your guidance in this house over your career im very grateful and i thank you and i wish you well in whatever you decide to do thank you for your patience and i would yield back the balance of my time"], [0.4572155773639679, 0.4572155773639679, 0, "i thank the speaker and welcome all of you to the discussion tonight as everyone is talking about right now we are preparing to have a discussion this week on the budget and where we go from here the continuing resolution is last years spending it was not passed for the full year so we are now in the process of considering how to fund the government and at what levels through the rest of the year so i appreciate the opportunity to consider why we are doing what we are doing you would have to ask yourself exactly what the basis is of all of the discussions that we are having on the floor of the house id like to make things as simple as possible to understand so i will begin the discussion by simply writing the big picture onto the white board to my left the big picture is simply 3 5 and 2 2 now 3 5 t is the amount that we spend every year 2 2 t is the revenue that the government brings in if you were to go ahead and then do the math on that you would see that we have an outflow of 1 3 greater than the inflow actually those numbers have been revised im not sure if its because the inflow has dropped down or if we are spending more but the revised figures show us that we have a deficit of 1 5 t 1 5 trillion in this current year so we will put that number up on the board in order to continue to just get the big picture on where we are this 1 5 t 1 5 trillion deficit that we have i consider to be in a pipeline its a deficit this year but at the point at which we spend the money and weve not taken in money to offset it then it becomes debt i look at it like its a pipeline running into a barrel well just make a graphic here weve got the deficit pipeline full of 1 5 trillion each year because we are spending more than we bring in the barrel at the end of the pipeline i just call the debt barrel its again fairly transparent as the deficit rolls into that barrel it becomes debt which is accumulated and passed on to the next generation in rounding the figures off we see a debt right now of about 15 trillion we will put that label on our barrel basically you have the picture of the budget right here in front of you we are spending 3 5 trillion we are bringing in approximately 2 2 trillion one of those numbers is a little bit incorrect so youd say well its a 1 3 trillion deficit instead that has been revised and that deficit then is flowing into the debt barrel of 15 trillion so at the end of next year if we continue to spend and the proposals in front of us now are still running a deficit of at least 1 5 you can calculate that we will have a debt accumulated of 16 5 trillion now everyone likes to make this complex and its not that complex its very similar to the problems that maybe you or i had when we were growing up but we began to use more to spend more than what we brought in now if thats the case then we go about it by doing one of two things we either shrink the size of outflows we cut the spending or we get a second job or we get training in order that we would get a promotion and we then drive up our revenues so the discussion this week that were having the continuing resolution is focused mainly on what do we do about the outflows the revenues to the government that requires more people go to work and so this problem of the 2 2 is being accentuated by the 91 2 percent unemployment so when our citizens are antsy theyre concerned theyre alarmed that the jobs are just not happening it is not only in their lives that its a significant problem its in the lives of our government each one of our states is also with one or two exceptions going through this exact same problem theyre spending more than what theyre bringing in in tax revenues now a government has one of three different choices that they can make they can cut spending they can increase taxes or they can grow the economy and growing the economy is when you add more jobs each person and their job will pay taxes and that incrementally increases the number on the bottom so that we eventually get them to balance but then a government can also do one more thing and that is to print money and thats the quantitative easing that mr bernanke has triggered off so the printing of money then has its own downside we wont talk much about that tonight although it is probably the most significant thing in our business climate that we face an unstable dollar that is one where we are printing more dollars and the value begins to erode so people in their homes tonight would be watching the price of vegetables go up the price of gold has gone up the price of silver those dont have any more intrinsic value in other words a vegetable a year ago in our life would be consumed and would have about the same value the price of gold hasnt got any new manufacturing techniques that would be pulling great supplies off the market driving a price up through supply and demand the same thing with silver and in fact those prices are escalating dramatically right now because we have so many dollars because were printing money and by the way we printed last year about 2 6 trillion more or less so we have quantitatively eased we have printed enough money that were now seeing the prices go up in our society now the inflation is in contrast to what the government reports say because the federal reserve would tell you quite frankly that they see no signs of inflation its just that they dont consider the food and the energy that we would have facing us so again returning to our main board here then we have a significant chart that is available from both cbothats congressionaland from the ombthats white house and so weve got a significant chart and the chart basically looks like this and the chart simply comes up and then stops now this axis would be the years so that these would be prior years and now then future years extending out ahead of us on this level we have the dollars and this represents our gross income our per capita income as you can see throughout our history the income has been rising rising so that you have made more in your lives than your parents made and your parents made more than their parents all the way back to our founding but you also see right in this point which is occurring right about this period of time is that the curve begins to flatten out and start down so when i ask in our town hallsand we frequently ask the question are you living better than your parents did and almost unanimously the answer is yes but when i ask the second question are your children going to have better lives better incomes than you have had and almost 100 percent of the people say no well thats actually playing out in the chart right at this peak point here and were experiencing that as we speak now then the unsettling piece of this chart is that its discontinuous it stops the thing about charts is they continue on through history so we start at the founding fathers here and we come up we come up were topping out but then the chart stops that is 2032 maybe 2034 something out in that range and the economy simply stops the economy stops because of this and because of that you could see with our 15 trillion worth of debt that we could take every dollar thats coming into the unitedstates government right now and it would take us 6 7 years to pay it off thats if we did not spend any money and did not have any more deficits as you can see from this year and next year were going to have significant deficits and so we could not in fact pay that off in 7 to 10 years in fact it is ongoing the last thing that we need to get to have the big picture in front of us is that i view that barrel of debt and then i view that it is sitting on top of an aquifer of debt underneath it so i will simply draw that on the board at this point now we have the aquifer of debt and many people are saying that its about 202 trillion we could pay for almost 100 years and not pay the accumulated obligations for medicare medicaid and social security and its that piece which begins to make our economy falter and fail within the coming generation we saw this happen in the soviet union and so as we consider could it happen here well yes it could anywhere and the unitedstates is no exception to anything the rules of economics say that everything that you spend you have to pay for and if you dont pay for it there is loss at some point and we have been living in the government an economic lie we have been fooling ourselves saying that we can continue this process and now we have reached a point where it would be catastrophic within the lives of many of the people who are here in the unitedstates today so what do we do do we cut the 3 5 or do we grow the 2 2 now this week were going to have many many amendments and looking at it from this lens i heard my friends discussing public broadcasting and i agree with them there are many things about public broadcasting that i like and the programming but the question is should it be a government function and should we be spending money for it when its going to put your children and grandchildren into deeper debt should we be risking the failure of our economy and again this is not steve pearce this is cbo and omb you can go to either web site and take a look and find the chart of per capita incomes and just look at it its there so if we are risking that looked at through that lens then we can ask ourselves should the corporation for public broadcasting be funded and that answer will be given sometime this week on the floor because there will be an amendment there will be something in the bill that says that we will do just that these are the hard choices that we need to make now lets consider one other thing the president today submitted his budget to us and he recommended that we have 1 trillion over 10 years maybe 1 1 trillion how does 1 trillionit sounds like a big budget cut oh were really going to cut the budget a lot 1 trillion keep in mind thats for a 10year period and so simply divide 1 trillion by 10 and you get about 100 billion if we cut 100 billion out of this budget we change this number from 3 5 to 3 4 thats what 100 billion means and when the republicans are accused that were going to slash budgets and were going to really create turmoil in the budgetary process republicans are saying basically that were going to cut 100 billion also from 3 5 to 3 4 now you can do the math fairly easily if you cut 100 billion the deficit is going to lower from 1 5 to 1 4 now thats not going to significantly affect our debt barrel nor the debt aquifer that we face both are looming problems that simply omb and cbo tell us break the system now i do not believe that our system is going to break because i think the american people are going to insist that we begin to do forensic audits of our government to find the efficiencies to find the better ways of doing things a forensic audit would for instance ask are the duplications in the budget do we have multiple offices doing the same thing and the answer is absolutely we have offices doing the same thing that in fact sometimes we have 70 and 80 offices we are paying an overhead in every single office i think that what were going to have to do is to find those duplications and we simply roll them into one office to where were not multiplying the number of government salaries because every government salary creates in its lifetime about 4 million toward this you simply multiple the number of government workers by about 4 million in its life its actually a little bit more but that is their benefits their pay and everything associated with them but i tell my friends as republicans yes im wholeheartedly in favor of cutting the 3 5 that we must do and i believe that we should have the forensic audit of our government in order to wring out the inefficiencies the fraud alone in medicare is almost 0 1 percent in this equation the fraud in medicaid is 0 06 percent so you can see that they are significant numbers but none of the costcutting that were doing is actually going to balance the equation if we intend for our republic to survive we must begin to grow our economy we must increase the number of jobs that creates a population that is more content with their welfare with their prosperity with their ability to pay their bills every month but it also begins to cure our budget problems now if were going to talk about creating jobs we have to understand the greatest threat to job creation the greatest threat to job creation is uncertainty if you as an individual without owning a company are uncertain about what youre going to make in the stock market if you see different stocks and youre afraid that the stocks are not going to make you money then you pull your money out of the stock market because of the uncertainty right now we have a lot of the money that came out in the last 2 years flowing back into the stock market driving the prices back up were seeing that companies are actually posting profits higher than what they intended and higher in the past years so theres a mood of certainty among those people who are investing stocks and money is coming back to the stock market the uncertainty drove it out well the same thing happens in businesses if a business owner is certain that hes going to make new investmentsright now if you have cash in the bank its less than 1 percent you probably get onequarter of 1 percent each year for cash the best thing to do with cash is to invest it in creating jobs and president obama about 3 or 4 months ago really hit the business community and he reminded them here a week or so ago when he spoke to the unitedstates chamber you have a moral obligation to invest and create jobs well the government has the moral obligation to give certainty through taxes and regulation and thats the great rub here we have regulated and taxed many of our corporations offshore i know we have discussions every day about those companies that are taking tax breaks and theyre evil and taking the jobs somewhere else the truth is president obama mentioned it in his state of the union that we have the highest corporate tax rate in the worldone of the two and i think that japan just recently lowered theirs leaving us there so we are taxing our companies into uncompetitiveness theyre not competitive because of that piece of their cost structure ireland addressed this 15 or 20 years ago they lowered their corporate tax rate from 36 percent which ours is to 12 percent and companies began to flock into ireland in the succeeding years ireland began to raise its corporate tax rates so now companies are flocking out of ireland its that simple higher taxes kill jobs lower taxes create jobs im not saying we should not have taxes but i do say that tax policy increasing taxes that kind of tax policy will create stagnation and no job growth but the second thing that causes that is regulation companies do not want to put money into investments where they dont think theyre going to get a return they cannot get a return sometimes because theyre simply regulated out of business for instance consider the farmers in the san joaquin valley those were businesses those businesses were making money they were paying the banks they were buying land and theyre employing people theyre buying fertilizer but the silvery minnow a 2inch minnow that we would all want to keep alive got all of the water in the san joaquin river a judge declared that we are going to regulate the water away from people and to the minnow so 27 000 farmers in the san joaquin valley lost their jobs now then those people are not making the payments on their land theyre not able to feed their families so instead of being productive members of society they have now scooted to the top end of the equation which is the second poisonous thing we deal with in this is that when we kill jobs through taxation and regulation policies we actually transfer more cost to the top of the equation and thats the reason were in such imbalance a 9 5 percent rate of unemployment means that we are going to have more people on welfare food stamps more people on assistance i think we have a moral obligation to begin to fix the job situation in the country and we do that by finding the balance point in regulations i do not want to see the minnow go extinct but neither do i want to see our jobs go extinct we have killed industries in this country in the name of regulation the spotted owl was simply a regulation that was put into effect in our national forest and in new mexico alone we lost 20 000 jobs because of the spotted owl regulation i dont think we should stand by and watch the spotted owl become extinct but neither do i think that we should have given up those jobs and those jobs have gone to canada now i love the canadians but i would rather have the jobs here and be using unitedstates timber in the meantime when we stopped cutting timber then we started seeing massive forest fires because of the buildup of fuel in our forests an additional problem has been found in the west where the trees use up all the water they transpire it formerly what was happening was that new mexico with its arid climate had fewer trees per acremaybe 50 maybe 100 now we have got 2 500 the trees were crowding the grass out the grass is on the slopes the water cant run through grass as easily as it can across the bare ground so now with no grass the water is rushing into the streams down at the bottom of the mountain it used to be that the grass slowed it down and it had a chance to percolate in and recharge the aquifers so we are finding many of our mountain communities now starved for water so not only have we lost the jobs not only have we put people on welfare and driven up the cost of government we are also creating resource shortages throughout the west and we absolutely must begin to deal with all of this if we are to look again at another industry that we have simply dismantled or are in the process of dismantling i would look offshore in louisiana my wife and i made a career in repairing oil wells and so we understand the processes that happened offshore we understand the decisions that were made i think bp should be accountable and theyre being held accountable they are actually paying the bills on the cleanup and thats set in law and is actually happening right now but i do not think that we should have taken 100 000 jobs those are jobs offshore that were making well into the six figures high taxes were being paid to the government because people were making good money its dangerous work its hard work many hours and yet we took probably 100 000 jobs from the louisiana texas economy and we have moved it now to a cost for the government if we would begin to create the jobs again if we would go back and rebuild the industries the greatest solution for our budget crisis is that grow the number on the bottom and as we create jobs we pool costs from the top end of the equation my friends i dont believe that it is among our choices to not get our fiscal house in order if we raise taxes in order to increase this which many people suggest we are going to kill jobs and we get a washmaybe no increase maybe even a decrease if we will set about curing the imbalance in our tax rate for our unitedstates corporations i think then that job growth would become explosive if we would also find the pendulum bring the pendulum to the middle of the equation where we can protect species protect the environment protect the workers and at the same time create jobs i think americans are hungry for us to begin to solve the problems in that fashion rather than the partisan divide that says no we cant create jobs and those jobs shouldnt be here i think that americans are going to insist that we do what it takes to bring back the manufacturing jobs those good career jobs not just a job but a career thats what people are hungry for they would like to be able to plan their life to plan for retirement to plan for college for their kids to pay off a house to build a nest egg thats what americans are hungry for and it is not possible in the environment that we have right now when we kill job growth we kill opportunity when we kill job growth we kill prosperity and i think americans are hungry for the prosperity theyre hungry for a forensic audit of our government that begins to say why does it take 3 5 trillion to run the government every person sees things every day that our government does that dont make sense that cost too much and in the end kill our jobs and drive them overseas now people would ask well thats not possible and its going to take too long first of all is it possible yes if we establish 3 5 percent rate of growth then these numbers begin to balance up and we begin to cure the budget shortfalls both for every state and for the entire nation a 3 5 percent rate of growth then you would ask is that possible as a country we have averaged a 3 5 percent rate of growth over the last 75 years it is extremely possible so let us take on the hard tasks of finding the savings in the budget increasing our job growth and were going to find the solutions to the economic woes that threaten our entire society that threaten our entire economy we have many people who question can we cut the government can we cut the size of government right now with unemployment its going to drive unemployment too high that we should not be laying off a single federal worker new zealand came upon that question a decade or two ago new zealand began to ask themselves the same question why is our economy sluggish new zealand was in the bottom third of the worlds economies they said were a developed country we have smart people we have hardworking people why arent we in the top third new zealands conclusion is that they had too many nongovernment functions inside the government and so they took one agency and set about to cut the nonessential government jobs just to cut them without regard to what its going to do to unemployment or any other question in the department of labor thats the one that took it on and i have visited with the guy who actually did this they cut from approximately 63 000 employees down to one employee he actually said i could have cut myself but i had to go home that night and face my wife and by the way i should wish my wife happy valentines day she is in new mexico and im here and also my mom two special special women in my life but he said he could not go home and face his wife if he had cut his own job so from 63 000 down to one now to people who worry can we cut jobs from the government without it affecting the unemployment what happened in new zealand would happen here they jumped from the bottom third of the worlds economies to the top third thats because the people that they laid off from government went outside those functions transitioned outside the government and they began to be done at higher pay with more efficiency and with more purpose and so actually the tremendous increase in their relative position worldwide jumped from the bottom third to the top third was the offshoot and i think that we would see the same thing happen in our economy now again to whether we should have taxes increase taxes or decrease taxes does it work does it not work back in 2003 we gave the tax cuts under president bush and i was here at that point and voted for those tax cuts when we cut the taxes the growth rate was not 31 2 percent it was actually about 11 4 percent rate of growth within 30 days the economy began to boom up so that it finally got to 83 4 rate of growthfrom 11 4 to 83 4 now there was pent up demand and so people were buying new equipment and buying things in kind of a surge so that 83 4 finally moderated down to 53 4 then down to 4 and 41 4 and finally down to 33 4 which again is all we need to fix the situation it is not that complex the picture is not that complex people try to make it so here in washington because they love to spend your money but the truth is the consequences are now on us the truth is that we are facing catastrophic economic failures and inflation if we do not begin to pay attention to the fundamentals that are in play in front of so as we approach this week the idea that we can only cut 100 billion is one that we should all question we know there are greater inefficiencies im going to propose a series of amendments that would cut even more cut functions that i think could be delayed were going to suggest that the government maybe shouldnt be building a lot of projects a lot of buildings right now surely we can take a moratorium on that for a year or maybe two in the interest of future generations dont we think that thats a sacrifice that we should make so these are the issues that face us this week i would conclude by saying that i think that its achievable the solutions are right at hand we just have to have the will to create jobs and cut the size of the budget"], [0.45788535475730896, 0.45788535475730896, 0, "were at the end of another week of session here you know the presidents been trayeling around the country i know that costs millions and millions of dollars to put air force one in motion hopping all over the country ive also seen what it takes from a security standpoint to prepare for a president to come anywhere because of the sniper weapons available these days they have to be so thorough the secret service has to go along and check anything they can see they have to check out well that takes several days so to the average person you think well gee the president just comes in hes gone in 30 minutes no big deal but for those whose lifes work it is in the government to make sure that things go properly it is an extremely onerous task we owe so much to those who protect those who are leaving the country not so much the people in congress i know we had people in congress who were advocating that we all ought to have our own security detail but as one of my constituents said one morning at 2 in walmart wow you really dont have any security and i said no its just you me and the syrup here i dont think we should have to have security if it comes to that this country is in such trouble that im not sure well have it back in any proper form anyway in the meantime i am an advocate of letting people in washington d c who arent prior convicted felons and who meet the requirements of being able to carry let folks carry not here in the capitol of course you dont need one here weve got the finest we could hope for i know you know the capitol police are fantastic weve got some up in the gallery who make sure that things are orderly up there and as we know from the last 20 years there are times theyve had to lay down their lives to protect the public here so we are greatly blessed but it all comes back to this that were talking about millions and millions of dollars for the president to go anywhere ever since 1 week ago we were chastised by the president here on the house floor as he spoke from the podium here that we needed to pass his bill somebody else counted them i didnt weve got to pass this bill right now right away right now pass this bill now it turns out the whole time the president was saying this bill there was no such bill which brought back memories of exactly 2 years before when at that time the president demanded to come address a joint session of congress under the rules of congress the laws of the land no one can demand to come speak to the senate or house unless theyre invited but that was overlooked back in september of 2009 the president was not doing well in the polling with his health care ideas he figured if he came and spoke here on the floor because he is such a gifted reader that he might be able to persuade people to support a bill they otherwise didnt like so he came and he spoke he spoke of this bill my bill this plan my plan i couldnt find a bill i couldnt find a plan anywhere it was even 2 weeks later that i asked the cabinet member charged with health and human servicesits her areasince the president was so accusatory and said if any of you misrepresent my bill i am going to call you out i wanted to make sure i didnt misrepresent anything i asked the secretary of health and human services where do i get a copy of the presidents bill she said these words i think he was talking about a set of principles ah it couldnt have been he said this bill my bill this plan my plan he didnt have a plan he didnt have a bill he was talking about a set of principles how could he condemn us for misrepresenting a bill or a plan that he didnt have not then it turns out he didnt so as i heard the president say repeatedly to pass this bill pass this bill to do it right now right now i wondered if yet again 2 years later he was making the same errordemanding we pass a bill that didnt exist it turns out my concerns were wellfounded he had no bill he had no plan he had a speech but as weve learned from cbo generally speaking unless theyre chastised sufficiently by the president or the white house cbo cannot score a speech if theyre chastised sufficiently then cbo will give them some sort of scoring because there are pressures that can be brought to bear from the white house that somehow apparently make them sensitive which is another whole point i really dont believe that we will be able to fix the problems of the massive overspending the overtaxing the dramatic problems with the overvexation the overburdensome laws and regulations until we change a number of things one of those is we eliminate the congressional budget office and eliminate the rules under which bills are scored those rules were put in place in 1974 by the same congress that forced the military to rush out of vietnam leaving many report around 2 million people who had helped us to be wiped outmurdered killedbecause the congress didnt care that same congress put in rules that would require that a bill be scored as to the effect it would have on our economy on spending on revenue it required it would be scored under rules that do not allow the scorer to take into consideration reality history facts all theyre allowed to do is to consider the formulasthe rules under which theyre bound by that 1974 congress thats it now weve gotten horrible scoring and it cant be blamed on cbo or on the joint commission on taxation its the rules that are the problem but when a group comes back with a score of around 800 billion and then later they have to confirm in reality its more like say 1 1 trillion then you realize on an 800 billion bill that the score really should put boldly that you have to consider that with a 30 to 40 percent margin of error plus or minus so here is the score plus or minus 30 or 40 percent and thats about the best we can do since that is the best that cbo can apparently do its time to have some massive changes in this place its time to use reality its time to use history and not some 1974 liberal congress idea of how we get the government taking over everybodys lives thats no way to run government unless youre in some country besides the united states of america theres an old saying in this town mr speaker no matter how cynical you get its never enough to catch up in my 61 2 years here in congress ive found thats certainly true because you want to trust everybody you want to believe that when people say things in this town its true but then you find out for example that you can have a leader of the country tell everybody that we need to go after the big oil companies theyre having massive profits and were going after those companies then you find out that the bill thats produced to go after those companies has no adverse effect on those companies whatsoever and in fact it will make them even bigger profits than they might have ever imagined now i know there have been some issues about the bill title american jobs act of 2011 and yes i am the one who filed the american jobs act of i think it will be a wonderful thing when we in this body can work together we can have our disagreements i found in a deacon body even though there was a lot of nasty mean things said that if we had prayer together and we came together we had meals together we could work together one of the things thats so troubling on this floor is when people come so close to impugning the integrity of other people i know some people that have diametrically opposed views of how this country should work but i know in their heart they want the country to work well and succeed i just believe from history theyre wrong but there are people in this body who you might think we were so far from each other politically that we wouldnt want to have anything to do with each other dennis kucinich is one of those people that is quite far afield from me on so many political issues but dennis has never lied to me he has always been up front i find him to be a man of conviction and i find him refreshing marcy kaptur and i disagree on many issues maybe most issues but i know she is a person of integrity she has never lied to me she has never been anything but honest with me there are numerous people bill delahunt and i would spar in judiciary committee many many times other committees subcommittees here on floor but i always found bill delahuntwhat i would call a liberal from massachusetts a democratto be an honorable man a man of integrity and i believe with all my heart that he had a heart for this country and he wanted to see it work we ought to be able to work together when people realize that we have got common goals the common goal being the good of the country so lets at least find things we could agree on when i was engaged in trialsand i have been involved in many trials as an attorney and as a judge and then oversaw them briefly as a chief justice but engaged as a lawyerthere were many times when we started in the discovery process that i told opposing counsel we can do this one of two ways we can fight scrape and fuss over every question over every interrogatory over every deposition but we both know the rules require certain things will need to be produced that certain things will need to be disclosed so i would prefer to do it that way amicably and the people that win are the clients because they dont have to pay near as much money because it doesnt take near as much time if you can agree on the things that you know you are going to have to produce and quit having a motion to compel a motion to protect all this kind of stuff sometimes we had attorneys that could work together well and sometimes they would hit me with a discovery demand out of the blue that was so grossly unfair but not illegal that you would find out okay this is the way you want to go i didnt want to go this way but i believe so strongly in the interests of the person i am representing and believe so strongly in the process itself that if you want a fight you will have a fight if somebody is going to travel around the country condemning me and other people in this body for refusing to pass a bill knowing that that bill does not exist it is not in existence because legally it has not been filed then we are going to do some battle over that if i am going to be condemned for a week for refusing to pass an american jobs act of 2011 well after 6 days or so its time to have an american jobs act that we can pass or at least that i could go along with i would certainly like the president and others to know i am flexible but the corporate tax is one of the most insidious taxes that we have in this country because its not an honest tax governments had represented to voters for years and years that we have got this tax over here we go after the mean evil greedy corporationsand some do have greed as a material factor in their businessbut the thing is thats not what a corporate tax is about a corporation cannot stay in existence if they dont have their customers or clientele pay the corporate tax so a corporate tax is not actually a tax on a corporation a corporate tax is instead requiring the corporation to be the collection agent oh make no mistake that tax will come from the rankandfile people across this great country theyre the ones that are going to pay that tax the corporations are a collection agent they collect the tax from their customers and then they pass it on to the federal government the trouble is in this country now we have the highest corporate tax in the world any developing nation for sure 35 percent in china 17 percent and they do cut deals where they will reduce it to zero tax for 5 years i have been told by some people there you get a dealzero tax for 5 years and then gradually work up to 17 not here in the united states we are going to slap a 35 percent tax on anything a company in america produces that sure makes it tough to compete in the global market now that we have got planes ships that move so quickly rail that goes across borders it is important that we be able to compete in the global market and if we are going to slap a 35 percent tariff on everything an american company produces in this country they are going to have to move and go to a country where there is not such a high collection fee that corporations are required to collect in this country they are going to go to a country like china that charges a lot less for a collection fee from the customers but if people could get their mind around the fact that it isnt making the greedy corporations pay in fact the greediest corporations are the ones that dont pay anything you know we found out that the close cronies of the president at ge are able not to pay any tax but the momandpoptype small business corporations they are having to pay the tax gibson is employing a lot of people i got a gibson guitar when i was 8 years old a fantastic guitar we are going to send in armed agents to harass those people thats no way to draw business back into this country you reduce the corporate tax if you reduce it at all the more you reduce it the more jobs are going to come back because that means more and more corporations will be able to compete in the global market and theyll be able to come back here union members not the government union membersand that seems to be where union leadership wants to go these days forget the manufacturing unions we are driving those jobs out of america but any historian will tell you when a nation that is protecting other nationsand we are we are protecting the free worldthat requires that nation to have a military any nation that cannot provide its own military with the things it needs to protect itselfthat means steel it means all kinds of metal it means gunpowder it means actually uranium as we have nuclear subs and ships it means wood products it means tires we are buying tires for humvees from china these days excuse me we have to be able to have no supply line to be able to provide the things that we in this country need to defend ourselves and provide them in this country its time to quit driving companies including manufacturing jobs out of the country this bill drives more jobs out you have got to have energy those that are familiar with the battle of the bulge can dispel the myth that some think gee the war was won before the battle of the bulge some say they buy into the russians explanation that we had whipped the germans all by ourselves we didnt need the allies otherwise but if you really study the battle of the bulge what won that for the allies was the fact that the germans were running out of gasoline so what does the president do to help us he said go against and take the profits of these massive big oil companies instead page 151 through 154 he rips the heart out of the independent oil and gas industry in order to drill a well in america you have to raise capital if youre one of the majors like exxon like british petroleum the dear friends of the president if youre one of those big companies youve got enough money of your own youre capitalized you can do these things but for over 94 percent of the wells drilled in the continental united states theyre raising money they have to raise capital well this knocks the fool out of their ability to raise capital not only that it repeals the deductions that are not even available to any company that produces more than a thousand barrels of oil a day thats the majors so all this will do is eliminate over 94 percent of the wells drilled in the continental united states the result will be a higher cost of oil it will make even more profits for the presidents friends at british petroleum british petroleum is friends of the president they love the capandtrade idea and theyre going to love this bill by the president also we know weve heard complaint after complaint from state after state and theyre saying you are giving us so many unfunded mandates we just cant take this any more stop already we just cant stand this kind of help much longer so if you look through this bill you end up finding out there is a little provisionand like i say i was up until about 5 tuesday going through this lovely thing but there is a provision at the bottom of one of the pages rather obscure and my staff made copies ive got the best staff in the world but i dont believe they got my tag back on that page the title of the little section is federal and state immunity but then you read the section it has nothing to do with federal immunity under the law the federal government and the state government are immune from being sued but in that provision it actually says that gee if a state accepts any money at all from the federal government any money at all then they have effectively waived their sovereign immunity and are therefore subject to suit i just found it its page 133 a states receipt or use of federal financial assistance for any program or activity of a state shall constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity under the 11th amendment to the constitution or otherwise to a suit brought by an employee or applicant for employment of that program or activity it goes on so at a time when states say we cant afford any more unfunded mandates the president proposes a bill to let them get sued a bunch more by people who are unemployed thats just got to be great news and were seeing the hearings go on about solyndra this administration it appears from the evidence well get the final verdict later but they rushed in to give them 500 million of stimulus money so crony capitalism could occur and certain people could engorge themselves and all at the taxpayers expense and it turns out that probably future generations will be paying for that if you like the way that was handled youve got to be reassured because in this bill there are a number of references that green programs like solyndra will have priority and well rush a lot more money out there there are a lot of things we could agree on in that bill that the president never had anybody willing to file there was a provision for a payroll tax holiday well you would figure id support that im the guy who proposed it 3 years ago and personally explained it to the president and larry summers in january of 2009 but it sure wouldve been better if we did it before this administration squandered 4 5 trillion more than we brought in we couldve given everybody in the united states who pays income tax a tax holiday for 3 years and it wouldve only run up 3 6 trillion we would have saved 900 billion if you dont think that people having all of their own income tax from 3 years wouldve stimulated this economy then you need to embrace this presidents bill because youll love it nonetheless there are things that we could agree on both houses both parties i think agree that we were willing to sell some more broadband spectrum thats there in the bill but then he uses that as a platform to create another bureaucracy a big brother coming into your computer because its the public safety broadband corporation thats created and will just really make sure that big brother government intrudes in your life when you boil it all down we have a moral problem in america the founders continually pointed to god and said thats where we need to have our focus as ben franklin said without his concurring aid we will succeed in our political building no better than the builders of babel well be confounded by our local partial interests and we ourselves shall become a byword down through the ages so whether anybody believes in god or not as the founders did over a third of the declaration of independence signers were not just christians they were ordained ministers to take ones eyes off of self and put them on something higher and greater avoids the kind of engorgement the selfsatisfaction the selfemphasis that weve gotten into thats the reason you run up trillions of dollars of debt without any regard for the children the grandchildren and the generations to come i have to make this personal note reference it breaks my heart to see that in college football nobody loves college football more than i do i attended texas a m and i know a lot of people are excited about texas a m perhaps going to the southeastern conference for money all about money the traditions of texas a m make it unique and i think the greatest public institution of higher education in the country im very proud of it but its the traditions and now we see that over a hundred years of tradition going back to 1876 are ready to be thrown away for money just money greed money forget tradition that makes your institution great forget it all forget the state rivalries forget it all were talking about cash isnt that what got us in trouble in this country in the first place when we put cash greed for ourselves above the interests of the country or the institutions we represent to close with this example my senior year in the corps cadets i was the second level below the corps commander i was one level right below the commander there were four of us at that level major unit commanders there was a corps commander he didnt get along very well he didnt play very well with others and the first meeting we had all of the senior leaders in the corps cadets he had his staff put together tables end to end he got up there with a corncob pipe like macarthur walked up and down and condescended and cajoled all his classmates like they were 2yearolds i approached him after the meeting and i said man these guys have seen you naked were all classmates were all friends you need to try to work together dont just condemn everybody and i think if we could get to that level in herenot that we run around naked togetherbut just where we can work together as friends disagreeing on issues but unless one person has a 100 percent lock on gods truth 100 percent of the time we should listen to each other not condemn each other and we can get these things worked out put greed aside and help this country last 200 more years with that i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.45791104435920715, 0.45791104435920715, 0, "i thank the gentlelady for yielding i agree with most everything you said tonight but i have to disagree with you on one point with regard to medicare the president does have a plan i talk to seniors all over my district one of the things that makes our seniors so angry is that over the course of their lifetime the money that they have put in their social security accounts its been robbed its been taken out and spent for other things so what the president does in obamacare is he takes half a trillion dollars out of medicare and uses it to spend for obamacare everyone agrees that we have to fix medicare the president agrees theres a problem bill clinton agrees theres a problem republicans agree theres a problem how do we fix it well what the president does is says im going to institute the ipad board the independent payment advisory board this is a board thats going to look at prices that we pay our health care providers and its going to reduce those reimbursementsreimbursements that are already incredibly low what does that mean its going to affect the access to care for our current seniors that is absolutely unacceptable we have a plan in place thats going to save medicare its going to protect medicare and were going to continue this great program for future generations lets not be mistaken the president has a plan that is going to kill medicare and provide a lack of service to our seniors i do want to move from that to jobs though because that is what is on everyones mind as i travel central and northern wisconsin people are concerned about jobs theres a lack of opportunity theres a lack of prosperity and so i want to review what the democrats did which is they talked to folks who will come up with abstract theories they went and talked to university professors and they came up with an 800 billionplus stimulus bill remember that was their jobs plan 800 billion of government spending they said government spending will lead to economic growth prosperity wealth and sustainable jobs we know that government spending doesnt lead to sustainable jobs it has never worked it doesnt work and thats why when they promised that we would have unemployment of only 8 percent and we would create millions of jobs the alternative happened weve lost millions of jobs and weve had unemployment reach almost 10 percent what weve done is not talk to the professors who sit in the classroom ive gone out and talked to job creators people who are actually putting people in my community back to work and what do they say why arent they creating jobs they continually talk about uncertainty in the marketplace what does that mean when they talk about uncertainty they talk about a 14 3 trillion debt the fact that were going to borrow 12 5 trillion this year alone were going to borrow a trillion dollars every year for the next 10 years as the gentleman from illinois said we are cascading towards a cliff and theres a road sign that says danger pump the breaks youre about to go over thats what were going to do our job creators are saying listen with this massive debt it creates uncertainty it creates uncertainty because we dont know what interest rates are going to be in the very near future were concerned about inflation because government is printing money to purchase our debt theyre concerned about punishing tax increases theyre concerned about health care costs with obamacare as the gentlelady from alabama said theyre concerned about regulation in my district we have a great forest product industry we make paper in my district boiler mact is going to kill jobs in central wisconsin and send them to china where they have no regulation all these things have come together to create uncertainty which means our job creators arent reinvesting theyre not expanding theyre not growing theyre not innovating do you know what it doesnt hurt the job creator it hurts the families in our communities because they have a lack of opportunity for jobs i want to just point to a chart that we have here when we have recessions there is whats called symmetry if you have a ushaped decline in this recession youll have a ushaped recovery if you have a vshaped decline youll have a vshaped recovery thats our history and youll see that in this chart what has happened differently in this recession the great recession is weve had a vshaped decline the recovery has ticked up a little bit and then it has flatlined why has it flatlined because of the uncertainty that has been created coming from washington from our democrat colleagues on the other side of the aisle and this administration its causing a lack of willingness for our job creators to reinvest i want to bring up one last point i continually hear how our friends want to increase taxes on our job creators i think anyone who looks at that says we will not create jobs by taxing the job creator i think its a good example if those who say we should raise taxes are concerned about jobs going overseas its a pretty simple example that i use you have walmart and target and kmartall the bigbox retailers they compete against one another right theyre competing yet kmart is not doing so well theyre laying people off theyre closing stores right my friends on the other side of the aisle the democrats they would come in and they would advise kmart theyd say listen you have to bring in more revenue you have to keep these people employed you have to keep these stores open you need more revenue to bring in more revenue all you have to do is raise your prices if you raise your prices youll bring in more revenue we all know thats not what will happen if you raise your prices at kmart you will drive more shoppers to walmart and target if you raise the cost of doing business in america you are going to send more of our jobs to china india mexico vietnam but youre going to outsource these jobs because youre raising the cost of doing business in america lets make sure we make america a competitive place where our job creators can do what they do best which is to create jobs and to put our hardworking families back to work"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.5498005449771881, 0.4501994550228119, 1, "thank you and i want to continue making this tribute and joining my colleagues congressman lance and congressman holt in this tribute this evening to john adler a good friend and one of our colleagues i dont want to repeat some of the things that my colleagues have already said but i would like to talk a little bit about some instances of my own life that also involved john i think mr lance mentioned how difficult his political life was in the sense that he was always running in areas that were primarily or historically republican when he was elected to the state senate back in the early 1990s he won in an upset against an incumbent of course when he ran for the congressional seat which adjoins mine in the south in ocean county he was very much running against the odds that seat had been held by congressman saxton who was also a good friend for many years and was republican as far back as anyone can remember and he still won i think he won by 51 or 52 percent of the vote he just always faced challenges like that it was mentioned when he was growing up that his father died also of a heart condition at a young age i think 47 years old and i dont even know if john was in high school at that time he would often talk on the campaign trail about growing up and having to depend on social security benefits and he was able to relate to people because of his upbringing those who were struggling and those who had a hard time because maybe they had lost a father or didnt have a parent or grew up in circumstances where they didnt have much money i think that the energy and the willingness to always take on the fight very much characterized john as was mentioned he really was one of the smartest people that i have ever met i remember on another occasion when we were at a campaign event and i was introducing him and i mentioned he graduated undergraduate from harvard university and then went on to harvard law school and how impressed i was with that after the event was over he came up to me and said frank dont mention i went to harvard i have to be humble and that certainly doesnt indicate any kind of humility if you mention harvard not that he wasnt proud of it he certainly was and he had reason to be but he always wanted to relate to the average person to the middle class person to the little guy because that was his upbringing that is what he was really all about that is why he wanted to come to congress as mr lance mentioned anybody who graduates from harvard undergraduate and law school could easily spend the rest of their life making money and doing well financially but he decided he wanted to go into politics he wanted to help people and even if it meant he had to run in a district and work hard and raise a lot of money to campaign in order to win he was determined to do that because he really believed that that is what life is all about giving back giving to the public giving back to his country i want to just mention a couple of other things that i thought were kind of interesting john would always talk about his family i dont know how long it takes to go back and forth to where he lived in cherry hill exactly probably a couple of hours maybe a little more but he was always determined to go back and forth as much as possible even when he was here in order to make sure that he was able to help his family and not spend a lot of money he would spend the night in his office because he wanted to make sure that he had enough money to pay for his family he always talked about his kids he talked about their education he was so proud of the fact of where they were going to college and talked to me many times about them and their education and wanted to go back home so he could go to an athletic event with them or just be with them and his wife shelley the one thing that everyone comments about is not only johns humility but also his sense of humor i have to tell you that many times i would come to the floor and sometimes i always remember him over in that set of chairs or standing up in that part of the house floor i would always come up to him and ask him if he wanted to do a 1minute special order or if he wanted to do this or that i was always nagging him to do different things and sometimes he would do and sometimes he wouldnt but he would always tell a joke he always would make me laugh i have to be honest that oftentimes after a long day here in the house of representatives thats really what you need you need someone to tell a joke or to make you laugh with his wit with his sense of humor it was a very special thing im not sure that i can really describe it well also on the campaign trail jon runyan his successor in congress was here speaking the other night you couldnt help when you saw john adler and jon runyan together jon is this huge guy a football player big tall and of course john adler was so slight he always exercised i dont even know how much he weighed but he was very slight the contrast between them was sort of interesting john would always poke fun at that as well the fact that he was a slight guy and that jon runyan was such a big guy as a football player i heard mr lance talk about ocean county and john representing ocean county i cant help but mention one aspect of that and that is the fact that when he first was running in ocean county because i used to represent it at one time he would remark to me about how beautiful it was how wonderful the beaches were and he was very concerned to preserve the quality of the beaches the quality of the ocean and also protect the industries that used them particularly the fishing industry there was an organization called the recreational fishing alliance that was very supportive of john because he was very concerned about the fishing industry it was historically part of ocean county and part of new jersey going back to even colonial times and that he felt he had a special role to play in trying to protect the industry they appreciated it fishermen maybe unlike some people they can kind of see whether youre really on their side and whether you really are truly supportive of them and understand their concerns they understood that john did and they really appreciated all the help that he gave them i know our time is running out i did want to first recognize my colleague"], [0.532280296087265, 0.467719703912735, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume first of all i think its important to make it clear that there was a voice vote in the energy and commerce committee there were 2 days of debate on this class act 2 days of debate and the language in the amendment apparently was even changed before there was a voice vote so to somehow diminish that there was some sort of a real vote or notthere was a real vote 2 days of debate and a real vote secondly just so theres no misunderstanding my friends keep talking about the debt and the deficit we face first of all as a democrat i want to say that i dont need a lecture from my friends on the other side of the aisle about deficits and the debt we saw how this country went from surplus to deficit with the passage of the bush tax cutsmostly for the wealthy that werent paid for every economist will affirm that they brought us into debt two the prescription drug billthat was much more expensive than my friends on the other side of the aisle told us it was going to be and then they didnt pay for it on top of it and then add to that two wars that arent paid for we are fighting the wars in afghanistan and iraq and we didnt pay for them we didnt look for offsets in the budget they didnt even go to the american people and say were at war we have to have a war tax or we have to find a way to pay for the war no soldiers go fight you know their families suffer and we do nothing so you want to know why were in debt thats why were in debt and just for the record this class act that were talking about is not this taxpayersubsidized endless government funding type of a program here i mean it has to be selffinanced by the premiums that people pay who volunteer to get into it it says in the law that this cannot be funded by the dollars of taxpayers what this is is a framework a framework to get us to focus on the issue that we need to address which is longterm health care in this country now im from massachusetts and i may be a little sensitive on this issue because one of my heroes the late senator ted kennedy championed this issue he understood that there was a need out there and he saw as we all have seen what families go through when loved ones cant afford or families cant afford to pay for the longterm care of loved ones so it took us decades to get here to get to this point where we have a framework yes it is true this is not perfect it needs more work but we have a framework here and its not a framework which calls for endless subsidies by the taxpayers it says weve got to come up with a program that can selfsustain itself that is financed by those who want to be enrolled in it why would you throw this away why would you throw this away my friend on the other side of the aisle talks about false promises please give me a break false promises you got up over a year ago and said were repealing this health care reform bill the affordable care act and were going to replace it with something its been over a year nothing nothing not a single thing you know its not like we havent had time to do it or to talk about these issues or debate these issues i mean this has become a place where trivial issues get debated passionately and important ones not at all national public radio funding we had to debate that on the floor reaffirming our national motto in god we trust we had time for that issues on abortion and every hot button issue you can think of including we had a debate on making it easier for unsafe people to bring concealed weapons from state to state to state now i dont know about texas or about other countries but ive got to tell you people talk to me about a lot of problems and about a lot of things that keep them up at night some of the things that youve brought to this house floor never even enter their minds because what keeps them up at night are things like this what happens if i get sick will i be able to take care of myself what happens if my spouse gets sick seriously ill will i be able to care for her will i be able to care for him what if its my child what if its my mother or what if its my father will i be able to take care of them over a long period of time those are reallife issues that real people worry about each and every day so i would say to my friends on the other side of the aisle first of all vote down this rule because i think it is insulting to bring a rule to the floor on the issue of longterm care and say were going to cap debate at 3 hours i think this is too important this is more important than reaffirming our national motto number one number two i would urge my colleagues on this side of the aisle understand that what this represents is a framework and understand how long it has taken us to get to this point and ive got to tell you if we throw this framework away i doubt very much that at any time in the near future this congress is going to do anything meaningful on the issue of longterm health care so lets get serious about dealing with the real challenges that the american people are faced with lets not say that this is going to add to the deficit its not going to add to the deficit in the law it says it has to be selfsustaining if not it doesnt work it says that we are not going to be subsidizing this program thats what it says if you want to get serious about the deficit you know what then make sure warren buffett pays the same tax rate as his secretary if you want to get serious about the deficit thats what you can do to help us deal with the issue of the deficit but going after this with all these smokescreens i think is unfortunate so i would urge my colleagues vote no on the rule and vote no on the underlying resolution i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.5305163562297821, 0.4694836437702179, 1, "mr president since i was sworn into office this january about 6 months ago the house and the senate have both been understandably and properly concerned with one issue that has perhaps eclipsed every other issue that has come before us in this halfyear period of time that related to our national debt and the anticipated expiration of our debt limit which will hit in just a couple weeks many americans are understandably concerned and have articulated the concern that if we pass the debt limit deadline of august 2 without raising the debt limit there could be catastrophic financial consequences in light of that i along with a number of my republican colleagues both in the senate and in the house have introduced legislation called the cut cap and balance act to address the debt limit to address it head on it says we will raise the debt limit if three conditions are met first that we make significant cuts to domestic discretionary spending for the fiscal year 2012 budget second we need statutory spending caps to put us on a smooth but steady glidepath toward balancing our budget sometime within the next decade third we need a balanced budget amendment passed out of congress and submitted to the states for ratification we think all three of these steps are necessarily required before we take the significant additional step of raising the debt limit because of the fact that it took us a long time to get to this point the point where by the end of the year we will have accumulated 15 trillion in debtabout 50 000 for every man woman and child in america between 120 000 and 150 000 for every wage earner in america this is a lot of moneybefore we extend that debt limit again by an additional 2 4 trillion we have to solve the problem we have to address the problem that led to its creation in a real lasting binding fundamental way that is why the most critical part of this legislation while each part is important happens to be found in that which rests upon the idea of a balanced budget amendment to the constitution we as members of congress could decide right now that over the next 10 years or 15 years it might be a good idea to cut spending by 2 trillion 3 trillion 4 trillion 5 trillion 6 trillion perhaps morebut if we made that promise today as a downpayment to the american people in exchange for the permission of the people to raise the debt limit it is a promise we cannot make good on because we cannot bind a future congress this congress was sworn in in january of 2011 elections will be held in november of 2012 and a new congress will be sworn in based on those elections in january 2013 the same thing will happen again in january 2015 and every 2 years after that for the duration of our republic the decisions we make right here right now can affect the here and now and can be binding for the here and now but we cannot reasonably expect and we cannot ask the american people when making a decision so longlasting and precedentsetting as this one to simply trust us that future congresses will see things the same way we do the only way we can bind a future congress is by amending our law of laws that 224yearold document painstakingly ironed out by some of the brightest men of the last several centuries in philadelphia 224 years ago when we amend the constitution we make it possible to bind a future congress that is what we need to do we have had some interesting debate and discussion surrounding this proposal last friday i listened with surprise and dismay as our president said we dont need to amend the constitution to require a balanced budget but we do need to balance our budget in the opinion of the president congress just needs to do its job not amend the constitution i think i understand his point i think he is suggesting that for congress to do its job it needs to balance its budget but i have to ask the question how has that worked out for us have past congresses balanced their budgets has the current congress balanced its budget overwhelmingly the answer is no it happens every now and then some would describe those instances where it has balanced in the last two or three decades as an accident others a momentary blip still others would suggest it was the product of accounting gimmickry rather than an actual act of budget balancing when that occurred regardless we know that balanced federal budgets are newsworthy indeed because they are very rare i look forward to the day when they are no longer newsworthy when they are customary and the only way to make them customary based on our experience as americans throughout most of our nations history is by amending the constitution to require it to make this a binding and permanent law i was shocked and dismayed again to learn that our senate majority leader senator reid from nevada stated just a few hours ago that he does not like this legislation he made some very disparaging comments about it notwithstanding the fact and completely ignoring the fact that this is not just the best legislation to address the debt limit issue right now it is the only legislation it is the only legislation that addresses this issue that is moving through congress and that has been reduced to legislative language it is certainly the only one that has been passed by one body of congress and is now moving over to the senate he is criticizing something when he himself has not offered anything this is the only show in town given how close we now are to the august 2 deadline and in part because we punted this so long and in part because we have not been having the debate and discussion in congress we should have been having for months this is it this is the only proposal if senator reid has suggestions on how we might change this proposal i am all ears i would love to hear what they are if he has his own proposal i would love to see what that is but simply to stand from that desk over there and disparage this legislation is inexcusable absolutely inexcusable given the fact that he has offered nothing let me read some of his words he said the american people should understand that this this meaning the cut cap and balance act is a bad piece of legislation perhaps some of the worst legislation in the history of this country i dont know what he is referring to he didnt give specifics nor has he given any specifics on what he would like to see in its place or how it could be improved my suggestion to our senate majority leader is if he has ideas please put them on the table because as we approach this debt limit deadline we are running out of time the clock has been ticking for 6 months we have known this was going to happen this is not news to us why then has there been so little debate and discussion in this body why is it that we spent weeks and weeks and weeks often dealing with legislation that paled in comparison to the importance of this issue the clock kept ticking and we kept debating and discussing other legislation far less important this in my opinion was a gross dereliction of duty but we still have a few weeks we can still deal with it we can still address it i suggest strongly that we address it by starting with that legislation that has actually been proposed and that we have full debate and discussion but no we are told even after the house of representatives earlier this week passed the cut cap and balance act passed it with bipartisan support by the wayno fewer than five members of the democratic caucus in the house of representatives voted to support this that was passed tuesday night we were told later we would be having a vote on saturday or perhaps monday then just a little while ago we were informed by the senate majority leader that the vote would be tomorrow giving us little or no time for actual debate and discussion on the floor of what is still to this moment the only legislation moving through to address this issue this is not an appropriate moment for demagoguery demagoguery on an issue this important can result in a lot of unnecessary pain no one disputes that there could be significant negative economic consequences associated with not raising the debt limit i do not dispute that not for a moment that is exactly why i put my neck on the line in order to file this legislation because nothing else was moving forward i didnt want to do it but when i was sworn in as a senator just a few months ago i understood it was my obligation to do what i could to make things better to make our constitutional system work so i filed it it is an insult not only to me and to my colleagues but to all americans when addressing an issue this important to have so little debate and discussion over this issue i find it appalling i find it reprehensible i demand an explanation and i demand an alternative solution if the senate majority leader is going to pick this apart and say he will not do it moreover i will remind the senate majority leader that just a few short years ago in 2006 when we had a different president belonging to a different party and this body was in control of another party if my memory serves me correctly not only did thensenator barack obama vote against raising the debt limit calling the need to do so the product of a failure of leadership that he was not willing to condone and perpetuate but every single one of his democratic colleagues joined him in that vote not one of them voted to raise the debt limit here we are again approaching the debt limit here we are again with only republicans stepping to the plate and offering a solution only this time the solution is a permanent one unfortunately in 2006 and prior and in subsequent debt limit extension votes there was no serious debate attached to it as to a permanent solution we have to amend the governing document the law of laws the only kind of law that can bind future congresses in order to solve this problem we have to do it now this is part of what it means to be an american we as americans crave liberty and we eschew tyranny to any degree every single time we authorize deficit spending we fuel the unfettered expansion of the federal government and all its power we commit ourselves and our posterity to a future that will include working more and more hours and days and weeks and even months just to pay their federal tax bills every single year that is time they will not get back that is time we will not get back that erodes our individual liberty it also erodes our liberty when the same regulatory structure that exists today grows bigger and bigger every year because we are borrowing now more than 1 5 trillion every single yearnot because of some aberrational condition some unusual development that requires an unusual expenditure of borrowed money but just to cover our basic daytoday operations this is what fuels the perpetual expansion of government and when government expands perpetually our individual liberty is diminished unfortunately and to a corresponding degree this is unacceptable but there is a way home the way home is found in limiting the role of government we can limit the role of government most effectively at this point in time i believe by limiting the pool of money to which congress has access the only way to do that is through a constitutional amendment i wish to close by addressing one final argument that sometimes has been used in response to and against the cut cap and balance act many of its detractors are making the claim that i find extraordinary a claim that says why are you even supporting this because it cant pass it is a little bit akin to saying why do we even play the super bowl when it is expected that one team is going to beat the other team we have to play but this one is not a game this one is for real when we vote after debating and discussing members of this body can and will be held accountable to our constituents so it will be up to me and each of my colleagues in this body to decide how to vote on this issue for those who make the unfortunate decision to vote against this notwithstanding the fact that 75 percent of the american people strongly support the idea of a balanced budget amendment notwithstanding the fact that 66 percent of americansboth of these figures according to a cnn poll todaysupport the principles underlying cut cap and balance notwithstanding the fact that this is the only permanent way of solving our debt problem if members of congress and members of this body choose to vote against this legislation they will do so i believe at their own peril they will have to face their constituents and explain why a handful of them were unwilling to raise the debt limit unwilling to address this problem unwilling to fix the perpetual deficit spending habit of congress simply because they did not want a balanced budget amendment to the constitution i think that is a tall order i think that is difficult to explain i think those who try to make that explanation to their constituents will do so at their own political peril but more importantly the vote they cast will be at the peril of the people of the united states of america of their liberty of their economic stability and of their ability to prosper now and in the future we can turn this ship around but in order do it we need robust debate and discussion and our constituents deserve more the american people deserve more than to have the kind of sleightofhand scheduling and the kind of dismissive cavalier attitude toward what is being characterized correctly by many as the fight of an entire generation we need to pass the cut cap and balance act it is not only the best solution it is the only solution the time is running out and i urge each of my colleagues to support this thank you mr president i yield the floor"], [0.5289743840694427, 0.47102561593055725, 1, "i have known john adler for 20 years he entered the new jersey state senate in january 1992 having been the only democratic candidate to win an open seat that year defeating an incumbent in what was not a strong year for the democratic party his party it was a strong year for my party the republican party and so he came to trenton as a phenomenon he was a very young man he was born in 1959 so he would have been 32 years old when he became a member of the state senate i had been elected to an unexpired term in the general assembly the year before and i served in the 1990s in the general assembly the lower house of our legislature and he served continually in our upper house in our state senate having first been elected in 1991 and then reelected in 1993 1997 2001 2003 and 2007 he rose to a position of prominence in the new jersey senate he eventually chaired the state senate judiciary committee which is an extremely important responsibility in the structure of our government in new jersey and he was always interested in public policy the year before he was elected to the state senate he had run as an underdog in a congressional race and although he did not win that race i think that many took note of his candidacy and i think that propelled him into our state senate i moved from the lower house of the new jersey legislature to the state senate in the election of 2001 when we became direct colleagues and we worked together on many different issues and he always worked in a collegial and extremely competent fashion indeed we sat next to each other for a period of time of our service in the state senate divided only by the center aisle to those who know our state capitol in trenton the state senate chamber is a very small room it was designed originally for 21 members one state senator from each of our 21 counties and when the state senate was increased in population in the 1960s based upon the principle of one person one vote to 40 members it became a place where its really quite overcrowded and so we really sat extremely close to each other in this small chamber of the state senate john adlers career in the legislature was one of distinctionfor example prohibiting smoking in indoor public places and workplaces he also sponsored an act promoting lower vehicle emissions and an antipredatory lending act to protect consumers from unfair credit practices and based on that and many other accomplishments when he came here he was appointed to the financial services committee the committee to which i was appointed as well and so we became colleagues not only here in this chamber the house of representatives the peoples house across the united states but we became colleagues on the financial services committee john was not raised in circumstances of affluence he lost his father when he was a young man and for him and his mother it was a struggle and yet despite that he went to harvard he was graduated from harvard college in 1981 and from harvard law school in 1984 he was an excellent student and at harvard he met the person who became his wife shelley someone whom i know and who is known by my wife heidi and we consider ourselves to be friends with the entire adler family and together john and shelley brought into this world four wonderful sons jeff alex andrew and oliver all of whom i know jeff is at harvard at the moment alex is at cornell and they have two younger brothers and tonight on this sad day the day when johns funeral took place at temple emanuel in cherry hill we remember prayerfully his wife shelley and their beautiful sons jeff alex andrew and oliver in 2008 there were two open seats in the house of representatives in new jersey due to retirements jim saxton in district 3 and mike ferguson in district 7 and john succeeded jim saxton as i had the honor of succeeding mike ferguson so we were the only freshmen in the class of 2008 from new jersey and i think that we shared that bond as of course every member of a freshman class shares a particular and special bond certainly it is exciting for someone to move from a state legislative chamber here to the house of representatives and i think we shared that excitement for example when we went together to the harvard seminar that took place for new members and of course the orientation that takes place here and when we would bump into each other in the hall here during orientation sometimes we thought what were we doing here it was an exciting time for both of us john adler was a person of enormous wit a very dry subtle and sophisticated wit and it really pierced the veil of much of what occurs in public life and in political life where in so many instances we take ourselves too seriously that was not congressman adler he had been involved over the course of his life in many different charitable activities he served on the cherry hill township council before he went to the state legislature the boards of the camden county chapter of the american red cross the food bank of south jersey the virtua west jersey health and hospital foundation and the camden county advisory board on children and certainly his respect for the political process is something that we should all recall especially those of us who had the honor of serving with him in trenton and in washington i believe that those who serve in public life do so out of a sense of responsibility john adler could have made a great fortune in the practice of law given his native intelligence given his academic training and given his ability as a speaker he chose to be involved in public life in cherry hill a great suburban community in camden county in southern new jersey in the state legislature where he was very much involved in making sure that the judges who were appointed to office in new jersey were men and women of ability we have a system in new jersey where our judges are appointed not elected appointed by the governor and confirmed by the state senate and as chairman of the state senate judiciary committee john was intimately involved in that the district he served was an interesting district the only camden county community in the district is his hometown of cherry hill and he served vast portions of neighboring counties burlington county and ocean county and to those who are not familiar with the geography of the state of new jersey places in ocean county are among the most beautiful beaches anywhere not only in this country but in the entire world and i know that he had a commitment to protecting our environment john adlers life was ended by a bacterial infection in his heart at age 51 his father had died in his late 40s also based upon a heart condition so perhaps john adler had a weakened heart but he had a very strong heart in his views on public policy in his views on helping the people whom he represented first in a municipal governing body for many distinguished years in our state senate and in the 111th congress where he was my colleague and my friend and where we too alone were the freshmen from the state of new jersey im pleased to yield to congressman holt"], [0.528814285993576, 0.47118571400642395, 1, "thank you i am going to be joined by my colleagues today and we are going to talk about the financial situation here in the united states and about the meaning of the various ideas and proposals that have been put forward i want to compliment my colleagues on the republican side for their tenacity in putting out their sound bites but i think its very very important for the american people to understand in detail exactly what is being proposed here yesterday we did have what was called the cut cap and balance proposal you might also call it the cut slash and burn proposal because once you get past the sound bites and get into the details of what has actually been proposed youve got to stand back and go whoa wait a minute is that really what a balanced budget amendment is all about were going to go into that in a few moments to really understand exactly what this balanced budget amendment is and the effect that it will have on americans particularly on women in america but before we go there we need to step back a bit and understand how it is that we got into this situation with this deficit of 14 trillion how did we get here its really important to understand that before you go off and try to solve the problem you need to know what is the situation what is the circumstance this little chart here lays out where the deficit came from now understand that at the end of the clinton administration in january 2001 the united states government was running a surplus a 300 billionplus surplus it had run that for the previous 2 years so we had a surplus and we were on the path during the decade 20012010 to literally pay off the entire american debt it would be paid off now whether thats a good idea or not you can debate that but thats what we were on so the trajectory was had we maintained the same policies the same growth in our economy we would have paid off the total debt however something happened now what happened what happened was a change in policies and two wars the iraq and the afghanistan war following the 9 11 event in 2001 and then the iraq war in 2003neither war paid for for the first time in american history neither war was paid forall borrowed money for the first time ever in americas history another thing happened along the way and that is in 2001 the first george w bush tax cut followed in 2003 by the second george w bush tax cut here is what they meant take a careful look at this this is where the deficit started we started here with the bushera tax cuts and then over the years so that in 2019 20 yearswe have this extraordinary growth in the deficit caused by those tax cuts of course it assumes the tax cuts will continue on into 2019 the red area here are the wars again not paid for so the iraq war and the afghanistan war the other thing is this downturn in the economy the downturn in the economy occurred in 2008 how did it happen why did we have that crash of the american economy we had it because the federal government stepped back from regulating the financial institutions allowing them to run wild assuming that they would be smart enough to regulate themselves that didnt happen they were smart enough to be extraordinarily greedy wall street went on a greed binge and the result was the collapse of the financial industry needless to say there are other players in this game many americans hundreds of thousands of americans joined in the game and took out mortgages and bought houses but there was no way they could possibly afford them it was the financial industry the mortgage industry and the wall street bankers and we wound up with the great collapse of 2008 to deal with that the bailout of wall street occurred most of that has now been paid back it worked did it work for the benefit of americans it stabilized the financial institutions and it certainly worked for the benefit of wall street that program occurred in the final months of the george w bush administration unfortunately the american economy has not recovered despite the spending of some 700 billion in the stimulus program it actually worked it didnt work enough to get the economy moving forward so we wound up with this huge deficit going forward the deficit remains in place because the wars continue 178 billion a year spent on the war in afghanistan and iraq also continuing are the george w bush tax cuts this is where the deficit is coming from thirdly the economy has not recovered thats where the deficit is now what do you do about that do you put in place a constitutional amendment that has something really interesting when the american public understands what is in that amendment its not just a balanced budget there are real things in that amendment then that amendment if ever put in place will have extraordinary consequences for americain my view none of them positive a sound bite is great balance the budget force the government to balance the budget just like we do at home hello america do you really balance your budget every month every year i dont think so we take out a mortgage to buy a house thats borrowing money folks thats not balancing your daily budget thats borrowing money and now youve got to pay the mortgage pay the interest when you lose your job or when youre laid off or when youre cut back in hours what do you do you do your best to cut expenses and then you probably are going to borrow more moneymaybe the home equity loan maybe the credit cardto get by we all do that all of us its not so easy to at the end of every year balance the budget fortynine states yes they have balanced budget amendments im from california democrat jerry brown facing a balanced budget amendment guess what he borrows money he doesnt balance the budget ohand his predecessor arnold schwarzeneggerrepublican said he was going to blow up the boxes and balance the budget it happened twice in the 7 years that he was governor that he was able to balance the budget why did this happen why did it happen america ask the question what is in the balanced budget amendment ill tell you whats in it a requirement that a twothirds vote be enacted for every expenditure and every tax increasea twothirds vote this is a fundamental shift in the very nature of american democracy we had a dozen wonderful representatives of the republican party talk for an hour here and not once did they mention that the american democracy will be forever changed no longer majority rule a fundamental tenet of american democracy majority rule pushed aside and now should this ever become law a minority rule onethird of this house onethird of this senate dominating the will of 65 percent of every elected representative and senator the end of the most fundamental tenet of american democracy the end of majority rule it also works in a very pernicious and bad way you can cut taxes with a majority vote it takes a twothirds to raise taxes so years and years ago the oil industry had the opportunity in our democracy to receive a tax reduction they got a tax reduction and the oil industry went on with that tax reduction called a subsidy so that they can explore for oil and gas for a hundred years they have had a tax break now we can give them another tax break but under the balanced budget amendment it would take a twothirds vote to take away the tax reduction the tax break the subsidy that they have received for a hundred years a century would take a twothirds vote to do that because that would be considered to be a tax increase so what does it mean to the oil industry well heres their profits from last year lets see exxon 10 7 billion oxy 1 6 billion conoco 2 1 chevron 6 2 billion bp of gulf fame 7 2 billion thats their profit part of that profit is your tax dollar part of that profit is the tax dollar of every american that has been given to the oil companies for more than a century so that they can go explore for oil is there an american that believes that the oil industry needs our tax dollars to continue to be viable i dont think so but if the constitutional amendment passes becomes part of our constitution a majority of this house and the senate could increase the subsidy but it would take a twothirds vote to get our money back we need to understand the details of what a balanced budget amendment means ive been joined by my wonderful friend and extraordinary representative from the great state of new york representing the hudson river valley in the capital region we had a discussion last night about a piece of this and ive been waiting for you to arrive when we could talk about how the balanced budget amendment and the cuts in the legislation that was passed yesterday would affect women we just had 20 women from the republican party here telling us that we ought to enact a balanced budget amendment what does it mean for women who are 65 and over would you please join us and enter this conversation"], [0.5275878310203552, 0.4724121689796448, 1, "well thank you so much i was in my office doing a lot of work and i couldnt figure who you people were talking about it must be some foreign enemies of the united states that really were not supporting the things that as far as i am concerned it just makes common sense its just a patriotic agenda its just something that if america has given us the opportunity to get to where we are and our parents are where they are it just seems to me that we cannot afford to talk like democrats and republicans were talking about america an america that can be and continues to be a beacon for countries all over the world you mentioned manufactured made in the united states i remember i was on a trade mission in the caribbean and there were some difficulties some members had about whether or not we should give preferential trade to these small countries my contribution was i just walked around everything that was in the places where we were the corn flakes came from the united states the cars came from the united states the lamps came from the united states the furniture came from the united states doing trade with them meant we were encouraging our base to do what we do best and that is to make things so it just seems to me that when we get a flicker of hope coming out of detroitand oh my god detroit when i was a kid after world war ii i really thought i was in heaven to see middle class people with cars and little boats and kids going to college and their parents never dreamed it but they were making things they were making money they were investing in our future and now that theyre coming back i cannot see why any police cars fire cars commuter cars anything how we can say thatwe ought to go to detroit first before we go to tokyo before we go to taiwan and all of these other countries it is the sense in saying that you made an investment in a country that created an atmosphere that makes us all proud to me i like fighting republicans i mean its what the country should be all about and i have been here for four decades it has been exciting and people said well didnt this happen in 1994 no we fought then but we were still friends we didnt have people putting down our country we had different ideas how to reach the same objectives we were concerned about jobs always but also education also health care its inconceivable how anybody republican or democrat can cut programs when if you go into an emergency ward in a hospital they dont ask for your voting card they dont ask whether you are a democrat or a republican if you are laid off and you go home and you have to tell your wife or pull your kids out of school the loss of selfesteem the loss of the security you have the embarrassment that you are going to lose your house nobody asks are you a democrat or republican are you liberal or conservative and it gets contagious as to what happens in one block when a house is foreclosed then it happens in a community and then is happens to america and that is what is happening today it is happening to our country and so it seems to me that when people have campaigned and said that they want to stop spending they want to stop borrowing and they want to raise revenue they want to balance the budget thats not republican thats american but where do you ever get the concept that just stopping spending in certain areas it means that you have savings i mean you can cut someones foot off but still youre going to have a problem with the rest of the economy and if indeed the specialists republicans or democrats economists can tell you that their h r 1 continuing resolution is going to lose 700 000 jobs how in the world could we not debate that how in the world can we not discuss that how can not a group of democrats and republicans say well look we made these campaign promises they were ridiculous we really believe we ought to make sensible cutbacks lets see how we can cut back without causing more economic problems for our country lets see whether or not the environmental problems still are going to continue whether or not health problems are still going to be there and my god education education the united states of america education has been the key to opening the doors for imaginations to capture the entire world and you dont have to have any bad feelings about other people in other countries its just that were so used to being proud as americans were so used to saying that if its made in america it must be better and what were not used to is asking for handouts and what were not used to is having people say that theyre not going to help us with unemployment insurance when we didnt want that we wanted employment and they say no they cant even give us assistance while were waiting for a break right here in america there are so many people who have lost their jobs and do you know john those jobs will never be there for them because productivity technology has closed the opportunity my god they have to be retrained and they reach a certain age where retraining is not even an option 1540 for our young people to go to school or for them to continue to believe in their communities in their families and in their country youve got to have training and education to find out what the demand is going to be it wont be the same demand that we had perhaps when i was a kid or when my parents were kids but there should be great opportunities in the greatest country in the world make no mistake about it we are not broke we are not broke we did not get into this thing in a democrat way or in a republican way people made big big big mistakes but it wasnt the guy working on the job or the guy in the union who made the mistake it wasnt that we overcompensated public employees they didnt cause this deficit it just seems to me john that we shouldnt have to have this debate on this floor people listening ought to recognize that cutting billions of dollars of resources and causing pain to our young people and to our senior citizens is a campaign promise that shouldnt have been made and that certainly shouldnt have been carried through"], [0.5272127091884613, 0.4727872908115387, 1, "i thank the gentlelady for yielding if we are going to talk about how bad the budget situation is now i think it makes sense to explain how we got here first in the early 1990s the budget had gone totally out of whack the first president bush got together with the democratic leadership of the house and senate unfortunately we had to break his pledge on read my lips no new taxes and they came to an agreement and did a little bit to fix the budget in 1993 after president clinton came in we did some serious work about the budget we raised some taxes and got the budget under control in the 1993 budget when you vote on budgets they are tough budgets president bush to a large extent can credit his decision to address the budget with new taxes as part of the reason for his defeat and when the democrats without a single republican vote in the house and not a single republican vote in the senate passed the 1993 budget 50 democrats lost their seats it was a tough vote you lose your seats when you have very serious deficit reduction but as a result of that 1993 budget we not only balanced the budget in just a few short years but we went into significant surplus and created a record number of jobs the dow jones industrial average almost quadrupled in 1995 when the republicans got in control by demagoguing the votes that we cast fixing the budget they came in and tried to undermine everything in the entire budget president clinton let the government get shut down rather than sign those irresponsible budgets that the republicans passed as a result of his tenacity and holding on to his original plan the budget was balanced in a few short years now there are some in congress who talk about the historic balanced budget amendment in the mid90s well if they hadnt come to such agreement the balance would have balanced itself we didnt know when we voted on that as a matter of fact whether the budget had already gone into surplus they hadnt finished counting the money it went from a 290 deficit we got down to 10 billion and the agreement slowed down the progress a little bit but we still went into surplus in 2001 chairman greenspan was answering questions like whats going to happen when we pay off the entire national debt held by the public whats going to happen to interest rates whats going to happen to the bond market when there are no government bonds how do you calculate investment strategy when you dont have government bonds setting the norisk limit and you have increased rate of return after that how do you calculate investment strategies if there are no government bonds because you have paid them all off by 2008 it was projected we would owe no money to china japan and saudi arabia we would have paid off our entire national debt so people are thinking this is hard we had done it in 2001 by august of 2001 after the first round of tax cuts we had already gone broke instead of the surplus social security surplus they were talking about the lock box put that away for social security medicare surplus put that in the lock box for medicare we had a surplus over that by august of president bushs first year we had gone through all of the surplus and we were into social security and medicare by august you cannot blame september 11 for the fact that we had already gone broke a month before and so after two tax cuts not paid for after prescription drug benefit not paid for a couple of wars not paid for we are in the ditch now during the clinton administration we had paygo you wanted to spend some more money you had to come up with the money to pay for it you wanted to cut taxes you had to cut some programs you had to pay for it everything you did you had to pay for it when president bush came in they did away with paygo and put us in the ditch now were so far in the ditch that most experts suggest we need 4 trillion in deficit reduction to get back to a point where we are fiscally responsible about 4 trillion the simpsonbowles committee came up with one plan with a lot of this and a little of that 4 trillion but there is one interesting thing that you could do to come up with almost 4 trillion let all of the bush tax cuts expire done that is all you have to do as a matter of fact in the congressional black caucus budget this year we started off with that premise let them all expire but we wanted to extend some and so we paid for them we cut the oil loopholes and extended some and we cut some other loopholes and added this tax and cut this we got to a point where we could extend a lot of the tax cuts because we paid for them if you want to know what deficit reduction looks like without revenue you can look at the continuing resolution earlier this year it started out at 66 billion which annualized was about a hundred billion and 10 years that would be about a trillion if you look at what was in that first trillion dollars that they wanted to cut it was so bad that they couldnt get it passed they ended up having to compromise we had cuts in the safety net like community health centers cuts in energy assistance for lowincome seniors cuts in community action agencies and we had cuts in investments in the future head start pell grants got cut scientific research and nasa all got cut and then just perfunctory parts of government fbi agents got cut were sitting up in the judiciary committee trying to figure out how to deal with many of the problems weve got and half of it is we dont need new criminal laws we need new fbi agents to investigate the cases fbi agents were cut 4 000 fewer clean water grants environmental protection all cut air traffic controllers there are so few theyre working so hard that theyre falling asleep on the job they were cut the next round of cuts would be obviously medicare and housing and other programs were next on the chopping block we could not getthey could not get that passed as a matter of fact by the time they finished now theyre going to a program suggesting that we need to cut not 1 trillion but 2 trillion or 3 trillion if you couldnt get the first trillion passed because youre so deep into the things that people believe in things thatclean water grants food inspectors there are so few food inspectors in that budget that some meatpacking plants would have to close because they are obligated to have a federal meat inspector on site and if you cant be on site you cant operate they had so few meat inspectors that they anticipated many of the companies would have to close down or at least close temporarily because there were so few now theyre trying to figure out how you can do 2 trillion or 3 trillion worth of cuts they came up with this idea of the debt ceiling the debt ceiling is something that recognizes the fact that weve already spent the money so you raise the debt ceiling not because youre spending any money but because you have already spent the money its a perfunctory kind of thing dozens of times almost once a year over the last 50 years weve had to increase the debt ceiling democrats and republicans all have had to vote for the debt ceiling the charade about the thing is usually the majority party has to cast the tough votes and the minority party gets to talk about fiscal irresponsibility and grandstand a little bit but its never in the context that theres any question about whether the debt ceiling is going to be increased speeches are made but its in the context its going to pass and you can make a speech about it now theyre saying maybe we wont increase the debt ceiling nobody knows what would happen if the debt ceiling were not increased if we defaulted on our bonds if we didnt send out social security checks nobody knows what would happenwhat would happen to the investments what would happen to the interest rates we had a temporary technical glitch a few years ago where checks were a day or twocouple of days late going out and they calculate that as a result of that little glitch we paid about half a percent higher interest rate for many years now a 1 percent interest rate on the national debt now is about in the range of 100 billion so if youre looking at what would happen if you defaulted on the debt and people charged more interest well thats the order of magnitude that we would be talking about we shouldnt have to even discuss what would happen if because it could be anything and who would want to find out we ought to just go ahead and increase the debt ceiling and not use it as a threat that unless you do this well blow up the economy i would hope that our leadership would not capitulate to those kind of threats because if you capitulate this time in october they can shut down october by not passing appropriations bills dont get my way or the highway to close down the government in a year or so you would have to do the debt ceiling again same thing so if you capitulate to these kinds of childish threats there will be no end to it and you will certainly invite them back as a matter of fact what is going on now is theyre kind of slowwalking us through some cuts that never could have been made in the normal legislative process last year in december we extended the bush tax cuts that cost 400 billion a year now were broke and we need to come up with about 400 billion a year as if we had forgotten what we did last december now when we extended those tax cuts theres no mention of how it would be paid for it would have been nice to know what the plan was whether were going to have to cut social security or medicare in order to afford the tax cuts that were extended in december now theyre going to try to get some cuts that they couldnt otherwise get if youre making rational choices and legislative process is about choices if you want a program you ought to pay for it if youre willing to pay the taxes then you can have your program not willing to pay the taxes cant have your program last year we passed health care reform it cost a trillion dollars we raised more than a trillion dollars in taxes thats a balanced approach if we didnt want to pay the taxes we couldnt have the program and so thats the balanced approach that were not making as we go along now because the next step in this process will be not cuts but caps no program will be cut if any deal comes on these 2 trillion or 3 trillion deals come back not a single program will be cut there will just be caps three months from now when you try to appropriate under those caps youll wonder why you cant afford head start why you cant afford any food inspectors why you cant afford any fbi agents because the caps are so low if you put them all together if you had made your choices if you had known you were going to have to cut head start and fbi agents and clean water grants when you cut taxes maybe you wouldnt have cut the taxes you should have made the choices all at once"], [0.5260590016841888, 0.47394099831581116, 1, "we have one or two more fallen heroes that we want to

class jonathan villanueva who was killed at the same time as staff sergeant matthew hermanson but i wanted to take a minute to talk about master sergeant tara brown she was born july 21 1977 she began her military career in 1997 at the kadena air force base in japan as an administrative clerk quickly mastering her skills in communications and embracing a love of travel and adventure master sergeant brown completed assignments to germany turkey alaska and korea before taking charge in numerous highlevel communications positions at andrews air force base right down the street master sergeant browns awards include the bronze star posthumously joint service commendation medal air force commendation medal with three oakleaf clusters and the air force achievement medal with three oakleaf clusters she is survived by her husband ernest brown father jim jacobs mother gladys verren brother jim jacobs jr and sister laguanda jacobs i will tell you that during this service and when they talked about master sergeant brown they talked about her smile they talked about her status as a newlywed but more than anything they just talked about her love of service and the fact that she was willing to give it all so i wanted to make sure that as we continued we included master sergeant tara brown in our ceremony today just to make sure that we dont forget any of our troops that we had the privilege and the opportunity to participate in their service and on their day i think that all of my colleagues and i dont see them now but i think all of my colleagues have exhausted their time in making sure that they honor all of our fallen soldiers this was just one thing that we thought we wanted to do to show the country that although we disagree on 20 or 30 percent of things in this body and those 20 or 30 percent may be very gutwrenching and they may be very divisive and we may differ on how we cut programs but every difference in principle is not necessarily a difference in purpose and a difference in our ultimate goal and that is to make sure that this country continues to be the best country on earth so we as just a small part of this august body and one that we are honored to be a part of we are honored to serve with so many senior members who have taken us under their wing to make sure they nurture us we cant thank you enough for that and we cant thank congress and the american people enough for giving us the opportunity to go over to the conflict to watch afghans as they start to patrol their own area i will tell you i am not sure if congressman shuster touched on it but we had an opportunity to patrol with a group of afghans and their elders one of the elders that was over there was a very elderly man who was the commander of this police unit and they were protecting the entrance into this city and they had their checkpoint while walking to the checkpoint we saw a young man holding arms and protecting us as we walked and we stopped to talk to him then they pointed out to us he lost his father and brother in a firefight just a week and a half ago while they were out patrolling then as we talked to him just for a few minutes longer he talked to us about the vision of freedom and he was all excited and his eyes were open very wide as he talked about why he was still patrolling after his father and his brothers funeral which was the fact that he had a love for his country for afghanistan but also because he felt an obligation because we had so many troops out there fighting and dying that we were joined at the hip because this was a very important goal and it is not just to bring freedom to us it is to bring freedom to people all across this world then as he was telling us that he told us that just a couple of days before we got there that his daughter drowned in a creek in their little village so we are talking about a very young man who had tragedy three times in his life who was still out there with his machine gun in the desert in the heat patrolling to make sure that this congressional delegation was safe but also taking the time and we watched him talk to school kids and other things but that is what makes this country great and the thing that united us all was the fact that what makes this country great we are inspiring other people so that they want to make their country and their town and their village great just like america so you have people all across this world and we can talk particularly about afghanistan because that is where we saw it that were going above and beyond because they appreciated our effort to help them and they were committed to helping themselves and they said we are in it with you and we are going to sacrifice our life and our limbs just as those brave men and women in the united states are doing i want to thank you for allowing us to have this time to talk about the people we lost and i will just end with reading their names because i think that we cant

so i have a different opinion i think if you invest money you get innovation and you get jobs and none of what has been said by speaker boehner says anything about innovation jobs and he has no seemingly understanding of the importance of securing the homeland i am joined this evening by members of the congressional black caucus to call upon congress to pass a bill that increases the debt ceiling so that we can avoid economic disaster and continue to work for the american people in repairing our economy and creating jobs while i support bipartisan efforts to increase the debt limit and to resolve our differences over budgetary revenue and spending issues i cannot support any measure that unduly constrains the ability of congress to deal effectively with americas economic fiscal and job creation troubles since the debt limit was first put in place congress has increased it over 100 times in fact it was raised 10 times within the past decade congress last came together and raised the debt ceiling in february 2010 today the debt ceiling currently stands at 14 3 trillion in reality that limit has already been eclipsed but due to accounting procedures by treasury secretary geithner the debt limit can be avoided until august 2nd congress must act now in order to avert a crisis never in the history of america has the united states defaulted on its debt obligations we must be clear on what this issue means for our country united states treasury bonds have traditionally been one of the safest investments another country or investor could make for foreign nations and investors purchasing a unitedstates treasury bond meant that they held something virtually as safe as cash backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government as we continue to discuss the necessity of increasing out debt ceiling i have heard the concerns of many of my constituents and the american people regarding the size of our national debt and the care with which taxpayer money is spent i too am concerned about these issues for to burden future generations of americans with tremendous amounts of debt should not be a way to avoid our fiscal responsibilities to the american people however the task of resolving our debt ceiling crisis must take precedence over other concerns including political ideology prior to the existence of the debt ceiling congress had to approve borrowing each time the federal government wished to borrow money in order to carry out its functions with the onset of world war i more flexibility was needed to expand the governments capability to borrow money expeditiously in order to meet the rapidly changing requirements of funding a major war in the modern era to address this need the first debt ceiling was established in 1917 allowing the federal government to borrow money to meet its obligations without prior congressional approval so long as in the aggregate the amount borrowed did not eclipse a specified limit in turn with the proceeds from the bonds the federal government of the worlds largest economy is able to finance its operations if the united states defaults on its debt obligations the financial crisis that began in 2008 would pale in comparison according to economic experts the ensuing economic catastrophe would not only place the unitedstates economy in a tailspin but the world economy as well the fact that congress a body that typically has its fair share of political battles has never played political chicken when it came to raising the debt ceiling should give us all pause and is a testament to the seriousness with which we must approach this issue however this time around some of my republican colleagues have created an impasse based upon an ideological commitment to spending cuts while i understand and share the concern of my republican colleagues with respect to deficit spending and will continue to work with them in order to find reductions now is not the time to put ideology over pragmatism the reality is that on august 3rd the united states will begin to default on its debt obligations if the debt ceiling is not raised this detour into a spending debate is as unnecessary as it is perilous as increasing the debt ceiling does not obligate the undertaking of any new spending by the federal government rather raising the debt limit simply allows the government to pay existing legal obligations promised to debt holders that were already agreed to by presidents and congresses both past and present raising the debt limit simply matches the amount the united states is allowed to borrow to the amount it already owes moreover the impending crisis would have already occurred were it not for the extraordinary measures taken by treasury secretary timothy geithner including the suspension of the investment in securities to finance the civil service retirement and disability fund as well as the redemption of a portion of those securities already held by that fund if the united states defaults on its obligations on august 3rd the stock market will react violently to the news that for the first time in history america is unable to keep its promises to pay not once in american history has the countrys full faith and credit been called into question credit rating agencies like moodys and standard poors stand ready to downgrade the triple a rating that america currently enjoys once america defaults investors who purchase unitedstates bonds and finance our government will be less likely to lend to america in the future just as a person who defaults on a loan will find it harder to convince banks to lend them money in the future a country that defaults on its debt obligations will find it harder to convince investors to lend money to a government that did not pay them back showing the world that the united states does not pay its debts makes the purchasing of that debt less desirable because it requires the assumption of more risk on the part of the investors furthermore any investors who continue to purchase unitedstates treasury bonds will demand much higher interest rates in order to cover the increased risk once a default occurs investors figure that the chance of the united states defaulting again is much greater and will require the government to pay higher rates of interest in order to make the loan worth the risk for investors to take on imagine the impact on our stock market if we do not pay our debts as we have seen throughout the recent financial crisis a bad stock market hurts not only big businesses and large investors on wall street but small businesses and small investors as well families with investments tied to the stock market such as 401 k s pension plans and savings will once again see the value of their investments drop the american people are tired of the uncertainty of the value of their retirement accounts with uncertainty still lingering in the markets and in the minds of citizens we must not allow another wild fluctuation in the markets to occur due to default one of the major reasons that the job market continues to remain so stagnant is the fact that the flow of credit to small businesses that enables them to hire and expand has slowed increasing the debt ceiling is the responsible thing to do congress has already debated and approved the debt that an increased ceiling makes room for however my republican colleagues have chosen to use this as an opportunity to hold the american people hostage to their extreme agenda they knew that the cut cap and balance act was not a realistic proposal and that it was not going to pass the senate they just wanted to waste time along with the congressional black caucus i believe that congress should increase the debt ceiling to meet the obligations the united states has already promised to undertake by refusing to do so it endangers our economy and the recovery of our jobs last week republicans introduced the cut cap and balance act which i aptly named the tap dance loser club and bust bill because it tap danced around raising our debt ceiling and acting in a responsible manner to pay our nations debt obligations that bill would have forced our nation to join a losers club as it would have eliminated important social programs such as medicaid medicare social security and pell grants the theme for the republicans seems to be a focus on cutting programs for the most at need and ignoring the need to focus on job creation this bill busts the hopes and dreams of our children seniors and military families it busts the hopes to grow our nation in the future the tap dance loser club and bust bill was just a distraction and now we have the opportunity to once again get serious about raising our debt we can not continue to waste a tremendous amount of time the deadline is right around the corner the american people cannot have a government that is the embodiment of living check to check we must do something now for a moment think about the american people step back and envision the faces of those who will be impacted if we are not successful in finding common ground they are the faces of the the elderly who will not receive their social security payments they are the faces of children and infants who will not receive their wic benefits they are the faces of hardworking every day americans including the multitudes of poor working families who will not be able to receive the benefits they need from government run programs that are keeping them from falling into homelessness when you think of our future also see our present without raising this debt limit we are putting the present and the future of americans at risk"], [0.524838000535965, 0.47516199946403503, 1, "i thank the vice chair of the cbc and to follow congressman g k butterfield who i think hit on all of the proper and necessary areas of concerns it has been written that ours will be the last generation in this country to experience surpassing the previous generation that our children will not achieve what we have achieved and the jobs are not there and while the individuals who have written about this and presented research on it are certainly brilliant and wise i will gently rebuke them and disagree with their prediction i am not in any way willing to accept the fact the fatalism that the united states will inevitably fall to number two in the world behind china yesterday there was a news story that said at best there will be two superpowers equal in terms of influence and their economies china and the united states this nation that placed men on the moon this nation that creates a new technology almost hourly should never surrender its place in the world to any other nation and further i dont think that it is in our best interest to even give a hint that we believe that we cant continue to create jobs for the next generation the jobs tour that we had during the month of august was eyeopening and earthshattering when we walked from our cars inside the cleveland state university place where we held the jobs fair there were people who had been in line since 5 that morning and so it always troubles me to hear people say and say baselessly well you know some people dont want to work so 5 in the morning standing in line and at best of the 5 000 or 6 000 people who were there we only had about 2 000 jobs but people stood patiently in line one of the things that happened that i think some of you may already know about who are in the cbc an anglo gentleman and there were people from every race in every city but this particular gentleman caught my attention because he said look i listen to black radio he said i just like r b and i heard about the jobs fair and i thought id come over since im unemployed and he said is it all right and of course our position is has been and shall always be one of including everybody particularly in a time of crisis but even if were not that is what we would want and so he remained in line im not sure what happened whether he was one of the successful applicants or not the point i want to make is that the pain that is being experienced in this nation is not just being experienced by african americans it is true that our numbers are higher but our numbers are higher for a variety of reasons number one african americans historically have tried or sought employment in government one of the reasons washington d c is predominantly black is because african americans from the south came to washington by the tens of thousands because it was believed that if you could get to the capital of the united states you would experience far less bigotry and discrimination and so by the thousands they came to washington the same thing holds true with government african americans have sought employment with state local and the federal government so every time people read in the paper or cheer that some state laid off 200 or 300 people they need to understand that those are 200 or 300 real human beings and chances are also great that they are disproportionately minority so that is one of the reasons why our numbers are swelling like they are but also i think we have got to realize that there are some other factors through no fault of people who are unemployed i served as mayor of kansas city missouri from 1991 until 1999 two terms 8 years one of the things we always had to fight was expanding urban sprawl is what it is called sociologically kansas city is a city that stretches 322 square miles to show you how large that is you can place the entire city of san francisco inside the city limits of kansas city 30 times or the city of washington i think it is like 42 times it is a huge city now while many politicians brag about that the truth of the matter is we stretched out our resources one of the things i learned during the jobs fairswe started out in cleveland went to detroit left detroit and went to atlanta left atlanta and went to miami left miami and went to los angelesand there is one thing that was present at all of those that this congress needs to deal with and it is this the jobs that were brought to our fairs were not new jobs the truth of the matter is they were jobs that already existed except they were in the suburbs and so as the cities have expanded the jobs have moved to the suburbs and so we cannot speak of creating jobs without dealing with the issue of transportation theres an inextricable connection between jobs and transportation how do you get people in the highest unemployment areas to the areas where the jobs are for those who live on the eastern seaboard you have a little better situation because you have as we do in washington the metro but when you start moving toward the western part of the united states or the caribbean there is no mass transportation that is as effective as it is on the east coast therefore if jobs are in suburban kansas city and people who live in the urban area are unemployed and do not have a car and do not have any way of getting to the jobs there is no way they can get there remember kansas city is a city of 322 square miles which means that people could need to go essentially 30 40 50 miles to get a job now let me also say that nothing has been discussed thus far dealing with transportation the jobs bill is seeking to have what i think most of us would support which would be some kind of transportation bank where it would end up that the government would put money in and hopefully the private sector would come in and we would be able to get these infrastructure jobs going but the amount of money that is being discussed is woefully inadequate and theres probably little chance that were going to be able to create any new mass transit programs in the country in fact umta the urban mass transit administration is broke virtually broke so theres very little in the way of help coming forth now theres some politics involved and were all in the political environment and the people at home may not even understand whats going on tragically i have watched our country move to a state where people are constantly angry theyre being told to hate their government and then both sides of the aisle use inappropriate language to discuss things with the other side of the aisle its continuing to ratchet up and its getting worse and worse and the people around the country are not only participating in it they are encouraging it this is the united states of america my hope and my dream is that this nation will be around for my children and my grandchildren but im telling you that what our children are seeing is not a pleasant sight because they are looking at a nation that is becoming more and more divided you cant look at television or radio without this constant attack attack attack and its just sickening to see this as were moving into an election cycle were going to see thermal nuclear campaigns and the american public needs to come to grips with the fact that if people will run a nasty campaign where all they do is attack chances are when they come to congress theyre going to do the same thing and the more we bring people in here who come for the sole purpose of fighting against the other side the less business were going to take care of for the people of this country i said last week there are some people whod like to defeat the president of the united states fine campaign against him get your spouse your children your grandchildren your friends and everybody vote against him if you can vote twice vote twice do everything you can to defeat the president but right now vote for the american public fight him later vote now for the american public and the american public is in trouble weve got to create opportunities for jobs to grow and develop or were going to find ourselves faced with a new normal a new normal where unemployment is considered normal at 8 percent rather than 3 5 percent which is what our predecessors decided that were going to keep unemployment at 3 5 percent so we cant allow this to happen i think weve got to fight against it but more than that what weve got to do is quit fighting each other nothing is going to happen worth anything if were fighting each other"]], "top_unsure": [[0.00041943788528442383, 0.4995805621147156, 0, "paris s pough of columbus ga

bring down premiums the congressional budget office cbo says that whether premiums would increase or decrease as a result of this legislation is difficult to determine but in either case the magnitude of the effect is likely to be quite small the effects of the repeal of this exemption will be small the cbo says state laws already bar the activities that would be prohibited under federal law if this bill was enacted every states insurance regulations ban anticompetitive activities like bid rigging price fixing and market allocation every state has insurance regulators who already actively enforce these prohibitions this amendment like the bill we considered 2 years ago will have no meaningful impact and may have minor negative unintended consequences but i will once again reluctantly support this measure because this amendment takes important steps to limit its unintended consequences and to reaffirm the mccarranferguson exemption for nonhealth lines of insurance this amendment contains language that clearly limits its application to the business of health insurance while the repeal of the mccarranferguson exemption for health insurance does essentially nothing repealing it for other types of insurance could be disastrous one of the main benefits of the mccarranferguson exemption is that it allows insurance companies subject to state regulation to share historical and actuarial data the antitrust laws generally frown on competitors that share data but in the insurance market sharing data improves competition this is because a shared pool of data about the risks and loss rates of various kinds of insurance allows small and mediumsized insurers to enter the market and compete if insurance companies did not pool data only the largest insurers would have access to enough data to account for risk and price their policies for a number of reasons which include the size of most health plans the availability of health care data from various public and private sources and the relative predictability of health care costs health insurers rely much less on sharing data than other insurers this amendment contains a clear definition that limits its application to the business of health insurance it clarifies that the mccarranferguson exemption continues to apply to life insurance annuities property and casualty insurance and other nonhealth types of insurance it is an improvement over other proposals that are not so limited defined and clear about their intent this amendment also prevents private class action antitrust lawsuits against health insurers this limits the possible unintended negative effects because this amendment is much improved in ways that will limit its unintended consequences and because it reaffirms the importance of the mccarranferguson exemption to nonhealth lines of insurance i support the amendment the acting chair the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from arizona"], [0.000478893518447876,

finding out whats in this bill in the last 2 years weve had 47 committee hearings in six different committees weve taken 25 floor votes to repeal defund or dismantle harmful elements of this massive 1 trillion 2 000page government takeover of our nations health care system were finding out whats in this bill weve already repealed the 1099 requirement with bipartisan support weve already repealed the class act with bipartisan support now were awaiting the supreme courts decision on whether the individual mandate is constitutional i think the public is now beginning to learn a little bit about this bill themselves i think they know there is a 3 8 percent tax on small businesses our job creators theres another 2 3 percent tax on medical deviceswheelchairs for our seniors hearing aids for our disabled folks these are things that are in this bill theres a 40 percent tax on your health care plans now they keep telling us too that if you like your health care plan you can keep it well president obama himself said you know there may have been some language snuck into this bill that runs contrary to that premise who do we believe here what do we believe here we are again one more thing to add to the list of what were finding out ipab the independent payment advisory board this unelected board makes decisions and gives recommendations to congress for cutting medicare payments so this panel of unelected bureaucrats unilaterally decides what kind of care is now available and allowable to our seniors to our veterans and to our americans with disabilitiesnot doctors not nurses not anybody who has medical or scientific training these are bureaucrats just what we need more bureaucrats if we dont vote to repeal this provision a gang of 15 unelected bureaucrats will have the ability to cause cuts to medicare payments without anyone elses input the acting chair the time of the gentleman has expired"], [0.000478893518447876, 0.4995211064815521, 0, "3 years ago president obama promised congress that the american people would have 6 percent unemployment in exchange for trillions of taxpayer dollars to pump into the economy today we know that the stimulus program was mismanaged illconceived and failed to create the jobs promised by the president for 38 straight months and counting the unemployment rate has remained above 8 percent the american people realize something that my democrat friends dont seem to understand that government cannot create jobs and shouldnt be in the business of handing out jobs in 2010 the american people sent me and many of my colleagues to washington to cut government spending and offer real solutions to job creation we have been aggressively fighting to achieve that challenge our country needs commonsense progrowth policies that will help small business regain their confidence when business owners have faith that the government will not raise their taxes impose new unnecessary regulations and pick winners and losers in the marketplace theyll invest more when they invest more the company grows and the opportunity for american jobs grows with it just last week we saw a very clear picture of the different visions for job creation held by folks in washington my friends in the senate voted on but thankfully failed to pass the buffett rule the act would impose a tax hike on one class of americans and would pay for approximately 11 hours of government functioning talk about a cynical ruse serving only to divide our country for political purposes but while my democrat colleagues in the senate are working to raise taxes on americans and americas job creators the house is trying to lower them last week we passed a small business tax cut which will give businesses with fewer than 500 employees a 20 percent tax reduction off their active business income and encourage the creation of more jobs for our citizens data shows that 7 out of every 10 jobs in this country are created by companies with fewer than 500 employees my republican colleagues and i truly believe that small businesses are the backbone of our countrys economy and their success is vital to our economic recovery we continue to act proactively and as reflected in the 27 jobcreating measures passed by the house this congress alone to ensure job providers are able to create innovate and lead we hope our friends in the senate and white house will decide to join us as we say yes to american jobs for american people"], [0.000478893518447876, 0.4995211064815521, 0, "40 years from now a beloved high school history teacher at tahoe high school named garrett fant should be celebrating his retirement surrounded by generations of his students and his children and grandchildren they would have all told affectionate stories about how mr fant inspired them or helped them and wished him a happy and welldeserved retirement unfortunately history has willed a different story army specialist garrett fant instead returned to lake tahoe last week as a fallen hero at the age of 21 this young man sacrificed all those years all those memories all those pleasuresand all that lifein the service of his country he loved the army and he had a plan for his lifehed serve his country as a soldier for 20 years and then he would come and serve his community as a high school history teacher from everything ive learned about garrett fant he would have made a great history teacher his mother told a reporter his thought was that high school was the last stop for kids and he wanted to influence people hed have made a great family man his older brother remembers looking up to garrett as if garrett were the older brother knowing full well the dangers that surrounded him in afghanistan his foremost attention went to reassuring his family that he was safe and secure his mother said he always tried to protect me from the dangers of being over there he was just someone that if you were his family or his friendsor his countryhe gave you his all and loved you with everything above all garrett fant wanted to be a soldier his brother tried to get him to enlist with him in the navy but garrett would have none of that he was all army and had known from the time he was a little boy thats what he most wanted to do on facebook he listed his occupation as grunt telling his friends you cant spell infantry without fant he was the top marksman in his class of 1 000 i wish id known him i wish my grandchildren might one day have been his high school history students instead army specialist garrett fant takes his place in history among nine generations of american heroes who sacrificed all those precious years to protect those who couldnt protect themselves to stand up to the bullies of the world to proclaim liberty throughout all the land and unto all the inhabitants thereof in his farewell address at west point general douglas macarthur turned his attention to fallen heroes like army specialist garrett fant and with searing insight he observed their story is known to all of you it is the story of the american man at arms my estimate of him was formed on the battlefields many many years ago and has never changed i regarded him then as i regard him now as one of the worlds noblest figures not only as one of the finest military characters but also as one of the most stainless his name and fame are the birthright of every american citizen in his youth and strength his love and loyalty he gave all that mortality can give he needs no eulogy from me or any other man and macarthur goes on to say but when i think of his patience under adversity of his courage under fire and his modesty in victory i am filled with an emotion of admiration i cannot put into words he belongs to history as furnishing one of the greatest examples of successful patriotism he belongs to posterity as the instructor of future generations in the principles of liberty and freedom and so garrett fant became a teacher after all as shakespeare said this story shall the good man teach his son succeeding generations of students at south lake tahoe high school and also at valley oak high school in american canyon which garrett also attended will know his story every memorial day in his hometown his name will be read with a special pride that his friends and neighbors will share strangers will pass by his honored grave adorned with flags and flowers and theyll note the few years he had and the sacrifice he made and be humbled by it and perhaps inspired by it to become better citizens no history teacher can do more than that to his grieving family on behalf of a grateful nation i can only say that you do not mourn alone your pride in garrett is shared by your community by your country and by many many history teachers who will tell his story to the latest american generation"]]}
