"i would like to commend my friend and colleague the gentlewoman from california for organizing tonights special order on the hiv aids crisis in africa and for her general leadership on this issue the gentlewoman from california is providing the kind of leadership that has caused this congress to finally focus on this crisis and on this epidemic she is a member of congress that served on the staff of one of the most esteemed members of congress who is now retired congressman ronald dellums and congressman dellums decided earlier this year that he was going to give priority time to this issue even though he is away from congress working in the private sector in the health care industry he decided that this is the most important issue confronting the world today so he uses most of his time now not only speaking with members of congress the president of the united states health organizations pharmaceutical companies the ustr he has just about spoken with everyone imaginable that has the power to do anything about this issue so as a result of the efforts of the gentlewoman from california working along with congressman dellums and the rest of us we are finally i think being heard on this issue i would like to commend president bill clinton for recognizing the importance of united states support for international hiv aids treatment and prevention programs earlier this year the president requested an additional 100 million in funding for international hiv aids treatment and prevention programs these funds would be in addition to the 225 million that the united states is currently spending on these programs the impact of the hiv aids epidemic on subsaharan africa has been especially severe since the beginning of the epidemic over 80 percent of all aids deaths have occurred in subsaharan africa by the end of 1999 there were an estimated 23 3 million people in subsaharan africa living with hiv aids that is 70 percent of the total number of hivinfected people worldwide in subsaharan africa there are over 5 000 aidsrelated funerals per day hiv aids treatment and prevention efforts in subsaharin africa are complicated by poverty most africans lack access to the most basic health care services and only the wealthiest people in africa can afford hiv aids medications and advancements in treatment therapies furthermore high illiteracy rates combined with low levels of education funding have made prevention efforts more difficult nevertheless experience has proven that hiv aidsprevention programs can make a substantial difference if the programs are funded sufficiently and implemented in an effective manner uganda in particular has implemented a highly successful program which has reduced hiv aids infection rates by over 50 percent i happen to have been in uganda when i was on one of my trips to africa with the president when he was there i had an opportunity to visit the clinics and to talk with people and to understand how seriously they had taken this whole epidemic and how they were moving forward and providing leadership on the continent and it is working and it shows senegal has also developed a successful hiv aids prevention program however effective hiv aids treatment and prevention programs cannot be expanded or implemented in other countries without substantial financial assistance from the international community h r 3519 the world bank aids marshall plan trust fund act was passed by the committee on banking and financial services on march 15 of this year by a bipartisan majority thanks to the leadership of the gentlewoman from california and to our chairman the gen tleman from iowa this legislation would direct the secretary of the treasury to enter into negotiations with the world bank for the creation of a world bank aids trust fund to provide grants to support hiv aids treatment and prevention programs in less developed countries and i am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill now during the committee on banking and financial services consideration of h r 3519 i offered an amendment to the bill that increased the amount of funds authorized to be appropriated for payment to the world bank aids trust fund from 100 million to 200 million per year while 200 million is still only a small fraction of what is needed for hiv aids programs it would represent a significant commitment of financial resources by the united states and set an example for the international community i know that at the time that i offered the amendment our chairman was a little bit worried because this is a difficult issue and at a time where we have competing interests and we have lots of needs here in this country it is very difficult sometimes to get our congress focused on a crisis like this someplace else however i feel that the crisis is of such proportions that we must be aggressive and we must be bold and i still think 200 million is but a drop in the bucket i am worried now iam worried that when this bill is on the floor in a few days that there will be an effort to reduce the amount back to 100 million because of the fear that it will not be passed if it is more than 100 million i would like to encourage support from my colleagues to keep the amount at 200 million let us not go backwards let us move forward and let us stand up for what is right i hope that the recent report that was put out by the cia and others and the work that has been done now by the national security council identifying aids as a world threat to peace will help our people to understand that we cannot retreat we must move forward we cannot reduce the amount in this bill from 100 million to 200 million i also offered another amendment that would allow the world bank trust fund to provide technical assistance to countries to assist them in building the capacity to implement effective hiv aids treatment and prevention programs i am pleased to report that both of my amendments were passed by the committee on banking and financial services the rest of the world does look to us for leadership and i think there is one other area that we have got to be profoundy supportive of i would just like to give a little background on that if i may most hiv aids drug therapies are well beyond the reach as i said of all but the wealthiest elites in subsaharan africa drug therapies that have extended the lives of people living with hiv aids in the united states and other developed countries would cost between 4 000 to 20 000 per person per year in subsaharan africa however the gross national product per capita in subsaharan africa is only 503 per year if south africa is excluded the gnp per capita is only 308 per year furthermore according to the world bank no subsaharan african countries spent more than 400 per person per year on health care between 1990 and 1995 the agreement on traderelated aspects of intellectual property rights known as trips is one of the international agreements enforced by the world trade organization the trips agreement allows corporations to benefit from patents over plants and medicines corporations use their patent rights to force developing countries to pay for the use of plants and medicines in some cases these plants and medicines were developed by indigenous people in developing countries who have been using them for hundreds of years as a result of the trips agreement many people in developing countries have been denied lifesaving medicines because they cannot afford to pay for them in 1997 the south african government passed a law to make hiv aids drugs more affordable and available for its people this law allows the importation of commercial drugs from sources other than the manufacturers a practice called parallel importing and authorizes the south african government to license local companies to manufacture generic drugs a practice called compulsory licensing the unitedstates pharmaceutical industry opposed this law and our own united states trade representative attempted to pressure south africa not to implement it fortunately ustr has recently announced in december of 1999 that it would be more flexible in its policies towards south africas situation the amendment that i would love to have had passed in my committee would have required the united states government to encourage subsaharan african countries to develop policies to make hiv aids medications available to their populations at affordable prices it would also require the united states government to encourage pharmaceutical companies to make hiv aids medications available to the populations of these countries at affordable prices more importantly this amendment would direct the united states representative to the wto to encourage the world trade organization to exempt subsaharan african countries from the trips agreement and other international agreements that prohibit them from implementing laws that make hiv aids medications available to their populations at affordable prices this would allow countries such as south africa to enact legislation to expand the availability and affordability of hiv aids medicines without worrying about wto challenges to their laws access to affordable medicine is essential for subsaharan africans living with hiv aids it should be the policy of the united states and the wto to encourage policies that increase the availability and affordability of hiv aids medicines in subsaharan africa not to challenge or oppose such policies again the rest of the world looks to the united states for leadership it is essential that congress pass the world bank aids marshall plan trust fund act that has been initiated and guided by riy friend and colleague the gentlewoman from california and the gentleman from iowa and it is equally essential that congress fully fund the presidents request for international hiv aids treatment and prevention programs also it is imperative that we do not pare back the 200 million that we adopted in the committee on banking and financial services but rather support it and move forward in a very proud way to join with other leaders in the world some countries much smaller than ours who are doing more to deal with this crisis than we are doing i am convinced we can do that"], [0.49913299083709717, 0.5008670091629028, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume

the unitedstates to strengthen our ongoing effort to conclude the nagorno karabagh peace process as well as to enhance opportunities for regional cooperation in addition we are strongly encouraging president clinton to extend president kocharian an official invitation to washington while his counterparts in azerbaijan and georgia have paid official visits to the unitedstates in the past president kocharian has not had the same opportunity and we believe that such a visit will further strengthen the unitedstates armenia relationship and is long overdue finally the fact that the upcoming summit is taking place in turkey armenias neighbor to the west is particularly significant turkisharmenian relations have been difficult for among other reasons the hostile blockade that turkey still maintains against armenia there have been however some potentially hopeful signs of a trend towards better relations this summer when i traveled to armenia with a bipartisan group of my colleagues we saw firsthand evidence of moves towards a new crossborder relationship between the armenian city of gyumri and the turkish city of kars also i was very encouraged to see that turkey sent a delega tion to prime minister sarksians funeral last month i encourage president clinton to use the considerable unitedstates clout with turkey to urge that country to improve its relation with armenia and also to persuade turkey to use its influence with azerbaijan to promote increased cooperation with armenia despite our grief we want to take this opportunity to emphasize our belief in armenias commitment to democracy economic reform peace and stability within armenia and throughout the region we take this opportunity to reiterate our full confidence that this commitment is deeply

unfortunately the majority has consistently underfunded this office why this year the administration has asked for 97 9 million and is getting only 86 million from this bill and this is in the midst of a 200 billion budget surplus that is the wrong message to send to the american people about the importance of civil rights this amendment can fix this by fully funding the division with an additional 11 8 million now in the past few years the civil rights division has been more important than ever in pursuing criminal civil rights abuses the nation has experienced the horrors of the torture and deaths of matthew shepard and james byrd and the murder of a reproductive health care provider dr bernard slepian more recently four new york city police officers killed amadou diallo an unarmed immigrant in the lobby of an apartment building and another four officers brutally assaulted abner louima these are just a few of the cases that the division is reviewing the federal bureau of investigation stated that there are 10 461 law enforcement agencies across the united states reporting a staggering total of 8 049 hate crimes in 1998 alone these are conservative numbers though because the truth is many hate crimes go unreported because the victims fear retaliation and many police departments just do not collect such data now while law enforcement offices and agencies pursue the bulk of the offenders the justice department must train those agencies and prosecute those offenders the local officials car not with added funding the civi rights division can hire five just fiv more lawyers and assure that many c these perpetrators are brought to juc tice three prominent civil rights groupe the naacp the aclu and the na tional asian pacific american lega consortium have pointed out in a let ter to the house that one of the mos pressing issues for many americans i that of police misconduct the department has investigated th police departments of washington d c new york city new orleans and lo angeles and many others for numer ous offenses including excessive force prior investigations have led to con sent decrees with local police depart ments including steubenville ohio and pittsburgh pennsylvania foi using excessive force and impropei searches in december 1988 thejustice depart ment was conducting six public inves tigations with eight attorney throughout the country and in december 1999 the department was inves tigating at least 12police department with just the same number of attorneys as the previous year we cannot expect the department tc increase its workload in this mannei without adding additional resources andso this amendment would permit the division to hire three muchneeded attorneys to prosecute police misconduct and so my colleagues i urge my colleagues to support the serranoconyers amendment it adds modest funding to the civil rights division all to oftenthe majority gives our nations civil rightslaws mere lip serviceoffering us civil rights on the cheap the budget before us today confirms my worst fears if you look at the actual evidence in critical areas such as hate crimes police misconduct employment and housing you will see that there is overwhelming evidence of ongoing discrimination in our society yet the budget actually under funds the critical civil rights division to the tune of 11 million consider the problem in hate crimes our nation has only recently began the healing process in the aftermath of the tortures and deaths of james byrd jr and matthew shepard in laramie wyoming in the years 1991 through 1997 there were more than 50 000 hate crimes reported 1 this is why the conyersserrano amendment would allow the division to hire five new attorneys to help prosecute hate crimes and other civil rights crimes the incidence of police misconduct toward minorities is also growing dramatically in pittsburgh a police officer shot to death a black motorist who had slowed down and peered through his side window while observing a drug arrest in riverside california a 19yearold black woman was shot to death by a policeman in her car at agas station and we all know thatamadou diallo a west african immigrant was shot 41 times in the vestibule of his bronx apartment by four police officers at a time when the civil rights division is on the verge of being totally overwhelmed i our amendment would also allow the division il to retain three additional attorneys to fighl against police pattern and practice misof conduct the problem with regard to employment and housing discrimination is no better the number of employment discrimination cases in federal courts has almost tripled between 1 1990 and 1998 from 8 413 complaints to 1 23 735 the bipartisan glass ceiling commist sion recently found that 95 percent of top cors porate jobs in america are held by white males with africanamericans holding less e than 1 percent of top management jobs and i women holding 35 percentof senior level pos sitions just recently we learned of outrageous discriminatory conduct at texaco corp in cluding tapes of top management officials re ferring to africanamerican workers as black jelly beans in terms of housing tester programs by the r urban institute and others confirm that whites r are far more likely to be shown apartment and other rental units than similarly situated minori ties and it was only a few years ago that an elderly africanamerican man was literally s chased out of his apartment in vidor texas after he had moved there pursuant to a fed eral court order requiring that the allwhite housing complex in that city be desegregated this is why our amendment provides the funds to hire 13 additional civil rights attorneys r i believe this is the most important amendment we will vote on today the serranoconyers amendment has the support of the i naacp the aclu and every major cii rights group in the country we have a choicewe canclaim to be opposed to dis crimination or we can put our money where our mouth is and fund the fight against dis crimination i urge a yes vote i submitthe following letter for the record"], [0.4991585612297058, 0.5008414387702942, 1, "the reason this evening that i am asking for a 5minute special order is to talk about some legislation that i have been working on and we have a great many cosponsors h r 1323 as i begin to talk about it members need to understand when i first was brought to the problems attention by some constituents of mine i realized the first issue we need to deal with is what i call the candy effect we need to get over the snicker factor and then really get on to dealing with the problems that some women in our country are having h r 1323 deals with breast implants an issue that has been the subject of court cases but my concern is that the federal food and drug administration who is supposed to be americas watchdog our protector to mdke sure that we are not harmed by faulty drugs or medical devices in fact the fdas own web site calls itself the nations foremost consumer protection agency and we pour millions and millions of federal tax dollars into this agency every year unfortunately when it comes to medical devices the fda is neither our watchdog nor our protector in may i was disappointed to learn that the fda approved saline breast implants for the general market the fda approved these breast implants despite data presented by the manufacturers showing that three out of four mastectomy patients who opt for saline breast implant reconstruction experience painful local complications the fda approved breast implants despite the fact that the majority of implants rupture within the first 3 to 4 years the fdas own scientists concluded that the manufacturers have incorrectly carried out their statistical analyses and therefore determined that the complication rates were as high as 84 percent with mastectomy patients within the first 3 to 4 years these complication rates continue to increase over time 1745 but now with the fda approval the two leading manufacturers are able to market their saline breast implants in fact one of the manufacturers even has a pending fda criminal investigation regarding its breast implant production and testing hanging over its head and it still received approval by the fda my concern for women who opt for a saline breast implant stems from hundreds of women who have contacted me with their experience and i have heard from my own constituents and women from across the country who have suffered from the longterm consequences of reconstruction and cosmetic surgery including infections deformity and rupture these women also have suffered from inaccurate mammogram readings due to implants concealing breast tissue which is critical in detecting a reoccurrence of cancer studies show that up to 35 percent of the breast tissue can be obscured by these implants in addition these women are experiencing difficulties with health insurance coverage to pay for the high cost of repeated surgeries and examinations the cost of faulty implants is paid for by all of us just consider the number of women who have had breast implants the institute of medicine estimated by 1997 1 5 to 1 8 million american women had breast implants with nearly onethird of these women being breast cancer survivors the american society of plastic and reconstructive surgeons cites breast augmentation as the most popular procedure for women ages 19 to 34 in 1998 nearly 80 000 women in this age bracket received breast implants for purely cosmetic reasons by 1999 an additional 130 000 women received saline breast implants in spite of these escalating numbers very little is known about the longterm effects of the silicone of these breast implants on the body few patients understand that even when they opt for the saline breast implants the envelope of the implant is made of the silicone following the fdas decision to approve saline breast implants the agency did warn women of the potential risk fda officials called upon implant manufacturers and plastic surgeons to ensure that thorough patient information is provided to women before they undergo the surgery so now with the fda approval process behind us the only course of action to safeguard future women is an informed consent document somehow a piece of paper issupposed to make up for the manufacturers insufficient mechanical testing revision data and retrieval analysis it is supposed to make up for inaccurate labeling and risk estimates it is supposed to make up for the plastic surgeons obligation to fully inform their patients of the potential complications and reoperations and the doctors chosen surgical procedures there is so much we dont know and yet the one government agency mandated to safeguard the publics food drug and medical devices is willing to jeopardize women with a medical device that has alarmingly high failure rights in spite of the agencys call for postmarket studies the fda approval of saline breast implants provides no incentive for the manufacturers to make data better or a safer medical device i highly doubt the postmarket studies will be conducted in a meaningful and timely manner and i doubt that the fda has the ability to properly oversee these studies anyway one of the manufacturers is already predicting to its stockholders it will have fdas approval of its silicone breast implants in a couple of years and i believe the need for more research is especially compelling in light of the fdas own study on the rupture of saline breast implants i include for the record two articles from the washington post and the los angeles times on may 18 of this year dr s lori browns research was presented the study examined women through the use of mris in order to detect whether theirimplants had ruptured and concluded that 69 percent of the women had at least one ruptured breast implant the fda concluded that rupture of silicone breast implants is the primary concern although the relationship of free silicone to development or progression of disease is unknown my colleagues have joined me in trying to get some critically needed independent research into silicone breast implants we have sponsored the silicone breast implant research and information act h r 1323 which calls upon the national institutes of health to conduct clinical research on women with silicone breast implants our bill places a special emphasis upon mastectomy women who are adversely affected at a much higher rate than women receiving implants for cosmetic reasons while that research is being conducted the bill would also bolster the informed consent procedures and information given to women when they consider breast reconstructive surgery or breast augmentation i urge my colleagues to join mein sponsoring this bill and ensuring the health and wellbeing of american women since the fda wont do its job wejl have to i include the following articles from the washington post and the los angeles times for the record how safe is safe the food and drug administration ruled last week that salinefilled breast implants the only kind still available can remain on the market they had been in regulatory limbo a 1976 law allowed medical devices then available to continue to be sold pending further testing only now completed but for those who hoped the longawaited fda ruling would give a firm yes or no on safety the agencys judgment is less than definitive saline implants may be sold the agency ruled but women must be made aware of their many potential complications including pain infection cosmetic problems and a 20 to 40 percent chance they will need replacing by another operation within three years a serious effort needs to be mounted to warn women of these risks the agency believes not exactly a ringing endorsement why then approve at all critics accuse the fda of diluting the meaning of its seal of approval many products legally on the market carry risks drugs commonly come with warnings of side effects but the critics argue that the agency should take a harder line toward optional cosmetic products and procedures and in fact most optional devices with complication rates this high have been kept from the market the fda says it is trying to draw difficult lines between protecting people and allowing them to weigh their own risks at a time when both demand for lifestyle products like cosmetic surgery and the variety available are skyrocketing should people be protected from liposuction and laser eye surgery from cosmetic procedures with a remote risk of serious harm but a high risk of moderate harm the implant ruling reflects an fda choice to become at least for cosmetic surgery less a goalie and more a disseminator of information its a defensible but risky approach that can only work if accompanied by close oversight especially of the implant manufacturers and plastic surgeons who benefit financially from use of these products for most consumers the fdas stamp of approval still speaks more loudly than any warnings it may tack on"],

the gentleman from alabama for the manner in which he has developed this bill given the constraints of a low 302 b allocation and the contentious policy issues that normally weigh this bill down he has done an excellent job of balancing funding and policy considerations both the subcommittee and the full committee markups went as smoothly as could be expected for this bill and that is a testament to his fairness and his bipartisanship it is also a tribute to the bipartisanship on the democratic side of the aisle i might add and i commend my fellow members on the democratic side it is a pleasure to work with the gentleman from alabama and his republican colleagues on this bill having said that i also want to make it clear that the total level of spending in the bill of 12 625 billion is not adequate to meet our national security requirements and will i believe seriously impair the presidents ability to carry out an effective foreign policy that is why the administration has put out a veto threat on the bill that is one of the reasons the underfunding i have indicated my support for the bill on the basis that the chairman has been judicious in his distribution of the resources available to him it will be necessary at a later time to provide additional resources for this bill to enable the united states to meet new challenges and maintain our leadership around the world if that does not happen i would have to urge my colleagues to vote no at some later date in order to sustain a presidential veto and another issue of contention is the smith amendment if the smith amendment passes and the mexico city language is included in this legislation i would then oppose the bill and urge my colleagues to do so also the bill now contains only 100 million of the 1 4 billion requested to support the wye river accords i would expect these funds to be included at a later stage in the process also when needed to implement the accords there is also a need to address additional resources for other needs such as support for the peace implementation efforts in and around kosovo and for meeting unitedstates commitments on debt restructuring to poor countries this is a very high priority for many of us in the congress the bill is therefore in my view a work in progress if additional resources are not forthcoming at a later time i will be urging those who support this bill at this time to oppose it the total recommendation of 12 625 billion is almost 2 billion below the presidents request and is 715 million below last years spending level for foreign assistance the programs in the bill that are most severely underfunded include the independent states of the former soviet union the international development association ida which does so much to assist the poorest of the poor in africa and other places in the world aids operating expenses debt restructuring the global environmental facility and the nonproliferation antiterrorism and demining account on the positive side the bill includes 680 million for the child survival and diseases program fund known by us affectionately within the committee as the callahan account which will enable the expenditure of 145 million to combat hiv aids as well as fund increased efforts against tuberculosis and other childhood diseases such as measles and malaria of course we would like to be doing more and that is why we want the funding levels up in addition the bill includes 30 million for displaced children orphans and blind children which is an increase over last year and i thank the chairman for that the bill also includes funding for vitamin deficiency programs polio eradication and basic education poll after poll shows that the american people support welldirected humanitarian aid programs that assist poor children and the poor countries with basic human needs while the bill does not contain a separate account for african development assistance and i wish that it would it does maintain last years funding level for africa maintaining last years level is not a victory but at least it did not get cut as other programs have and i would hope that as we go forward with the bill we will have an increase for africa the total of all accounts the bill provides 1 6 billion in assistance to africa with respect to the independent states of the former soviet union the bill contains 725 million this is far too low well below last years level and 307 million below the presidents request this means serious cuts in the expanded threat reduction initiative and cuts to emerging republics such as armenia and georgia and reductions in programs that support small businesses exchanges and regional initiatives which are also designed to develop a new generation of proreform leaders and institutional partnerships the cut to aids operating expenses will scale back necessary security improvements the cuts in the nonproliferation account will limit new initiatives for antiterrorism export controls and demining i mention all these so that our colleagues will know what the impact is of the underfunding of this bill it provides only 50 million of the 143 million for the global environmental facility in addition the cuts in the development assistance account will mean cuts to bilateral and environmeiltal programs the bill includes only 33 million of the 120 million requested for debt restructuring and prohibits funding for the trust fund for the highly indebted poor countries hipc this request was made before the recent historic agreement among the g7 in cologne germany which has broad support from governments multilateral institutions and religious groups granting generous debt restructuring to the worlds poorest countries as called for in these new agreements will be the most significant poverty alleviation action we can take in a generation the amounts currently in the bill do not even put us on the playing field i would hope that we could get it to a level where we could honor the jubilee 2000 initiative goal of debt forgiveness in the months ahead i have been pointing out some of the deficiencies and some of the pluses in the bill in the interest of time i will submit the rest of my statement for the record and just close by saying that this house takes pride in providing ample resources to the defense bill to protect our national security the importance of an engaged foreign policy with the resources to back it up also protects our national security in that interest i did want to just take a moment to acknowledge the tragedy of the plane that went down in colombia and ask for just a moment of recognition for those brave young men who lost their lives i respect their dedication to a dangerous task and would ask the house to take a moment to acknowledge their ultimate sacrifice president kennedy said in his inaugural address in 1961 and everybody in america knows this quote president kennedy said my fellow americans ask not what our country can do for you but what you can do for your country but everybody does not know that the very next sentence the very next sentence the president said and i was there to hear him when i was a college student in washington d c the very next sentence is my fellow citizens of the world ask not what america will do for you but what we can do working together for the freedom of man that is what we do in this bill and hopefully what we do in this congress is to reach out to help promote the freedom of man throughout the world this embodies what the bill is about or should be about my colleagues we have an obligation to move forward together to provide for a robust foreign assistance program that enhances our national security this bill is a start and it should be supported of course unless the smith amendment succeeds however we have a long way to go before the end of the year to finish the job i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.49916571378707886,

member of the subcommittee for moving this legislation through the committee i would also like to report that i am familiar with the indian tribe that is involved here the lower sioux community it is in my congressional district it is a relatively small indian community native american community but i would like to emphasize it is very well administered it has acquired this land and feels that in order to remove a cloud from title this act of congress is necessary i would like to suggest to the subcommittee that it consider legislation that deals with this type of situation because i expect that the lower sioux community is not the only native american group in the united states that faces this type of obstacle to the disposition of land that it has purchased which has not been in trust status which is off of its reservation area as we see here in the 21st century we have a number of native american communities that are becoming more prosperous they are engaging in commerce i think that it would certainly facilitate the activities of these communities if in these fairly welldefined situations where there is not a concern about any abuse in connection with the assets of the community that they had the flexibility to on their own make these transfers and not have the cloud on title that exists in situations such as this one i have worked with the community in crafting this legislation with the administration and also with the committee and subcommittee staff i would like to express my appreciation to the staff members of both the committee and the subcommittee at the request of the lower sioux indian community i have sponsored legislation that would exempt land owned in fee by the community from the effect of the indian nonintercourse act 25 unitedstatesc 177 1994 ina in recent years the community has acquired several parcels of property outside the boundaries of its reservation it is likely that not all of those parcels will not be needed for the development which the community contemplates therefore the community should have the ability to dispose of any unneeded portions of fee land as and when appropriate purchasers may appear at present it is unclear whether the ina prohibits such transactions absent an act of congress it was this problem which prompted the community to seek legislation that will permit similar conveyances without resorting to the cumbersome and timeconsuming legislative process each time an individual sale is agreed to the terms of the ina does not distinguish between fee land and trust land my bill states that no conveyance of lands from any tribe of indians shall be of any validity unless the same be made by treaty or convention entered into pursuant to the constitution in the past this has been interpreted to mean that congress must either give direct approval or must establish the process for giving such approval although congress has allowed the secretary of the interior to approve the conveyance of lands owned in trust for tribes by the united states congress has never set up any process for approving the conveyance of fee lands the clouding effect of the ina is illustrated in a discussion contained in a brief filed with the united states supreme court by the united states department of justice in cass county minnesota v leech lake band of chippewa indians the brief observed that n recent times congress and the executive branch have assumed that the ina requires congressional approval of sales of all tribally owned lands whether or not those lands are within a reservation congress repeatedly has passed legislation allowing individual fee parcels of tribal land to be sold congress has on several occasions in recent years adopted legislation similar to that which the community seeks for example p l 86505 1 74 stat 199 authorizing the navajo tribe to dispose of its fee lands without federal approval p l 101630 104 stat 4531 authorizing the sale of a parcel of land owned in fee simple by the rumsey indian rancheria p l 101379 11 104 stat 473 authorizing the eastern band of cherokee indians to convey a particular parcel of its fee land p l 102497 4 106 stat 3255 authorizing the mississippi band of choctaw indians to convey certain lands which it owned in fee the supreme court has never ruled that the wording of the ina does not apply to fee lands in fact in a case decided just last year the court made a point of saying that the question is open this court has never determined whether the indian nonintercourse act applies to land that has been rendered alienable cass county v leech lake bank unitedstates 118 s ct 1904 1998 the assumption has been and still is that the act prevents the sale of fee land without congressional approval this is the legal position of the united states citing the amicus brief of the united states in the cass county case and the department of the interior has taken the position that it cannot not give the lower sioux community permission to sell fee land because congress has not given the department that authority most importantly purchasers assume that the consent of congress is required before tribal tee land can be sold the effect of all this is that the lower sioux community is stymied the wording of the ina seems to say that congressional permission is needed to sell fee land the justice department acknowledges that the department of the interior acknowledges that congress has acknowledged that and purchasers acknowledge that this bill will solve that problem for the lower sioux indian community

friday accords in northern ireland and the fact that they are still being pursued and we are hopeful that they will be brought to resolution clearly this action against such a highprofile defense lawyer and defense representative in northern ireland was calculated to in fact stop those peace accords from going through as other actions that have taken place have also been aimed at that and i think all of us are hopeful that the northern ireland government the government in the uk will recognize that the objectivity of the royal ulster constabulary to in fact do this investigation has been forfeited because of the events that have occurred in the recent past and certainly with regards to rosemary nelson obviously the testimony here the fact that she feared them and so forth i think is a statement that demonstrates that they have in fact compromised their neutrality in terms of being able to go forward with such investigation i think that the government structure clearly want to and hope that they would like to get to the bottom of this and so i think we must find an objective investigation that is independent to get to the bottom of it and i think we should get to the bottom of it and prosecute those that are guilty ofthis assassination and proceed with the business at hand i think that events in northern ireland are pretty clear recently i had the privilege to travel and participate in northern ireland with habitat for humanity the belfast celebration providing homes to both catholics and protestants the economy of all of ireland is on the upswing employment and opportunities are growing and hopefully the iscrimination that has persisted in the past can now finally be laid to rest it has taken hundreds of years to get to where we are but these are this type of behavior is learned behavior and i think that the human spirit certainly can rise above it and we have seen some pretty good examples of that in the past year the electoral process has been successful and while outstanding issues exist i am optimistic that the clinton administration the former senator george mitchellled good friday peace accord agreement of 1998 will be implemented and that the ira decommissioning and reform at the ruc will be achieved i commend the leadership of the republics prime minister ahern mr trimble and jerry adams who are attempting to bring to conclusion and completion the goals of peace and reconciliation in northern ireland this horrific murder of the attorney rosemary nelson represents a sad day in the long peace process in northern ireland but hopefully it will not be the last chapter hopefully the last chapter will be one with this type of symbolic action of this outstanding personality and person that this will be one in which this loss of life will help to push us and push these governments to a point of reconciliation and building the type of community and the type of understanding that will settle this matter for decades into the

was murdered by a car bomb in lurgen northern ireland on march 15 1999 this cowardly act is believed to have been orchestrated by an outlaw band of extreme protestant red hand defenders who claimed responsibility for the killing rosemarys commitment to social justice and defense of nationalist activities in highprofile cases throughout northern ireland led to intimidation tactics by the protestantdominated police force the royal ulster constabulary ruc and several death threats by unionist paramilitaries nelson who was married and the mother of three children aged 8 to 13 represented the catholic residents of carvaghy road who refused to allow a protestant fraternal organization to parade past their homes in annual sectarian commemorations that prompted provincewide violence she also defended the family of robert hamill who was the victim of the portadown kicking incident while ruc police officers did not address this atrocity unfortunately due to rosemarys death this case is still pending rosemary made a very impressive and powerful impact when she testified before the house subcommittee on international operations and human rights on september 29 1998 her testimony exposed the harassment and intimidation of defense lawyers representing nationalists in political cases in northern ireland she accused the ruc of making death threats against her and her family through clients as well as sending threatening telephone calls and letters directly to her in addition it is also alleged that the ruc made similar threats against the safety of other defense attorneys in northern ireland i would point out that 10 years ago prominent catholic defense attorney patrick funucane was murdered by an alleged loyalist death squad to this day no one has every been charged with that crime further allegations suggests that the ruc has conducted searchers without warrants arrested and detained suspects without providing access to legal council these allegations clearly violate international civil rights laws and compromise the neutrality of the ruc to enforce the law the murder of rosemary nelson has the potential to uproot and undermine last years historic good friday peace agreement further retaliation from nationalist paramilitary forces could take the british province back toward a state of sectarian warfare that has regrettably prevailed for 30 years in response to rosemarys murder and the past and current intimidation tactics i rise in strong support of h res 128 which condemns all violence committed in violation of the largely successful northern ireland ceasefire agreement specifically this measure condemns the murder of rosemary and calls on the british government to overturn its decision to allow the ruc to investigate rosemarys death while the objectivity of the ruc is under question the investigation will not be accepted h res 128 rightly urges the british government to conduct an independent inquiry and issue a detailed public report on the car bombing which killed rosemary nelson furthermore this important measure requests the british government to conduct a judicial investigation of the treatment of defense attorneys by the ruc and continue to investigate the death of patrick finucane recently i had the privilege to travel and participate with habitat for humanity in a belfast celebration of providing homes for both catholics and protestants the economy of all ireland is on the upswing employment opportunities are growing and hopefully the discrimination that has persisted in the past can now finally be laid to rest the electoral process has been successful and while outstanding issues exist i am optimistic that the clinton administration and the former senator george mitchellled good friday peace agreement of 1998 will fully be implemented and ira decommissioning and reform of the ruc achieved i commend the leadership of the republics prime minister ahern mr trimble and jerry adams who are attempting to bring to conclusion and completion the goals of peace and reconciliation in northern ireland the horrific murder of attorney rosemary nelson represents a sad day in the long peace process in northern ireland the role of defense attorneys in any democracy and in northern ireland is vital the test of a new society in northern ireland will be to recognize and respect such roles without any intimidation or improper interference we must all look forward to that day by building a truly democratic society brick by brick and building a community which respects one

president clinton telephoned her at home around 2 oclock or 3 oclock one morning on de cember 17 19972 00 or 2 30 he told her that her name was on the list of possible witnesses to be called in the paula jones lawsuit when asked what to do if she was subpoenaed the president suggested that she could sign an affidavit ms lewinsky indicated that she was 100 percent sure that he had suggested that she might want to sign an affidavit she understood his advice to mean that she might be able to execute an affidavit that would not disclose the true nature of their relationship when ms lewinsky agreed to that false affidavit she told the president by telephone that she would be signing it and asked if he wanted to see it before she signed it according to ms lewinsky the president responded that he did not as he had already seen about 15 others concurrent with these events i just described the evidence will further demonstrate that as ms lewinsky attempted to return to work at the white house after the 1996 elections she spoke with the president according to betty currie the president instructed betty currie and marsha scott deputy director of personnel to assist in her return to the white house in the spring of 1997 she met with ms scott she complained in subsequent notes to ms scott and the president about no progress being made with her getting back to the white house on july 3rd of that year she dispatched a more formal letter to the presidentin fact using the salutation dear sir and raising a possible threat that she might have to tell her parents about why she no longer had a job at the white house if they dont get her another job she also indicated a possible interest in a job in new york at the united nations the president and ms lewinsky met the next day in what ms lewinsky characterized as a very emotional visit including the president scolding her that it was illegal to threaten the president of the united states their conversation eventually moved on to other topics though primarily her complaining about his failure to get her a job at the white house continuing with ms lewinskys effort to return to work near the president there was a july 16th meeting and september 3rd telephone call with ms scott on the evening of september 30 the president advised ms lewinsky that he would have chief of staff erskine bowles help with a job search and bowles later passed this on to john podesta although each recalled their involvement occurring earlier in the year a few days later however her hopes of a job at the white house quickly ended on october 6 she had a conversation with linda tripp who told her that she would never return to the white house according to a friend of hers on the staff learning this secondhand was according to ms lewinsky the straw that broke the camels back she decided to ask the president for a job in new york with the united nations and sent him a letter to that effect on october 7 during an october 11 meeting with the president he suggested that she give him a list of new york companies which interested her she asked if vernon jordan might also help five days later she provided the president with her wish list and indicated that she was no longer interested in the u n position although she did receive an offer on november 24th and declined it on january 5 1998 after this meeting with the president arrangements were made through the president and ms currie for ms lewinsky to meet with mr jordan on the morning of november 5 1997 mr jordan spoke by telephone with the president about 5 minutes and later met with ms lewinsky for the first time for about 20 minutes according to ms lewinsky mr jordan told her he had spoken with the president that she came highly recommended and that were in business however the evidence reflects that mr jordan took no steps to help ms lewinsky until early december of that year after she appeared on the witness list in the jones case actually mr jordan testified in his grand jury testimony that he had no recollection of even having met ms lewinsky on november 5 when he was shown documentary evidence demonstrating that his first meeting with ms lewinsky occurred in early november he acknowledged that such meeting was entirely possible you can see that was not to be a high priority for mr jordan at that time until december for many months ms lewinsky had not been able to find a job to her satisfactioneven without the perceived help of various people then in december of 1997 something happened which caused those interested in finding ms lewinsky a job in new york to intensify their search within 48 hours of her signing this false affidavit in the paula jones case ms lewinsky had landed a job with a prestigious fortune 500 company it is anticipated that attorneys for the president will present arguments which will contest much of the relationship with monica lewinsky the president has maintained throughout the last several months that while there was no sexual relationship or sexual affair in fact there was some type of inappropriate intimate contact with her what has now been dubbed as legal gymnastics on the part of the president has made its appearance other examples followed within his definition of the word alone he denies being alone with ms lewinsky at any time in the oval office he also questions the definition of the word is it depends on what the word is means in how you answer a particular question further we would expect the president to continue to disavow knowledge of why evidence detrimental to his defense in the jones case was removed from ms lewinskys apartment and hidden beneath ms curries bed or knowledge of how ms lewinsky found herself with an employment offer in new york virtually at the same time she finally executed an affidavit in the jones case unfortunately for your search for the truth in these proceedings the president continues today to parse his words and use legal hairsplitting in his defense i cite for your consideration his answer filed with this body just days ago for instance 1 responding in part to the impeachment article i the president persists in a wrongheaded fashion with his legal hairsplitting of the term sexual relations which permits him to define that term in such a way that in the particular salacious act we are talking about here one person has sex and the other person does not as a graduate of one of the finest law schools in america and as a former law professor and attorney general for the state of arkansas the president knows better i have this statement here extracted out of the presidents answer to this proceeding 2 responding to both articles of impeachment the president now would have you believe that he was not focusing when his attorney bob bennett was objecting during the deposition and attempting to cut off a very important line of questioning of the president by representing to judge wright that ms lewinskys affidavit proved that there is no need to go into this testimony about the presidents life he said that this affidavit proves that there is absolutely no sex of any kind in any manner shape or form remember that this is the same president who now pleads that he lost his focus during this very important part of this deposition this is the very same president who is renowned for his intelligence and his ability to compartmentalize to concentrate and focus on whatever matter is at hand and now he comes before this senate to each one of you in his answer by and through his attorneys and pleads that he simply wasnt paying attention at this very important point during his own deposition in tennessee we have a saying for situations like that that dog wont hunt 3 in his further response to article i the president effectively admits guilt to obstruction as i read this his pleadings refer to the president himself and he states that he the president truthfully explained to the grand jury his efforts to answer the questions in the jones deposition without disclosing his relationship with ms lewinsky so he said he did answer the questiona in the jones deposition in a way so as not to disclose his relationship with ms lewinsky at the bottom of the same page he denies that he attempted to impede the discovery of evidence in the jones case think about this with me for a minute basically the purpose of the jones deposition of the president was to secure truthful testimony about these kinds of pattern and practice witnesses and therein discover the likes of monica lewinsky that is the purpose of being there the president admitted in his answer that he purposely answered questions so as not to disclose his relationship with ms lewinsky said another way he intentionally answered questions to avoid the discovery of one of these female employees with whom he was sexually involved that is precisely folks what impeding the discovery of evidence is i ask you if you get an opportunity to look at this very closely 4 in his answer to article ii the president denies that he encouraged monica lewinsky to execute a false affidavit in the jones case when everything is said and done ms lewinsky had no motivation no reason whatsoever to want to commit a crime by willfully submitting a false affidavit with a court of law she really did not need to do this at that point in her life but this 20somethingyearold young lady was listening to the most powerful man in the united states whom she greatly admired hearing him effectively instruct her to file a false affidavit to avoid having to testify about their relationship and in order to do that she had to lie about the physical aspects of their relationship according to her the president didnt even want to seethat actual affidavit because he had seen 15 more just like it and as such he knew what it would be 5 in an additional response to article ii the president answers and asserts that he believed that ms lewinsky could have filed a limited and truthful affidavit that might have enabled her to avoid having to testify in the jones case that is an incredible statement that is an incredible statement given the fact that the president knew firsthand of the extent of their sexual relationship and he also knew that the jones discovery efforts were specifically after that type of conduct even with the best of the legal hairsplitting it is still difficult to envision a truthful affidavit from ms lewinsky that could have skirted this issue enough to avoid testifying and if you really think the president had this belief dont you think he would have accepted ms lewinskys offer to review her affidavit and perhaps share this bit of wisdom he had with her before she signed it and lied after all in this answer he just filed he says he had an out for her a way for her to have the best of both worldsnot to have to lie and still avoid testifying in the jones case why didnt he share that with her when she gave him the opportunity if he in fact had such an idea i suggest that perhaps that is a recent idea even if for some reason you dont believe ms lewinsky offered to share that affidavit with him dont you think it still would have been in the presidents best interest to give ms lewinsky his thoughts before she violated the law with a completely false affidavit now indeed is the time to stop the legal gymnastics and hairsplitting and deal with these charges and facts appropriately as a house manager i believe i can speak for all of us out of a sense of fairness and again request that we and the president be permitted to call witnesses i submit that the state of the evidence is such that unless and until the president has the opportunity to confront and crossexamine witnesses like ms lewinsky and himself to testify if he desires there could not be any doubt of his guilt on the facts a reasonable and impartial review of the record as it presently exists demands nothing less than a guilty verdict while it has been the consistent defense of the white house to be inconsistent it still comes as something of a surprise that the president has not made a stronger case for the calling of witnesses before now he has aggressively sought the opportunity to challenge the truth and veracity of witnesses in these impeachment proceedings during the hearings in the house which many believe are analogous to a grand jury proceeding the presidents defenders and his attorneys consistently complained of the failure to call witnesses and the lack of fairness and due process almost every day there were partisan attacks from the white house and its emissaries who were dispatched throughout the media talk shows with the same complaints of no witnesses and always our measured response was a calm assurance that there would be witnesses called during the trial phase in the senate is there any doubt that our forefathers intended a twostep impeachment proceeding the house would function as the grand jury and determine whether to chargeto impeach then you as the trier of fact would function as the jury to try the case and weigh the testimony of the fact witnesses in recent days some have publically asserted that the house is hypocritical because it didnt call some of the fact witnesses it now asks to call in the senate for the record it must be noted that the house judiciary committee out of an abundance of fairness did allow the presidents defense team 30 hours in which to present any witnesses that they could have chosen and they could have examined but any allegation of hypocrisy certainly appears to miss the point that the writers of our constitution never contemplated two separate trials for an impeachment proceeding but now we would respectfully suggest is the time for witnesses all americans including the president are entitled to enjoy a private family life free from public or governmental scrutiny but the privacy concerns raised in this case are subject to limits three of which i will briefly discuss here first the first limit was imposed when the president was sued in federal court for alleged sexual harassment the evidence in such litigation is often personal at times that evidence is highly embarrassing for both plaintiff and defendant as judge wright noted at the presidents january 1998 deposition i have never had a sexual harassment case where there was not some embarrassment nevertheless congress and the supreme court have concluded that embarrassmentrelated concerns must give way to the greater interest in allowing aggrieved parties to pursue their claims courts have long recognized the difficulties of proving sexual harassment in the work place inasmuch as improper or unlawful behavior often takes place in private to excuse a party who lied or concealed evidence on the ground that the evidence covered only personal or private behavior would frustrate the goals that congress and the courts have sought to achieve in enacting and interpreting the nationss sexual harassment laws that is particularly true when the conduct that is being concealedsexual relations in the workplace between a high official and a young subordinate employeeitself conflicts with those goals second the second limit was imposed when judge wright required disclosure of the precise information that is in part the subject of this hearing today a federal judge specifically ordered the president on more than one occasion to provide the requested information about relationships with other women including ms lewinsky the fact that judge wright later determined that the evidence would not be admissible at trial and still later granted judgment in the presidents favor does not change the presidents legal duty at the time he testified like every litigant the president was entitled to object to the discovery questions and to seek guidance from the court if he thought those questions were improper but having failed to convince the court that his objections were well founded the president was duty bound to testify truthfully and fully perjury and attempts to obstruct the gathering of evidence can never be an acceptable response to a court order regardless of the eventual course or outcome of the litigation the supreme court has spoken forcefully about perjury and other forms of obstruction of justice in this constitutional process of securing a witness testimony perjury simply has no place whatever perjured testimony is an obvious and flagrant affront to the basic concepts of judicial proceedings effective restraints against this type of egregious offense are therefore imperative the insidious effects of perjury occur whether the case is civil or criminal only a few years ago the supreme court considered a false statement made in a civil administrative proceeding false testimony in a formal proceeding is intolerable we must neither reward nor condone such a flagrant affront to truthseeking function of adversary proceedings perjury should be severely sanctioned in appropriate cases stated more simply perjury is an obstruction of justice third the third limit is unique to the president the presidency is more than an executive responsibility it is the inspiring symbol of all that is highest in american purpose and ideals as the head of the executive branch the president has the constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed the president gave his testimony in the jones case under oath and in the presence of a federal judge a member of a coequal branch of government he then testified before a federal grand jury a body of citizens who had themselves taken an oath to seek the truth in view of the enormous trust and responsibility attendant to his high office the president has a manifest duty to ensure that his conduct at all times complies with the law of the land in sum perjury and acts that obstruct justice by any citizenwhether in a criminal case a grand jury investigation a congressional hearing a civil trial or civil discoveryare profoundly serious matters when such acts are committed by the president of the united states those acts are grounds for conviction and removal from his office"], [0.5008075833320618, 0.5008075833320618, 0, "as i have done every year i rise again to declare my deep concern and utter indignation regarding the 25year occupation of the island of cyprus by turkish troops it was in july 1974 that turkish forces consisting of 6 000 troops and forty tanks landed on cyprus northern coast and captured a good part of the island nation this military operation was appropriately codenamed attila a few days later the three guarantor powers namely greece turkey and the united kingdom were negotiating to determine the fate of the island to maximize its illegal territorial gains turkey used this opportunity to launch the second phase of its preplanned assault codenamed attila i1 since then turkey has occupied 37 of the island in defiance of any code of civilized behavior in the community of nations the consequences of that brutal action were devastating more than 5 000 people were killed during the invasion even today the fate of 1 614 cypriots and 4 unitedstates citizens missing since the invasion remains a mystery more than 200 000 greek cypriots men women and children were forcibly expelledby the invading turkish army in a mass exodus reminiscent of bosnia and kosovo these refugees settled in the southern part of the island of course they have never been compensated by turkey for their confiscated lands and houses or for their ruined businesses ever since this atrocious act turkey has embarked on a methodical effort to first entrench and fortify its military presence on the island and second to alter the demographic characteristics and ethnic composition of its population to achieve the former goal turkey beefed up its occupation force to more than 40 000 in addition a large amphibious assault force is permanently stationed at the turkish mainland base closest to cyprus to accomplish the latter goal scores of turkish people from anatolia were transplanted into the occupied lands to take possession of the properties and businesses of the expelled refugees these settlers conservatively estimated at 80 000 and the turkish occupation force currently outnumber the turkishcypriot population who legitimately inhabited northern cyprus before the invasion the illegal nature of this aggressive act and the brutality with which it was conducted aroused the indignation of the international community in the ensuing years the arbitrary declaration of the occupied northern cyprus as an independent republic failed to expunge its illegal nafure a quarter of a century later the occupied northern cyprus has remained a pariah entity not recognized by any nation in the world except turkey over the years repeated attempts have been made by individual governments and by the united nations to find a solution to the problem of cyprus all of them failed because of the intransigence of turkey as a result the relations between greece and turkey have been adversely affected to the point that direct military confrontations between them have been narrowly averted on at least two occasions given their geographic location and the fact that both countries are member states of nato such a conflict would seriously impact the stability of the eastern mediterranean region demilitarization would alleviate the security concerns of all parties and substantially enhance the prospects for a peaceful resolution of the problem unfortunately cyprus efforts to resolve the situation have been rebuffed by turkey and the selfproclaimed leader of the illegitimate turkish republic of northern cyprus mr denktash the intransigence of the turkish side is clearly reflected in the two preconditions set by mr denktash for a solution of the cyprus problem specifically hq demanded that this illegal government in the occupied part of northern cyprus be formally recognized he also said cyprus must withdraw its application to join the european union threatening that there will be war if cyprus joined the european union both demands are obviously unacceptable to the congress the united states government the government of greece the legitimate government of cyprus and to any neutral member of the international community denktashs threats have been echoed by the government of turkey which has threatened to annex the occupied part of the island if cyprus joins the european union in fact turkey has already signed a number of agreements with the illegal turkish regime that lay the groundwork for the eventual annexation of the occupied area what mr denktash and turkey fail to understand is that acceptance to membership in the european union must be earned on the basis of performance and achievement over the years it has become obvious that the intransigence of turkey on a just settlement of the cyprus problem represents a strategy aimed at forcing turkeys acceptance to membership in the european union such membership has so far been denied for several reasons first is the fact that turkey has not yet achieved the level of economic prowess deemed necessary for membership in the european union second the political system and the philosophy and practices of its governments over the past several decades do not conform with the democratic principles of the western world third turkeys record on respect of human rights and political freedom leaves a lot to be desired lastly turkey continues to reject proposals for a just and permanent solution of the problem of cyprus despite the european parliaments position that membership is contingent upon resolution of the cyprus problem the recent dispute over cyprus plan to purchase defensive antiaircraft missiles to protect itself also demonstrates the bellicose posture of turkey as opposed to the conciliatory stance of the government of cyprus this incident clearly illustrates the need for a concerted effort to solve the problem of the divided cyprus turkey objected to the planned deployment of the defensive missiles falsely claiming that they represent a threat to its security it also made clear its intention to use force to block this deployment in response to these threats the government of cyprus offered to cancel deployment if turkey would resume serious and constructive reconciliation talks yet the turkish side remained intransigent in its refusal to renew negotiations and continued to threaten cyprus with military action in a remarkable gesture of good will the government of cyprus eventually and unilaterally canceled the deployment of the missiles forgoing its legitimate right to selfdefense against turkish aggression it is regrettable that this conciliatory decision failed to bring the turkish side to the negotiations table prolonging this explosive state of affairs in eastern mediterranean is fraught with risks for all parties involved including the united states an armed conflict between greece and turkey over the cyprus dispute remains a dire possibility such a conflict would have devastating consequences for peace and stability in that sensitive and highly volatile region it is the interests of the united states the countries involved in the dispute as well as other neighboring countries to have this matter settled in a spirit of mutual respect i along with representatives maloney and kelly today introduced a bill that urges turkeys compliance with all relevant united nations resolutions relating to cyprus this bill also requests our administration to use its influence to persuade turkey to accept the united nations secretary generals invitation for negotiations without preconditions in the fall of 1999 to this end i call upon the administration to focus its attention on the problem at hand and to apply the necessary diplomatic pressure on turkey and mr dektash in order to promote a peaceful and negotiated resolution of the dispute if nothing else history has taught us that neglecting a smoldering problem that has the potential of a major crisis only makes its consequences more devastating in the threshold of the third millennium the united states can hardly afford to

archdiocese during the difficult communist times finally to the ministry of peter in rome in this journey he has left an indelible mark on his church and the history of our times with the world watching john paul ii has begun to show burdens of age but he has lost none of the extraordinary vigor that has characterized the 212 years of his pontificate one of the longest in church history on new years eve for instance he celebrated a long formal te deum in saint peters basilica had dinner in his quarters with vatican aides and friends after which they all sang carols at midnight he appeared in his window and delivered his traditional new years greeting to an adoring crowd in saint peters square below h3544 co then he celebrated yet another mass his first of the new millennium in his private chapel his staff was exhausted but by 9 the next morning he was in another basilica in rome leading another mass from the moment he became a priest in cracow karol wojtyla has conceived his role as a pastor a representative of christ on earth who has to be seen by the faithful since he became pope in october of 1978 he has made 92 pastoral trips abroad to 123 countries and territories meeting more leaders and bringing the message of god to more people than any other pontiff before him this year alone he has been to mount sinai in egypt followed in christs footsteps in the holy land and prayed at the shrine of the virgin mary in fatima who he believes interceded to save his life when he was shot in saint peters square in 1981 as a leader of a billion members of his faith john paul h is generally considered the preeminent religious leader in the world but his moral authority goes beyond his church it extends to all who seek a message of love and compassion of dignity that defies materialism of freedom of thought unconstrained by political oppression above all he has urged people all over the world never to give up hope he likes to recall that his first words in saint peters square were an echo of christs exhortation be not afraid wherever he has traveled john paul ii has championed human rights and individual dignity both of which in his view include freedom of worship with this definition of liberty he turned the church in his native poland into a protector not only of catholics but of all citizens oppressed by communism no matter their religion if any in so doing he helped discredit the communist system in poland and bring about its downfall elsewhere in the world it used to be said in poland that while he was the archbishop of cracow the countrys communist leaders considered him their greatest threat likewise in moscow once he became pope it is no accident that chinas leaders have so far refused to allow him to conduct a pilgrimage in their country in traveling the world john paul ii has reached out to the other great religions last month he sought to bridge the historic divide between christians and jews in a gesture of breathtaking eloquence in its simplicity he placed a sheet of paper in a crack in jerusalems western wall god of our fathers he wrote we are deeply saddened bythe behavior of those who in the

way needs to hear these words nations need to hear them especially those nations that have been reborn after the fall of the communist empire as well as those who witnessed the event from outside

who is the alpha and the omega of human history be it the individual or collective history and this someone is love love that became man love crucified and risen love unceasingly present among men it is eucharistic love it is the infinite source of communion he alone can give the ultimate assurance when he says be not afraid john paul ii has sundered depotism and ennobled faith by displaying to

trepidation the chairman spoke a little bit about the hispanic caucus meeting and i am here to tell my colleagues that the hispanic caucus is devastated by the fact title vii was added to this bill in the managers floor amendment now i understand that in the managers floor amendment there are also a lot of things we negotiated to make the bill better but the one thing we never got to negotiate to any great extent was title vii which is very important to the hispanic community and the limited english proficient children that it serves the fact is if we had had a chance in committee markup to deal with title vii as we did with title i we may have come out with the same bipartisan compromise on that as we did on title i but it puts us kind of behind the 8 ball to be here having to make a presentation on the floor in support of title i but yet disturbed by the situation of title vii and what it really looks like as the republicans entered it into this floor amendment i am going to vote for the bill because i believe there are so many things that have been compromised and even in title vii there was some compromise we did raise the trigger from 210 million to 225 million we then further got a little compromise on the language that would allow the children to opt in or opt out that is in my mind one of the biggest hurdles or obstacles there was in title vii i am going to support the bill and support the managers amendment because i strongly support all the programs that i believe h r 2 really does a good job of maintaining it also maintains the integrity and original intent of the bill originally when it passed out of committee i was not able to support the bill i was one of six people that voted no it was more on process than it was on what were the contents of the bill even at that time i stand here again in objection to the process on title vii although that is there and we have to deal with it i am hopeful that as we move to the conference committee and deal with the senators and their version that we may be able to revisit title vii and make it better than it is as it presently stands in this bill i understand several of my colleagues on that side of the aisle were concerned about the parental involvement and they did move to strengthen that parental involvement and i support their desire to make sure that parents know everything that is going on with their childrens education in school but by the same token a child should not suffer the lack of services because a bureaucrat is waiting for a parent to make a decision or they cannot make a decision themselves i believe the way my amendment has been accepted into the bill that the children will receive services immediately upon entering school that the final notification will take place quickly that the school will be required to pick up the phone or make some direct contact as quickly as possible to make sure that that child does not lack any services having said that i feel that the bill is vastly improved i believe the managers amendment which i hesitate to vote against because it does contain all of the agreements that we have made and made improvements to but i do not believe this is the end of the situation i believe that we have a process yet to go through in which we will have to meet with the senate and have a conference and the senate will have to concur and we will have to yield to some of the senates desires and i am hoping that the senates desires for bilingual education and for title i and parental notification is even stronger than it has been on this side of the aisle along with that let me tell my colleagues that one of the reasons that i support the bill is that we are able to increase or include language increasing the standards and accountability for instructions this is something that the gentleman from california from our side has been a strong proponent of for many years we were able to put it in the bill that is going to be marked up tomorrow i would have liked to come down earlier and join in the lovefest that was taking place on the floor in the general debate regarding this bill the only problem is that i could not join in that lovefest because i believe the honeymoon is going to end tomorrow as the gentleman from new york has stated tomorrow we are going to take up straight as which destroys everything that was negotiated in this bill which i think is absolutely ridiculous although i am hopeful somebody will come to their senses and either not offer straight as or that straight as will be voted down and if it is not voted down i hope it will be vetoed by the president so that we will not have to deal with it and keeping intact what we have in title i i would also like to commend my colleague from arizona for working with me on the parental consent portion of this bill i believe his willingness to compromise gave us the ability to be able to vote for this bill and madam chairman i do support the managers amendment madam chairman while i regret that the committee did not have an opportunity to mark up and fully debate title vii the bilingual education act which is included in todays managers amendment and while i still have a number of concerns regarding the effects this bill will have on limited english instruction programs and the children they serve i am going to vote yes on the managers amendment because it is vastly improved over where it was a week ago and because i hope it will be further improved in conference last week the education committee considered h r 2 which includes the reauthorization of several important federal education programs including title i which provides nearly 8 billion for the education of disadvantaged children the magnet schools program the indian education program the javitz gifted and talented program and the mckinney homeless assistance program although i strongly support these programs and believe that h r 2 does a good job of maintaining their integrity and original intent i was not able to support h r 2 when it was reported by the committee due primarily to what i consider to be unreasonable parental consent requirements placed on the education of limited english proficient children while i understand that several of my colleagues on that side of the aisle desire increased parental involvement and strengthened parental rights and although i support that desire i could not support the manner in which they were going about obtaining that involvement and those rights since it meant that a limited english proficient child could go for months without title i services however over the past week since this bill was reported from committee staff have worked tirelessly to negotiate an agreement whereby parental involvement and rights are maintained and more importantly lep children begin receiving educational services almost immediately in the process of those negotiations we were also able to make headway on a number of issues in title vii for instance we were able to increase the trigger point at which the instructional services program turns into a formula grant we were able to insert provisions ensuring that local education agencies measure the progress of lep students not only on english proficiency but also on challenging academic and contents standards and monitor the transition of lep students into the mainstream classroom we were also able to include language increasing standards and accountability for instructional programs and teachers and requiring the department to do research and collect data on best practices and while i still have concerns regarding some of the provisions in title vii i am pleased with the progress that has been made over the last week and would like to commend the staff for their hard work i would also like to commend my colleague from arizona mr salmon for working with me on the parental consent language although i know he feels as strongly about his original position on this issue as i feel about mine in all honesty were the democrats in charge of the house many of the provisions in this bill including those regarding parental involvement and consent would look quite different and i am sure that mr salmon would have rather stuck with his original language however i believe that we have come up with an agreement that we can both live with and support and i believe that h r 2 carefully crafted by chairmen goodling and castle and ranking members clay and kildee is also something we can live with and support and so madam chairman as i said earlier i will support the managers amendment and urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same"], [0.5007984638214111, 0.5007984638214111, 0, "i

tennessee and the tennessee volunteers football team now the undisputed ncaa national football champion just a few short weeks ago the tennessee vols completed a perfect 130 season and earned their first national championship in 47 years under the eye of the great coach phillip fulmer the winningest active coach in the ncaa who has now won about 85 percent of his games as the head coach the vols captured their second consecutive sec championship ro top it all off coach fulmer was named both the sec and national football coach of the year many other people also have helped make this past season more memorable than ever the vols defense led by defensive coordinator john chavis held 7 opponents to 14 points or less and 8 to under 100 yards rushing this season the vol defense ended the 1998 season ranked 6th nationally in rushing defense and had one of the best overall defenses in the nation the vol offense led by now departed offensive coordinator david cutcliffe who took the top spot at the university of mississippi powered through opponents all season long the new offensive coordinator is not new to aggressive and successful play coach randy sanders who took over the offensive reins during the fiesta bowl was previously the quarterbacks and running backs coach at ut coach sanders first game saw his offense perform exceptionally well against the tough florida state defense the volunteer offense had a tremendous season indeed averaging over 211 yards rushing per game leading the sec and ranking among the top nationally who else could assemble such a great coaching talent and staff but the greatest athletic director in the nation doug dickey coach dickey has had amazing success in his career at ut as head football coach from 1964 through 69 coach dickey put the ut football program back on the map winning two sec championships and leading the vols to high national rankings in several bowl game appearances for the last 13 years coach dickey has been a true leader in the field of college athletics and has built the university of tennessee into a sports powerhouse in the ncaa additionally his efforts to build scholarship fundraising have led to an increase in uts level of giving from 800 000 to more than 9 million annually to the athletic department the people i have mentioned thus far have contributed a great amount to the success of the ut football program but they alone could not have done it without a host of great volunteer athletes the volunteer football squad achieved a perfect season last year and joined the 1951 volunteers as the only other national championship team in tennessee football history the championship team was led by four captains all of whom brought outstanding leadership and exciting action to the volunteer team all american linebacker and cocaptain al wilson was the emotional leader of the vol defensive team and perhaps in the biggest game of the season al wilson broke the single game individual caused fumble record in a matchup against florida cocaptain and placekicker jeff hall had an amazing season earning the sec alltime scoring record with 371 points in his career he also had a gamewinning field goal at the buzzer to win the season opener against syracuse more importantly jeff hall was named an academic allamerican and sec player cocaptain shawn bryson and mercedes hamilton helped the vol offense dominate opponents throughout the season both players started every game and provided much needed support to the offensive effort bryson who started every game as fullback rushed in one game for over 200 yards on 21 carries with four touchdowns mercedes hamilton who started every game as offensive right guard was a key blocker who helped lead the vol offensive running game without a doubt most quarterbacks would rather not have had to follow a player like peyton manning however tee martin the fantastic leader of the tennessee offense rose to the challenge under enormous pressure martin posted a tremendous season completing an ncaa record 24 consecutive passes in a 2game period against alabama and south carolina his favorite receiver peerless price was another vol who certainly lived unto his name peerless he led the vols with 61 catches for over 900 yards in 1998 and finished his career ranked third on uts alltime list for receptions and receiving yards and also had a 100yard kickoff return against alabama there were many key players and others that made this season a very special one for the vols as i said before the fiesta bowl gave the vols their second national title in 47 years the 1951 volunteers led by the great coach general robert neyland was the last tennessee team to win the national championship some of the greatest names in tennessee

legislation and the amendments that will be proposed here in the next few minutes i also want to thank the chairman of the full committee for his support of this legislation the full ranking member for his support of this legislation and also the support of the gentleman from oregon the ranking member of the subcommittee for his work over the last several months on this legislation we have worked very well together and i look forward to the rest of the session i will not specifically go into all of the funding details because that will be in the statement i will submit for the record but what i would like to do for the members of the house those of whom are listening is to go through the kind of things that this limited force does for the united states number one it is the unitedstates coast guard that is directly responsible for the oil pollution act of 1990 and all of its provisions around this country since the oil pollution act went into effect and since the coast guard has been monitoring this issue and enforcing this statute oil spills in the world have dropped by 60 percent it is through much of the effort of the unitedstates coast guard in this area that is responsible for that drop i have visited prince william sound the sight of the exxon valdez spill and the infrastructure put in place mainly because of the coast guard activities is phenomenal fifty percent of the cargo transported across our oceans is considered hazardous and it is the coast guard that deals primarily with that particular issue it is the coast guard which leads the unitedstates delegation to the international maritime organization that deals with 153 countries around the world that ensures that not only our coastal waters and not only our coastal waters out 200 miles of our coastlines but the international regime of the imo of these 153 countries that enhances the quality of our international waters it is the coast guard that is directly responsible for patrolling the north atlantic in something called the ice patrol so that not only the unitedstates ships traveling in the north atlantic can be safe from icebergs but the international community can be safe from icebergs the coastal fisheries out 200 miles off our coasts not only off the florida coast or the california coast but the oregon and washington coast in the frigid waters of the north pacific 200 miles of the alaskan coast 200 miles off our coast we monitor the coastal fisheries and the unitedstates coast guard ensures that unitedstates law is enforced out that far and they do a great job interdiction of drugs on the high seas just imagine the coastal waters of the united states the pacific coast the atlantic coast the gulf of mexico the caribbean we have the technology we have the resources to interdict almost all the drugs if the coast guard is given those resources within 5 to 7 years i am convinced that we can interdict up to 85 percent of those drugs if the coast guard is given the right resources we talked about safety at life at sea not only is the coast guard responsible for safety at life at sea for unitedstates fishermen but they also do a good job in the international arena on every river looking at the mississippi river the great lakes our estuaries the coast guard is responsible for safety at life at sea who inspects vessels domestic and foreign it is the coast guard who inspects these cargo ships these container ships these oil tankers thebulk carriers the small vessels it is the unitedstates coast guard who interdicts illegal immigrants being carried through to this country on the high seas it is the unitedstates coast guard who cuts ice in the great lakes who cuts ice in the estuaries like the chesapeake bay around this country it is the coast guard who cuts the ice leading to mcmurdo station in the antarctic it is the unitedstates coast guard who cuts the ice in the arctic ocean it is the unitedstates coast guard the point i am trying to make is that the unitedstates coast guard does all of this with a force smaller than the new york city police force i urge my colleagues not only to support this legislation but to think about the silent service that does a magnificent job and all they ask for from this body is that we know something about the magnificent job that they and that we vote for this legislation h r 820 was developed in a bipartisan manner and deserves the support of all the members the primary purpose of h r 820 the coast guard authorization act of 1999 is to authorize expenditures for the unitedstates coast guard for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 section 101 of the bill authorizes approximately 4 6 billion in the coast guard for fiscal year 2000 and 4 8 billion in fiscal year 2001 the amounts authorized for fiscal year 2000 include funding for coast guard programs at the levels requested by the president with certain increases the funding increases over the levels requested by the president are primarily for drug interdiction and commercial fishing and recreational vessel safety specifically h r 820 contains an additional 380 million for drug interdiction consistent with the provisions of the western hemisphere drug eliminatibn act which was enacted by congress last year h r 820 authorizes an additional 142 million in operating expenses for fiscal year 2000 and 148 million in operating expenses for fiscal year 2001 these funds will allow the coast guard to operate 15 additional coastal patrol boats a regional law enforcement training center in puerto rico several maritime patrol aircraft and six medium endurance cutters the bill further allows the coast guard to construct 15 coastal patrol boats for 81 million and to begin construction of six medium endurance cutters for 100 million in fiscal year 2000 these new assets will allow the coast guard to execute its role under the western hemisphere drug elimination act i have supported increases in the coast guards drug interdiction spending because i am convinced that the level of coast guard drug interdiction has fallen well below what is necessary to fight the war on drugs effectively the 46 million increase in drug interdiction resources requested by the president for fiscal year 2000 is not adequate to respond to the alarming level of teenage drug use in this country the bill also contains additional funds for voluntary fishing vessel safety personnel and 100 million to accelerate the national distress and response system modernization project also h r 820 authorizes 128 million in fiscal year 2001 to acquire a replacement icebreaking vessel for the great lakes section 102 of h r 820 authorizes an increase of coast guard military personnel to 40 000 by the end of fiscal year 2000 and 44 000 by the end of fiscal year 2001 to allow the coast guard to aggressively fight the war on drugs in the caribbean finally there are a few noncontroversial provisions in the bill including a provision to require vessel operators to give notice to the coast guard 24 hours before they enter unitedstates territorial waters i thank the ranking member"], [0.500767171382904,

chairman regula and my colleagues both the gentleman from washington mr dicks and other valued members on the subcommittee we have an opportunity to support a bill that will manage and protect our environment it will maintain our obligations to our sovereign indian nations it will protect our nations cultural resources and maintain fiscal responsibility it was not an easy task for the chairman of our subcommittee to come up with all of the pressures of this bill in the form that this bill takes but it is a good package i thank the gentleman from ohio for inserting language that i authored in the report that will force the pacific northwest region which covers my state of washington to look at all impacts to the endangered salmon problem in the pacific northwest and not just focus on dam removal as the solution to restoration of our salmon populations it is not the solution it is a multifaceted problem that requires a great deal of analysis and careful consideration right now our region faces an immediate challenge with almost 8 000 pairs of caspian terns which nest on a manmade island called rice island which is located 20 miles upriver from the mouth of the columbia river the national marine fisheries service estimates that over the past 2 years these little birds have feasted on between 10 and 23 million juvenile salmon that are migrating out to the ocean these birds are protected tnder the migratory bird treaty act which the unitedstates fish and wildlife service is responsible for carrying out i appreciate the committee working with me on report language that requires the unitedstates fish and wildlife service to come up with a mitigation plan that will include but not be limited to transporting these birds to areas that are more in line with their natural habitat if we come up with a responsible plan for managing the caspian terns we will see a positive impact on the number of salmon returning to the columbia and snake rivers to spawn this is an important piece of the salmon restoration puzzle that we cannot ignore i am also pleased that within our budget limitationswe were able to increase funding for health care provided the native americans through the indian health service the health disparities among native americans are profound one area in particular is diabetes that seriously affects native american populations and other minority populations in our country the prevalence of diabetes among native americans is higher than it is for the rest of the nations population and the rate is rapidly increasing to epidemic proportions in some tribes across this nation for the second year in a row we have provided funds in this bill for diabetes screening through the joslin diabetes center a great center dedicated to curing and doing more research and understanding the complications of diabetes we have also included language in the report to increase the number of podiatrists within the indian health service to attempt to avoid one of the major complications of diabetes through preventive care and early treatment of diabetic foot ulcers for native american populations this bill contains a delicate balance for forest service funding and programs as members may remember we reached a hardfought agreement on this issue last year when supporters of active forest management agreed to eliminate the purchaser road credit program that was a difficult problem to overcome to eliminate that program this program primarily affected small timber purchasers many of which were in my district on the east side of the state of washington while the agreement held throughout the process last year attempts may be made today to unravel that agreement so i urge all members all of my colleagues who may consider supporting a forest service amendment to think hard about the agreement that was reached in good faith last year we should not destroy the accord that was achieved all in all this bill is well balanced it considers carefully the delicate nature of the programs that are contained within the interior appropriations measure it is one that i hope will see great approval in this body the chairman and the ranking member and all of us on the subcommittee worked very hard to make that balance occur we still have to deal with the senate we have to get a bill that goes through the process

this child so when she was in her ninth month in arkansas he allegedly hired three people to go and beat her and kill her baby with the express purpose of beating her to the point that she would lose her child well they did that allegedly they grabbed this woman took her away and beat her she was on the floor begging for her babys life she was not saying dont terminate my pregnancy please dont kill my baby and the allegation goes that one of the assailants said you dont get it bitch your baby dies tonight there was a cnn program yesterday where the woman was interviewed and she was talking about how she could hear the heartbeat fade away and how that affected her this was a sevenpound baby girl this cries out not just for some action it cries out for severe punishment what they are allowed to do in arkansas they can now charge these three people and the man involved who hired them with the crime of murder because 6 weeks before this event arkansas passed a law making it a separate offense for a criminal to cause the death or injury of an unborn child and because of that law these three thugs and the man that hired them are facing capital murder charges not just an additional penalty for assaulting the woman this is not just a loss to the woman she was not begging dont lose something for me she was begging dont take my baby away something she understood to be separate and apart from her without that law the three people that were hired to beat her and cause her to lose her child would never have been prosecuted for what they intended to do which was to kill the baby now what are we trying to do in this statute we are trying to do what 24 states have already done in some fashion federal law is silent on this question this bill only applies to federal statutes that already exist in this bill if a woman is covered by a federal statute and happens to be pregnant and she is assaulted and her baby is injured or killed under this statute the federal prosecutor can bring an additional charge that being the loss or the injury to the child in addition to the assault to the mother it does not change any state law it only applies where federal law already is in existence by adding an additional charge like states do recognizing the entity the child the unborn child being a separate victim that is the scope that is the purpose california has had a similar statute since 1970 there are a lot of statutes throughout our states that deal with this issue in varying ways one thing this bill does it allows the prosecution to occur at the moment the embryo is attached to the womb like 11 states there is no requirement for viability to be had before the criminal can be prosecuted many states take that tack missouri is one of them their statute has been upheld by the supreme court as being constitutional because it did not infringe on roe versus wade rights it only applied to thirdparty criminals who assault pregnant women and destroy the unborn child recognizing that they could be prosecuted this statute is legally sound and i think it brings americans together in this fashion when the term abortion is brought up we divide as a country that is not going to change any time soon there is a genuine debate and heartfelt views about that but i believe most americans in the arkansas case would want the criminals prosecuted for killing that baby i think most americans would want the person who shot the woman five times with a baby inside of her her child to be prosecuted for the two events assaulting the woman and killing the child i think regardless of prolife or prochoice feelings that most americans want toprotect the unborn from violence against criminals and when a woman chooses to have her child a criminal should not take that away from her it is not just a loss from sentencing enhancement it is the taking away of a life if members have got any doubt about federal law and the unborn i am going to read something to them i hope every member of congress will sit down and think for a moment the implementation of the death penalty at the federal level is covered by section 3596 it talks about how the death penalty is imposed at the federal level and under what manner it can be imposed but it has a section listen to this section 3596 federal law section b pregnant women a sentence of death shall not be carried out upon a woman while she is pregnant why why do we not execute women while they are pregnant if it is just a mere loss to the woman she is going to lose her life why not just go ahead and do it federal law understands that we are not going to kill an unborn child because of the crimes of her mother i would suggest to members that 99 9 percent of americans agree with that concept and if you tried to execute a woman who was pregnant there would be a hue and cry throughout this nation like you have not seen or heard ever before what i am trying to do in this bill is fill a gap in the federal law and say this if the state cannot kill the unborn child for the crimes of the mother a criminal who destroys or injures an unborn child should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law because it is more than a loss to the woman that is all i am saying roe versus wade clearly says that when it comes to the woman choosing about her pregnancy that is her decision in the first trimester this bill expressly exempts consensual abortions because it is the law of the land that that is the right of the woman to choose as to her own body this bill does not allow a prosecution of the woman if she takes drugs or does damage to her own baby i did not go down that road the woman under no circumstances can be prosecuted nor can medical personnel all i am saying is if a pregnant woman is assaulted where federal jurisdiction exists already and her baby is destroyed or injured the criminal is going to pay a separate debt to society so if one of your constituents comes to capitol hill and visits you and while up here unimaginable things happen terrible things happen they are assaulted and they happen to be pregnant and lose their child because this is an exclusive federal jurisdiction area this statute would kick in to allow a prosecution of that criminal who took their baby away from them when they chose to have it i hope that rationality will prevail and that members will actually read the statute we are going to divide the prochoice and proabortion people today because abortion has taken a fervor among some members that they have lost the view of what is right fair and common sense let us bring ourselves together and do some good"]], "top_unsure": [[1.1920928955078125e-07, 0.49999988079071045, 0, "i thank the gentleman for yielding me the time i rise in support of h r 4147

practices carried out to the detriment of our youth this included halting child pornography online to cracking down on violent offenders h r 4147 would simply include those children under the age of 18 to the list of those who should be protected from harmful and potentially damaging material the protection of children from sexual predators act also contained new language which provided for enhanced penalties for individuals who knowingly transfer obscene materials to juveniles whether through the mail or interstate commerce these enhanced penalties carry the weight of up to 10 years incarceration and or applicable fines compared with previous federal statutes under title 18 of the united states code that only carried a penalty of 5 years the bill is important for it builds upon the efforts of this body to regulate and stem the flood of obscene material throughout this country h r 4147 would build upon the efforts taken in 1998 to increase penalties against transferring obscene materials to juveniles under 16 years of age it would raise the age limit for enhanced penalties for transfer to juveniles to 18 years of age and close the loophole left in the law by not protecting youth between the ages of 16 and 18 if this body is going to act on behalf of our children and concerned parents in limiting exposure to obscene materials then we should act accordingly and across the board for all juveniles the bill would not limit any material that is protected by the first amendment it would only limit the material which is defined as obscene the supreme court has gone on record several times as saying that obscene material is not protected by the first amendment additionally the supreme court has defined obscenity on several other occasions the bill in no way will prohibit the exchange of protected material and is designed solely to protect all children from what is clearly inappropriate material more than 32 years ago the court recognized the harm to minors from pornography and the need to protect minor children from pornography in the case of ginsberg v new york the court ruled that protecting children from exposure to pornography is a transcendent interest of government because it concerns the health safety welfare and morals of its community by barring the distribution to children of books recognized to be suitable for adults furthermore obscene material is an effective tool in the hands of predators pedophiles use the material as part of the seduction process of children it is used to engage children and lure them into activities that pedophiles find acceptable and the rest of us find deplorable this bill in short would extend protection from pedophiles to those under the age of 18 i would ask all my colleagues to support our children and support this bill we should make sure that those who would seek to spread this filth knowingly to our children be ready to pay the price of up to 10 years behind bars i

first with respect to the amendment in a press conference that a number of us just held where we talked about the bill the underlying bill itself and how it funds nasa one of my colleagues talked about how this bill was like eating the seed corn well this amendment unfortunately while well intentioned by the gentleman from indiana is a little bit like cutting your crops down before they are harvested we have already put the seed in the ground we have already fertilized the ground we have already raised the crops and we are about to harvest those crops and instead of doing so we are just going to burn the field and we are going to burn our entire investment in this program where we have already had some yield but before we get the full potential of the crop or of the product and i think that would be a terrible mistake if the gentleman believes and i totally disagree with this but if the gentleman believes that the funding is a waste of taxpayer dollars what a terrible waste of taxpayer dollars it would be to destroy the project right now and get nothing in return for it i think that would be a very big mistake and i would hope that our colleagues would once again reject this amendment now with respect to the underlying bill i think the fact that we are cutting about a billion dollars out of nasa or proposing to cut about a billion dollars out of nasa cutting about a quarter of a billion dollars from the national science foundation is really wrong headed and i know that the chairman of the subcommittee and the ranking member and the chairman of the committee who is on the floor tried to do the best they can with what they have but this bill and perhaps the coming labor hhs bill if that ever gets to the floor in a singular form is a product of a failure on the part of the congress to adhere to the agreement that we made in the 1997 budget act i sat on the committee on the budget in 1997 when we wrote that and the fact is over the last couple of years through abusive use of emergency spending through a highway bill that was incredibly bloated and through actions taken this year we have blown through the caps in discretionary spending at the front end and now we are taking it out on the back end and i do not think there is anybody in the congress who truly believes at the end of the day that we are going to abide by that in the meantime all we are doing is making these illusory cuts and saying that we are going to make these cuts which really send the country backwards i think it would be a mistake we ought to be making an investment in the

the culmination of nearly 4 years of hard work and an effort that will provide congress with a new resource for reviewing new government regulations before they take effect i first introduced this legislation during the 105th congress with the goal of giving congress the tools it needs to oversee the steady stream of new and often costly regulations coming from the federal government government regulations have an impact on every american we see an average of close to 4 000 new regulations promulgated every year in most cases regulations speak to a noble purpose and can often be viewed as a measure of the value that we place in protecting such things as human health workplace safety or the environment yet too often the government oversteps its bounds in its attempt to achieve these goals and we all pay the price as a consequence the price of regulations poses a particularly heavy burden on small businesses and manufacturers they drive our economy forward they need our help estimates vary on the annual cost of government regulations from a range of 300 billion a year to 700 billion every year congress has a special entity the congressional budget office or cbo to help it grapple with our enormous federal budget there is growing sentiment that a similar office is needed within the legislative branch to review and analyze the numerous government regulations that are developed and issued every year to address this need in 1997 i first introduced legislation to create the congressional office of regulatory analysis or cora todays legislation is the culmination of that effort as the vice chairman of the committee on small business and the chairwoman of the subcommittee on regulatory reform and paperwork reduction and as a small businesswoman myself i know that small business owners are very familiar with the burdens that federal regulations place on them some studies have shown that for small employers the cost of complying with federal regulations is more than double what it cost their larger counterparts we do not need any study to reach that conclusion common sense says that if a regulation costs a company with a 5 billion revenue stream the same as it does a company with a 5 million revenue stream the overall impact on the smaller company will be significantly more on a per unit basis s 1198 creates an office within gao that would focus solely on conducting independent regulatory evaluations of regulations to help determine whether the agencies have complied with the law and executive orders the fact is congress cannot obtain unbiased information from the participants in the rulemaking because each participant including the federal agency has a particular viewpoint and bias this legislation will fill the information gap and assist members in congress in determining whether action is warranted the purpose of the bill is to ensure congress exercises its legislative powers in the most informed manner possible ultimately this will lead to better and more finely tuned legislation as well as more effective agency regulations the office will provide congress with reliable nonpartisan information levelling the playing field with

number of bipartisan noncontroversial public health measures it includes key provisions to respond to emerging health threats save victims of cardiac arrest promote clinical research improve our research infrastructure and fight prostate cancer and lupus i would like to highlight a few of these provisions first h r 2498 includes the provisions of the 21st century research laboratories act legislation which i introduced earlier this year there is no doubt that america is the worldwide leader in medical research both at the national institutes of health and at our research facilities throughout the nation however while congress has worked successfully to increase funding for medical research monies for building construction and renovation have lagged my legislation responds to this problem by authorizing the director of the national center for research resources at the nih to make grants or enter into contracts to expand or renovate existing research facilities and construct new research facilities it also authorizes grants for the purchase of stateoftheart laboratory instrumentation in addition h r 2498 includes the provisions of the lupus research act which was originally introduced by the gentlewoman from florida she has been a tireless advocate for this proposal and it was overwhelmingly approved by the house earlier this month today over 1 4 million americans have lupus a devastating disease that causes the immune system to attack the bodys own cells and organs ninety percent of the victims of lupus are women and the disease is more common among women of color by the time some lupus patients are diagnosed especially in poor or rural communities irreversible damage to vital organs has already occurred the bill before us expands federal lupus research activities through the nih and it authorizes the secretary of health and human services to make project grants for the delivery of essential services these projects will help identify innovative ways to respond to this terrible disease h r 2498 also includes the provisions of the cardiac arrest survival act which was authored by the gentleman from florida i want to truly commend him for his leadership in advancing this initiative which passed the house in may with strong support each year a quarter million americans die due to cardiac arrest many of these victims could be saved if portable medical devices called automated external defibrillators or aeds were used aeds can analyze heart rhythms for abnormalities and if warranted deliver a lifesaving shock to the heart an estimated 20 000 to 100 000 lives could be saved annually by greater access to aeds h r 2498 directs the secretary of health and human services to issue regulations to provide for the placement of aeds in federal buildings the bill also establishes protections from civil liability arising from the emergency use of these devices the proposals incorporated in this legislative package will

cognitive and behavioral research and building a new facility they are very supportive of the need for the sanctuaries outlined in this legislation in the midtolate eighties the federal government launched a vigorous chimpanzee breeding program aimed at finding answers to the cause of aids while these animals served us well in research that led to breakthrough medical treatments for many diseases researchers discovered chimps were not a good model for aids research as a result there is a surplus of chimps living with hiv that deserve our attention in their postresearch existence today

laboratory cages some are living at a facility charged with gross negligence in their treatment of chimps the passage of this bill would establish a costeffective publicprivate partnership to create a sanctuary system to provide for the lifetime care of chimps these sanctuaries would be staffed by trained professionals and overseen by a board of professionals with a thorough understanding of the

flood control navigational improvement beach restoration and ecosystem enhancement projects that will be of significant benefit to millions of americans let me cite one example with which i am particularly familiar thirteen years ago the des plaines river which flows through my congressional district in northeastern illinois went on a rampage flooding over 10 000 homes and businesses forcing 15 000 people to flee to drier ground and causing at least 35 million in damages a year later there was another major flood along the des plaines and several times since the waters of that river have spilled over their banks just this past week in fact residents in the area were reminded of the threat posed by the des plaines when a pair of rainstorms caused the river to crest 1 4 feet above flood stage in gurnee il much to my relief and not just to mine alone sections 101 and 408 of h r 1480 address this flood threat by authorizing subject to the timely completion of the final corps of engineers report the construction of the first phase of the des plaines river flood control project and an expanded study of the options for phase i1 assuming their wording remains unchanged and h r 1480 is enacted into law those provisions will allow the corps of engineers to proceed expeditiously with work on three floodwater storage areas the construction of a pair of levees the raising of an existing dam and development of additional flood control alternatives as a result a 25percent reduction in des plaines river flood damages can be expected when the authorized construction work is complete the benefits of which are anticipated to exceed the costs by a ratio of 1 7 to 1 furthermore the groundwork will have beenlaid for the implementation of additional flood prevention and or reduction measures in short these efforts to mitigate if not eliminate flood damages along the des plaines are a winwin proposition thousands of people in the northern chicago suburbs will profit because they will not suffer the same or as severe disruptions as they have in the past and millions of taxpayers will benefit because they are less likely to be asked to repair the damages that future flooding episodes would otherwise cause moreover the same can be said for a number of the other projects in the bill one reason being that much to its credit the unitedstates army corps of engineers takes very seriously its obligation to determine that waterresource projects under its jurisdiction have a favorable benefittocost ratio also it should be noted that h r 1480 contains a number of provisions aimed at making future flood control and water resource projects as environmentally friendly as possible to sum up what we have before us today is a longawaited bill

recognize the gentleman from arkansas when we are talking about social security i think it is important that everybody understands why some of us are as concerned about the tax cut for example a lot of folks have really questioned me quite personally when i have said on this floor as i am about to say now this tax cut that is going to the president is the most fiscally irresponsible bill to come before this congress in the 20 years that i have been here and i say that for one reason and one reason only and that is when we look at the effect of the proposed tax cut at least the one that was talked about not the one that was conferenced because it is interesting when we sunset a tax bill in 8 years that one is interesting but the effect of a tax cut literally explodes by about 4 5 trillion in the second 10 years now my colleague talked about the baby boom and the social security trust fund and it being exhausted and the year is 2034 that is when the social security trust fund under current projections will be exhausted provided we do not do anything well it is our hope and expectation thatwe will do something and therefore when we talk about this there is no reason for anyone 65 years of age and older in fact 55 years of age and older to worry about that that is a given but in 2014 that is only 14 years from now that is when we will begin paying out more out of the social security trust fund than will be paid in that is when the problem becomes a reality it will take 7 4 trillion of money from somewhere between 2014 and 2034 in order just to meet the current obligations of the social security trust fund and the blue dogs have said why do we want to do that why would the congress for any reason want to increase the liabilities on the ability of the federal treasury to make the commitments that we promise everyone on social security why would we want to reduce the amount of revenue available to pay off those commitments at exactly the same time that the baby boomers are going to be retiring at the top of their numbers i do not understand that i have never understood why the leadership of the house this year did not choose to fix social security first but they did not we did not and therefore we find ourselves in a position of having a bill go down to the president which he will veto which he should veto it is in the best interests of our country that he veto it then it will be in the best interests of our country that we now begin to look at putting together the kind of a compromise piece of legislation that will fix social security fix medicare deal with rural health problems and i hope that my colleague the gentleman from arkansas since he has been the coordinator and the chairman in the blue dog effort dealing with health care might have a few comments about that and i would recognize him at this time the gentleman from arkansas for any comments that he might like to add to this discussion"]]}
