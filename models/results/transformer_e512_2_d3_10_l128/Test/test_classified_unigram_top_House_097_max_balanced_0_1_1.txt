program to last years appropriations level at that time it was made clear that such an increase was modest indeed given the epas new responsibilities with regard to toxic wastes and given the magnitude of the cuts in epas budget between 1981 and 1982 if we want to reaffirm the commitment we made 1 month ago to the epa budget and environmental protection we must vote today to bring the appropriations for epas research closer to the fiscal year 1982 appropriations level when we debated this issue previously i think we made obvious a contradiction in epa research policy on the one hand the agency is committed to improving the quality of scientific research that it uses to support our environmental standards that is a goal that all of us can enthusiastically endorse at the same time however the agency is cutting exactly those longterm research projects that keep the epa in the forefront of environmental science the point is obvious if the agency is going to focus its entire environmental program on shortterm regulatory needs the quality of its science will inevitably deteriorate that point has been underscored by the american chemical society which represents 125 000 chemists and engineers and which has enthusiastically endorsed the amendment to restore appropriations for epa research let me quote directly from the societys letter the scheuer amendment would increase funding for extramural research an area slated for drastic cuts by administration thereby allowing the agency to draw upon qualified creative experts outside epa who can assist in solving environmental problems the extramural program is critical because it is open to the entire scientific community including many of the best environmental scientists some of whom have become discouraged by their inability to have their work supported by funding through the epa laboratories the proposed additional funds will allow epa to increase its longrange research on emerging environmental problems it would be shortsighted to wait until such problems reach crisis proportions before attempting to develop the information that is needed for appropriate policies and regulations a lack of fundamental information is a major reason the agency has failed to meet some of the regulatory deadlines established by congress in summary the american chemical society believes that the house would be wise to accept the scheuer amendment i include the full text of the american chemical societys letter of endorsement at this point in the record and i ask that my colleagues support this important

yield myself 6 minutes i thought that i would take a slightly different angle in the debate today because the people of my district seem to be beginning to feel a little better about their government and about the congress and i noticed that the polls recently reflect this there is a little bit of improvement in the feeling out among the people about this congress the members here have told me that they can sense that in their own districts i have wondered about the new attitudes we see these days and i have wondered what they might be caused by and i have become perplexed by it i have finally decided that it could be a mixture of things it probably is a mysterious mixture of the election in 1980 the space shuttle and the fact that our president has survived a mindless assassination attack and it might be that this congress is about to agree on a fundamentally different course of action for the country whatever the cause i think we need to nourish this new feeling this new attitude of hope and bring it along i think we need to do that because attitudes and expectations can have more to do with our economy in my judgment than the finetuning that we might do here any regulation that is done by the bureaucrats downtown or any monetary manipulation that might be done by the federal reserve now how can that be that attitudes and expectations can affect the way people behave well i know that the members hear the same things i hear out there among the people and that is why save your money why save it spend it on that television set or on that car because it is just going to cost you more next year ~ so we have a sort of inflationary mindset in this country and more than anything else i think we need to break that inflationary expectation i think we can do that if we act dramatically here we can alter the way people behave with respect to work savings investment productivity we need this new positive attitude for a second and perhaps an even more important reason and that is because while the presidents economic recovery sets a new course of action for the country it is a longterm commitment we did not get into these problems overnight and we are not going to get out of them overnight i hear people one after another say that we are just now finishing the easy part of this budget resolution we are just now finishing the easy part of our analysis of our economic condition the tough part is yet to come in order to maintain the resolve that we need as a people to see our way down this long road we need that positive upbeat spirit that national resolve that i think we can get if we act dramatically here the people are ready to do that i remember that when chairman volcker came before our budget committee he told the story of a ride hie had in a taxicab in new york city he and the driver got into a conversation about the economy and the chairman asked the driver how he thought the economy was going to be the driver said that he thought things were going to get worse the chairman was rather disappointed and he engaged him in further conversation in which the taxi driver said i think things are going to get worse first and then they are going to get better i rather think that it is like moving into a new house the house is going to be comfortable but when you first move in there are some inconveniences and there are some dislocations i think that is the situation we are in now with regard to our economy the point i think is that the commonsense of~ this country is not in this chamber and the commonsense of this country is not downtown the commonsense is out there in the country they know that we are changing direction and they know we have to keep that national resolve in order to get along with the economy so the people know the best chance we have to change the inflationary expectations in this country is to build the resolve that we need in the presidents program then after those two points about our attitude in this country i would like to make a third point and that is whether or not there is a difference between the jones resolution arnd the presidents proposal i happen to think there is a big difference the presidents proposal means less taxing the presidents proposal means less spending the presidents proposal means more growth the presidents proposal means less central government and the presidents proposal means more longterm commitment but the tactics of the time actually have been to suggest to the conservatives that there is not much difference and to the liberals it seems to me the suggestion is that there is a big difference with a little something for everyone i think that is the politics of confusion and i think if the people were present here in the chamber instead of the members commonsense world cut through that and they would support the president so i say those who would vote for the jones resolution on the basis that there is only a small difference between the two there is a big difference there is one indisputable big difference between the jones resolution and the presidents economic recovery program that has not been discussed and that is that only one of these pro gramsand that is the presidentshas the trust the confidence and the support of the people only one of these programs can alter expectations and break the inflationary mindset that is ruining our economy only one can change behavior of the people with respect to how they work produce and invest only one can be the best for the longterm support we have to have for this country so i say to this body that if we are going to be sending a signal here today why not give the presidents economic recovery program a chance"], [0.00020125508308410645, 0.4997987449169159, 0, "i rise in strong support of the conference report on the municipal wastewvater construction grants amendments of 1981 and i urge my colleagues to do likewise this legislation has been hammered out over the course of the past year with our colleagues in the senate taking into consideration the administrations commitment to reform epas construction grants program and i believe we have done an excellent job under most trying circumstances all of the members who have labored so hard on this legislation are to be congratulated for the product that is before us today special recognition belongs to the chairman of the public works and transportation committee the gentleman from new jersey who provided the strong leadership and encouragement that has been the hallmark of his tenure as public works committee chairman the leadership of our subcommittee on water resources chairman bob roe from new jersey and ranking republican john paul hammerschmidt from arkansas also deserve particular credit for developing the original version of h r 4503 which the house passed just a few weeks ago by the overwhelming vote of 382 to 18 and for negotiating the excellent compromise that is embodied in this conference report and of course the staffs of both the house and senate public works committees on both sides of the aisle should be recognized for their outstanding efforts in connection with this legislation when president reagan took office less than a year ago he initiated a program of major realinement with respect to governmental responsibility the general thrust of his realinement was to reduce substantially the role that the federal establishment plays in the governmental process within this overall context the president proposed reducing the funding level authorized for fiscal year 1982 for epas construction grants program from 5 billion to 2 4 billion furthermore the president proposed no wastewater treatment plant funding until legislation reforming the epa s construction grants program was first enacted into law the conference report on h r 4503 represents the reform legislation that the congress has developed in response to the presidents initiative i believe that the process has been extremely difficult and in some cases a painful one but it has been most beneficial and the president and his emissaries ann gorsuch and john hernandez from the environmental protection agency are to be congratulated for taking the lead with respect to the need to reform this important environmental legislation i agree with president reagans goal of balancing the budget and have supported and will continue to support efforts to achieve that goal at the same time i believe we must be particularly painstaking in our efforts to insure that our budget balancing decisions are the best most informed decisions possible this is especially important with respect to capital investments designed to further the development of the nations commerce and industry and the wellbeing of our people for all thcir contributions to the nation public works investment programs are particularly vulnerable to disproportionate reductions when there are cutbacks nationwvide for budgetary reasons because the programs are national in scope the numbers are large and present a tempting target they are characterized by long leadtimes and therefore are anticipatory they must~ be commenced long before needs become critical the deterioration they are intended to compensate for is slow gradual incremental and diffused cutbacks are not immediately translated into public perception that needs are being shortchanged like our economic system in general they are often taken for granted this situation poses a serious budgetary danger while we quite correctly pursue a course over the immediate future of reducing our federal spending we must strike a very careful balance excess cuts in public works investments could shortchange vitally needed programs and undercut the larger economic objectives which the cuts are intended to achieve in this context it is precisely because i share the presidents vision of a revitalized reirdustrialized america that i accord great priorities to our public works programs on which so much of the economys vitality and the peoples wellbeing depends in other words in attempting to address our immediate economic needs we must guard against actions that could ultimately lead to severely undercutting our nations program of longterm revitalization i am convinced that the package of reforms embodied in the conference report before us today properly recognizes the need to balance budgetary objectives with equally important environmental objectives h r 4503 significantly reduces the level of authorized federal funding for epas construction grants program it does this not because there is either a realization or a perception that we do not have water quality needs greater than those able to be addressed by a 2 4 billion funding level rather the conference report recognizes that in these times of special economic sensitivity the federal government is unable to spend as much money as some would like to address legitimate water quality problems at the same time the amendments to the clean water act made by h r 4503 continue to provide for stability and viability in our nations clean water program i believe that the house in passing the original provisions of h r 4503 and the conferees in fashioning the compromise embodied in this conference report were guided by a number of key concepts first the hallmark of our efforts was balance and consensus for too long we have attempted to solve our problems in an atmosphere of hostility and contentiousness and with this legislation we attempted to create a new and better precedent with respect to the development of essential environmental legislation second we never lost sight of how important it isand will continue to beto preserve and enhance the quality of our nations waters i am convinced that all of the conferees believe as i do that while we inherit the earth from our fathers we also borrow it from our children third even while we sought all possible ways of eliminating environmental hazards we were guided by the conviction that it is impossible for us to have a society that is without risk we recognized that our task must be to identify those risks that are socially acceptable that we willingly assume because the alternatives are far more damaging fourth we viewed achieving our clean water goals in a total or wholistic sense always seeking to balance our environmental objectives against equally important economic social and international purposes there was recognition that economic energy environmental and social objectives were not opposed to one another all must be coordinated in the attainment of the quality of life our people want and to which they are entitled fifth the policies we adopted were i believe founded on sound technical bases with assurance as to feasibility of implementation and with due regard for cost effectiveness implementation will allow for flexibility both in means and schedules to achieve our clean water goals sixth procedures were adopted to expedite decisionmaking in recognition of the fact that unnecessary delay harms botil the environment and the economy seventh we made a special concerted effort to find new and better ways of addressing our water pollution needs strong incentives were developed to create more cost effective resource efficient reliable solutions to our clean water problems eighth the clean water act establishes a national water pollution control program as such the conferees understood that the acet must recognize and be equipped to respond to the legitimate significant water pollution needs of all regions and areas of our country north and south east and west large and small urban and rural ninth because we were dedicated to lessening the heavy federal presence from every area of our nationallife we strived to limit federal intervention to those responsibilities which the national government is uniquely qualified to carry out we attempted to minimize the role that the federal government plays in attempting to solve our problems and emphasized instead reliance on institutions and individuals better equipped to deal with those problems and finally state and local governments were truly given a greater voice in determining environmental policy and a greater role in its administration with the enactment into law of h r 4503 there will be more flexibility in the use of funds given to the states for environmental programs where authority is assigned to state and local levels the delegation is intended to be a true one so that the process is made simple and is not simply the addition of another tier of regulation others have discussed in detail explanations of this confer ence reports provisions i would just like to add some clarification on a few of those provisions section 4 of the conference report directs the administrator of the environmental protection agency to make three grants for certain projects already in epas construction grants pipeline the first involves the expansion of the southeast sewage treatment plant located in the bayview hunters point area of san francisco in order to mitigate the odors noise and visual impacts and other adverse effects on the community identified in epas environmental evaluation of the proposed plant expansion it was agreed that a greenhouse skills training center would be constructed adjacent to the southeast sewage treatment plant the center is to be connected to the plant by pipes which will carry methane to heat the cent er in addition sludge from the treatment plant will be used as fertilizer for the greenhouse a favorable grant eligibility determination and commitment to a 15 million greenhouse skills training project was made on january 22 1981 by the california state water resources control board which acts as epas representative in determining grant eligibility in the state of california however although epa was fully aware of cswrcbs decisions it wa not until several months ago that epaincorrectly the conferees believeinformed san francisco that the greenhouse skills center would not be eligible for grant funding under the clean water act in the meantime the city and county of san francisco had begun construction of the expansion to the southeast sewage treatment plant the second matter intended to be covered by this section involves the greater eureka wastewater treatment project in the eureka project approximately 139 acres of property adjacent to the proposed eureka treatment plant are considered to be environmental mitigation for siting of the proposed treatment plant and holding pond on 16 acres of wetland the 139 acre site is to be dedicated as permanent open space and maintained and managed as a wetland wildlife area having the dual purpose of acting as a demonstration project to improve water quality while at the same time insuring restoration and enhancement of habitat values of a substantial wetland area on november 21 1980 the california state water resources control board issued its concept approval letter informing the city of eureka and the unitedstates environmental protection agency of its determination that the purchase of the 139 acres was grant eligible a little less than 2 weeks later on december 3 the city of eurekas mayor signed and accepted a step ii grant award subsequently epaagain incorrectly we believeoverturned cswrcbs determination and advised the city that acquisition of the 139 acres was not eligible for federal grant funds both of these cases involve epas krefusal to abide by the grant eligibility determination made by the duly appointed agency of a state having construction grants program delegation responsibilities both involve mitigation measures arising from the construction of a granteligible treatment works both situations involve costs associated with an integral part of the underlying grant eligible treatment works in both instances epa erred in refusing to abide by the cswrcbs grant eligibility determination the third project covered by section 4 of the conference report involves what the conferees believe was the need to provide innovative and alternative grant funding for the vascular plant reverse osmosis technology that the city of san diego is proposing for its sewage treatment recycling system section 8 of the conference report deals with providing strong incentives for the use of innovative and alternative technologies and processes as author of the original innovative and alternative technology provisions in the 1977 clean water act i am particularly heartened that the conferees agree that these provisions constitute an important opportunity to make our nations clean water program more cost effective and environmentally beneficial during oui water resources subcommittee hearings on this con~truction grants reform legislation epa testified that to date epa has found that for each dollar invested in the innovative and alternative technology program to provide this incentive 6 is saved in project costs the i a provision contained in this conference report will i am convinced continue this excellent fiscal track record i would just like to highlight one last provision of the conference report section 10 provides a new scheme for federal funding of reserve capacity of special note scction 10 also has the effect of repealing the industrial cost exclusion ice provision of the act section 10 provides that any grant made after november 15 1981 for a publicly owned treatment works will include funding for industrial capacity on the same basis as residential capacity this is a most important provision and is one that was overwhelmingly supported by the house in different form on two separate occasions earlier this year allow me to make one additional point i am convinced that perhaps more than in any other area focusing on the tremendous wealth of talent that exists throughout our nation offers the promise of the best water quality return for our constructiongrants program investment it is a matter of investing in our nations infrastructure i spoke earlier about our national need to reinvest in our infrastructure there i was speaking of capital infrastructure here im talking about something else something perhaps far more important im talking about our political our problemsolving our people infrastructure i have long believed that the best government is the one closest to the people there it is less costly more accountable and more responsible to peoples needs but over the years i believe our people have lost sight somewhat of this fact we have had too much of a tendency to look to someone else to solve our problems to let the federal government dothings for us in the process we have lost many of the most effective solutions to our problems and a great deal of control over our destinies we have let our people infrastructure deteriorate this situation must be reversed nationwide we can begin by truly returning the power and responsibility of government back where it belongs to the hands of the people in this way best of all we will achieve our clean water and other legitimate national objectives i am convinced that the conference agreement on h r 4503 takes a major step in this direction i therefore strongly support its passage today and urge all of my colleagues to do likewise"], [0.00020125508308410645, 0.4997987449169159, 0, "i rise in support of h r 6542 which would prohibit the leasing and development of oil and gas in our nations wilderness system although the bill lacks certain provisions which i would have preferred to see included such as clarification of the status of certain lands outside the wilderness system i nevertheless supported this legislation in committee and i vote for it today because of a strong personal belief that congressionally designated wilderness areas should be offlimits to oil and gas leasing and development at this time this has been my position for more than a year dating back to the disclosure that hundreds of lease applications had been filed on wilderness lands including wyomings washakie wildernessa 686 584acre region in northwestern wyoming adjacent to yellowstone national park which was set aside by congress several years ago as a component of the national wilderness preservation system our national parks and wilderness areas are special places which deserve preservation and protection from development i believe and i think most people agree that oil and gas development could be potentially destructive to the physical characteristics of these areas and that it would be incompatible with the esthetic and scenic attributes which motivated the congress in the first place to single out these areas for special status therefore i strongly support that portion of h r 6542 which prohibits leasing in designated wilderness areas this action will place the congress clearly on record ending the speculation and uncertainty that currently previals as to the legal responsibilities of the government under the 1964 wilderness act with respect to leasing in wilderness areas at the same time i wish to make clear my disappointment that the committee refused when considering this legislation to provide the same kind of clear guidance and management certainty with regard to lands which have been studied for wilderness potential but not included in the wilderness system for too long too much land has remained in uncertain management status in the wake of the forest services rare i and rare ii wilderness inventories this legislation should have addressed this problem attempts to raise this legitimate area of concern during committee consideration of the bill were ruled nongermane thus precluding a full and open discussion and a vote on the record the point is that the purpose of this legislation is to prevent leasing and development in areas set aside by congress as wilderness however the bill withdraws from leasing not only designated areas but also propsed areas and lands under study which may eventually be proposed as wilderness pending congressional action on their status yet there is nothing in the bill that would impel the congress to determine the wilderness status of these lands in a timely fashionsuch as a date in the future on which these lands would again become available for leasing in the event of congressional inaction in other words certain lands are withdrawn without benefit of congressional decision as to whether or not they should be added to the wilderness system and certain other lands could automatically be withdrawn from leasing merely by virtue of their being recommended for designation as wilderness at the end of a study process congress needs to fulfill its responsibility to make a decision one way or the other on the wilderness status of these lands so that they can be considered in the forest planning process and managed according to their particular attributes instead these lands are in management limbo in an effort to address this problem of management uncertainty in my own state i have joined with wyomings two senators to introduce the wyoming wilderness act of 1982 our wyoming bill has three major objectives first like the bill we are considering today it would withdraw all congressionally designated wilderness areas in wyoming from leasing in this regard our bill goes a step further than the lujanseiberling bill by also withdrawing wyoming wilderness areas from operation of the mining laws subject to valid existing rights effective upon enactment second our bill would add several hundred thousand additional acres of national forest lands in wyoming to the wilderness system and third it would release remaining forest lands from their current uncertain status and include them in the forest planning process it is the hope of the wyoming congressional delegation that our bill can be enacted yet this year i would like to make one other point about wyomings contributions both to the nations wilderness system and to the effort to achieve energy sufficiency currently about 25 percent of wyomings national forest system has been designated as wilderness more than 2 million acres of some of the nations most spectacular wilderness country is in wyoming and if the wyoming congressional delegations bill is enacted our contribution to the wilderness system will increase by several hundred thousand acres we in wyoming are proud of our national parks and wilderness areas and we mean to preserve and protect them we are also proud of our contribution to the nations energy supply for many years the oil and gas resources of wyoming have helped fuel the american economy and they continue to do so there are enormous coal resources in wyoming which we have only begun to tap there are extensive uranium deposits and a variety of other important minerals since half of wyoming is owned by the federal government most of these resources lie beneath federally owned landsnational forest and bureau of land management lands it is the view of most wyoming people that we should continue to encourage the development of these resources which contribute to the nations enermy security and benefit the economy of the state it is also the view of most people that wyomings national parks and wilderness areas which comprise less than 10 percent of the states land should be protected from development these lands should be offlimits to leasing and that is why i support the legislation before us today the remaining federally owned lands in wyoming should be managed according to the several laws already on the books and according to their particular attributes for many areas that should mean allowing leasing and others kinds of public uses but the land planning and management re sponsibilities of the various landmanaging agencies cannot be met until congress fulfills its responsibility to make a decision on the status of federally owned lands the bill before us today represents one important decision that wilderness areas will be offlimits to mineral leasing now it is time for congress to get on with the job of determining the status of millions of acres still in limbo"],

worried about the future of a program that has provided income security to americans for nearly half a century during his campaign for the presidency mr reagan promised that he would preserve the social security system as a safety net we now see that this was just so much more campaign rhetoric already mr reagan and his chief budget slasher david stockman have succeeded in eliminating the 122 minimum benefit this will hurt nearly 3 million americans at the bottom of the economic ladder now the administration is attempting to panic the congress into making benefits to most americans who have come to believe in the integrity of the system and to rely on it for security the president has proposed cutting 88 billion in early retirement disability and other benefits by 1986 attempting to frighten the american people into believing that the social security system will go broke unless he has his way this is a blatant example of overkill the measures proposed by the white house to protect the social security system it is clear that the president is interested in protecting something other than social security the tax bill that tie stampeded congress into accepting is guaranteed to produce huge budget deficits so he can keep his campaign promise to balance the budget by 1984 there is no question that the gigantic tax cut for the rich will reduce revenues and will require budget cuts beyond anything so far proposed reducing social security benefits is just another way to achieve these cuts some measures must be taken to insure social securitys immediate future but they need not be nearly as drastic as the white house proposes social security supports three separate programseach financed by a separate trust fund they are financed by a payroll tax on earningscurrently 6 65 percent for employees and 6 65 percent for employers up to a maximum of 29 775 a year first there is the old age and survivors insurance program that pays benefits to retired workers and their dependents and survivors next there is the disability insurance program that pays benefits to disabled workers and their dependents finally there is the health insurance program which is part a of the medicare program which pays for doctors bills is finance4 by monthly premiums paid by those enrolled in the program and from general tax revenues because i have encountered considerable confusion regarding some other programs i would like to set the record straight the supplemental security income program which provides a basic level of income for the aged blind and disabled is run by the social security aministration but is not part of the social security program it is paid for by general revenue tax funds and not from any of the social security trust funds a person does not have to work under social security to be eligible for ssi benefits this used to be called the old age assistance program when it was run by the states until a few years ago funds for the aid to the families with dependent children program afdc also come from general tax funds and are in no way related to social security it has surprised me to discover that many people think the programs are somehow related neither is the civil service retirement system related to social security this retirement system is funded by contributions from federal employees who are not covered by social security and matching funds from the employing agencies the social security program does have some problems that must be solved but solutions do not require the kind of severe remedies that the president has proposed in the past few years we have had historically high rates of inflation accompanied by high unemployment moreover wage rates have fallen behind price increases as a result social security has been paying out more and not collecting as much as had been anticipated it is expected that the economic picture will improve and that the social security outlook will brighten as well for the next 30 or 40 years until longrange problems begin to take hold it is apparent to me that this administration wants to mislead the public on the social security issue to achieve its own ends all through the tax debate mr reagan used the most optimistic economic assumptions to argue his case in his social security proposals he uses the very worst economic assumptions he cant have it both ways depending on which he wants to advance i dont want to mislead the people into thinking that there are no problems with the social security program the longrun problems are very serious they result from the fact that the population is aging at a time when the birthrate is declining social security is a payasyougo program where active workers pay the benefits of retired workers it is predicated on an everexpanding work force and today that work force is not growing what the reagan administration wants to do is solve the problems of the next century in the next few years none of us knows what is going to happen in the 21st century as in our private lives most of the things we worry about so much never happen none of us knows what the economic conditions will be like 30 or 40 years from now perhaps we will develop new energy sources that will expand our productive capacity beyond our wildest imagination we would not recklessly leap into solving predicted longrange problems when to do so will cause injury to millions of people right away the president wants to cut billions in benefits out of the program in the near future by discouraging early retirement 55 percent of full benefits rather than 80 percent allowed now at age 62 restricting eligibility for disability insurance limiting benefits to survivors and by taking other steps beyond what is needed it is not necessary to hurt millions of americans now when there is a good chance that such extreme measures will not be needed at allespecially if mr reagans assumptions for economic recovery should prove right in the meantime using the social security system to achieve shortterm economic ends such as a balanced budget is playing recklessly with the future of millions of americans there are a lot of things we can do we can amend the law to permit one fund to borrow from another we can allow the troubled old age and survivor insurance fund to borrow from the healthy medicare fund we can consider financing a portion of social security from general tax revenue funds there is an opportunity as well for creating standby loan authority from general funds whatever changes we decide to make should be thought through very carefully and should take effect sometime in the future we cannot simply say to americans who have spent all their working lives paying into a system that we are going to change the rules and they are going to have to make other arrangements do you say to a man or a woman 55 years old that they are going to have to start some kind of private fund for their retirement how much time do they have to build that fund many people made assumptions about retirement income based on social security they took out private insurance annuities and set up separate savings accounts or made other investments they figured out how much they would need based on how much they could expect from social security it would be heartless and unrealistic now to tell them they will have to find a way to increase their savings in the working years they have left working beyond 62 is fine for those people who want to and are able but recent studies by the social security administrat ion show that only 15 to 20 percent of those who opt out before 65 do so voluntarily most who retire before age 65 do so because of failing health or because they can no longer handle the job pressure in many cases the 62yearold worker who has labored 40 years in the steel mills or the auto plants is worn out if he works until he is 65 he may well be dead maybe that is what the administration is counting on there is something else to consider social security is a compact between the young and the old it was designed for a changing society where it is no longer possible for younger people to assume the responsibility of caring for their aged relatives because of changes in working and living conditions mr reagan wants us to return to the old world even though it is no longer possible if we fail to meet the income and medical needs of the older citizens we inevitably are going to shift this cost to the young who cannot afford it we would also create major problems in private pension funds that are tied to social security workers would demand higher employer contributions to make up the difference putting added pressure on price developments we simply cannot afford to destroy the confidence of a program that is so much a part of our society because we are worried about what might happen 30 or 40 years from nowor because mr reagan has gotten himself into an embarrassing revenue situation as the result of an illconceived tax bill"], [0.00020137429237365723, 0.49979862570762634, 0, "i rise in support of house joint resolution 341 the proposed waiver of law package submitted by president reagan to remove certain regulatory obstacles to the private financing of the alaskan natural gas pipeline with passage of the alaskan gas transportation act angta of 1976 congress made a clear statement to the effect that completion of the alaska natural gas pipeline was in the national interest in the intervening years i have seen no new evidence suggesting a need to revise this statement the alaskan gas pipeline is still a key component in our efforts to meet our energy needs in a selfsufficient and lesscostly manner the proven natural gas reserves located in the prudhoe bay region of alaska are estimated to be 26 trillion cubic feet or 13 percent of our domestic natural gas reserves furthermore there are 100 trillion p bic feet in potential reserves in alaska although natural gas production in the lower 48 can be expected to increase under gas price deregulation studies prepared for the pipeline consortia and energy projections made by the department of energy demonstrate that there will be a clear continuing need for natural gas by american consumers throughout the end of this century also gas production in the lower 48 will not be sufficient to meet that need indeed a shortfall will exist in the mid1980s even with access to alaskan natural gas clearly the proven gas reserves in alaska are something we cannot ignore the alternative to accessing alaskan gas in a timely and efficient fashion is continuing dependence on the importation of foreign oil the alaskan gas which will be shipped through the proposed transportation system will initially be able to replace 400 000 barrels of oil per day ulltimately when the system is operating at full capacity the gas will replace 600 000 barrels per day the resulting savings in payments for foreign oil will be 7 billion in the first year alone assuming a conservative 1987 price for oil of 50 a barrel with these facts before us the question we must answer is not whether we must access the alaskan natural gas but rather when and how i believe the alaskan natural gas pipeline will be the most efficient economical and safe method of transporting the natural gas from alaska to the regions of the lower 48 where it is most needed it is true that the initial cost of alaskan gas to the consumer will be high in the first years most assessments place the cost in the range of 9 20 to 9 35 per million btus in the early years however the effect of debt amortization over the 20 year life of the project will mean considerably lower gas prices for the consumer average costs deflated to 1980 dollars are projected to be in a range of 4 65 to 5 10 per million btus during the project life certainly these cost figures will be highly competitive with the rising cost of oil and alternative energy forms at the end of this decade and through the next in fact the cost of natural gas shipped through the pipeline system works out to about one half of the projected average btu delivered cost of oil over the same period and this does not figure in the cost of the continued purchase of foreign oil on our balance of trade sheet to those who are concerned that ultimately financial participation by the federal government will be required let me be clear this pipeline will be a privately financed project if it is to go forward there is no question it is a massive project if the decision is made eventually in the private sector to finance it the gas pipeline will be the largest and most ambitious project to ever be financed privately the pipeline will cross 4 800 miles of arctic and nonarctic terrain in the united states and canada it will provide at least 16 000 american jobs and will have the capacity to deliver between 2 billion and 3 2 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day the total cost for completion of the project could run as high as 54 billion in 1987 dollars is it not reasonable that the investment community and the pipeline participants would be sensitive to the regulatory climate and the many factors which have a bearing on the viability of the project as a whole certainly the obstacles to private financing of such a project as this would be great but not impossible in an unregulated envirdrnent however present laws and regulations are so rigid and restrictive that any favorable decision by the private sector is automatically precluded regulations imposed by the federal government and congress have molded the market an set conditions on any private financing arrangements which alter some very common business practices for instance in the matter of prebilling public utilities ordinarily pass on the cost of constructing nuclear facilities while construction is in process and no power is being delivered the practice is common in business though it has never been a part of energy transportation financing procedures nevertheless acceptance of this waiver package still affords maximum protection to the consumer since there are strict limits placed on when and how prebilling can begin all subject to a federal energy regulatory commission ferc decision the package also does not decrease the risk to the pipeline participants but maintains a high incentive to complete the project and to complete it on time the transmission companies will have invested at least 8 billion the oil and gas companies at least 9 billion that is a total of 17 billion they stand to lose if the pipeline is never completed and gas never flows therefore i urge acceptance of this waiver package in arder to allow the private sector to make a decision based on the true merits costs and risks of the alaskan gas pipeline venture"], [0.00020137429237365723, 0.49979862570762634, 0, "i want to congratulate the subcommittee on an outstanding bill particularly out late chairman an outstanding young man from

going back and looking at all of the history of the st lawrence seaway and the great lakes this congress has had an outstanding record of history in the development of that project in respect to our growth it is a program that was developed under the truman and eisenhower years by the way through the national security council i read all of the congressional testimony way back then when president eisenhower called upon congressman george dondero from michigan and senator wiley from wisconsin and developed the basic st lawrence seaway corporation at this present time the great lakes serves as a useful tool mainly to canada the midwest does not utilize the great lakes to its maximum potential so in looking at the possible future modernization both from an environmental standpoint and widening standpoint we cannot get the great lakes usage because the great seagoing vessels are too wide in order to get through the locks like the welland canal consequently concerning the present status of

effort with the authorization committee and other members of interest not only to the midwest but to the whole united states and in a partnership with canada in developing further improvement that is

percent of its capacity and usage and the united states only 30 percent in the midwest we are losing a great deal of what i consider competitive product delivery in the world trading market because the canadians are bringing a great deal of products up by rail into canada and shipping out overseas by boat consequently we are losing a competitive edge not only as a partner with canada but more importantly with other countries in the world so i would like to suggest later on that we continue in our transportation studies i have read about 30 different management marketing consulting studies in the great lakes region by various consulting firms that we have paid through contract through this bill and other appropriate public works bills and in looking at the development of public works projects through the corps of engineers i would just like to say in closing that i would hope that congress in our partnership with canada continually look to upgrade and modernize the st lawrence seaway because at one time more tonnage passed through the st lawrence seaway than any passageway in the entire world i think from a competitive standpoint that we ought to address that issue i am very happy that this committee is beginning to recognize that what i call phase 1 of looking at that future development possibility it would be my hope that the committee continue that support and i would encourage a bipartisan effort to improve and develop the great lakes and use it at a maximum potential and still be environmentally sound i rise in support of this legislation which makes appropriations for the department of transportation and related agencies for the coming fiscal year the bill is a wellbalanced approach to the transportation needs of america and stands as a tribute to the late chairman of the house transportation appropriations subcommittee adam benjamin under chairman benjamins leadership the subcommittee has approved funding recommendations addressing the needs of public mass transportation the interstate highway system the activities of the united states coast guard and americas railroad system chairman benjamin and the distinguished ranking republican of the subcommittee congressman cougnlrn recognize the fundamental importance of meeting americas transportation needs in many respects the variety of transportation methods made available to the american public and business is taken for granted our interstate highway system is the best in the world and has fostered the economic growth of america americas railroads continue to provide reliable efficient transportation of american commerce to a large degree the growth and expansion of the american economy occurred only because of americas transportation system and during this current period of economic sluggishness in america it is absolutely essential that transportation remain funded at adequate levels i believe the appropriations recommendations of the subcommittee on transportation adequately fund the activities of the department of transportation however i also believe that more needs to be done before the transportation systems of the united states can both contribute to and lead an economic recovery the interstate transportation system continues to demand funds for maintenance without attention to problems of deteriorating highways and secondary roads the efficiency and competitive costs of transporting goods will be reduced 1 also believe the congress must maintain as a priority funds for mass transit urban and rural bus systems for example in the state of michigan continue to provide essential service in cities like jackson and ann arbor in both of these communities public transportation is provided for the elderly the handicapped and the working commuter and finally i believe congress must continue to explore methods by which americas waterways can contribute to the national and international flow of goods this years transportation appropriations report contains language expressing the interest of the subcommittee in taking actions to enhance the economic viability of the st lawrence seaway especially those actions which will make the needs of the seaway more visible again i offer my support for passage of this measure and express my appreciation for the work of our late chairman adam benjamin congressman coughlin our subcommittees ranking republican is also to be congratulated for his effectiveness in shaping this bill"], [0.00020137429237365723, 0.49979862570762634, 1, "a heavy responsibility has been laid on all of us in this chamber today in the name of budgetary restraint we are called upon to defer and even dismantie a broad range of federal programs long regarded as essential to the wellbeing of our society but before we come to a decision on these proposals i believe it is imperative that we examine most carefully the mechanism that has been offered for arriving at that decision the reconciliation process the members should understand clearly that if this mechanism is accepted on this issue it will have a significant and i submit unfortunate impact on the way in which congress legislates now and in the future in formulating the congressional budget act the reconciliation concept was suggested by charles schultze who proposed that congress use the same method for finalizing its budget as is used by the executive branch the legislative history also supports the position that reconciliation was intended to implement the determinations made in the second or final budget resolution for a fiscal year but that was not the case last yearthe first time reconciliation was implemented on the spending sidenor is it the situation this year there are those who say that in these unprecedented economic times reconciliation is a necessary procedure but it must also be said that inclusion of reconciliation in the first budget resolution significantly diminishes the responsibilities of thq authorizing comnmittees for making policy decisions in a meaningful fashion it precludes meaningful analysis forecloses debate imposes serious time constraints and serves to undermine rather than strengthen the overall lekislative and budget processes if it is the decision of congress to reduce federal spending then so be it but i do not believe the mechanism for that decision should be reconciliation in the first budget resolution nor should reconciliation in any spending resolution call for spending reductions in the mutyears neither approach is contemplated by the budget act reconciliation was designed to bring spending in line with the budget ceiling for a particular year not future years section 310 of the budget act is clear on this as is section 301 b 2 which specifically limits ireconciliation to the enactment of spending legislation for the coming fiscal year we can achieve the reductions necessary in fiscal years 198284 by lowering the total budget ceilings for those years when we enact the budget resolutions attempting to force those reductions now prior to consideration of thle budget resolution for those years does violence to the budget act and robs congress of the flexibility it must have if federal spending is to be controlled and sound fiscal policy achieved in addition it is my understanding that the senate budget committee has directed the senate committees to cut through the reconciliation process authorization as wvell as direct spending programs in some cases this involves reductions in programs which have not as yet been authorized in all cases it involves matters which fall within the spending jurisdiction of the appropriations committees and should not under the budget act be targeted for reduction by the authorizing committees i for one hope that this house would resist anymovement in this direction in the upcoming conference on the budget resolution one of the primary purposes of the budget act was to fashion a process whereby the authorization and appropriation committees would make spending and fiscal decisions in an orderly and meaningful manner however that is not the situation we see today nearly 71 years after the adoption of the budget act recognizing this i believe that the time is now ripe to begin work on making the budget process an even more useful exercise by reaffirming the intended role of the authorizing committees in talking to other members i know that there is great interest in doing so and i am committed to wvorking with all members to insure thle success of that effort i would now like to address the issues contained in the socalled grammlatta substitute which are of concern to the committee on public works and transportation the funding levels assumed for some of our major program areas and the reconciliation instructions given to our committee with respect to public works issues the grammlatta substitute differ from the budget committee resolution in three specific program areas urban mass transit operating subsidies adap and the economic developmnent administration in function 400 transportation the grammlatta substitute reduces the administrations proposals for mass transit operating subsidies for fiscal year 1982 by 260 million in budget authority and 130 million in outlays through acceleration of the phaseout for these subsidies coiiversely the house budget committee resolution while assuming the presidents spending level for fiscal year 1982 rejects the phaseout and proposes for fiscal year 1983 an additional 400 million in budget authority and 200 million in outlays and for fiscal year 1984 750 million in budget authority and 500 million in outlays in function 450 community and regional development the graninilatta substitute restores for fiscal year 1982 100 million in budget authority and 12 million in outlays to thle administrations proposals for eda cvelopment loan and other grant programs it goes on however to assume its termination at the end of fiscal year 1982 thle budget committee resolution assumes for fiscal year 1982 a funding level of 350 million in budget authority and 100 million in outlays with sufficient funding for fiscal years 1983 and 1984 the grammlatta substitute also assumes thle administrations figures for adap 450 million in fiscal year 1982 and 324 million in budget authority for the airport trust funds facilities and equipment program the budget committee assumed in its resolution 750 million and 400 million respectively for these programs in all three instances i believe that the budget committees resolution more accurately strikes a balance between spending cuts and program needs of equal concern to me is the reconciliation directive contained in thle orammlatta substitute unlike the budget committee resolution it directs the committee on public works and transportation to achieve cuts in authorizations as well as spendinga practice which i have already indicated has raised a number of concerns on the senate side in addition it imposes on our committee an almost impossible task to address by june 15one short month awaylegislation in the area of eda regional commission highway safety mass transit operating subsidies federalaid highways epa construction grants tva and army corps of engineers water project construction grants just in the area of highways for example it must be said that it has always been our committees intention to undertake next year a comprehensive review of the whole federalaid highway program how are we to address in 1 month the needs and concerns of this program or any other and really do justice to the legislative process to do so i submit would turn the dream the president spoke of last tuesday evening into a nightmare i do not challenge the immediate need for restraint in this budget i ask only that in making our decisions we use a little discretion we have an enormous capital investment in the american economic structure that ii 1740 c cannot and must not be sacrificed for illusory shortterm benefits it is precisely because i share the presidents vision of a revitalized reindustrialized america that i urge continued adequate funding for the public works programs in which so much of our national treasure has been invested reductions across the whole range of federal activities may indeed be necessary at this time but they should not fall disproportionately upon the very programs on which rests all hope of longterm lasting economic stability private enterprise cannot do its job without a functioning system of public highways airports and airways mass transit water and sewer lines and a host of other services which government alone can provide but the sad truth is that this complex system is breaking down today because we have failed to protect our capital investment today our funding of public works as a percentage of the gross national product is less that half of what it was in 1965 1 the interstate highway system now almost completed after 25 years and some 80 billion of public money is wearing out faster than it can be repaired just about 1 in every 10 miles of the system is in need of immediate resurfacingand that is the very best of our highways bridges all over the country are collapsing sewers and water lines are rotting away city transit systems are breaking down billions of dollars in coal for export pile up in antiquated seaports and our airports are congested almost beyond belief for lack of development funds mr chairman i refuse to believe that this congress will accept as its public works policy build it and forget it the people of this nation have invested their toil and treasure in the public works foundations of our economy it is up to the congress now to protecl that investment i am happy to yield to the chairman of our economic development subcommittee the gentleman from minnesota"], [0.00020137429237365723,

resolution for fiscal year 1982 will be the most important decisions of the 97th congress the type of budget resolution which will soon be adopted by this body will in a large measure determine the future course of this nation this administration contends that the american people on november 4 1980 gave ronald reagan a mandate to reduce federal spending cut taxes and slow inflation op february 18 1981 the president reacted to this socalled mandate by producing perhaps the most revolutionary budget document which this nation has ever seen the budget revealed by the presidentnow embodied in the grammlatta substituteprovides millions more for the most prosperous in our nation while pennies are taken away from the poor in the name of 1econamic recovery the budget revealed by the president would pad the pentagon with over 50 billion in new money for ships and other weapons for which we lack the skilled manpower to build and operate in the name of national security the administration budget would take away a 46cent meal from a food stamp recipient household or a ceta job from a high school dropout in the name of reducing inflation it is hard for me to understand the nature of a mandate in which a cold and callous insensitivity for the poor the disadvantaged the handicapped the elderly and the unemployed in our society is disguised as maintaining a social safety net for the truly needy to this date no one in this administration has yet defined this illusory term truly needy i do not believe that the american people mandaited the dismantlement of government by thiq means indeed ihe cbc has met the president headon by accepting his challenge to propose measures which offer a greater chance of balancing the budget reducing and eliminating inflation stimulating the creation of jobs and reducing the tax burden most importantly the cbc substitute accomplishes the economic goals which president reagan purports to address except that we do it with humaneness and compassion our substitute offers a greater chance for addressing the economic ills of this nation time and time again we have heard administration officials members of congress and bureaucrats recite how federal deficit spending causes inflation yet the administration budget or grammlatta substitute provides for a huge 50 billion deficit while the congressional black caucus does not subscribe to the tenet that a deficit creates inflation the cbc substitute amendment provides for a 7 85 billion surplus in fiscal year 1982 in a fiscally sound manner the cbc substitute offers the taxpayers a greater chance by rejecting the reagan administration tax cuts under the reagan plan 19 percent of the taxpayers with iincomes of 30 000 and above receive 61 percent of the tax relief while the 63 percent of the taxpayers with incomes below 20 000 receive only 18 percent of the tax relief the cbc rejects this economic shell game which redistributes income from the poor and middle class to the rich our substitute takes bold new steps toward innovative and comprehensive tax reforms our substitute offers the largest and fairest tax cut for the working poor and the middle class by increasing the standard deductiontaken by 60 percent of american taxpayersby indexing the tax code to control bracket creep and by increasing the earned income tax credit our substitute provides for a different approach to business incentives to stimulate capital formation and productivity by adopting a firstyear capital cost recovery system for business which has been endorsed by fortune magazine the new york times and the public interest tax research group our substitute generates ovvr 44 billion in additional revenue by ending wasteful and unproductive tax subsidies andl loopholes which only add to the federal deficit the cbc substitute offers the nation a greater chance by reflecting compassion and concern for our most precious resourcethe american people somewhere in the budget slashing hysteria we have forgotten that the people are the most important resource that we have we have forgotten that our government is here to serve the peopleall the people in this nation somewhere along the line we have gotten lost in a maze of cold statistics and numbers and percentagesforgetting about the human experience that lies beyond those numbers you forget that we live in a nation where government supposedly exists of the people by the people for the people i hope that before the final vote on this budget resolution that you will take the opportunity to walk the streets and see the multitude of our young people who are out of work contrary to some myths this is not because they do not want to work but rather because they lack the training and the opportunities to gain meaningful employment the caucus substitute may mean the difference between thousands of young people wasting their lives away or a cadre of young people who will have the basic skills to obtain productive employment i hope that befljre the final vote on this budget resolption that you will go grocery shoppipig with a welfare mother on food stamps you might get a vivid picture of how difficult it is for the 22 million americans on food stamps to purchase nutrtional food for a family on a limited budget the grammlatta substitute would take away nickels and dimes from food stamp benefits when pennies may make the difference for a poor food stamp recipient under our substitute a welfare mother on food stamps will not have to choose between eggs or milk or between bread or butter as members of congress you and i know that we get free medical care right here in this capital or in bethesda naval hospital other americans are not privileged to the best doctors for free it is in recognition of this type of reality that the cec substitute provides a full 75 1 billion for health care spending let me elaborate in this area a bit currently over 28 million elderly persons receive health care under medicare the elderly are sick more frequently and for more prolonged periods of time than the rest of the population of every 100 persons age 65 and over 80 suffer some kind of chronic ailment 10 suffer from impaired vision and 17 have hearing impairment sixteen of every one hundred persons age 65 and older are hospitalized one or more times annually the elderly require three times as many days of hospital care every year as persons under the age of 65 for most of our senior citizens illness strikes most often and with greatest severity at the time in life when incomes are most limited millions of our older citizens cannot afford the health care that they need it is a sad commentary on our society when many of our aged are forced to choose between seeing a doctor or getting a prescription filled or whether they will spend the money for food or warmth the cbc substitute protects funding for medicare since the enactment of medicaid in 1965 life expectancy of all races and sexes has increased and infant mortality rates have decreased clearly the medicaid program has helped nevertheless 23 million black americans still endure poorer health care higher death rates lower life expectancy and a reduced sense of wellbeing than the white population the shocking fact is that only half of the poor people in this country are eligible for medicaid benefits thirteen million children are supposed to receive physical checkups medical and dental care under medicaid yet 1 out of 3 american children has never seen a dentist one in seven has no access to regular health care the caucus substitute protects medicaid benefits for the poor andsick in our society under the grammlatta substitute which incorporates a cap on medicaid spending many states if not most would have to slash medicaid eligibility and benefits in fact many states are already doing so our nation leads the world in terms of biomedical research in fiscal year 1981 we will spend over 3 billion for this purpose yet we still do not have adequate treatment for cancer we have not found a way to cure diabetes we do not know how to prevent a myriad of diseases which cripple and debilitiate our people our substitute protects funding for these important research activities millions of americans suffer from the wrenching problems of mental illness alcohol and drug abuse a presidential commission on mental health acknowledged and lamented the fact that we have neither adequate services or trained manpower to properly treat these problems our substitute aussumes that we at least maintain current levels of spending for mcntal health services research and training minorities are severely underrepresented in the health professions for example blacks comprise fewer than 3 percent of lhe nations physicians and dentists and pharmacists less than 4 percent of podiatrists less than 1 percent of veterinarians and optometrists the cbc substitute provides funding for the federal programs which were designed to address thes~e fundamental inequities let me say that the bottom line is that the ci3c substitute meets the human capital needs of this nationin health education employment income security science and technologybetter than any other proposal before you the caucus substitute offers proof that the budget can be balanced goveminent spending decreased our national security maintained and tax relief granted without harming those less fortunate in our society who depend upon federal social programs a vote for the caucus substitute is a vote for america"], [0.00020137429237365723, 0.49979862570762634, 1, "i rise in support of the fauntroy substitute the congressional black caucus once again has presented an alternative budget plan that offers this nation the promise of strong economic recovery rather than the continued pain of unemployment high interest rates and runaway deficts this alternative is necessitated by the fact that this current administration continues to make excuses for its bankrupt economic policies which are bankrupting our nation we are told to just wait intil our economic recovery program takes effect we have been waiting now for 8 months with these results interest rates are the highest in history 16 million americans are either out of work working parttime or so discouraged that they no longer even look for work the housing industry is in the worst condition since world war ii business failures and farm foreclosures are running at the highest levels since the great depression this litany could go on and on but suffice it to say that if the congress had enacted last year the congressional black caucus economic recovery plan instead of president reagans we would not be suffering the economic contractions that are now wreaking havoc with our nation there is no joy however in pointing out that the congressional black caucus last year predicted the misery and human suffering that would occur as a result of the adoption of the reagan economic program the reagan record hs all too clearly shown that the congressional black caucus was right the congressional black caucus is right again this year we have once again met the presidents challenge to put up or shut up we put up once again a fair and sound budget proposal which will rescue our nation from devastating and debilitating deficits unemployment and economic stagnation the fauntroy alternative controls federal spending not by pushing millions more americans into poverty not by a continued assault on the nations young disadvantaged and poor but by an assault on wasteful military spending extravagant tax breaks to wealthy citizens and irresponsible tax subsidies for profitable corporations the fauntroy substitute rejects the reagan economic shell game which redistributes income from the poor and middle class to the rich more than any other alternative the cbc alternative embodies creative and comprehensive tax reformstopping the raid on the federal treasury through tax breaks for those who least need them rather the cbc alternative restructures the presidents tax cut to principally benefit those earning less than 50 000 per year moreover our alternative provides real tax relief to the poor and middle class by increasing the standard deduction and earned income tax credit the fauntroy substitute proves that fiscal responsibility can be achieved while maintaining compassion and concern for the american people by implementing tax reform and by reducing military expenditures the cbc budget would reduce the projected fiscal year 1983 deficit to 97 billion by 1985 a surplus of 4 2 billion would result let me emphasize once again that fiscal responsibility need not come at the expense of the poor and disadvantaged in our society the republican party platform for 1980 said the measure of a countrys compassion is how it treats the least fortunate yet we now know that this republican administration has systematically dismantled every program which was created to serve our least fortunate under the cbc budget the american tradition of compassion and concern for the needy and destitute would be restored to address the totally unacceptable rate of unemployment among our people the cbc alternative includes 6 billion for a desperately needed jobs program to train and put people who want to work back to work additionally the cbc budget restores funding for important education programs such as title 1 and student financial aid in order to maintain an investment in our human capital and in our future by educating our young people other vital national needs in housing social services and transportation which the reagan budget fails miserably to address are best met under the cbc alternative budget in short there is a way to move this nation toward the goal of reduced inflation without throwing millions of americans out of work there is a way to reduce the federal deficit without taking school lunches away from hungry children and snatching costofliving adjustments from the elderly there is a way to lower interest rates and to restore confidence in our economy without slamming the door on thousands of small businessmen and farmers the way is the fauntroy substitute i have a special concern in the area of health care and waut to discuss with my colleagues the cbc alternative budget proposals in this regard the fauntroy subutitute recommends that 85 5 billion be spent on health care programs in fiscal year 1p83 in order to provide the resources necessary to treat and prevent disease care for sick workers mothers children and the elderly this amount is a full 7 5 billion more than the reagan budget and 5 5 oillion more than the budget committee alternative as cochairman of the congressional black caucus health brain trust i enjoy the benefit of the special expertise of hundreds of experienced health care professionals throughout the country these health care professionals are appalled and rightly so about the ruthless impact of last years budget cuts on the ability of poor and disadvantaged americans to obtain high quality medical care it is all too obvious that the great progress that we have made in the last decade in expanding the availability and affordability of health care from inner city communities to isolated rural towns is swiftly being undermined last year 1 billion was slashed from the medicaid program forcing states to cut benefits and limit eligibility for the poor and working poor as a result over 1 million people lost med icaid coverage virtually all of the losers were women and children in lowincome families thousands of families with incomes at or below the poverty line when faced with overwhelming medical care costs have had to quit their meager paying jobs and go on welfare in order to keep or obtain vital medicaid coverage we believe that it is unconscionable to impose this type of pain and hardship on the poorest and most disadvantaged segment of the population the cbc budget therefore restores those cuts in medicaid imposed last year and maintains a basic level of medicald coverage for the millions of women children and lowincome famtlies who depend upon the government for basic health care similarly the fauntroy substitute restores cuts imposed last year in medicare and rejects any cuts for fiscal year 1983 more than 90 percent of medicare enrollees are senior citizens who have the greatest health care needs in this nation senior citizens have the highest percentage of heart attacks and the greatest number of strokes they are the individuals who for the most part have the greatest incidence of cancer and suffer the greatest incidence of crippling and debilitating disease moreover in addition to being the most sick the elderly suffer the double disadvantage of being sick and poor one out of six senior citizens is poor one out of every two black elderly is poor or marginally poor the cbc finds untenable any proposals which penalize our senior citizens and ask them to use their already limited resources to pay more for medical care the cbc also rejects as foolish and shortsighted any freeze in spendling on such vital health programs as maternal and child health alcohol drug abuse and mental health rervices health manpower and biomedical research additional spending in these areas now only serves to save money in the long run no where is the cost effectiveness of a strengthened federal investment in health care more evident than in the area of biomedical research the economic losses from illness and diseases which we still are unable to prevent and cure run into the billions of dollars last year i had the pleasure of hearing testimony from 10 nobel laureates who spoke about the fact that our nation is becoming scientifically and technologically illiterate they spoke about the need for more funding for biomedical research in order to maintain a leadership position in advancing new knowledge about medical care in order to continue progress in understanding the causes of disease and illness the cbc budget provides additional fundiqg to maintain a strong federal investment in biomedical research let us remember that the debate about health programs and out the larger federal budget is otri simply a debate about numbers and dollars and cents it is about human beingschildren parents elderly it is about their successes and failures it is about their hopes and dreams the cbc budget is an alernative which will allow all america te to enjoy human dignity and a high qusiity of life i urge my colleagues to support the fauntroy substitute"], [0.00020137429237365723, 0.49979862570762634, 1, "i rise in support of this agriculture appropriations bill first and foremost i commend the chairman the gentleman from mississippi for his tremendous job in putting together i think another great bill trying to meet some of the needs of the american farmer also i want to commend the ranking republican member the gentlewoman from nebraska and all members of the subcommittee with whom i have had the opportunity to work i would like to make one point in these few minutes which i have we hear a great deal of criticism by some people who do not know the facts when they say the american farmer has been subsidized i would like to make one point to all the people within the sound of my voice and the people across america and especially my colleagues in the house for far too long the american farmer has subsidized the american consumer why should i say that to my colleagues in the house let me give you two or three reasons why the american farmers today happen to be going through their third year of declining farm income at no other time in the history of our country except during the great depression has our farmer faced the third year of a declining farm income in this year of 1982 the american farmer will receive less in real noninflated dollars than at any time since that year of the great depression this year in 1982 we will have more farmers go bankrupt and leave the farm than in my entire lifetime yet in america we find not only the third year of declining farm income but in the last 2 years the land values have not increased with inflation and this year when inflation is down in real dollars we have land values that are less my friend from indiana mr meyers has been in the banking business and he knows that most farmers are out there on the land not for profit but because they love the land when they have lost the equity in their land because of deflated dollars then many financial institutions in this country cannot stay with the farm any more because their agricultural borrowers do not have the equity to refinance many of our american farmers today find that they cannot continue in business in my district onehalflet me repeatonehalf of the farmers are supplementing their farm income with offthefarm income in order to try to stay on the land and on the farm yet in our country the american consumer spends only 16 percent of the disposable income for food and fiber on the table for their families that compares to 25 percent in japan 37 percent in brazil 43 percent in india and over 50 percent in the soviet union has the american consumer got a good deal from the american farmer you had better believe it because the american farmer is subsidizing the american consumer and the food on their tables yet today our farmers find that for each 1 cash flow they have they have 13 of indebtedness september 21 1 982 is that very much let me show you something back in 1950 the farmer was in debt 1 for each 1 of cash flow back in 1960 for each 1 that the farmer had in cash flow he had 1 30 in debt but today for each 1 of cash flow that the american farmer has he has 13 indebtedness i would like to make this point the american farmer is receiving only about 50 percent of parity do you know the american farmer has invested in land and equipment an equivalent amount of dollars as the fortune 500 has invested in its production fortune 500 and the american farmers have about 1 2 trillion invested nearly the same yet the fortune 500 of this country made a profit of 80 billionplus last year and that is not very good to write home about but the american farmer only made a profit of around 20 billion let me point this out if the american farmer had received the like amount of net profit that the fortune 500 received the american farmer would be receiving 200 percent of parity is that equity is that fairness i predict to you that by the year 2000 when the agriculture bill comes up this chamber will be full and i predict to you that the press gallery will be full becaftse i think the great crisis that will occur by the year 2000 will be world hunger and the shame of it all is this that that problem can be solved by the american farmer it can be solved by this 3 3 percent of the people who are on the land making their living but it can be solved only if they can make a profit finally i want to draw the committees attention to that section of the committee report addressing the farmers home administrations proposal to close its county offices in love county and coal county in oklahoma farmers home is trying to cut operating expenses and that end is laudable but their means to achieve that end in oklahoma was to close five county offices in my congressional district in these times of an agriculture price and credit crisis their ends do not justify their means i worked diligently with the state director and the national administrator of farmers home to find alternatives to complete closure of the five offices in three instances we were able to find mutually acceptable alternatives but love county and coal county are exceptional cases the love county office supervises a large number of relatively small loan portfolios this is because there are a number of small marginal farmers and ranchers in that county the state director proposed to close that office and combine its caseload with an adjacent county which had a smaller number of loan applicants and outstanding loans this is not acceptable"]]}
