spoke on the floor about the 60th anniversary of what happened in montgomery when rosa parks with great courage refused to give up her seat on the bus the courage of that woman and all of those who supported her has made such an incredible difference in our country and it is indeed related to what i want to say about hiv and aids many of us had the privilege of knowing rosa parks when she worked for john conyers we honored her here in the house and are so proud that we have a statue of rosa parks in the capitol of the united states we think of her and we think of the courage she had which led to the civil rights act the voting rights act and that voting rights act and civil rights act led to our having a much more diverse congress of the united states from there came our congressional black caucus the hispanic caucus and the asian pacific caucus the black caucus directly related to mr conyers who was a founding member and rosa parks who was an inspiration they were responsible for so much change in the leadership of our congress and because so many issues spring from the congressional black caucus some say the conscience of the congress so the relationship from rosa parks through the caucus to now we are observing the 25th anniversary of world aids day the link is congresswoman barbara lee who has been such a champion in the congress on this subject we take great pride in the accomplishments she has had in her capacity as a member of congress but also as our representative to the united nations general assembly each year world aids day is observed internationally to reflect the progress that has been made in reaffirming our determination to banish aids to the annals of history we recognize that achieving an aidsfree generation requires our relentless energetic and undaunted commitment to testing treatment and finding a cure the world aids day theme this year the time to act is now challenges us to act with the urgency that this global epidemic demands aids as we know and the hiv virus is a ferocious and resourceful disease a resourceful virus evermutating to escape our efforts to destroy it therefore we have to be ferocious resourceful and adaptable in our effort to succeed to end hiv we must bring bold thinking and deep commitment to testing treatment and the search for a cure and a vaccine to prevent president bush with his pepfar initiative took a big advance in how we can help prevent the spread of aids in the rest of the world he and mrs bush with their pink ribbon red ribbon initiative to link cervical cancer prevention with hiv testing and treatment in africa was a remarkable initiative so we salute the bipartisanship we supported of course president bush with pepfar we wanted it bigger and he wanted it strong and there we were with something that has saved millions of lives and given hope to people i visited some of the clinics in africa where pepfar is being administered and some of the people i met there said i would never have come in to be tested before because there was no reason i had no hope that there would be any remedy or any maintaining of a quality of life that would have encouraged me to risk the stigma of saying that i was hivinfected so again it is all about the people in new york today bono will be observing the 10th anniversary of the one and red initiatives that have set out to alleviate poverty and eradicate disease with a heavy focus on hiv aids we know the work of the melinda and bill gates foundation and what they have done on this issue particularly in india i today also wish i could be in san francisco where amfar will be saluting the work at university of californiasan francisco on hiv aids by establishing a new initiative there i am just mentioning a few other observances of world aids day it is happening throughout the world if you go back a number of years when i came to congress we were going to two funerals a day it was the saddest thing now we are going to weddings and helping people make out their wills and all the rest because they have a longer life ahead the maintenance of life the quality of life is really important but we do want a cure so i said it was the 25th anniversary of world aids day i meant to say the 25th anniversary of the ryan white care act that young man whose name is something that is iconic to all of us left us but his mother carries on the tradition and it has made such a tremendous difference my colleague henry waxman who is no longer in the congress but is still a champion on hiv aids was so instrumental in leading us to passing that legislation so it has been bipartisan it is global it is personal it is urgent that we continue so that one day 50 years from now people will say what was aids what was that and the books will show that it was a terrible terrible tragedy that befell the worlds population regardless of status of wealth of gender or of race and something that is now buried in the news somewhere as a terrible memory but not a part of our future again as we observe world aids day may we all wear our red ribbons in sympathy with those who have lost their lives sadly before the science took us to a better place on this that is what we are counting on research and science to take us to a better place on this and also the enthusiasm determination and relentlessness of so many people throughout the world to make hiv aids a horrible horrible memory again but not part of our future"], [0.002007007598876953, 0.997992992401123, 1, "first let me thank congresswoman kelly for those very generous remarks but also for your tremendous leadership and for staying the course and making sure that we are here really speaking truth to power each and every week on behalf of the black caucus also to you congressman don payne thank you very much for your leadership and for really rising to the occasion on so many issues in the very short time that you have been here you have hit the ground running and really have made a tremendous difference i want to just speak for a few minutes as it relates to the review of the congressional black caucus for the last year or 2 years i have to just say that our leader mr butterfield has been a very bold and tremendous leader we have accomplished quite a bit and we have a lot more to do while 2015 has been very challenging i believe that the congressional black caucus has really stepped up and made a huge difference not only for the african american community and communities of color but for the entire country it has also been an inspiring year we have seen the birth and growth of the vital black lives matter movement we have also witnessed powerful and moving protests across the country in places like missouri new york and even in my district in oakland and in berkeley california with people of all backgrounds and ages coming together to demand justice to petition their government to exercise their democratic rights i am so proud of the young activists who are standing up and demanding an end to racism and injustice in many of our communities they are truly bringing the civil rights movement into the 21st century i want them to know that they have allies here in the peoples house for too long congress has ignored or brushed aside issues affecting the african american community and other communities of color it is past time that everyone steps up and does the good work that we were sent to washington to do that the congressional black caucus has done for many many decades we need to start by talking about and looking at what has happened with the voting rights act as you know this year marks the 50th anniversary of this landmark legislation the voting rights act was gutted by the supreme court in its shelby v holder decision and of course republican state legislators have fallen all over to restrict voting rights across the country everywhere these dangerous restrictions come in the form of voter id requirements elimination of sameday voter registration and really severe reduction in early voting efforts we must call these efforts for what they are republican attempts to take away one of our most fundamental rights but we will not let this happen i am so proud of the congressional black caucuscongresswoman terri sewell and john lewis and mr clyburn the entire congressional black caucus our bill h r 2867 the voting rights advancement act sponsored by congresswoman sewell who represents selma alabama would restore the preclearance provisions of the voting rights act for any state that has had 15 or more voting rights violations in the last 25 years in the preclearance process as dr king once said give us the ballot and we will fill our legislative halls with menand of course womenwith goodwill we can fill this body with those who really want to see democracy fulfilled so we need our young people to keep up the street heat and demand that congress act it is past time that we get serious about restoring the voting rights act and ensuring that all americansand that means all americanshave free and unobstructed access to the ballot box also the serious economic disparities that persist in the african american community are very very evident according to a report released earlier this year by the joint economic committee led by ranking member congresswoman carolyn maloney and the congressional black caucus we learned and it is very glaring that more than one in three black children are born into poverty and the african american poverty rate is three times that of white americans the cycle of poverty and inequality starts in our school systems where black students account for 42 percent of preschool student expulsions despite accounting for only 18 percent of enrollment now that is preschool expulsion every time i remember this and say this it really makes me very terrified about what is taking place with young black kids especially with young black boys because there is no way anybody no kids should be expelled from preschool that is ages 1 to 4 that is outrageous i am the mother yes of two fabulous great black men and i am the grandmother of two black boys and i find statistics like that very very troubling for african americans we have allowed our school system to be turned into a pipeline to prison we must act now to address systemic issues facing our education and our criminal justice systems i want to applaud congressman bobby scott and congressman conyers because they have worked for decades on criminal justice reform and we are beginning to see some progress as a result of their very diligent work our criminal justice system is broken it needs to be rebuilt from the ground up so alongside of our cbc colleagues once again we are calling for comprehensive criminal justice reform also i want to mention our effort which i cochair with chairman butterfield our tech 2020 initiative silicon valley is right next to my district in california there are great opportunities there for everyone however the tech industry has not been inclusive of hiring and contracting with and working with communities of color especially the african american community so i am very pleased that the tech 2020 of the congressional black caucus has been initiated we are working with our great leader reverend jesse jackson with an insideoutside strategy many of the tech companies understand what is taking place and that they need to be an industry that is inclusive of everyone so the black caucus along with rainbow push along with the tech industry are working on a variety of strategies to make sure that this industry which provides goodpaying jobs and opportunities is an industry that is inclusive that does not discriminate and that includes the diversity of this great country so i have to just say to congresswoman kelly and congressman payne thank you for giving us a chance to talk about so many of the issues that we have been working on when you look at the issue of poverty cutting poverty in half in 10 years we know how to do it we have legislation the half in ten act h r 258 to do that and the pathways out of poverty act h r 2721 we know how to provide opportunities the congressional black caucus once again is leading on all of these fronts it is a big agenda but it is an agenda that makes our country stronger so thank you

the divide a call to action by the congressional black caucus to eliminate racial health disparities i would like to thank my colleagues congressman hakeem jeffries and congresswoman joyce beatty for hosting this timely special order historically racial and ethnic minorities are likely to have the highest uninsured rates and are less likely to receive preventive and quality health care while the affordable care act has helped minorities afford health insurance and access quality care there is still a need to eliminate existing disparities for example the department of health and human services is currently working to expand access end racial and ethnic discrimination perform outreach to underserved communities improve workforce diversity and expand data collection and reporting while this is an ambitious plan it is one that is extremely necessary unfortunately coverage access and outreach may not be the only keys to eliminating disparities demographic characteristics contribute heavily to racial and ethnic health status for example research shows that privately insured african american and hispanic adults fare worse than privately insured white adults along measures to access and use of care unfortunately african americans and hispanics are less likely to have a regular provider than their white counterparts the same research also showed that privately insured african americans and hispanics had less confidence in their ability to pay for medical costs since social determinants like economic stability education and environment play such a large role in how we each view and access health care many of the changes necessary to eliminate racial and ethnic disparities require a much larger plan than just a focus on healthrelated programs reducing disparities in health truly entails addressing racial and ethnic social determinants such as availability of safe housing affordable food access to education job opportunities communitybased resources public safety public transportation and more our society must make many changes before we can truly eliminate racial and ethnic health disparities because that also means eliminating disparities in many other sectors i thank congressman jeffries and congresswoman beatty for hosting this poignant special order tibet"], [0.0020335912704467773, 0.9979664087295532, 1, "we should not be here today we

violence takes such a toll on our citizens but here we are standing up for the millions of americans who want congress to do something and honoring the thousands of americans who have lost their lives

are men and women black and white rich and poor old and young at a mcdonalds in california an 8monthold baby was killed along with his mother who was trying to shelter him when a gunman came in and started shooting at a north carolina nursing home a 98yearold grandmother was killed when a shooter came in and opened fire here in the united states you are 10 times more likely to be killed by a gun

drive down to your local gun store and buy an assault rifle there is nothing anyone can do to stop you over the last 10 years people on the terrorist watch list tried to buy explosives or firearms 2 233 times over 90 percent of the time they were successful this is wrong the american people know it is wrong public health officials know it is wrong and nearly every single law enforcement

percent of nra members said suspected terrorists should not be allowed to buy guns if you were to walk outside the house of representatives right now and stop someone walking down the street and ask the simple question should terrorists be allowed to buy guns you would get a very simple answer they would say no of course terrorists should not be allowed to buy guns but they can republicans here

where congress has to even have a standard procedure to observe mass shootings yet we arent even allowed to have a debate about legislation to address this problem it is time for us to stand up to the

mark the 1month anniversary of the shooting at the pulse nightclub in orlando a hateful act on the lgbt community that took the lives of 49 people this shooting shook the country as have the many mass

still think about the story of tyshawn lee its just hitting my mind all the time because its not fair it makes me cry tyshawn lee was a 9yearold boy in chicago deliberately assassinated shot multiple times in the head kaline continues i hope people can make better decisions about what to do with guns i hope people stop fighting about whether we should do gun control because i worry more people and kids like tyshawn will be killed we cant accept violence as normal this is not the country kaline should have to grow up in and how do you explain to an 8year old that in america with 91 people dying

health in america every april we observe national minority health awareness month this year is particularly significant as we mark 30 years since the groundbreaking health and human services task force on black and minority health report this report sparked the first serious discussion in washington on addressing the deep racial health disparities that exist in this country this year also marks 50 years since the creation of medicare and medicaidprograms that have kept and continue to keep americans healthy we are also celebrating the fifth year anniversary of the passage of the affordable care actthe most significant legislation to improve the health of all americans in more than a generation these legislative achievements continue moving us closer to health equity for allhowever major health disparities still exist the zip code in which you are born still determines your likely life expectancy gross disparities exist from zip code to zip codeeven within the same city or county so today i rise to join my colleagues in the congressional black caucus to bring to light the state of black health in america and call for more action to address persistent and lingering disparities in health access treatment and care since the passage of the affordable care act access to care has dramatically expanded in communities of color the uninsured rate has declined 7 3 percent in the african american community and more people have access to affordable quality healthcareall thanks to the affordable care act when we were crafting the affordable care act i had the privilege of serving as chair of the congressional black caucus and let me tell you we worked day and night with our colleagues in the congressional hispanic caucus and congressional asian pacific american caucus to push congress and the administration to craft the best possible bill since its passage the affordable care act has improved the american health care system healthcare is now more affordable and accessible than ever women can no longer be discriminated against because they are a woman have a preexisting conditionsuch as hiv aidsor have been the victim of domestic violence young people can stay on their parents health insurance until they are 26 and people with serious conditions like cancer no longer face the real fear of hitting their lifetime cap and being denied lifesaving treatment the aca also expands the capacity of the healthcare delivery system to better serve those at risk for and living with hiv aids these are the facts the affordable care act has dramatically increased access to preventative care for women lowincome communities and people of color despite rabblerousing and grandstanding from the right this law is saving livesevery day in communities across americafrom maine to my district in the east bay during the last enrollment period 16 4 million americans obtained health insurance and more than half a million came from my home state of california make no mistakethe affordable care act is working african americans and latinos historically underinsured or uninsured groups have seen the greatest declines in their uninsured rates this is especially good news for african americans who are living with hiv where the key to halting the epidemic is access to affordable and quality care with this increase in coverage we are beginning to close the gap in racial and ethnic health disparities and access to care however much work remains to truly realize health equity in america right nowin america the richest and most powerful country in the worldafrican americans still suffer from disproportionately high numbers of preventable deaths disparities in access to quality health care and underrepresentation within the medical community african americans have the highest mortality rate of any racial and ethnic group from cancer furthermore africanamericans are 40 more likely to die from a stroke than whites and 30 more likely to die from heart disease than whites and while african americans are only 13 of the unitedstates population they account for nearly half of all new hiv infections african americans also account for the highest hivrelated deaths and hiv death rates madam speakerthis is unacceptable in an age where technology and innovation are paving the way to new medical breakthroughs these persistent disparities in healthcare cannot be allowed to continue that is why today i urge my colleagues lets work together and commit ourselves to passing legislation that will end racial and ethnic disparities and achieve health equity the affordable care act was a good start but more is needed for years the congressional tricaucus has championed this effort by introducing the health equity and

force this important legislation builds on the affordable care act and puts us on track to eliminate health disparities in our country the health equity and accountability act would address incidences

system for their own advantage i truly believeand i hope my colleagues do toothat employers and employees should have a level playing field with an updated and expeditious processing mechanism employers should not be able to endlessly delay and appeal elections and abuse a process that was put in place just as much for them as it was for employees organizing has a long and important history in america unions and collective bargaining have made sure we have a weekend to spend with our families a 40hour workweek and made sure women are paid fair wages 1l 1000 organizing has made sure workers are safe from all types and forms of workplace dangers countless studies show that the proportion of workers in labor organizations tracks very closely with income for middle class americans critics of this rule dont want a level playing field for labor organizations to fight for the middle class they want a process that is open to delay and manipulation rather than letting workers choose for themselves whether or not they want to join a union bad actors would prefer to delay or prevent the choice from ever being made at all this new rule reduces the opportunity for bad actors to play games with the process and applies new technological updates to the process as well the republicans time and time again seem to want to waste time on grandstanding instead of legislating this is a perfect example of another bill that wont become law the republicans want to tilt the economy toward the wealthy toward big business toward ceos we were sent here to do the peoples work the new rule for the nlrb is entirely consistent with the legislative intent of the creation of that agency and it is for the advantage of people who live in our towns and cities it improves the economy raises up the middle class helps give everybody a fair shot at the american dream when we talk about the pathway to the american dream the pathway to success in our country the organized labor movement has and continues to make enormous contributions toward making sure that americans are earning livable wages that they can support their families and live the american dream it is not only the weekends and 40hour workweeks that they have given us the organized labor movement continues to fight for the middle class and to fight to grow the middle class and to address some of the increasing trend of

presuppose that every workplace will want to organize nor that no workplaces will want to organize it simply has a fair set of rules in placefair to businesses fair to employees fair to labor fair to everybodythat allows a decision to be made regarding organizing in the workplace what is even more important about the effort mr heck talked about is it will allow workers and business owners to participate in a bigger pie that is what we all want by reauthorizing the exportimport bank we are creating jobs in our country and the export sector and that means that the owners of the companies will do well it means the employees of the companies will do well it means the management will do well it means the line workers will do well so lets participate in a growing pie by passing a clean reauthorization of the exportimport bank rather than trying to divide the pie to take more away from working families and the middle class and give more to big businesses i urge my colleagues to vote

yielding and for his leadership in support of working men and women like my colleagues i am a strong supporter of tribal sovereignty and believe that we must recognize the rights of tribal governments but i am also a strong supporter of labor rights the ability of hardworking men and women to join together in collective bargaining to improve their workplace and the lives of their families union membership has many advantages higher wages better benefits and safer working conditions it is no coincidence that we have seen the middle class shrink dramatically at the same time that union membership has declined that is why we need to act to expand labor rights and why we should be concerned about the bill before us i believe that the 2004 national labor relations board decision in san manuel indian bingo casino struck the appropriate balance between respecting tribal sovereignty and upholding labor rights in its decision the nlrb stated the national labor relations act does not apply if it would undermine the exclusive rights of selfgovernance in purely intramural matters or abrogate indian treaty rights however the nlrb clarified that labor law would apply if an entity is a purely commercial enterprise and employs or caters to individuals who are not tribal members that is an appropriate test whether we are talking about casinos or construction companies hotels and resorts or mines or power plants h r 511 would overturn the nlrbs carefully crafted decision and could take away existing bargaining rights from hundreds of thousands of workers we know that workers at tribally owned casinos have benefited from union membership a unite here union study of tribal casino workers in california documented higher wages lower healthcare costs and less worker reliance on public benefits like medicaid to meet the needs of their families employers too gain when workers are more productive and turnover is reduced we have realworld examples of how unions have helped workers gary navarro a pomo nation member employed at graton casino resort testified before the education and the workforce committee that i became active in my union because of unjust treatment of casino workers by the managers and how nothing could be done about even sexual harassment because of sovereignty exercising our right to organize turned out to be the only way to protect ourselves and our coworkers madeline a worker at foxwoods was suspended because she was forced to clock out when she went to see a nurse for a workrelated injury which put her over the casinos attendance points system her union won her reinstatement and backpay and the company provided a mandatory osha training program for management jenny langlois at foxwoods benefited from a union contract that gave her the time she needed to receive treatment for breast cancer h r 511 would result in the loss of those gains and by eliminating nlra rights could deny them to many more workers in the future by doing so it would leave those workers without any avenue to bargain collectively ensure fair compensation or seek redress for workplace injuries three out of four of the 600 000 workers employed in tribal casinos are not tribal members they do not have full access to internal tribal mechanisms for filing grievances or petitioning for changes in policy and while some tribal governments have labor laws that apply to commercial operations many dont and there is no guarantee that those who have them will not change or eliminate them in the future by eliminating nlra rights workers could have no place to turn to push for labor rights to appeal unfair firings or disciplinary action or to take action against sexual harassment h r 511 would affect more than the gaming industry including construction workers miners and hotel workers that is why the international labour organization has stated that it would appear likely that an exclusion of certain workers from the nlra and its mechanisms would give rise to a failure to ensure to these workers their fundamental freedom of association rights absent any assurances that there were tribal labor laws that provide the same rights to all workers but there is no such requirement in h r 511 it would preempt nlra coverage but there are other federal laws that apply to tribes including the occupational safety and health act title iii of the americans with disabilities act the family and medical leave act and the employee retirement income security act why should we single out the nlra the law that gives workers bargaining rights or will we be asked to eliminate those other important protections in the future proponents of the bill argue that it is designed to provide equal treatment for tribal nations with state and local governments but there are key distinctions first we are talking here not about people who work directly for tribal governments but for workers in commercial enterprises most states and localities dont operate huge commercial entities that hire the majority of workers from outside of their jurisdictions second if state or local workers want to push for laws to obtain or protect collective bargaining rights they have the ability to participate in the political process and vote in elections that is one reason that the vast majority of state and local public employees have those rights nontribal workers at tribaloperated commercial enterprises lack that ability they dont vote in tribal elections and they have no direct ability to affect labor policies for tribal governments we should fight for workplace

land water and conservation funding and will have devastating impacts on all communities in my home state of california and across the country whats worsethis bill slashes funding for the environmental protection agency epa by more than 700 million dollarsfrom fy2015 levels and funds the agency at more than a billion dollars less than the presidents fy2016 request these profound cuts would significantly harm the clean water fund and the safe drinking water fundcritical programs that ensure the safety of our drinking water and our children it also includes 40 million in cuts to the historic preservation fund hpp which would weaken the national park services nps ability to preserve sites significant in the civil rights movement this includes sites like the selma to montgomery national historic trail where many of us participated in the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of bloody sunday furthermore there are also egregious policy riders in this bill that would block clean air protections such as the epas clean power plan too many families particularly those in lowincome vulnerable communities already suffer from poor air quality because of dirty carbon pollution we know that communities of color are disproportionately affected by pollutionrelated illnesses including asthma according to the american academy of allergy asthma and immunology one in six african american and one in nine latino children suffer from asthma there are other toxic policy riders that would block the protection of our imperiled wildlife under the endangered species act like the greater sage grouse population the endangered species act is the only law that has safeguarded more than 2 000 plants and wildlife from extinction this law enjoys broad support from nearly 85 percent of americans and yet here we are again with a bill that seeks to undermine decades of animal protection and runs counter to vast public support mr chair we need to continue to fight to defend our environment address climate change and make real meaningful impacts on reducing greenhouse gas emissions so we protect our environment our children and our future unfortunately the bill before us does just the opposite i hope that as this process moves forward we can address the insufficient funding allocations and backwards policy riders that would harm every american and put our precious

innocent lives to gun violence let me give you some numbers 31 2 that is the number of years since the terrible tragedy at sandy hook elementary school 34 000 that is the number of people who have been killed by someone using a gun since sandy hook 1 182 that is the number of mass shootings in our country since sandy hook 30 that is the number of moments of silence observed by this house for victims of gun violence since sandy hook 521 that is the number of days the house has been in session since sandy hook and zerozerothat is the number of votes that have been taken in this house to keep guns out of dangerous hands in the last 31 2 years just a few weeks ago we experienced the worst mass shooting in our countrys history at the pulse nightclub in orlando fortynine innocent people lost their lives in that nightclub 49 people who were someones son daughter someones brother sister someones significant other someones friend and someones loved one after this horrific shooting the american people dont want to see their elected representatives fall back into the same old pattern of mass shootings followed by moments of silence thoughts and prayers but no real action taken to help prevent the next tragedy the american people want to see congress pass meaningful legislation to help keep our communities and our loved ones safe eightyfive percent of americans are in favor of banning individuals on the terrorist watch list from being able to legally buy guns ninety percent of americans support strengthening and expanding our background check system there are two bipartisan prosecond amendment bills that would do just that the first bill h r 1076 known as the no fly no buy was introduced by our republican colleague peter king this bill says that if you are on the fbis terrorist watch list then you dont get to walk into a gun store pass a background check and leave with the weapon of your choice if there is one thing both sides of the aisle should be able to agree on it is keeping guns away from suspected terrorists bring that bill up for a vote the second bill h r 1217with 186 coauthors democrats and republicanswould close a dangerous loophole in our background check system that allows criminals domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill to bypass a background check altogether and instead purchase their guns online or at a gun show or through a classified ad this is a huge loophole and it costs lives you dont have to look any further than the sister of elvin daniel from wisconsin his sister zina had a restraining order against her husband which prevented him from passing a background check when he tried to buy a gun in a store nevertheless zinas husband was able to go online and buy the same gun a 40caliber semiautomatic handgun and he took that gun and used it to kill zina and two other people in a store in wisconsin this bill would close these kinds of loopholes and help stop criminals from getting guns everyone says they want to keep guns away from dangerous people but the only way to know if someone is dangerous is to conduct a background check background checks are our first line of defense against criminals domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill in getting guns last year 260 members of this houseincluding 76 of my republican colleaguesvoted to fund the background check system at record levels let me tell you if you are willing to fund the system at historic levels you should have no problem using the system bring this bill up for a vote both of these bills are not only bipartisan they respect the second amendment rights of lawabiding citizens i am a gun owner i own guns i support the second amendment if these bills did anything to violate those rights my name

newtown or san bernardino ever happen again congress should immediately move forward and pass the denying firearms and explosives to dangerous terrorists act this commonsense bill would prohibit suspected terrorists from possessing guns or explosives keeping dangerous weapons out of the hands of people who wish to do our country harm is a solution that we should all be able to get behind the hateful attack in orlando also reminds us once more of the growing threat of isisinspired radical islamic terrorist on unitedstates soil is real and cannot be ignored or downplayed congress must reassert leadership in the fight against isis by passing legislation to hold the president accountable for developing a comprehensive plan to destroy isis through congressional oversight hearings we must also ensure that federal agencies and local law enforcement are effectively communicating with each other to identify international and homegrown terror threats through both traditional security approaches and social media internationally congress must act to cut off sources of funding to other radical islamic terror groups by restoring crippling sanctions on iran the recent agreement which frankly shipped billions of dollars to the worlds largest state sponsor of terror while helping finance organizations like hamas and hezbollah is simply unacceptable at home we cannot allow the tired partisan bickering to distract us from the difficult but necessary work of preventing gun violence we need to bridge the partisan divide and put the best interests of our country before politics a good first step is the legislation that i helped introduce with former congresswoman gabby giffords to require universal background checks on firearm purchases the vast majority of the american people support this commonsense idea and it is past time congress moves forward with this proposal that will keep more people safe we also need to improve communications so that local law enforcement is notified when someone attempts to purchase a gun and fails a required background check my colleague congressman mike quigley introduced a commonsense bill to make this fix which i strongly support other important efforts to prevent gun violence include my bill with congresswoman debbie dingell to prevent domestic abusers from being able to purchase weapons this proposal would help again

be while it may not be this nations proudest moment it is a part of our history and it is a tragic event from which we can learn and we can actually grow i think as a nation the enlisted men stationed at the port chicago naval magazine including the port chicago 50 served our nation proudly and they served her honorably for that they deserve our gratitude for those unfamiliar with the story and i know it has already been talked about but i would like to talk about it very briefly again following a catastrophic cargo vessel explosion on july 17 1944 which killed or wounded 710 people several enlisted men voiced concerns about continuing to handle munitions at the port among those voicing concerns were two gentlemen from cincinnati ohio from the area that i am proud to serve mentor burns and edward lee longmire both men enlisted in 1943 they were not lifelong soldiers with extensive training they were ordinary patriotic americans doing their part to help in the war effort mr burns was a woodturner in a furniture factory before enlisting mr longmire worked as a sales clerk selling poultry nothing in their background prepared them for handling munitions and unfortunately the navy at that time did not provide adequate training for the men serving at port chicago so it is understandable that the men who survived the explosion were reluctant to continue loading munitions without efforts to make the process safer for that they were charged with mutiny reluctance and even refusal to return to unsafe conditions and procedures is not mutiny it is common sense america is the greatest country on the face of the globe but that doesnt mean we dont at times make mistakes and that is what happened here injustices like the mutiny convictions for the port chicago 50 certainly fall within that category however one of the things that makes america great is the freedom of the american people and the peoples elected representatives to speak out against injustices correct past wrongs and strive for a better future for all of us we cant go back in time and prevent the convictions of the port chicago 50 but we can correct the record and we can exonerate those wrongfully convicted and give their families and their loved ones the peace of knowing that they served our nation honorably and faithfully and that they did nothing wrong it is far past time that the port

government should take in response to the deadly threats to the jewish communities in europe as we all know the number of violent antisemitic attacks have increased from 100 to 400 percent in some european countries since 2013 alone murders in paris and copenhagen and elsewhere remind us that there are those who are motivated by antisemitic hate and have the will and the means to kill i would just note parenthetically that my work in combating antisemitism began back in 1981 in my first term from this very podium speaking out in favor of jewish refuseniks i joined mark levin and the ncsj 1 year later in 1982 on a trip to the soviet union where we met with men and women who were targeted by the kgb and the soviet evil empire simply because they were jewish sadly antisemitism has not abated and in recent years it has actually worsened 1915 this resolution calls for the united states government to work with our european allies on specific actions that are essential to keep european jewish communities safe and secure it is based on consultations with the leading experts who are working directly with these communities the resolution focuses on the formal partnerships between european law enforcement agencies and jewish community security groups here in the united states the collaboration between the department of homeland security and security community networkan initiative of the jewish federation of north america and the conference of presidents of major american jewish organizationshas been essential to protecting jewish communities here the formal partnerships between the community security trust in the united kingdom and the jewish community security service in france and their respective governments are also excellent models that need to be emulated the resolution emphasizes the importance of consistent twoway communication and information sharing between law enforcement agencies and jewish community groups it encourages the development of a paneuropean information sharing communication and alerting system and envisions governments intergovernmental agencies and jewish communities working together on it such a system should function dayround and yearround and include training for personnel who are implementing it the resolution also calls for european governments to support assessments in several key areas and accordingly adjust their actions and strategies details matter the assessments should gather and analyze data on crimes committed response from law enforcement types of attacks or incidents that are most prevalent and the types of targets that are most at risk it is essential to understand how law enforcement agencies usually receive reports of antisemitic crimes and what initial actions they take when a report is filed i remember years ago when i offered a resolution at the osce parliamentary assembly we heard that it was just hooliganism and other kinds of acts done by young people when you spraypaint a swastika on a tombstone in a jewish cemetery when you deface a synagogue and you attack a man simply because he is wearing a yarmulke clearly these are acts of antisemitic hate yet they were being dismissed as something that was other assessments are also needed on jewish community security groups particularly of their capabilities resources relationships with local law enforcement agencies preparedness including emergency response plans and the extent to which their decisionmaking is based on the best available information analysis and practices the resolution calls for governments to use these assessments to help these community groups develop common baseline safety standards these standards should include as i said before training controlling access to physical facilities physical security measures including cameras and crisis communications emergency exercises and simulations mapping access to facilities and sharing information with law enforcement agencies should also be part of the standards these assessments will help achieve the resolutions call for law enforcement personnel to be well trained to monitor prevent and respond to antisemitic violence and to partner with jewish communities for all of these assessments governments should draw information from sources that include jewish groups law enforcement agencies independent human rights ngos research initiatives and other civil society groups and leaders h res 354 calls for safety awareness and suspicious activity reporting campaigns like if you see something say something here in the united states other aspects of the resolution include appropriately integrating initiatives to counter violent extremism and those to combat antisemitism and the urgency of implementing the declarations decisions and other commitments of the organization for security and cooperation in europe that focus on antisemitism to accomplish these goals the resolution calls for european governments to ensure that they appoint or designate senior officials with the necessary authority and resources to combat antisemitism and collaborate with governmental and intergovernmental agencies law enforcement and jewish community groups finally the resolution reaffirms support for the mandate of the united states special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism as part of the broader policy of fostering international religious freedom and urges the secretary of state to continue robust unitedstates reporting on antisemitism by the department of state and the special envoy to combat and monitor antisemitism i would note parenthetically that i authored the amendment to the global antisemitism review act of 2004 introduced and sponsored by senator voinovich my amendment created the office to monitor and combat antisemitism within the state department that has proven to be a key tool in this fight the resolution has the support of leading organizations and it has 89 cosponsors including

the killing continues after watching boko harams violence i wasnt surprised to see that that group pledges allegiance to isis isis publicly accepted the overture claiming this new relationship expands their selfdeclared caliphate to west africa at the same time we have seen boko harams propaganda increase in quality mimicking the production of isis videos sweeping what we call the virtual caliphate on the internet so the good news is that nigerias neighbors chad niger and cameroon have all been making progress in the fight against boko haram under a newly established african union regional force

from personal experience the nightmares never stop not even after my rapist was killed in prison did the nightmares stop i still see his face in the dark i can hear his voice appraising my body like i was a cow at an auction i have carried this burden since i was 7 years old and it cant ever be fixed but we can stop it from being the fate of others by making the punishment so severe the crime is not an option she probably wouldnt have agreed with the 6month sentence that the stanford judge gave the defendant who will only do 90 days another anonymous letter in college a man broke into my apartment and brutally raped beat and pistolwhipped me it is hard to read this he sodomized me with his gun i have horrible flashbacks and can barely live a day when i dont have anxiety or panic attacks and the wish just to die and end it all from the emotional physical and psychological damage that he did to me you give some of us hope and i want to sincerely thank you and other members of congress for standing up for us rape victims i am honored for you to share my story to help others but i want to remain anonymous because i still fear my attacker even though i dont know his name my rapist knows my name he stalked me prior to the rape thank you for taking the time to write me back the last case laurens was a case i actually tried i tried the person who assaulted her and her sister it was in 1997 lauren was the age of 11 and her stepsister was 9 years of age they were repeatedly molested not by a stranger or by a friend but by someone closertheir grandfather he molested them several times this happened 20 years ago next year and lauren still cant talk much about it she reached out to my office to tell us that sexual assault stays with you for life in her case the individual was convicted he received a 10year sentence in one case and a 5year sentence in the other and they were stacked on top of each other which means he had to do 15 years in the penitentiary of the state of texas we have done some good things over the years we have done some good things in congress the justice for all act strengthens the rights of victims of crime in the criminal justice process increasing their access to restitution and the reauthorization of victims notification grants it takes steps to reduce the rape kit backlog it expands the use of sexual assault nurse examiners in underserved communities i have been around so long that when i started prosecuting cases we didnt have a rape kit we didnt know what that was we certainly didnt have dna but we have rape kits now because some wonderful doctors have figured this out some of them at the texas childrens hospital in houston it is a forensic kit that is taken of the sexual assault victim these items are analyzed and tracked through dna to find out who the rapist was but right now in our country we have rape kits that are sitting on the shelves in police departments throughout the country that are gathering dust people just cant get around to solving these crimes they make all kinds of excuses we dont have the money we just need more help the bottom line is that we are denying justice to sexual assault victims for the failure to analyze these rape kits we need to analyze the rape kits but it cuts both ways some of these rape kits after they are analyzed exonerate people in the penitentiary get it done solve this problem of the backlog of rape kits there is no excuse for the justice department for the fbi for any local law enforcement agency not to analyze those sexual assault kits right away you see when the crime is committed the system works in such a way that we dont let the victims forget about what happened to them because they may have to testify and they cant get on with their lives so to speak until the rape kit is analyzed and the idea that one has to wait a year or 2 years before we know who committed this crime is abuse of the system the system is abusing the victim again like i said it may exonerate an offender who is in the penitentiary so no more excuses it needs to be a priority of police departments analyze the sexual assault kits analyze that dna because it really is good evidence in the courtroom to convict the guilty and exonerate the innocent but you cant get to that point and the victims cant get to trial until the sexual assault kit is analyzed they have to continue to remember this they cant forget it not that they would forget it but they cant get on with their lives the same thing is true about postponing these cases so many judges take a sexual assault case and aht we will postpone this case we are going to try some slipandfall case instead courts in the united states by the legislative authority of the legislatures should make a priority of sexual assault cases especially of minor children and put them in the line first to get their day in court some states do itsome dontbut that is one easy fix that we could do of course this law the justice for all act protects vawa funding streams that are critical to crime prevention and i mentioned about dna testing i mentioned jim costaa great american this issue is a bipartisan issue we have 80 in our victims rights caucus40 republicans and 40 democrats every year we have this fight with the appropriators we are in the appropriations season there was a great law that was passed by congresssponsored i believe by ronald reagan or whoeverthat said this when a criminal is convicted in federal court the judge may impose a fee and that fee goes into what is called the victims of crime act fund voca is what it is called god bless those federal judges they are nailing these criminals because more and more money every year is going into the victims of crime act fund that fund is to be used for victims of crime including for services restoration counselingall of those good things that we now do for victims that we didnt used to do but here is the problem more money than ever before is coming into the victims of crime act fund right now my understanding is there is 9 billion in the fund now this isnt taxpayer money this is money that criminals have paid toward the rent on the courthouse they have paid for the crimes they have committed plus their sentences and it is a fund that is supposed to go to crime victims it is a great idea the problem is congressus this has been going on for years it doesnt appropriate all of the money every year that came in the previous year only about 30 percent of it is appropriated to crime victims organizations and many of these organizations are barely keeping their lights on i am no appropriator i am not a cpa i am a lawyer the appropriators say well we cant spend that money because we need it as an offset for other spending in other programs it is not for other programs it is not taxpayer money what jim costa and i have been trying to do since we came in here in 2005 is to say what goes in this year comes out next year spend it all we dont need to have a rainy day fund because the money keeps going up every year because federal judges are making defendants pay into this fund once again it belongs to victims of crime but it is administered by the justice department it is no reflection on this administration it has been going on for years the justice department just hangs onto it because the appropriators dont spend it all and appropriate all of the money as i said because they want to use it as an offset 2100 the country and some judges like the one at stanford have to get their mindset right today in 2016 sexual assault is a crime we dont talk much about it is just kind of distasteful so we dont talk about it we talk about other things yet these sexual assault victims live quiet lives of despair and i have known a lot over the years some of them keep in contact with me they just call to check in and they dont ever get over it we would hope that they would we would hope they get their lives together you know they become survivors but emotionally many of them just dont get over it for a lot of reasons because they are ashamed their mom told them it was their fault whatever we need to make it real clear that congress is on the side of sexual assault victims make no mistake about it we are on their side because really we are their only voice we are it if we dont speak for them and help legislation forward to protect them it doesnt get done so we have a lot to do one thing that i would like to mention the father and the mother of the rapist gave a statement to the judge and i read those statements i would like to talk about the father he basically blamed the victim for the conduct of his son he is wrong and the problem is he actually believes it is her fault he didnt just say that to try to protect his son he believes it is her fault that is what is really bad most of us who are males in this house we have sons i do have one i have grandsons we have an obligation to raise our sons in accordance with basic human rights and explain to them when they are very young that there are some things you just cant do you are going to be punished for it but also it is wrong sexual assault is one of those it is wrong you cannot do that we need to explain that because we have a generation of young malesevery generation of young males has to be reeducated we have that obligation in our families to educate our sons that because you think you are somebody you are not going to get off if you do that crime whether you are an athlete whether you come from pedigree whether you are rich famous whatever we need to explain to our sons that it is morally wrong to sexually assault a person under any circumstances because no always means no it is not the fault of the victim so i would encourage dads to do this this doesnt cost any money it doesnt cost any legislation but it is a moral obligation we have as fathers i think if fathers did a better jobi have said this a long timeif fathers did a better job we would have fewer young males at the courthouse because most of the people who showed up at the courthouse when i was a judge they were young males most of them were under 25 years of age and they were males and it is not because the women get away with it it is because young males commit most of the crime we have that obligation and i encourage fathers to do that i want to talk about two more cases that i was involved in i tried this case as a prosecutor and this was a senior citizen sadie was her first name and in the trial the victim had to state what happened to her she would never say rape she certainly never said sexual assault because we didnt use that term but she kept testifying from the witness stand what happened to you and she said it is a fate worse than death well can you be a little more detailed no it is a fate worse than death and we went through this for a little bit and she kept saying that it is a fate worse than death she eventually said enough of the right words to meet the legal qualification for rape and i asked her at the trial why do you keep saying it is a fate worse than death i dont know if you have ever heard that before or not and she said it is real simple when you die you die once when this crime is committed against you you die every day it is a fate worse than death that is the way sexual assault victims view this crime and that is the way the law ought to view this crime to many it is a fate worse than death and she had it perfectly because it is a fate worse than death the last case i will talk about is one that i prosecuted as well this individual the victim in this casei wont use her name because her family still lives in houstonshe was leaving one of our major universities and driving home to a town north of houston and all the lights turned on on the dashboard she is having car trouble and she pulled into a service station she thought it was open it was not she came in contact with who she thought was the service station attendant he was not the service station attendant i am not going to mention his name he doesnt deserve it he kidnapped her he had a gun he took her from this area put her into some woods sexually assaulted her beat her up and she survived because she was a remarkable lady in fact my understanding now after the trial the defendant was mad that she did survive anyway he is tried he is convicted by a jury of 12 rightthinking houstonians who convicted the defendant in texas we have in some cases jury sentencing and the jury sentenced this individual this rapist to 99 years in the texas penitentiary that was the maximum he deserved every minute of it now we would hope everything would be okay and that life would go on bad guy outlaw goes to prison sexual assault victim gets justice in court but it doesnt work that way because that is not life the first thing that happened was she started abusing alcohol and then other narcotics her husband left her and a yearmaybe 2 yearsafter the crime i get a call from her mother and she tells me that her daughter has taken her own life and she left a note that says im tired of running from the criminal in my nightmares see she got the death penalty for what somebody did to her in the cases that i mentioned tonight and the many many others that we have all received since last week there are a lot of victim survivors and we really are judged by the way we treat innocent folks in our community not the rich not the famous not the athletes but by the way we treat the innocent the kids the people who have no voice in our justice system except congress so we speak for them and we need to speak for them as well so i would remind the people that are out listening to this to use the survivorsspeak and weigh in on this conversation if they want this subject as i mentioned at the outset is one that we sometimes dont want to talk about but we cant ignore it ever not anymore not today not in this town or any town in america that is why the stanford judge needs to go and that is why i commend the folks in california for having a recall petition judges need to get their head on straight to know they have to get it right every time when it comes to justice the scales of justice are a balancing act justice for defendants but also justice for victims and survivors of crime because rape is never the fault of the victim and when a rapist commits a crime against usually a woman or a child that rapist is stealing the very soul of that victim because that is what happens sometimes let us not forget that and that is just the way it is"], [0.0006282925605773926, 0.5006282925605774, 1, "i thank ms stefanik for telling us of the work of st josephs and
