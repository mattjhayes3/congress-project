between the united states and six latin american countries five in central america and the dominican republic it has been 13 months as i said since the president signed this agreement the majority leader the gentleman from texas the most powerful republican in the house promised a vote in 2004 he promised a vote by memorial day now he promised a vote i think he means it this time by it is simple the reason we have not voted on the central american free trade agreement and that is because of the broad opposition in this house and among the american people republicans and democrats by the dozens in this house oppose the central american free trade agreement business organizations labor unions both in the united states and in the six latin american countries oppose the central american free trade agreement the latin american council of churches as do many religious leaders and churches and organizations in the united states oppose the central american free trade agreement environmentalists active environmentalists food safety advocates all kinds of very broadbased organizations oppose the central american free trade agreement today the gentleman from north carolina and i did a news conference at the capitol with 23 business leaders speaking out business leaders representing 23 businesses speaking out against the central american free trade agreement the reason is simply that our policy is not working our trade policy in this country has failed us for 12 years just look at this chart since 1992 the year i was elected to congress the trade deficit number of dollars worth of exports versus imports our trade deficit internationally was 38 billion today after nafta pntr tpa all these trade agreements our trade deficit last year was 618 billion from 38 billion to 618 billion now maybe those are just numbers but those numbers translate into something much more important than economist data these numbers translate into manufacturing job losses the states in red have lost 20 percent of their manufacturing in the last 5 years the states in blue have lost 15 to 20 percent ohio my state 217 000 jobs lost michigan 210 000 illinois 224 000 these are just manufacturing job losses people who make a decent wage a middleclass wage who have health benefits who have earned pensions thousands hundreds of thousands of them have lost their jobs 228 000 in north carolina 130 000 in mississippi and alabama 353 000 in california 201 000 in the state of texas 200 000 in the state of pennsylvania 72 000 in the state of florida in state after state after state we are losing hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs our the trade policy is not working cafta is more of the same cafta is a dysfunctional cousin of the north american free trade agreement it was an agreement that was negotiated by the select few benefiting the select few now supporters of cafta tell us as they always do in trade agreements that as a result of this agreement unitedstates companies will export more products to the developing world unfortunately if you look at this chart that is simply not the case the unitedstates typical average wage is 38 000 the average wage in el salvador is 4 800 honduras 2 600 nicaragua 2 300 to say that people in those countries are going to buy products made in this country simply does not pass the credibility test hondurans are not going to be able to buy cars made in ohio nicaraguans making 2 300 a year are not going to be able to buy prime beef raised in nebraska guatemalans making 4 100 a year are not going to be able to

country last weekend i had the privilege to join one of my heroes the gentleman from georgia who was also one of the leaders of the nonviolent civil rights movement to retrace his steps across the edmund pettus bridge where americas long march to freedom met a roadblock of violent resistance the day became known as bloody sunday by 1965 the cause of equality and human dignity had already seen much progress and setbacks the supreme court decision of brown v board of education rosa parkss defiance on a bus in montgomery the breaking of a color barrier at ole miss the historic march on washington the assassinations of medgar evers and president kennedy the bombing deaths of four little girls at the 16th street baptist church in birmingham alabama the mississippi freedom summer the passage of the civil rights act of 1964 but on this bloody sunday about 600 people young and old put their lives on the line and met the unbridled force of racism for the most basic american right the right to vote and be full participants in our democracy the alabama state patrol was waiting for them at the other side of the pettus bridge and attacked them with clubs tear gas and dogs the gentleman from georgia was beaten so badly he believed he was going to die the images were captured on tv when the movie judgment at nuremberg was interrupted with the news many people watching the movie first thought that it was a continuation of the movie depicting brutal nazi oppression until they realized that this was happening in america right now peoples shock moved the political world one week after bloody sunday president johnson spoke to the nation in inspiring words he said at times history and fate meet in a single time and a single place to shape a turning point if mans unending search for freedom so it was at lexington and concord so it was a century ago at appomattox so it was last week in selma their cause must be our cause two weeks after bloody sunday dr martin luther king and the gentleman from georgia led 4 000 people across the pettus bridge on their 54mile march to montgomery six months later president johnson signed the voting rights act proclaiming that the right to vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised for breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible walls which imprison all people merely because they are different from each other soon the voting rights act will be up again before congress for reauthorization we should do it sooner rather than later we should make it permanent rather than for short periods so we do not have to revisit the issue and debate its provisions surely there is enough common interest and bipartisan support to accomplish this their cause 40 years ago this week still must be our caus6 to

still must overcome as long as the gap between rich and poor continues to spread in our nation with some and not all having access to health care we still must overcome as long as children of color are more likely to live in poverty die sooner and less likely to graduate high school and go on to college we still must overcome as president bush stated during his recent trip to europe we cannot carry the message of freedom and the baggage of bigotry at the same time all our nations must work to integrate minorities into the mainstream of society and to teach the value of tolerance to each

title vi of this legislation is drawn from a bill that i introduced in the first session of the 109th congress my legislation is known as the child pornography prevention act of 2005 and as the title states the intent of my legislation is to prevent american chjldren from becoming victims of pornography every one of us knows that the fuel that fires the wicked hearts of child predators is child pornography and it must be confronted in america every day in this country children are sadly exploited in pornographic enterprises sometimes b those closest to them believe it or not in their homes sometimes by commercial producers in the home children are forced to pose for pornographic pictures or act in pornographic videos sometimes by family members and even friends and caretakers and other trusted individuals sadly our resources in the law enforcement community inform us that these pictures and videos are posted on the internet or surreptitiously spread to sexual predators in the commercial arena and in hollywood as our cultures become more and more youth oriented and sex has become more and more prevalent we must ensure that children are not being used in the production of prurient material and provide law enforcement with the tools to prosecute those who exploit children a main tenet of my legislation is the language that will fix a technicality known as home pornographers to get at the first problem that i just described home pornographers have used this loophole to evade federal prosecution in child pornography cases these individuals will use digital cameras polaroid cameras video cameras to make pornographic images of children download them and distributethem on the internet my legislation first and foremost makes it clear that federal prosecutions of home pornographers may proceed in federal court because their activities impact on interstate commerce another element of my bill which has become in many ways more controversial is the addition of a new section of the criminal code section 2257a which adds a recordkeeping requirement that will force people in even in the entertainment industry to keep records of the names and ages of their subjects along with proof of their identification when they are engaged even in simulated sexual activity on screen anytime hollywood uses a simulated sex act in a soap opera a cable television show a movie or other production a record must be kept to show that a child was not used even in the creation of a simulated sex act heretofore the law has only required that such records be kept in the cases of hardcore pornography where actual sex was being performed and recorded for entertainment value but if a child is used in a simulated sex act the impact of such abuse on that child is in many ways just as real as it would be had the production involved actual sexual contact therefore my bill require these records be kept for simulated sex because by doing so certain bad actors in the entertainment industry will be deterred from using children also my bill goes a step further by requiring that records be kept even in the case of what is known as lascivious exhibition once again no child should be used in either nude pictures or sexually explicit materials or even in activities that have a prurient interest this is again the type of images that fuel the flames of the wicked hearts of child predators and should be stopped finally the legislation expands the ability of investigators and prosecutors to pursue the people who are used to distribute child pornography these distributors also will be required to follow these new recordkeeping provisions and this will provide law enforcement with a powerful tool against them as well providing law enforcement with the tools to combat child pornography contained in my legislation is a muchneeded and overdue step that must be taken to protect our children from those in society who have no decency and no shame i also commend those legitimate producers of entertainment products in the united states of america with whom we have had dialogue and with whom we have worked in the development of this legislation it is not my purpose in any way to suggest that those that are involved in the legitimate entertainment industry in this country have anything to do with the illegitimate industry that is pornography in america nevertheless it is important that even in main street hollywood america that we ensure that children are not used even in the creation of entertainment materials that simulate sex acts and our legislation will create the recordkeeping to prevent just that i hail the passage of the child pornography prevention act as a part of the child safety and violent crime reduction act it is time to protect our kids and yesterday this congress took a great step toward that goal in entertainment in america"], [0.500700831413269, 0.500700831413269, 0, "yesterday a subcommittee of the japanese food safety commission on prions which deals primarily with bse or mad cow disease voted to pursue a course designed to open japans borders to unitedstates beef this is something that the beef industry has been waiting for for about 1 year 12 years now and the full committee will vote tomorrow on opening trade with the united states and then this will begin a 4week comment period afterwhich it is assumed that borders will open so we are hoping that by the end of the year we will see unitedstates beef going to japan this is certainly important for our beef industry because japan was buying at one time roughly 1 7 billion of unitedstates beef annually so it is a huge portion of our beef trade getting the border open has been surprisingly difficult however we had two cases of bse in north america that shut off trade with japan japan has had numerous cases of bse in recent years our current testing system would detect one bsepositive cow out of 10 million healthy cows with a 99 percent probability so the odds of a bse cow getting through our present system is practically nil so it is a very reliable system contrast this with the scenario currently going on with the european union in 2004 last year there were 756 cases of bse in the european union 756 whereas in all of north america there have been no more than four or five cases in the last 3 years there have been 189 102 cases of bse in europe since bse was first found several years ago so it has been a huge amount of trouble that they have had yet the united states has experienced practically no exports of our beef to europe one would think with that scenario that we would have had a tremendous export opportunity the european union has blocked unitedstatesbeef in violation of wto rules also has blocked our pork our poultry and genetically modifiedcrops so the european union certainly has not been a good trading partner and they have as i mentioned violated wto rules in doing so the net agriculture trade deficit between the united states and the european union was a minus 5 billion last year so we have taken a big hit in this area current trade talks with the european union are very important and we have an excellent trade ambassador rob portman who is doing a great job and we have great confidence in him but currently we have an offer on the table which is one by which we would reduce our amber box our farm subsidies by 60 percent from 19 billion to roughly 7 5 billion we have asked the european union to reduce their trade subsidies by 83 percent from 80 billion down to 15 billion the eu has countered with an offer to reduce their export subsidies and also their farm subsidies to 39 percent which is certainly not a very satisfactory counteroffer as a result we are somewhat concerned about their response to this whole situation it seems that tariffs certainly need to be equalized between the unitedstates and the european union currently our tariffs on goods going into the european union are roughly 30 percent their goods coming into the united states are roughly 12 percent so here these two large trading partners with economies of somewhere in the 9 trillion to 11 trillion range still have a great dichotomy in terms of the actual tariffs that are being charged against the unitedstates versus the eu the important thing to realize is if these trade agreements are formalized and if they do come into being this will certainly change the nature and structure of our current farm bill a note of caution here brazil is waiting there and seeing what is going to happen their land is roughly 10 percent of our land value their labor costs are about 5 percent of our value so if we reduce our farm programs they are going to be a formidable competitor we certainly think our farmers can compete with anyone in the world but when the playing field is that unequal it can be a problem so it is really important that we realize that trade agreements are tremendous if they are hoiored and if the playing field is equal but they can be huge liabilities if one side honors the agreements and the other does not so far with the european union that has been pretty much the situation so in congress we need to look at the next wto round very carefully"], [0.500700831413269, 0.500700831413269, 0, "yes i yield once again to the gentleman from michigan"],

commemorate the life of a man so well lived i am hard pressed to even suggest another individual contemporary of mine who can compete in that category a life extraordinarily well lived a life that began in poland in 1920 may 18 a month after my mother was born and as he lived through that life in poland and he saw the nazi pressure come on the border and as that border pressure became the invasion of poland in september of 1939 he was a young man a young man the son of a poor soldier a young man who was at that time already a theologian a student a philosopher an actor and a writer of plays and as the nazis occupied poland through that period of time during the second world war some of that work needed to go underground it needed to stay underground when the soviets took over but he lived a life where he saw the nazi holocaust he saw the totalitarianism that came with the nazis and he saw the oppression that came with the communists and the soviet union it gave him a perspective that could not be gained perhaps anywhere else on the planet but there and those of us who believe in providence know very well that god put him there and he put him there for us for so many things that we have benefited from over those ensuing years those 65 years from 1920 until 1985 as he lived underneath the nazis and the soviet union and underneath the totalitarianism that came with that yet he emerged as pope unheard of unheard of and unnamed in fact i have an interesting personal anecdote to this that pope john paul now referred to as the first lived only 32 days after he was named pope and ascended to the papacy and died another period of time we were in that unknown period of time when we did not know who the next pope would be that went on for days and several weeks early in that process i had no idea who the next pope would be i had not even looked at names or studied that or tried to handicap that decision that would come out of the conclave but i remember that i had a dream one night and i woke up in the morning and i said to my wife marilyn i said i had a funny dream last night i dreamed that our new pope would be polish and he named himself john paul ii and we laughed it sounded so ridiculous that there would be a pope who wasnt named and especially fron poland that would ascend to the papacy and that jo ke was a joke amongst us and then when he was named pope a polish pope john paul ii and that little insight came true i had no idea what kind of a man he would be but one of the first things he did in his first foreign trip was go back to poland there he was seen by onethird of the population of poland and the stops that he made people coming out of the mountains by the millions they wore their best holiday clothing they played musical instruments a great celebration and honor for this pope the son of poland had returned as his first foreign trip from the vatican and his message was be not afraid today we hear that message in the countries around the world if you can lift that veil of fear if you can lift it in east germany or if you can lift it in iraq or iran or lebanon today when people are no longer afraid they can do great things and that be not afraid message is the message that we hear every time from the mainstream news media today when they say the veil of fear has been lifted off of lebanon today that is the peoples message that is pope john paul iis message from 1978 that still echoes and still inspires for freedom be not afraid if you would listen to lech walesa today all the times that they tried to organize solidarity in poland and were unable to do so until pope john paul came and carried that message and people stood up and his message also was be peaceful we do not need a violent revolution we need a peaceful revolution of people who are not afraid that message of be not afraid brought poland into freedom for the first of the eastern bloc countries and that message of be not afraid when the wall came down on november 9 of 1989 and the people crawled over the wall and climbed on it and celebrated and chiseled pieces out of it and i have a piece of the berlin wall in my office here in congress and that piece symbolizes the single most significant historical event in my lifetime the end of the cold war when that wall came down the iron curtain came crashing down it could not have come down without pope john paul and his message and it was a historical miracle the way that freedom echoed across the eastern european nations the square in prague people rattling their keys they held their keys in the air and shook their keys they shook their keys for freedom the way that they held up the color orange in the ukraine which we heard from today and the way they waved the lebanese flag in the square in beruit today that was a peaceful assembly of freedom in prague growing from and being from that inspiration of be not afraid be courageous he was consistent he believed in the principles of the bible and the church as being imiportal and faced with the modern religion that says that the bible needs to be read in light of contemporary values he rejected that kind of philosophy because the church has to stand for timeless values not changing and fluctuating values his courage in the face of life on the issue of marriage the issue of peace all of those things together the sanctity of human life has been an inspiration for many of us on marriage and the family this was an issue that floated across this country throughout the last elections and 11 state went to the polls and said they stood for marriage many of those people went to the polls inspired by john paul ii and his consistency in values his consistency in faith his consistency in the value of human life and how important the family is as the unit the unit through which all of our values our religious values our work ethic our culture as a people flows through that unit of a man and a women joined togetlfer in holy matrimony and children and passing those values along to the next generation that human unit of the nuclear family is the key to civilization and if we fail in his message to hold our families together in this country and on this planet we have failed humanity that is part of the legacy as well as the inspiration to stand with those principles there was no compromise with evil with john paul ii he knew evil he faced evil daily and he stood for peaceful and high godly purposes there was no compromise with wrong if you compromise with wrong it becomes part wrong if it is part wrong it is all wrong he stood with those principles that consist in ethic of the catholic church it is the sanctity of human life and no one could have stood for that any greater than john paul ii we stand here today yes in mourning but in great celebration great celebration for a life so well lived that we can give thanks to his legacy for time immemorial and i pray that we will also refer to him as john paul the great i appreciate the gentleman from arizona yielding"], [0.0006874799728393555, 0.5006874799728394, 1, "congressman boyd thank you for yielding i deeply appreciate your efforts and the gentlewoman from california and my good friend from nashville tennessee for the comments that you have been making and trying to make this congress this house and those who may be observing us aware of the situation that we are in in the mid1990s i was amazed and somewhat taken aback and quite frankly somewhat was in agreement with the contract that was proposed by a group of individuals on september 27 1994 and i looked at most of those and i thought that sounds just like a southern democrat in what they would propose i am going to read some of those to you i am a general contractor and i do not do much work anymore our job sure does not allow us to do that so therefore i am not out building as i was through the 1990s and the 1980s and the early part of the 21st century but when i signed a contract with someone there were certain ordinances in that that said you have to abide by these or else if you do not we will take overthat contract and we will hire somebody else or put someone else in your place that will fulfill those commitments that you have made and i would sign a payment of performance bond that would do exactly that so i felt that any contract that you made with this country it was a contract that was binding so i want to read some parts of the contract item no 2 it says on the first day we will select a major independent auditing firm to conduct a comprehensive audit of congress for waste fraud and abuse we cannot even audit several of our different departments and agencies of the federal government today this was a plelge in 1994 look at something else here it says we guarantee honest accounting of our federal budget by implementing zero baseline budgeting in the tennessee legislature we understood what that was apparently the folks who agreed to sign this contract did not and the rest of the story as some famous person says is still being told then i take a look at no 6 the national security restoration act no unitedstates troops under u n command and restoration of the essential parts of our national security funding to strengthen our national defense and our credibility around the world when i go to other countries i am sometimes frightened not that i am an american because when god put my soul in the body of a woman who lived in america at conception and let me be born an american it was one of the greatest blessings i could receive but other folks i do not necessarily agree with i think they misinterpret the american people and how they have a lack of respect for us i do not like that and i want us to change that and i think foreign policy can make a difference so i think that those are failures our national defense september 11 happened after 1994 i am not blaming anyone there but i am just saying we need to start thinking in this country another one said term limits to replace career politicians with citizen legislators we have a senator who ran from tennessee and said he would serve 12 years i applaud bill frist for not running again i do not necessarily always agree with him nor do i disagree with him a lot but one thing i do agree with him on he kept his word we may not have passed the bill but quite frankly the bill does not require you to keep your word my father always said if you are honest you will be rewarded if you are dishonest you ultimately will be punished and will lose here is something else a balanced budget and tax limitation amendment and a legislative lineitem veto i have been here for a little over 3 years i have never seen either one of these items that these folks who signed the contract as i would sign as a builder have tried to pass again if you were back in tennessee and if you were working for a developer the first thing that would happen is they would say you have broken your contract so we will take it over and get some body else to finish the job i think the american public needs to understand that that when you give your word your word is your bond i travel my district all 24 counties and quite frankly there is no conv6rsation about 3 a gallon of gasoline very little there is very little conversation about a 1 000 per monthplus for health care very little conversation about the huge deficits that we have today very little conversation about the war in iraq where we have lost 2 500 young men and spend 100 billion a year approximately in that country but we played a little game one day as i played when i was a kid in school we called it tag in essence you have to tag somebody else out so they can chase the other folks until ultimately they capture someone and then they have to start running someone down so i said let us kind of play tag if you were president what would you do an older fellow in the back said no congressman we have elected you if you were the president what would you do i said the first thing i would do for this country is i would audit this country i would get the best cpas the most honest the most knowledgeable and i would audit every department every agency i would look at every nobid contract to find out how much profit was made i would audit this country and i would tell the american public why in 2001 we had 200plus billion dollars in surplus and why now we have 300plus billion dollars in deficits so i would audit america i would find out and tell the folks this is where the money went this is where your money went it is your money and here is where your money went and the next thing i would do i would call up at andrews air force base and i would have them cap off air force one with fuel i would get 10 of the best pilots in the navy i would also get 10 of the folks who can speak arabic really well and i would load them up and we would have a nonstop flight to kuwait and i would tell the folks in kuwait remember about 10 years ago when you were invaded by this fellow named saddam hussein or almost 15 years ago and you came to the worlds stadium and platform and said please help us we have got 600 000 people and a 25 million population country and their leader saddam hussein has just invaded us and they have taken over our oil fields and the rest of the world came to your rescue i would get the sheiks i would get the mullahs and the emirs and whatever they call themselves the royalty the folks who inherit the position and i would say 3agallon gas is breaking the back of every woman and every man who is working in my district that is our worst enemy we have conquered your enemy you help with ours now i would go to saudi arabia and some of those folks and i would tell them the same story then i would go to iraq and put the troops there that was needed to put production back in those oil fields up to 3 5 million barrels a day that was there when oil for food was a policy that we criticize now so much and certainly the dishonesty of it should be criticized but i would put back on line those oil wells what that does for us is to help us balance our budget instead of us spending 100 billion of american taxpayer money harold ford a candidate for the unitedstates senate says that the american taxpayers are footing the bill for both sides in this war as we pay 3 a gallon gasoline we are helping the insurgency get money especially from some of their buddiesin saudi arabia and other places fund their insurgency through the dollars that go in and go back out to the radical groups of islam and then american taxpayers are paying for the american troops that are sacrificing their lives there i would put on line the oil fields in iraq and get them producing more than 1 5 to 1 9 million barrels a day and i would bring the revenue ifi to where the american taxpayers wouldhave to quit paying for the cost of the war in iraq i know our time is about ended i have a whole lot more i would like to talk about the point i want to make is that in this country today we have a battle on our hands if you notice i am not mentioning a word on the other side their name it saddens me when folks come to this floor and they want to criticize democrats and republicans we are all adult and mature individuals it is time we started acting like americans instead of democrats and republicans it is my hope we can start working together and take this bitterness away bipartisanship is the only thing that is going to solve this thing in the rules committee when we are not allowed to introduce amendments i just got a news release that went out and i will mention this because it is from the national republican committee davis shares blame for high gas prices national democrats are desperate to gain traction on any issue they can in the lead up to the 2006 elections as gas prices across the fourth district rise so does the democrat rhetoric what representative lincoln davis probably hasnt mentioned though is that he voted twice against helping consumers feel less of a pinch at the pump they mention resolution number 519 and number 145 the gasoline for americas security act and the energy conservation research and development act you realize that republican senator bill frist wouldnt evenput this bill up on the senate floor because it didnt do what it said it did so in essence even the republicans in the senate disagreed with those who voted in this house on this bill that is the kind of truth you get from the truth squad when they come up and sthrt talking"], [0.0006876587867736816, 0.5006876587867737, 1, "mr ryan i think and also mrs tubbs jones i think it is important that we look at this issue of the irresponsibility of the republican majority they are being very irresponsible and to say that that is fine we will give you what you want of course i think we are going to see more of that kind of action by the republican majority to say that oh we are with you even if we are running the country into the ground we know better we know that we have foreign countries that we are borrowing from because we cant even borrow from ourselves anymore because we have done such a bad job we know we have raised the debt ceiling time after time after time again meanwhile we come to the floor and say our policies are working we know that there are things we should not be doing because you are working every day or you are running your business eyery day you may not be paying attention to everything that is going on not only are we elected but we are paid to watch out for your best interest and also for future generations best interests and they are doing it and i think that the paradigm shift as it relates to the american people paying attention to what they are doing in a way from a fiscal way i think will take place between now and november and so what is so unfortunate abqut this whole situation is that we are supposed to be responsible policymakers on a bipartisan basis and that is not happening right now that is just not happening the american taxpayers are getting mugged knocked down and kicked by this republican majority and the rubber stamp or the rubberstamp congress republican majority that is here now one other thing i want to mention here which i think is very very important just today mr ryan mrs tubbs jones we dont have to go back to weeks or months or 2 years ago or 3 years ago we had a payasyougo provision here individuals decided not to take it up we had an opportunity to raise the minimum wage on behalf of the american taxpayers the republican majority rejected an opportunity to raise the minimum wage for everyday working americans as a matter of fact mr ryan one of the republican leaders said i havent voted in 25 years to raise the minimum wage and if he would have had his way the minimum wage would still be 3 35 versus 5 15 i am so glad that my state joined 21 other states in raising the minimum wage meanwhile we are still here with chisel and hammer in hand as neanderthals on the republican side of the ball and saying oh we dont have to raise the minimum wage we are so indebted to the special interests that we dont even want to bother them of having an american public that is able to pay the rent or pay for their house mortgage or to be able to put gas in their tank we are so invested in the k street project we are so invested in so many other things that we are willing to allow these individuals to suffer but guess what those are the same individuals that are making america america and there are millions of americans that are there and so what is very very unfortunate here is the fact that the republican majority is still boasting about you know we are in charge we are going to continue to keep our foot on the necks of everyday americans that are going in punching in and punching out every day 5 days a week sometimes 6 because they have to work overtime those americans that know what it means to take a 15minute break in the morning and a 15minute break in the afternoon and a solid 30 minutes of lunch if they get that and they better not be a minute late those kind of individuals i think are going to go to the polls this november and say no more they are going to go to the polls and say we are willing to fight for the kind of accountability that we need from this government i am so proud of the 30something working group and the members that come down here and the democratic members that file legislation on behalf of the american people not on behalf of the democratic party not even on behalf of the democratic caucus not on behalf of our leadership but on behalf of the individuals that they represent who woke up early one tuesday morning and voted for representation in this unitedstates house of representatives and i must add the only chamber that you have to be elected to that you cant be appointed to al due respect to the senate but senators can be appointed by governors if a senator was to say hey you know i have had enough i want to go home i want to take care of my grandkids a governor can appoint a senator but in democracy in this chamber in the unitedstates house if one member were to say hey i want to take care of my grandkids i want to spend more time with my kids they have to run for office they have to run for office and they have to be replaced by the people so we have a greater responsibility we have a greater responsibility than the white house than the senate or the supreme court when you look at the three branches government to the american people the oversight house resolution 841 and mr cardozas legislation that calls for the calling in those administrators that are not accountable to taxpayers dollars these are the kind of bills that we must pass one thing i can say mr ryan which is so very important on our side of the ball of saying we want to take this country in a new direction is the fact that we said we will increase the minimum wage we will make our country more energyindependent within 10 years we will implement the 9 11 recommendations to be able to make sure that we can fight terrorism here and make sure that local communities have what they need these are not if or if we get around to it statements these are statements that we said

advocates of this free trade agreement and of the concept of free trade the principle of free trade internationally and in our country i want to make two general points i am sorry that i wasnt able to be here earlier and i do not want to repeat what my colleagues have said but there are two important overall points that i want to make that even if you have made them are worth thinking again about first is why free trade is important retirees simply do not by definition buy enough consumer goods to drive an economy our size we are accustomed to a standard of living that is frankly the highest in the world our children expect to grow up and participate as adults in an economy that is thriving in wellpaying jobs that can provide them with a standard of living that my generation has enjoyed yet as the number of retirees explodesand the number of young people in the workforce contracts our own nation cannot provide the demand for goods that can produce the overall gross national product that will assure the standard of living we are accustomed to so future generations are going to be more dependent on trade than we have been and we must open markets for their goods the american population will not be able to buy the amount of stuff that would drive an economy that can produce thle standard of living that we have enjoyed so if we do not have consumers around the world and remember the great majority of consumers are outside the united states if we do not cultivate them if they do not open their markets to our products then we cannot sustain the level of economic wellbeing the standard of living to which we have been accustomed and we thereby disadvantage our children this small agreement with one small country will allow consumer and industrial goods to enter that country 100 percent duty free one hundred percent duty free and agricultural products will enter 87 percent duty free and over 10 years reach 100 percent duty free this is a small market but we are making these agreements with country after country after country and most startling our exports are growing most rapidly and the majority of our growth in export goods is with those countries that we have negotiated trade agreements with now that stands to reason because if you sell your goods into a country where there is no duty they are going to do better than if you sell them into a country where there is a 20 percent 30 percent 40 percent 50 percent duty that pushes that price right up so in the big picture our children our grandchildren cannot do well unless we lay the foundation by opening markets for american products all across the world so our economic wellbeing depends on free trade agreements those free trade agreements and the gentlemen here on the floor with me tonight have been strong advocates of fair trade agreements these free trade agreements address labor standards environmental standards we are the only nation in the whole world that pushes those issues in the negotiation of trade agreements with other countries and we are reaching new standards as we move forward and gain more experience now we do not just require labor standards we help nations build institutions to enforce those standards so we look at do you have a department of labor we look at does the department of labor have sufficient staff to enforce the law we look at do the regulations take seriously the responsibility of enforcement and we literally help nations not only understand how labor standards help them deliver the benefits of world trading to all in their society but we help them understand that just having the standards to support all their people is not enough you do have to be able to enforce those standards you do have to be able to take action against the exploitive employer so these trade agreements are good for our kids they are good for peoples of the world and that brings me to my second major point our security depends on agreements like that we have negotiated with oman the 9 11 commission report cited our middle eastern free trade agreements and call for action on a comprehensive unitedstates strategy that should include economic policies that encourage development more open societi~s and opportunities for people to improve the lives of their families and enhance the prospects of their childrens future in other words the 9 11 report was saying if you do not address the causes that are creating terrorism and the willingness to be terrorists in other societies you cannot solve the problem and i want to just conclude by saying how very impressed i was when ways and means committee members a little less than 2 years ago made a trip to the middle eastern nations that were interested in trade agreements and whose other trading agreements were about to expire 2100 we knew that they would need to think about this in advance carefully we know that participating in trade agreements means other countries have to modernize their law to meet high international standards we knew it would take time and we wanted to be sure to alert these other countries to the challenges that lay ahead for them in negotiating these free trade agreements and to the enormous benefits that would accrue to their people in not only the present but future generations i must say i was extremely impressed with the sultan of oman he understood exactly what this was going to mean to his people he is one of the middle east leaders who understands that oil is a limited resource and he must prepare a broader base for economic success for his people in his own country and he is doing some of the work in the more advanced areas of desalinization thinking about the importance of water to his people and the demand in the world economy particularly in the middle east for potable water he is a very forwardlooking man he is very committed to participation in the political process by women as well as men he has appointed successful women to his top council they do things slightly differently because they are coming from a different path but he was very proud to have started worker committees that was his initiative because he knows workers have to have a better voice they have to be free to talk about the problems to work with management to work with owners for everyones success in this agreement he has moved light years

congratulate the gentleman from south carolina and the democrats for coming forward with a substitute it is never an easy thing to write a budget as we all know but i appreciate the fact that so many of our colleagues came forward with a budget the prime argument that is being made here today is first of all that the republicans seem to have caused the deficit number one and number two that the only way to get out of the deficit is to listen to the demo crats and increase taxes and increase spending so let me just take those because that is basically what the argument is first of all with regard to the deficit now maybe my memory is just fading but i am trying to remember back to before the world changed on september 10 of 2001 and we were running a surplus we had more money in the treasury in the federal treasury than we were paying out but we also discovered something that next morning on september 11 of 2001 we discovered that we were running some deficits that we did not know about because the balance sheet did not give us much perspective on it we were running a deficit in homeland security we were not protecting the country we were running a deficit in national defense we were not able to project our strength around the world and protect freedom we had a deep recession that we needed to climb out of that got a gut punch that morning and it lasted for quite a while longer so we made some very deliberate decisions that next day and days after in a bipartisan way we said it is time to reduce taxes stimulate the economy it is time to protect the country do whatever it takes it is time to fund our national defense it is time to protect our borders it is time to do all of these things and let us not ask the question today how we are going to pay for it let us do it and we did it and you voted for every one of those bills every single one do ndt shake your head i will show you the votes you voted for every single one of those bills to protect the country you protected the country with every single one of your votes so instead of coming down here today and blaming the republicans for partisan purposes why do you not remember the history you know that it is osama bin laden that had as much to do with this deficit as anybody in this country and instead of trying to get political points you ought to just relax and try and figure out a way to get out of it so this is how we decided to get out of it we said let us control spending let us stimulate the economy and look at what has happened as a result of that not only did the tax cuts not get us into that deficit but because of the work that we have done we are climbing out of it bjecause we are protecting the country because we are stimulating the economy and are creating jobs because of all of that we have the opportunity in this budget to reduce the deficit and build on the progress we had from last year last year we cut the deficit 20 percent 20 percent in one year with a growing economy and controlling spending and so we are starting on a glidepath reducing that deficit every year the deficit was not caused overnight it is going to take some time to get it down and we have a plan to accomplish that now i also want to put this deficit in some perspective you have got to compare the deficit to something you cannot just say 500 billion is a lot of money or 200 billion is a lot of money of course it is a lot of money but compared to what is it a lot of money compared to our economy is the measure that every single economist says you have got to compare it to and as you look at the deficit as it is compared to our economy you can see here that this year we are at 3 6 percent of our economy if we stick to this belt tightening that is responsible over time we will be able to get down to 1 percent of the economy and why is that important well first of all let me show you deficits in the past this is not even the biggest deficit we have ever run this is not the biggest deficit look back in 1946 after world war ii we were running a deficit that was 7 percent of our economy let us look to the year i first came to congress it was 3 9 percent of the economy back in 1990 when the gentleman from texas and i came to congress let us look back to the early eighties when we complained it was 5 percent we are talking about an economy that is chugging along and growing we are talking about a deficit plan that gets us below the rate of growth that we need to get to in order to have a responsible budget and we need to pass this plan and get on with business we do not need tax increases and we do not need more spending vote down the spratt substitute"], [0.000689089298248291, 0.5006890892982483, 1, "this is not the first nor will it be the last time that we take the floor of the house here in the well of the house to address a problem that is of great concern to all of us and that is the budget deficit this year past it was 412 billion and while it appears to be improving thankfully a bit for the current fiscal year it still will come in likely in the range of 350 billion and that will make it the thirdlargest deficit in our nations history the third in a row where we have approached the pinnacle the largest deficits we have run in our countrys history we are not here to score political points we are here to call attention to a problem that we think has grave consequences it may be that we do not feel or see the consequences right now but we feel that a day of reckoning lies on or just over the horizon i believe that because sooner or later the fundamentals in any market begin to take hold it happened to the dot coms it could happen again to us with the budget deficit that we are running today and the trade deficit we are running also today it could hammer the dollar after all the fundamental is simply stated like this when you raise the demand for credit which is what you do when the government runs a deficit of 312 billion 412 billion when you raise the demand for credit eventually you raise the price of credit in other words you raise interest rates what do interest rates do when they go up they stifle growth in the economy longterm growth and shortterm growth they could have devastating consequences for example on the housing market on the automobile market that is a likely consequence of the policies we are running today for the time being we have not felt or seen the results the consequences and largely that is due to the fact that this country is running large current account deficits which means we are pumping dollars into the world economy which come back here are recycled here by the purchase of our treasury bonds and treasury notes so for now foreigners are lending us the money to bridge our budget which is sparing us the effect of high interest rates but at the same time debt means dependence and over the course of years if we continue this practice we will find ourselves having undercut our independence in foreign policy which is something none of us wants even when foreigners buy our debt and spare us the outlay for now we still have to pay the interest we still have debt service the debt service in the total budget this past year was 165 billion 170 billion and it is going up inexorably because we have got more debt and interest rates are rising again as those two factors converge you are going to see the debt service the interest we pay on the national debt go up to 200 billion 225 billion 250 billion within the foreseeable future this is an obligation that has to be paid indeed there is no other item in the budget that is more obligatory the united states of america has to pay its interest on its national debt or otherwise our currency and our credit would collapse but once we pay the debt once we pay the debt service the effects are that priorities in the budget we could otherwise afford and fund and increase such as medical research and scientific research and education for our children and social security and medicare for the elderly become all the harder to fund because the interest has to be paid first this deficit problem is all the more distressing because it did not have to be just a few short years ago in the year 2000 the last full fiscal year of the clinton administration this country was running a surplus of 236 billion it is a fact you can look it up every year the clinton administration was in office due to two budget plans we adopted one in 1993 another in 1997 the bottom line of the budget got better and better and better the president came to office and inherited a deficit of 290 billion he sent us on february 17 a deficit reduction plan that barely passed the house a onevote margin barely passed the senate the vice presidents tiebreaking vote but look what happened as this chart here shows the deficit every year came down and down and down to the point where in the year 2000 we had a surplus without including social security a unified surplus of 236 billion unprecedented this was the surplus that president bush inherited when he came to office in the year 2001 and that is why i say this did not have to be we did not just fall out of the sky with these enormous deficits we did it because of policies that were adopted and passed in this house not by all of us most of us on our side of the aisle voted against them foreseeing this problem and knowing how difficult it had been to move the budget finally back into the black again for the first time in 30 40 years we did not want to see us backslide into deficit but that is exactly what happened what we have seen now is that we have gone from a surplus projected of 5 6 trillion between 2002 and 2011 that was the 10year projection that mr bushs own economists made at the office of management and budget when he took office 5 6 trillion we have gone from a projected surplus of 5 6 trillion to a projected deficit of 3 8 trillion over that same 10year period of time that is a swing of 9 4 trillion in the wrong direction we have never seen a fiscal reversal like this at least since the great depression 9 4 trillion in the wrong direction and much of that was policy driven the president says we have got to get our hands around spending but a large part of this problem was driven by his insistence that we have unprecedentedly large tax cuts and when the surpluses that we thought were going to obtain over that 10year period of time appeared to be overstated substantially by some estimates as much as 50 percent the president charged ahead with his tax cuts in 2002 2003 in addition to 2001 there were substantial tax cuts and the loss of revenues has had a big impact on the bottom line and has helped put the deficit almost intractably in the red again but most of the spending increases have come on the discretionary side of the budget in the appropriation bills that we adopt every year in four different accounts four different programmatic areas which is important to know because all of these areas are areas where the president has sought and we have provided what he has sought in the way of additional increases in spending if you look at the increases in spending over and above current services and that is the amount of money necessary to maintain the government services at their existing level if you look at those spikes in the budget that rise above funding for current services alone you will find the landscape for 4 years dotted by the same increases namely defense homeland security the response to 9 11 they account for 90 to 95 percent of the increases in spending so while the president is saying that congress needs to tighten spending in truth much of the spending that has driven the budget into deficit is spending that has been called for for defense and homeland security and for the response to 9 11 called for by the president passed by the congress and the fact of the matter is we are simply not paying the tab for these necessary expenses i am not disputing the need for this money what i am disputing and calling attention to is the fact that we are taking the tab for defense in our time against terrorists in the middle east and elsewhere and shoving this tab off onto our children that is why i often say that the deficit is a problem for the economy because eventually it will raise interest rates and stifle longterm growth eventually it will affect the priorities in the budget because debt service is obligatory and has to be paid and as debt service increases other things get eclipsed and shoved aside but the biggest problem with the deficit in my book is moral because what we are doing is instead of paying for defense in our time we are telling our children they have got to pay for defense in their time and our time too or at least the incremental cost of it this is the concern that we would like to address tonight the fact that we are not facing up to the situation that confronts us and the fact that we have a budget deficit of enormous proportions andby any honest fair and accurate calculation or projection of what it is likely to be it shows little signs of abating over the next 10 years as this particular chart right here will show this chart shows where we believe using congressional budget office numbers the presidents budget if implemented over the next 10 years will take us the budget deficit will get a bit better as indeed it is scheduled to improve this year probably 350 billion good news the bad news is that the president in projecting the future course of the deficit number one is only giving us a 5year projection and number two he has left out some significant costs such as the cost of maintaining troops in afghanistan and iraq after the year 2005 such as the cost of fixing social security such as the cost of repairing something we call the alternative minimum tax which actually raises tax revenues above the level that would otherwise exist if people were not required to pay this alternative minimum tax it will soon by 2010 affect 30 million tax filers as opposed to 4 million this year i do not think politically that is likely to happen and if you fix it to avert that problem the problem of having the alternative minimum tax apply to middleincome families for whom it was never intended then you get a result here of a deficit 10 years from now equal to 621 billion no improvement and indeed after a few years of slight moderation a worsening deficit every year to the point where at the end of our 10year time frame it is up to 621 billion let me just wrap up this introductory presentation of what concerns us about the budget by showing you sort of the backofanenvelope the easiest way i know to explain what i think is an outofcontrol situation back in 2001 when the bush administration was pushing its tax cuts they came to us and they said the future looks so rosy that you can pass these tax cuts you can pass these defense increases you can pass our budget and we wont be back to ask you to increase the debt ceiling of the united states a legal limit beyond which we cannot borrow we wont be back until 2008 2010 well the republicans in the house and the republicans in the senate passed the presidents budget pretty much as he requested with a few moderations the next year they were back hat in hand 2002 notwithstanding what they told us the previous year they needed an increase in the debt ceiling of the united states of 450 billion the following year 2003 they were back again this time they wanted a phenomenal increase in the debt ceiling of the united states 984 billion an increase in 1 year of 984 billion how much is that that amount is equal to the entire debt of the united states the year that ronald reagan took office it is a bit more than that as a matter of fact the following year having obtained a 984 billion increase on may 26 2003 the following september 2004 secretary snow was back saying i need 800 billion more they ran through 984 billion of debt ceiling in 1 fiscal year and came back hat in hand and asked for 800 billion more which the congress passed in late november of last year and then when the budget resolution was brought to the floor this year the republican budget resolution when it passed the house and passed the senate buried in it was a provision that called for another increase in the debt ceiling of 781 billion this is a budget which they claim will eventually move us to halving the deficit over 5 years at the same time they make that claim they bury in that budget a request provision that congress increase the debt ceiling by 781 billion add those together 4 fiscal years we get an increase in the deficit an increase in the national debt of 3 015 trillion that is just phenomenal there it is on the back of an envelope it sums up the fiscal course and policy of this administration as succinctly as anything we can present 3 trillion of additional debtborrowing capacity which will basically all be used up by the end of this fiscal year and they will be back again asking for more so this is what concerns us we frankly do not think the country can continue on this course and that is why we are here tonight to talk about a problem that we think should be a frontburner problem for both parties both houses both executive branch and the congress it needs more attention than it is now receiving i yield to the gentleman from maine"], [0.0006892681121826172, 0.5006892681121826, 0, "i yield myself such time as i

commitment to the troops and while i know the overall bill enjoys bipartisan support including mine i must point out that this morning i believe the leadership of this body has betrayed that covenant it seems that just 1 week after passing a socalled reform bill with no teeth the majority is back to their same old tricks arrogantly preventing debate and consideration of critical measures that improve the bill and the lives of the people serving this nation they even prevented the distinguished ranking member of the armed services committee mr skelton from offering an amendment to his own defense bill the skelton amendment would have prevented the copays for medication for our military and their families from going up which they will if this bill is passed without the skelton amendment but the republican leadership refused to make it in order for those americans who are not familiar with the rules committee and i expect that is most of them and how it works what that effectively means is that a select few in the republican leadership have decided what the entire congress and the entire nation and what the men and women in uniform will get they decided that on their own without even a vote on the house floor without the debate and consideration of this full body given the rhetoric we hear on this floor every day about the troops and how important they are i feel compelled to ask my friends in the majority to justify how in less than 24 hours after they approved 70 billion in tax cuts for the wealths how they could refuse to allow us to even consider a measure to improve th6 health bare of our troops and their families we owe our troops more respect than this it is for similar reasons that many of my democratic colleagues and i are concerned with section 590 of this bill the section removes a longstanding requirement in our military code that requires chaplains to exhibit a level of tolerance compassion and understanding towards the religious diversity of the soldiers to whom they administer counsel can you imagine that mr speaker we are taking away the idea that they should serve with tolerance compassion and understanding it was too inflammatory i should say that i am confident our chaplains have both the sense and the respect for their fellow soldiers to do this and to do it willingly but why would this majority lower that standard and expect anything less from our chaplains as they clearly do we have soldiers of every faith and no faith fighting for us under the american flag they all deserve our respect particularly in moments of great despair or need is this majority so arrogant as to suggest that they should micromanage how a chaplain administers faith qn a battlefield i can think of few things more offensive or absurd my friend mr israel offered an amendment to the bill that would have corrected the problem restoring the requirement that all chaplains demonstrate sensitivity respect and tolerance but mr israels amendment was tossed out the window along with common sense on this issue it has been forbidden by the leadership from even being considered on the floor today as was an amendment from representatives tierney and leach which buyer cardoza davis il delay evans would have established a trumhnlike commission which we have been trying for 2 years to do one designed to ferret out corruption and incompetence in our military contracting and for some reason the majority of this house does not want to look where all that money is missing in iraq despite the fact that the same measure has passed the house numerous times and despite the fact that it is the clear will of this body that this commission be created and despite the fact that the word incompetence has become the most apt description of this administration a select few in this leadership made these decisions for all of us that we would not even consider that amendment today an amendment which were it enacted would allow us to go looking for the 9 billion in taxpayer money that this administration has literally lost in the war in iraq there are many more amendments to this bill that the leadership refused to allow us to consider today and because they are making decisions for all of us and for the american people without their consent they decided we would not be allowed to consider mr markeys

seems to be playing out much differently than their program allows for tax cuts for the rich cannot save the world and it cannot save americans preventing americans from talking about an idea does not

hussein was this was brought home to me very dramatically on my first visit to iraq in october 2003 i have since gone back on three additional occasions plus to afghanistan i was talking with a young american soldier at that point we like every other intelligence service in the world and most people in the world thought there were wmds in significant quantities in iraq although i do hasten to point out the capacity to acquire and to develop those was still very much there and mr hussein was still working himself out of u n sanctions and placing himself in a position to do that so i still think we were right to have acted early but this young soldier that i was visiting with i asked him weve been here a considerable amount of time weve not found the quantities of wmds we expected do you think it was a wise decision to come he was quiet for a moment and looked at me and he said yes sir i will tell you regardless and i still think they had the capacity but regardless i think it was a good decision to come i said why and he answered my question with a question of his own he said sir have you ever been to a mass grave site i said no i havent he said i have he said until youve seen hundreds of wailing women as bodies are coming out one after another trying to identify is that a father is that a son is that a husband is that a brother you dont know what terror really is he said my question is why the whole world wasnt here 10 years ago that is a very interesting question to ask because we of all people had the ability 10 years previously to have done that we had just won a war with saddam hussein we stopped at the border and we actually urged people on the other side to rise up and they did and 50 000 of them were killed by saddam hussein and neither we nor our coalition allies did anything to help so i think looking at what was going on in iraq looking at the 400 000 deaths looking at the 263 identified mass grave sites and lodking frankly at our responsibility to have done something when indeed for a decade we did nothing is something that we ought to think about and frankly something that the whole world ought to think about just 2 weeks ago or last week actually the new york times ran an article on another mass grave site that had been located was being frankly explored if that is even the appropriate term in preparation for saddam husseins trial and in that there were 2 500 people almost all of them women or children some of them as young as 3 or 4 years of age that is the type of thing that american intervention in iraq stopped my friends on the other side say well are there any signposts any hope i think that is a very legitimate question to raise too because there is no doubt this has been a rough road that we have walked down and no doubt and i think my friends are appropriate when they raise this that it has not gone as predicted and as planned and it has been a very very difficult process but i think we ought to stop and look at the iraqis on the ground and see what they are doirig the fact that a constitutional government has been established or is being established the fact that 8 million people came out to vote under the most difficult of circumstances the fact that we have elections scheduled for october and again for december of this year an extraordinary achievement by very brave iraqis under very difficult circumstances to set up what we most need in that part of the world which is a functioning democracy that would not be possible without the sacrifice and the service of the brave men and women of the united states military that is one of the things they are accomplishing their first accomplishment of course is to make us more secure i think it is always legitimate to ask are we more secure or less secure as a result of the war in iraq i would argue we are more secure i would argue that anybody that believes somebody like zakawi would not be busy trying to kill americans someplace in the region or in the world probably is missing the point our troops are engaged there and are engaging an enemy that left otherwise free to operate would be busy trying to kill other americans as they demonstrated pretty dramatically on 9 11 i would also argue that over time the best way to transform the region is exactly the one that the president suggests that is to establish a functioning democracy i have a lot of faith in the iraqi people i have met the political leaders there i saw the courage of people going out i talked to a young soldier on the way back just after the elections actually in march of this year who had been wounded at mosul i asked him were you there for the elections he said yes sir i was it was the proudest moment in my 15 years of service to my country i was never so proud of my unit my army or my country for what we accomplished and frankly i was enormously proud and impressed with the iraqi people who came out and demonstrated their determination with our help to establish a free society so i think we should have this discussion i think it is a good discussion for us to have but i think we should remember the horror that was there before the americans intervened the process that is under way that will not only improve the lives of the people in iraq but is essentially the manner in which we hope someday to be able to leave a selfgoverning and free country it is not going to be an easy task it is not going to be a simple task but it is a noble task and it is one i think that the men and women engaged in it that wear the uniform of the united states can be extraordinarily proud of and frankly something that all of us can be grateful to them for accomplishing and running such great risks to achieve i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.0006899833679199219, 0.5006899833679199, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume it is a real privilege to rise tonight to take on the role of discussing the statutorily required humphreyhawkins side of this debate that is to consider how this budget fits into the overall economic policy of the united states we have heard so far a very engaging debate and may i say the chairman of the committee on the budget has done an extraordinary job of defending the details of this budget he has been powerful and persuasive and intelligent and i think has made a compelling case the argument that we are going to make in the next hour has to do more with how this fits into the overall economic priorities of the united states this in my view is perhaps one of the most important reasons for passing this budget because as we look at where america is today as we look at the economic challenges we are facing it is clear that we need to have a strong and responsible fiscal policy that encourages economic growth that controls spending and by controlling spending brings down our deficit over time reassures capital markets and sends the message that the american economy continues to be the safest place in the world to invest if we continue on the path directed by this budget resolution we have an opportunity i think to lay the groundwork for an unprecedented expansion and to create opportunity and economic growth in the american economy that is so badly needed in many of our communities including many parts of my district there is no question that the challenges we are facing today are substantial the deficit is a serious problem and the proposed remedy contained in this budget resolution involves some very strong medicine and for many individual members of the house some very very difficult policy decisions we need to pass this resolution because the broad parameters of spending that are the real budget resolution the blueprint that is the substance of this budget resolution is precisely the vehicle we need to move in the right direction to make sure that we control spending and create the opportunity to continue the economic expansion which is only now just beginning over the past few years america has gone through a challenging time economically nowhere is that more evident than in my district but at the same time there are very encouraging signs we know that we have been running a deficit we know we have been running a deficit because first of all understandably we have been in the throes of a recession and we have never run a surplus during a recession second of all we have never run a surplus in wartime and even as we have been undergoing a very difficult episode a combination of a slowdown which began during the last administration coupled with the substantial damage to our economy that occurred in the wake of 9 11 at the same time we have had to take on a war on terrorism that was not of our choosing the combination of these two factors the loss of reyenue because of the slowdown of the economy and at the same time the challenge of meeting the war on terrorism have been a substantial drain on our resources yet our underlying economy continues to be sound and clearly we have a path that we can pursue that brings us back toward a balanced budget and providing the kind of policy in place that will continue to meet the needs of america this budget resolution is precisely what we need we recognize that an uncontrolled deficit can put pressure on interest rates increasing the cost of borrowing and putting the brakes on economic growth and investment without economic growth we are not going to be able to generate the revenue to get back to a balanced budget we also recognize that a lax fiscal policy could further weaken the unitedstates dollar in global markets and undermine its standing as the reserve currency of the world economic system this has been one of the cdre advantages that america has retained relative to our global competition that is why the decision we make with this budget is going to be so very very important this budget is a blueprint for injecting spending restraint while encouraging economic growth and stability its adoption will signal to the financial markets that a fiscally conservative congress once more is prepared to sally forth to make difficult decisions necessary to control the federal deficit and maintain our economy on a growth path this budget vehicle provides fiscal discipline that will strengthen investor confidence in the renascent economy and act as a powerful tonic to continue on the path of economic growth it provides for controlling spending without raising taxes which is precisely the formula that has worked for us and can continue to work for us we recognize that we need to maintain a progrowth tax policy that is essential to move america toward a balanced budget this budget resolution allows us to continue and make permanent the successful tax policies that have allowed us to grow the economy what it does in a nutshell is it cuts the deficit in half over a 5year period perhaps more importantly it shrinks over time the national debt relative to the economy that is the burden on the national economy that the capital markets understand if we have a national debt that is growing relative tb the economy it will roil capital markets over time if it grows excessively but what matters to the economy is not the absolute size of the debt it is the size of the debt relative to the economy e 2000 if we can continue to grow the economy and grow the economy faster than the national debt then that will be a source of confidence and a source of growth in the economy that is precisely what this budget resolution does in a sound responsible way it maintains a strong commitment to economic growth and progrowth tax policy by controlling discretionary and mandatory spending i will have further remarks in support of this resolution i reserve the balance of my time"]]}
