government a couple of years back we were told that oneparty government was going to produce enormous change that washington was going to be pre sented with a reform agenda and that things were going to be better for middleclass america as a result of oneparty rule in washington today what we see is that oneparty rule has simplyproduced oneparty irresponsibility because what you have before us is a businessasusual budget one of the things that the american people have said over and over again that they want to see changed is the congress there have been attempts here to paper over the fact that we are not changing for example we went through an exercise of reform called the hamiltondreier committee which was to present to the congress a series of reforms the reforms suggested by the hamiltondreier committee after a year of work have literally been buried we have not seen any of them and guess what we are running a budget out on the floor today without having put in place any of those reforms with no intention of moving ahead with those reforms evidently in the future and a businessasusual budget on the floor and oh guess what we are even going to play some little games with this budget they were going to pump the budget up in money so that then people could come to the floor and offer amendments to cut back down the budget and take credit for the cutting back down of the budget and then what we were going to say was look how much we have saved and we were going to make certain that none of those little bitty cuts really did any harm so what we did was we went to the committee on rules and i took the time to go up to the committee on rules and watch this performance last night as we made in order some amendments that we knew would do no particular damage but the amendments that were real we simply lopped out the rule that you have before you today is a rule designed to make certain that nothing really happens that the congress continues to go forward spending money on itself as though there were no tomorrow and that any amendments that are offered do no real damage to that approach and oh b~e the way the amendments that were real in terms of reform never get to the floor this is just absolutely the wrong rule it is the wrong bill let me tell you one thing i think america is in the mood for a change middleclass america has had it with exactly what they see going on in the congress at the present time i have got one message to middleclass america then and that is if you want to see this kind of performance change change the house of representatives i will guarantee one thing if 3ou put republicans in charge of this body next january one of the first bills that we will revisit is this legislative appropriations bill we will go back and make certain that there is reform we will pull it into the discussion again we will revisit it we will get real reform as of next january but it is obviously going to take a new majority here to do it"],

open amendment process with the ability to offer amendments to cut spending our good friend the gentleman from kentucky is the chairman of the subcommittee and has always brought these bills to the

like to know where that amendment is when are we going to get a chance to see it this rule makes a mockery of democracy the democrat leadership should be ashamed of itself that it is forcefeeding this

number i think i have got a pretty good case of boy did i get a wrong number tonight i got a mailing at my office within the last couple of days from the speaker of the house not the acting speaker but the real speaker of the house the gentleman from washington and it was headlined how you robert s walker can help president clinton succeed i opened it up and it has got a lot of fascinating stuff in here about how i can help the president mainly how i can help the president by sending money to the democrat congressional committee and also by sending back their survey but i was fascinated by some of what was in this letter it was addressed to me i mean it says dear robert s walker and then it says to me you are one of a select group of democrats from around the nation whom im asking to take part in this important survey now obviously this is a computer glitch that got this to me but it did reveal some very fascinating things for example there is an underlying paragraph here that says unfortunately newt gingrich and his rightwing allies succeeded in cutting our congressional majority in last years election and all i could say was yippee and so that was the right thing i also kind of had the feeling at that point that i ought to start flapping my right wing but the fact is that they are admitting here that the gentleman from georgia has in fact gotten his message across to the american people and that we are in fact beginning to win new majorities but then it goes on and it tells the american people a couple of fascinating things it says here because the success or failure of the clinton administration depends upon which party has control of the congress righto i say to my colleagues if you wanted to have the clinton administration succeed what tom foley is telling you in this letter is you want democrats in the congress if you dont want the clinton administration to succeed with higher taxes and more spending you want to change the congress the gentleman from washington is absolutely right and i am pleased that he sent me this letter then he went on down here this is a fascinating little p s that they put on the letter it says if the republicans gain more control in congress it will severely cripple bill clintons agenda well let me tell you after spending some time at home over the last several weeks and listening to what people are having to say about bill clintons agenda my guess is that this is an admission by speaker foley that the republicans are going to take control of the congress let me repeat that to you it says if republicans gain more control in congress it will severely cripple bill clintons agenda america at this point wants to cripple bill clintons agenda they have decided that this tax and spend is not what they want tom foley is telling you america what you should do tom foley is saying elect republicans to congress because if republicans gain control of the congress we will stop bill clintons agenda thanks speaker foley for this letter this is a very revealing document i appreciate it now i did notice that you asked me to send a contribution i do not think you are going to get one you asked me to return the survey i do not think i am going to do that on a serious note i am a little concerned about the fact that it arrived at my rayburn house office building because solicitations of

very important debate virtually 3 years ago today i and the other 42 members of my class elected in 1990 and taking office in 1991 stood on the lawn of the capitol with two very important members of this body at that time the gentleman from indiana mr hamilton a democrat and mr gradison from ohio a republican pledging our support for this concept of creating a joint committee on the reorganization of congress we had been here a mere 7 months and understood at that time pretty clearly that congress is broken and something needs to happen what happened when we stood there on the lawn that day several weeks later the house bank scandal came along the house restaurant scandal came along the post office scandal came along a debate about the ethics committee on whether we were going to have full disclosure on what happened in the bank and finally in june 1992 under heat congress passed a resolution setting up the joint committee we spent a year in the joint committee held numerous hearifigs hundreds of members of congress coming and testifying over 40 different issuet that we all know have to be addressed and what happened nothing today we are going to take one small part of that an important part of that but only one small part of that and we are going to debate it in the congressional accountability act which i support one of the issues we were dealing with during that discussion was deliberation on the floor and members ability to come here with their ideas and to offer those ideas for the members to vote on if they liked them i wasdenied an amendment in this bill that would require congress to adopt foia for the nonlegislative areas of this body it was not made in order and why should congress come under foia because if we had the freedom of information act like we have downtown in the executive branch we would have never had a house bank scandal we would have never had a post office scandal we would have never had a scandal in the house restaurant system if the american people and the press could ask what happens here if they could see how we spend our money day in and day out members might be little more careful but because we do not have foia those things have happened and that is history but to not allow me to offer the amendment on the floor today is exactly what is wrong with this body we should defeat the previous

overhaul while this bill includes many valuable provisions for new police and prison space it has been significantly watereddown by the housesenate conferees in a display of arrogance toward their colleagues in both houses of congress the deleterious results of the backroom wheeling and dealing of the crime bill conferees are plainly evident there are several examples of the conferees ignoring or defying specific instructions from the house of representatives for example on july 13 the house voted to instruct conferees to include a community notification provision which would require local police departments to be informed about the presence of sex offenders in the community and encourage law enforcement to disclose this information to the public this language was watered down significantly in the conference committee report megan kanka a 7yearold in my district was viciously abused and killed by a sexual predator who had been convicted twice for preying on young children no one in the community knew the killers sordid past had megans grieving parents known that their neighbor was a dangerous person they would have taken steps to protect theirprecious child megans parents had a right to know that information im disappointed to say that the language in the crime bill is weak far less than the proposal offered by senator gordon and congresswoman dunn the conferees also ignored the fact that on june 22 the house voted overwhelmingly to instruct conferees not to accept any agreement that reduced funding for new prisons below the houseapproved level of 13 5 billion instead we have a final bill that includes only 8 3 billion for prison construction on june 29 the house overwhelmingly ap proved a measure to instruct conferees to not accept any agreement that disallows evidence of similar crimes to be presented in court when hearing sex offense cases on july 20 the house approved a measure to instruct conferees to not accept any agreement that fails to include a senateapproved measure that provides for mandatory prison terms for the use possession or carrying of a firearm during a state crirhe of violence these are but a few examples of the arrogance demonstrated by the conferees in crafting a bill that flatly contradicts the will of the house and the senate in many important areas there are obviously elements in this legislation

of you and visit the korean peninsula as you know from the news in the last few days the korean peninsula has been on the headlines we have heard a great deal about it but i think it is probably worth our time tonight to spend 30 40 45 minutes and just do a basic review of what we are talking about in north korea what the difficulty is in korea and get a look at the entire picture that involves the korean peninsula i think probably the first thing we should understand is that america the united states has a very special interest in south korea we begin that by saying that we have approximately 35 000 american troops stationed in south korea in addition to those 35 000 american troops we also have stationed in south korea about 14 000 private civilians and about 11 000 other members of military families so we have a very special interest in south korea in addition to the families and the american citizens and united states military personnel we have in south korea we also have a security commitment with south korea that followed the korean war which ended in 1953 to begin this evening i think we need to take a basic look at the geography so that we have a better under standing of what the korean peninsula looks like let us start right here so that we have a broad layout of what the geographical area is first of all down here in the lefthand corner you will see the country of japan and right here are the korean straits those are going to be important i will be talking a little later on about the deployment of the carrier attack force down in this vicinity over here you have the sea of japan up here of course you have china i will be talking at some length about china the relationship between china and north korea the impact of sanctions whether or not china will agree with sanctions whether or not sanctions are even going to work if north korea launched some type of military attack what would chinas response be of course below china here we have north korea and down here below north korea we have south korea now dividing the two koreas is what is commonly referred to as the dmz so this evening when i talk about the dmz i am talking about this line that you can see on the diagram right here or on the other map which i have right here the black line which i will point out right underneath of the red that is the line that is the neutral zone so to speak established after the korean war by the united nations agreement to divide the two koreas now stop for a minute about north korea north korea is about onehalf the size of the state of nevada and has a population of about 22 to 23 million people pyongyang is the capital of north korea that is locatedright up in this vicinity right here now south korea has a very interesting geography the reason we want to talk about this this evening is that because in south korea you will soon understand the kind of risks military risks that not only the american troops have but our strong ally and good friend south korea has now letus first of all look at seoul soth korea seoul south korea is the capital of south korea and the key part of seoul is that in seoul onehalf of the countrys population about 10 million people live in seoul south korea seoul south korea also provides onehalf of the nations grossnational product or onehalf of the economy for the entire south korean peninsula so as you can see seoul is a very very critical area now seoulso you have an idea of the proportion on this mapseoul is located approximately 35 to 40 miles from the dmz in other words north korea which is an adversary to south korea is within 35 miles 35 miles of the nations capital there in south korea now the terrain in north korea is very similar to the state of colorado i am from colorado so i will be able to explain what it is like in the event of mountain warfare what it would be like to engage in air battles in that kind of terrain very difficult terrain in north korea very tough winters now china has a relation with north korea i will just give you a couple of statistics 75 percent of the oil supplies of north korea the imports come from china 72 percent of the food that north korea brings in comes from china 88 percent of the cooking coal which is a vital natural resource not found in north korea comes from china so as you can see china has a very strong economic relationship with north korea now since world war ii actually since world war iiand right after the korean warit is the united statesof america that has provided the security umbrella for the entire asian region as you know under the constitution which general macarthur drafted for the country of japan japan is not allowed to build an offensive military force and it is really through the event of deterrence deterrence during the cold war that we have been able to keep this area fairly peaceful but that entire concept the entire peace that we have had since the korean war though it has been interrupted periodically by terrorist actions of north korea that entire peace is now being threatened now the threat over in the korean peninsula is not something that has just arisen in the last 3 or 4 days although of course the news media across the country and across the world is highlighting north korea this really began to boil over about a year ago when north korea announced that they intended to withdraw from the nonproliferation agreement let us talk a little about the history of the north and south koreas as you can probably remember from your history books the division of the koreas took place after world war ii kim il sung who is the dictator of north korea was actually put into his position by stalin kim ilsung happens to be the longestliving dictator of any country in the world he has a very tight and very strong control over his people in north korea north korea launched the korean war which took place in 1950 it was launched by north korea under the pretext of military exercises in other words north korea was conducting what they called routine military exercises and in 1950 under the command of kim ilsung who is the same dictator that we are dealing with today issued the command to attack south korea and now the united states after the korean war agreed to provide certain protections for the korean peninsula to try to keep peace along the dmz in a few minutes i am going to show you i am going to give a military comparison between north korea and south korea so that you have some kind of perspective of what the circumstances are of any kind of conflict on the korean peninsula before i goany further let me make this point very very clear to you and that is that should a conflict occur on the korean peninsula it is not going to be similar to the situation in iraq where we successfully retook kuwait that was an incident in which some human lives were lost tragically but the numberof lives lost in iraq will be nothing nothing in comparison to the kind of casualties that we will take on the korean peninsula in fact it is my belief that the casualties that we will take will not only be devastating but will be very immediate we will i believe within days of any kind of military conflict beginning take thousands and thousands of american casualties we need to be prepared for what could be the biggest challenge to us i think considering the other countries that are involved perhaps since the commencement of world wax now is a military conflict going to occur i do not think it is i think we have to go to great lengths to avoid military conflict but we must understand at the very beginning that the consequences even if the percentage or the odds of an attack by north korea are very very small the longterm and tragic consequences as a result of the conflict being launched are substan t tial very substantial so we need to b pay very close attention to what is r going on over there and we need to i properly protect ourselves v now about north korea what does kim ilsungwhat kind of dictator is i he i mentioned to you earlier that he i has very very tight control over his t people t over the last 10 years and even over the last 14 years kim ilsung has launched terrorist attacks on south korea this includes an attack in 1982 or 1983 in an attempt to assassinate the president of south korea they set off a bomb in burma which i believe killed 17 south korean cabinet members e2250 it includes a terrorist attack against north korea another separate attack against the president of south korea where the president was missed by an assassins bullet but unfortunately the assassins bullet found its mark with the presidents wife it includes the launching of 20 commandos to take what is called the blue house which is the equivalent of our white house in washington the launching of 20 commandos into seoul south korea they did not get to the blue house but to give my colleagues an idea of the dedication of these soldiers every one of those 20 soldiers fought to their death even after they were surrounded they no chance whatsoever of making it to the blue house every one of those 20 soldiers fought to the death now we have tried the doctrine of appeasement what is the doctrine of appeasement it is a doctrine that says you try and get along you continue to give up what you have to the other side in an effort to get along a good comparison i would say to my colleagues is lets say you have a garden and you have got a neighbor who wants the ftuit or vegetables out of your garden that neighbor has threatened to take the entire garden from you if you dont on a regular basis continue to supply him with vegetables from your garden and year after year the demand from the neighbor becomes that he wants more and more vegetables out of the garden that is exactly what has happened in my opinion in korea the united states has continued to practice a doctrine of appeasement with north korea now north korea my colleagues need to understand and we will get a little more into the politics here in a few minutes but one of the things about north korea is it is very very unpredictable north korea responds to actions of strength north korea behaves itself when it receives an action of strength since 1989 the united states has continued to downsize its military presence on the korean peninsula beginning in 1989 for example we pulled 6 000 troops out in 1991 george bush pulled out the tactical nuclear weapons off the peninsula we are coninuing to try and negotiate with forth korea through appeasement i do iot think the results are apparent and think frankly it has led us to where e are today let us talk a little more about kim i sung up in north korea we need to ook at this from a perspectiveof being he most closed society north korea is the most closed society in the world it s the most unpredictable society of any in the world and it has a control r a grasp of its people more than any ther country in the world i say to my colleagues for example if you buy a radio in north korea the government manufactures the radio so that they tune into only one station every person in north korea is required to carry a picture of kim n sung the children of the north koreans are brought up to believe that everything in the world revolves around kim n sung our intelligence capabilities in north korea are very very limited what do i mean by very very limited i think it is fair to say that our ground intelligence the intelligence we have on the ground in north korea to get us a kind of military information or economic information that so so we can assess where north korea is gong is very limited if almost nonexistent our primary source of information from north korea is satellite reconnaissance but satellite information is only good if there is good weather it is not good if there is bad weather and it does not work very effectively with tunnels and i am going to talk about the tunnels here in a few minutes so we are dealing with a society that is unpredictable we are dealing with a society that has a very tight control of its people we are dealing with a society in north korea where the citizens of north korea really have had no exposure to the outside world and do not understand the ramifications i think of a nuclear confrontation or any kind of confrontation on the korean peninsula we are dealing with a population who has had drilled in their heads since they were able to understand their language drilled over and over and over again that the korean peninsula must be reunited with their generation what does with their generation mean we do not know let us make some military comparisons so that we have an idea exactly what we are talking about in regard to north korea and south korea first of all as i mentioned earlier the united states of america has about 35 000 about 35 000 american troops in south korea the south koreans have about 600 000 this is give or take a couple thousand 600 000 troops so we have got about 630 000 troops military troops in south korea in addition to that we have got reinforcements in japan in okinawa and of course we are able to move carrier fleets or move carrier hi1894"], [4.8626861826051027e-05, 4.8626861826051027e-05, 0, "i rise in opposition to this rule when the house voted to defeat the first rule for flood relief it took the democrat leadership by some surprise in a house they have controlled with an iron hand for four decades the democrats do not have much experience with losing votes so last weeks 216to205 vote caused quite a stira stir many of us hoped would lead immediately to a better rule unfortunately but not surprisingly those hopes have not materialized instead of changing the rule the democrat leadership is changing the vote instead of prompt relief for the victims they get smoke and mirrors instead of receiving the message from the membership that it is a bad rule the democrat leadership apparently resorted to strongarming members and letting pressure build over the weekend to change enough votes to get their their way and their bad rule as a result today we havd essentially the same rule we defeated last week minus any fical responsibility and still inexplicably wedded to a totally unrelated provision to pay 100 stipends for 30yearold teenagers in los angeles no brave new change here same old business as usual the democrat leadership has held on like a dog with a bone to this extraneous provisioneven at the risk of delaying relief to the flood victims in the midwest it is no wonder some members and the media are openly specutating about what dealmaking is going on behind the scenes of the democrat leadership a bipartisan trio representing flood victims nonetheless recognized that our government is deeply in debt and that we have got to face the costs of flood relief in the context of our already debilitating national debt payments these members asked and answered the question of how to pay for this flood relief bileither from this years budget or nextlo avoid heaping additional debt onto our childmn and grandchildren twice they pleaded with the democrat majority on the rules committse to allow the full house to debate their ideas and twice they were turned down i think it is fair to graphically compare the 1993 flood in the mississippi river valley to the federal debt both are swallowing up our livelihood the vote on this rule cannot stop the flood but it can reduce the national debt yet one of my colleagues on the rules committee went so far in avoiding specifics of how to pay for this 3 billion bill that he told messrs penny slatrery and nussle to just go away and let us help you it is a quote almost as memorable as hello rm from the government and im here to help you we all have compassion for the flood victimsand we will help them helping people who have been hit by a natural disaster is one of our govemments greatest obligatdons but years of ignoring the costs of our actions emergency and pseudoemergency have sapped our resources administratlon spokesman leon panetta has stated that we cannot really afford to fully help these flood victims and that probably applies to other victims of other natural disasters yet to comeunless we change our patterns of spending more money than we have i am willing to cut spending in other governmont accounts to ensure that we can help the flood victims i know many of my colleagues feel the same wayand we should at least be allowed to have that debate on

referring specifically to north korea many have in the last few weeks read extensive media coverage on north korea and the situation that we have on the korean peninsula this is a situation that must be taken by every american citizen very very seriously it is a situation that directly involves 37 000 american soldiers and it involves probably 14 000 to 16 000 american civilians and if a conflict were to break out on the korean peninsula it would involve the entire world not only from an economic point of view but certainly the stability of peace in the world as we know it so i would ask tonight that you bear with me as i discuss a little about korea we are going to talk for a few minutes about the history of korea we are going to talk about the politics ofkorea we are going to talk about the military readiness of korea we are going to talk about the nuclear situation over in korea and finally talk about a few solutions what direction should this country take in regard to north korea let me start out by defining north korea which in my opinion is a lot like a grizzly bear i am from colorado and bears are a big thing back there a grizzly bear and grizzly by the way stands for the word horrible the horrible bear that is why the grizzly bear got its name grizzly bears are sometimes predictable and sometimes not so predictable but there are some things you can do with the grizzly bear in order to judge that behavior the best that we know bow first of all obviously you never pick on the cubs second of all you prepare yourself for a confrontation if you are going up into the high country of alaska or canada where grizzly bears are known to roam you prepare before you enter into those mountainous territories so you are not unprepared when the grizzly bear approaches it has always been thought that the grizzly bear can sense fear if the grizzly bear does not sense fear the grizzly bear turns and runs it the grizzly bear senses fear you have got a real problem on your hands korea is not a whole lot different than that north korea in my opinion now to start this evening let me mention a couple of articles that i think would be very helpful for the average joe and average jane out there that want to know a little more about what is happening in korea i thought time magazine june 13 1994 had an excellent article in addition to that so that you have a geographical understanding of what north and south korea are about and what military options might be available i suggest that you look at the map contained in that july 13 time magazine article in addition i know that many of you may not subscribe to the heritage foundation an excellent foundation here in washington but they have a memorandum it is no 224 memorandum no 224 called defusing north koreas nuclear threat this is written by darryl plunk darryl plunk is an expert in korean matters i know darryl in fact i was in korea i just returned from korea about a month ago i spent time with darryl over there he is well respected i think his article addresses very clearly the kind of challengethat we face on the korean peninsula both of those articles i would recommend to you for some very basic knowledge on what our situation is in korea let us start out by looking at a little geography to assist us here i have brought down a map as most of you know south korea is down on the southern end obviously it is divided by what is called the dmz the dmz runs right along in this area above that is north korea north korea is a very mountainous type of terrain it has a lot of weather similar to the state of colorado right now however the peninsula up there is going through the monsoon rains north korea the access across the dmz is limited again that map in time magazine lays that out very well for you up here on the northern tnd of north korea the largest border on the peninsula is with the country of china we are going to come pack to china and discuss china a little more when we talk about economic sanctions to give you a little history north korea is a dictatorship in my opinion it is a communist dictatorship i noticed the north koreans have recently continued to refer to themselves as a socialist society it is a clear communist type of dictatorship in north korea the dictator in north korea is a gentleman by the name of kim iisong kim iisong is estimated to be 82 or 83 years old and he was installel into power by josef stalin in about the late 1940s in 1950 in june 1950 much to the surprise of the united states congress much to the surprise of the president of the united states president truman this dictator kim ilsong who is the dictator that rules the country today under the pretext of military exercises launched a surprise attack against south korea there is no need to say much more about that attack because we all know about the korean war ironically it was never declared as a war there were still 114 000 fatalities from our country alone so the same dictator that ordered it is the dictator we are having difficulties with today why do i bring that history up it is important history to understand that this dictator has taken it upon himself before to immerse his people into a very intense war and we cannot underestimate his courage if you call it that his insanity if you call it that or his just pure stubbornness if you call it that to launch a military attack now let us move very briefly to the military comparisons between north and south korea again i do not mean to keep referring to that time magazine article but i think it is necessary because that article is very simple and lays out some of these comparisons when you look at the numbers of troops north korea outnumbers the south koreans and american troops 2 to 1 now in south korea we have a united nations command we also have the unitedstates forces we have the south korean forces the combined command in the forces the commanding general over there is a very competent verycapable very tough general by the name of general locke i had the opportunity when i was in korea to spend many hours with him and his staff i came away from there feeling very confident about the military leadership we have got if in factwe provide those military people with the necessary arsenal and tools to carry out their job now let me give you some comparisons north korea 1 200 000 troops south korea and the united states about 235 000 troops south korea has the probability of calling out reserves of 2 million more people north korea the latest numbers i saw has the potential of calling out 6 million people in reserves main battle tanks 3 700 in north korea and approximately 1 900 in south korea artillery 10 000these are multiple rocket launchers10 000 in north korea about 4 600 in south korea air defense guns and this is an important statisticair defense guns and surfacetoair missiles 18 000 in north korea and about 1 500 in south korea let us talk for a minute about the importance of air ballistic missiles korea does not need a nuclear missile to launch an attack against south korea in fact i personally would be surprised if they used a nuclear weapon my primary concern with north korea is that they are going to sell these nuclear weapons but they do not need a nuclear weapon to launch a very devastating very deadly and horrible war on the korean peninsula take a look the most strategic point you have got in south korea is the community of seoul the capitalof south korea onehalf by the way of the countrys population onehalf of the countrys gross national product and less than 30 to 40 miles away from north korean ballistic missiles you do not need even more than one missile to launch into a city of 15 million people to create a panic can you imagine a missile going off in the dmz landing in seoul the kind of panic it would wreak in fact i think panic is going to be our biggest problem if in factand god forbidbut if we do have a military confrontation panic will be our biggest problem these ballistic missiles are located along the dmz several key areas up here and they have a significant ballistic missile system now a lot of people look at the korean peninsula and we should all be justifiably proud about the job the kind of operation we did in the persian gulf iraq was rumored to be this huge force that we would suffer huge casualties that this was an army of might the united stateswent into the persian gulf with the pride of our american people our american service people and we got a quick and decisive victory not so in korea not so at all north korea will have a real fighting force it is ironic that several years ago the north koreans tried to attack the blue house which is the same as our white house in the united states the home of the president in south korea twenty north koreans 20 north koreans attacked the blue house they were completely surrounded very quickly those 20 north koreans had no chance absolutely no chance of survival except through surrender no chance and every one of those north koreans fought to their death even under those circumstances this force has got a heavy militia now we clearly have air superiority north korea has some of the most sophisticated tunnel systems in the world they have a philosophy that the peninsula should be reunified they have unaltered loyalty to their dictator kim flsong by the way kim i1songs son about 52 or 53 years old while the loyalty is not as intense for the son there is still a following of the father son in north korea so this will be a force and unlike the persian gulf this will be if the conflict occurs a conflict in which we suffer immense casualties which will re quire a tremendous amount of resources devoted to that peninsula to sustain that action or hopefully not but to retake the peninsula should the north koreans be successful enough about the military issue let us talk about the issue that has heated up and where we are today let us talk about the nuclear issue we have always been concerned about a nuclear arms race over in east asia east asia is a very important economic center for the entire world the security for eastern asia has been provided primarily by the united states since the end of world war ii for the most part that economic security blanket and military security blanket has provided a great deal of stability east asia has been fairly stable granted we had the vietnam war and so on but i am talking about the korean peninsula and japan and taiwan we have seen very prosperous economies the economy in south korea is a tremendous economy there is good leadership in south korea north korea has a very very poor economy but the nuclear issue and what concerns us is that east asia would get into a nuclear race several years ago we had a number of countries well over 100 sign what is called the nonproliferation agreement what that agreement calls for or preventshopes to prevent through the enforcement of an association called iaearemember those initials iaea because you will hear those a lot as we talk about the nuclear issue the nonproliferation agreement was a hope that we all had that we could stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons and instead we could bring this world together as an economic center so to speak and that the wars and the fears of nuclear war or the fears of a nuclear weapon falling into the hands of a third world country or a country without stability could be minimized well the only way that the non proliferation agreement works obviously is if the participants of the nonproliferation agreement agree with its terms north korea has refused over and over and over and over again to comply with the agreement that it signed on the nonproliferation agreement our president in response to this noncompliance in november of last year made a very clear statement to the north koreans you must never have excuse me i am wrong it is not you must not it is you can never have a nuclear weapon well our president has spoken some very strong words remember my comparison to the grizzly bear if you come face to face with a grizzly bear and you stand there and you look right at him you do not have a gun you have no choice you stand and you look strong the grizzly bear in all likelihood unless you have a cub there will walk away but if the grizzly bear senses that you are going to back off the grizzly bear knows weakness it is the same thing with north korea north korea understands two things they understand strength and they understand weakness if you have a president who makes a strong statement he needs to be able to back that statement up since novemberand i am not trying to be partisan because i think when we talk about foreign affairs we have to lift ourselves above partisanship and worry about the welfare of this country and the welfare of the entire world but since that november statement our country has shown in my opinion a great deal of weakness in its negotiations with north korea example north korea we know has about nine suspect sites for the development of nuclear weapons in korea now remember we have limited intelligence in north korea we really rely very heavily on satellite intelligence and satellites of course cannot pick up what is going on on the ground and we have to have good weather north korea is the most closed society in the world it is very difficult to get ground intelligence out of north korea it is very difficult to do ground intelligence out of north korea very difficult to do this so of the nine sites under the nonproliferation agreement a team from the iaea is allowed to go in and inspect these sites the north koreans have said no then they said yes then they said maybe then they said no then they said okay then they said no then they said come on over then they said no then they said come over and look at a couple of sites then they said no then they said come on over and we will let you look at seven sites but not the two suspect sites this last week they said you can never look at the two most highly suspect sites where you think we are developing nuclear weapons i saw a comparison it said it is kind of like walking through the customs when one comes into this country walk through customs and tell the agent yeah you can go ahead ive got nine suitcases you can go ahead and look at seven of them but im going to point out to you which seven suitcases you can look at the other two suitcases which i pick you cant look at it is clearly flying in the face of the nonproliferation agreement which is really much broader than the nonproliferation agreement because we are talking about a country like korea who soon will have the technology to do what korea is doing and if we do not have an agreement that is enforceable we will have an arms race throughout the world an arms race that the next generation the next generation will have a very difficult tirm dealing with so this agreement means a lot more than just relationships between the united states and north korea or south korea and north korea it really talks about the beginning of an arms race let us talk about some of the ideas dealing with the failure of north korea to comply with the nonproliferation agreement or the inspections i say first of all if you look at north korea they always pay attention as i said earlier when you speak from a position of strength we unfortunately in the last year and a half or couple of years have shown some weakness on foreign affairs in haiti in somalia in bosnia and in north korea and so the north koreans i think believe they can play cat and mouse with us in fact i think they rather enjoy it its a very dangerous game back to the grizzly bear its kind of like poking a grizzly bear when its asleep if its in hibernation and youre sure its in hibernation no problem if its not you better watch out so the nonagreement of north korea and some of the options that are available to force them back into the agreement should be discussed one of those is and i hear it from my colleagues and that is to take a preemptive strike we know for example up here in yongbyon up in that area right in here that there is a nuclear site up there a nuclear reactor there in fact that is the one my colleagues have been reading a lot about where the rods have been removed in the last couple of weeks and there are some that would suggest we take a preemptive strike that we certainly have the capabilities to take that facility out in my opinion a preemptive military strike would be crazy it is not well thought out a preemptive military strike against north korea can assure us of one thing and that is a war on the korean peninsula a war that will have devastating results a war in which many of our 37 000 troops and many of the thousands of subsequent troops that we sent over to korea will lose their lives will pay the ultimate price so a first strike is not a good option even if we carried out the first strike from a military point of view it may not be successful if the key ingredients that we are tying to destroy are stored deep underground and the probability is that they are stored deep underground even if we are successful and we hit a nuclear facility the unfortunate thing is if we set loose radiation the trade winds tend to go this direction would go over seoulremember the population center of south koreaand eventually make its way down over tokyo ind over japan so a first strike preemptive strike against nuclear facilities is not a good option in my opinion will simply start a war well what is the next thing well we heard the president talked a lot in the last few weeks and we heard some very educated scholars and some very welllearned people on korea suggest economic sanctions there are two factors for economic sanctions to work first of all china has to agree that it will not veto the economic sanctions in the united nations security council and second of all even if china does not veto those economic sanctions that china will agree to enforce the economic sanctions remember i said earlier that north korea is the most isolated country in the world they do not have a lot of trade like the united states does for example they are not like taiwan where they trade all over the world or japan they trade primarily with one country and that country is china here is the border remember we looked at the border earlier if that border is not secure if china does not exercise the economic sanctions along that border then economic sanctions will cost this country tens of millions of dollars we will have very minimal impact upon north korea and we will not accomplish what i think is the key goal china in just the last couple weeks the president and this is incredible to me the president the secretary of state have said on and off again that china they think they are going to get china to cooperate with us china is not going to cooperate with economic sanctions they are not going to let this occur just in the last week and a half or so ago china has said that north korea are the quote blood brothers does that sound like the kind of talk that is going to get cooperation from china especially after we have already given to them the mostfavorednation status so we really do not have much to swap with them i do not think china wants to see a conflict on the korean peninsula but their relationship with north korea goes deep remember we were about to overrun the koreans when we finally launched our counterattack in the korean war in 1950 the reason that it was stopped the reason that the korean war came to a stalemate is because china dumped its troops in to face us from the north china has a long history with north korea and they are not about to put that aside to assist the united states with economic sanctions now japan is beginning to play a very important role in this many of my colleagues have probably heard the events of the last couple of days where korea has come out and given a very clear warning to japan back off if you dont back off we have got missiles that can hit your countrys mainland this is more of a confrontation between the south and north than between the united states we have a good ally in japan we have a good understanding with japan but look at the politics in japan for a few minutes first of all there are about a half a million korean citizens who are now living in japan and these descendants of korea came from japan over the years between say about 1910 and 1945 when japan occupied the korean peninsula and brought slave labor into japan and as a result there have been descendants through the generations so about 500 000 korean descendants live in japan they are very loyal to the korean peninsula and they send a great deal of money about a billion dollars estimated as high as 1 8 billion in sympathetic money to korea to north korea every year now the japanese the leadership as my colleagues know they have had a lot of turmoil in their leadership and it does not appear that that leadership is entirely stable they are going through some very trying times we have very capable leadership in japan but japan is getting a little i think getting a little cautious about being involved in economic sanctions against north korea and japan we have said to japan look you of anybody ought to be concerned about this you will be if youre not already well within the range of nuclear korean missiles and those korean missiles could soon contain a nuclear warhead you have got to participate with us we have got to stop this before it gets out of hand but when it comes time to really do something about it as i said earlier japan is very cautious i think they are going to have a very difficult time stepping in there and telling their citizens who are korean descendants that they can no longer send money to their families in north korea well what kind of options do we really have we have talked a little about the history we have talked about the military we have talked about the consequences of a war on the korean peninsula if there were a military conflict in korea what kind of options do we have and again i would refer my colleagues i think to mr plunks article heritage foundation no 224 and by the way it is dated june 2 1994 it lays out some options i would like to add a little to some of those options first of all our president needs to be very strong in his message to the north koreans i believe that our message our president has to go further than he has gone now our secretary of defense mr perry i think has done a fairly commendable job in dealing with the north korean situation since he has come into office but it has to go above mr perry it has to go directly to the president the president has told north korea that their country would be destroyed as they know it i am not sure they take the president seriously i do not think they took the president serious since november when he said they cannot really have a nuclear weapon and then flipflopped around as to whether they should have one a few of them are ok or so forth our president needs to make it very very clear that north korea should not miscalculate what the intentions of the united states of america are first of all i think the president needs to assure north korea that we would not take a preemptive strike against their country but in the same statement the president needs to make unequivocally clear to north korea that should north korea launch an attack against south korea and the united states that we will use whatever weapon in our arsenal is necessary to destroy their country in other words north korea a military conflict would be a gross and fatal miscalculation on your part so we need a firm statement from the president we need to be prepared militarily again if you are going out into the mountains up in alaska or canada into that high country you need to be prepared if you are prepared you are not going to have any difficulty north korea understands strength we have got an excellent command force over in korea the south korean forces that i met with and commanding officers i felt were very capable but we need to shore up our defense we need to immediately in our opinion begin to move more naval force into the area and i think we need to do this very prominently so that people see what is going on i think we need to shore up our capability with our air superiority i think that we have to have a carrier task force an additional carrier task force moved into the area i think that we have got to prepare our troops for war and i think our troops are prepared but i think that north koreaneeds to get the message that should they decide to engage in a war that the united states of america is not only ready for the war but ready to end the war very quickly on our terms if you have a strong defense i do not think there is any better way to stop a military conflict than that defense it used to be in the cold war we talked about deterrence and there is a difference between deterrence and defense deterrence is where let us say there is a fellow named mel mel is sitting out here and mel has a missile and i have a missile now mel is smart enough to know that if he uses his missile against me i can still use my missile against him so mel and i just kind of stay at arms length with each other that is called deterrence deterrence will not work in korea what will work in korea is a strong strong de fense i think what we need to do in addition is the president needs to make a personal trip i think the president needs to visit china i think the president needs to visit japan now the president found time to visit oxford university mr president the most serious international problem that we have right now is korea the two most important allies that we have in korea are japan and china and i support you 100 percent in working with those two partners but maybe you ought to go sit down with them maybe you ought to tell them the importance of their cooperation in nonproliferation of nuclear weapons in east asia maybe we ought to make it clear to japan that it cannot continue to allow its citizens to send 1 billion or 2 billion a year to korea if in turn they expect our young american soldiers to go over and be willing to give their lives in defense of japan i think that our president has got a lot of groundwork to cover i think he is capable of doing it there has been a lot of criticism about the presidents military background there has been a lot of criticism and i happen to think a lot of this criticism is justified on our presidents weakness in foreign policy but our president does have the capability to communicate and if ever there was a time for communication if ever there was a time for us to get behind our president and hope that he could communicate in the clearest of terms it is now on the korean peninsula to the people of this country and to my colleagues in here this is a very very critical situation it is a situation that we cannot allow to continue without clear policy and a clear message and a showing of strength we do not want a war on the korean peninsula any more than you want to run into a wounded grizzly bear on a trail up in the mountains you do not want that to happen finally and let me conclude with this one of the things that i think is very important for us is to approach north korea and say whats up we know you know what is going to happen if you continue to push these nuclear weapons you have got a lot better future for your country and a lot better future for the people of your country if you join the market look at what has happened in russia look how much chinahas improved look at your own blood brothers down in south korea look what its done to their economy when they come into a capitalized type of system you dont have to ct~ange from communism to capitalism open up your doors open up your doors to the rest of the world stop your isolation it is a winwin deal for you north korea if you stop the isolation come into the world start trading with the world youre going to have north korea countries throughout the entire world giving you foreign aid youre going to have countries throughout the entire world wanting to invest in your country to put money into your country what is wrong with a country like north korea when they have such isolation not long ago i had an opportunity to give some graduation speeches and i talked about the difference between an 18yearold in north korea who would probably never taste ice cream in his lifetime has probably never seen a tv certainly has never flown on an airplane unless it is a military aircraft has never owned a car probably has never driven a car has never had an opportunity to go to department stores and pick out clothes has never had an opportunity to go down and buy a soda pop or enjoy some of the finer points of life compare that with the south korean 18yearold who has had those opportunities ice cream is abundant tvs modern life it is there north korea can provide that for its citizens and keep the hierarchy that it has they can preserve that leadership all that leadership has to do is open up to the rest of the world i hope that that is what north korea does every american should hope that that is what north korea does it would stop the proliferation at least starting on the korean peninsula it would show that there is an effective way to deal with nuclear proliferation and military confrontation without missiles i hope that is what happens but we as a country must prepare that that may not be what happens we as a country must be prepared not only for the best of times but for the worst of times right now the pendulum seems to be tipping toward the worst of times on the korean peninsula do not go to bed tonight thinking that there is going to be an attack tomorrow but do go to bed tonight thinking about the consequences if there is an attack tomorrow and the importance of our president of the leadership of this country to step forward and make sure that a military confrontation on the korean peninsula does not take place"], [5.100838097860105e-05, 5.100838097860105e-05, 0, "let me just say that i really appreciate the gentleman from california coming to the floor of the house to discuss this issue i think it has been going on for too long without rebuttal that the clinton administration has mischaracterized the health care system in this country the finest health care provided to anyone in this world is coming under attack by the clinton administration and like their tax policy and their economic policy they do not understand the problem they just absolutely do not get it as the gentleman from arkansas so aptly laid out in his talk about the false numbers and the way they are manipulated about access to care and the number of people that do not have access to care the clinton administration does not use true measures of what good quality health care is or how americas system compares with those of other industrialized democracies they also lay out false measures of quality health care as the gentleman has been quoting from fred barnes article entitled what health care crisis in the may issue of american spectator it is so well laid out the true story about american health care and the quality of that health care in one section of his article he talks about judging the two most common measures of health by the clinton administration life expectancy at birth and the infant mortality rate health care in the united states according to the clinton administration is not the best or even among the best the rticle shows how they manipulate the numbers to prove their case in 1990 life expectancy in america was 72 years for males and 78 8 for women this put the united states behind canada and france and many other countries and on infant mortality the united states fared even worse ranking 19th in 1989 with a rate of 9 7 what they failed to do was to tell us that this is a reflection of health not the health care system that life expectancy is determined by much more than the quality of a nations health care it is determined by social factors that affect life expectancy and it is exacerbated by the way that americans live today whether it be homicides injuries by careless living and aids is another factor that is brought into this even at the age of 80 when most people are highly dependent on the health care system americans have the longest life expectancy as far as infant mortality rate is concerned it is reflective of the health and socioeconomic status and not just health care many countries make no effort to save very lowbirthweight infants they are not recorded as live born and are not even counted there are social factors such as when young people are having babies at a much earlier age that creates a lowweight baby that has a much less propensity for living after it is born there are many other issues pointed out by fred barnes in his article but the point he tries to make is that it is not our health care system that is creating these problems it is the behavioral patterns of americans behavioral problems become health problems aids drug abuse assaults and violence sexually transmitted diseases and many other things the problem is not the health care system the problem is the people every year the pool of pathology in this country is getting bigger and bigger and we think that we can take care of everything by calling it a health problem it is behavioral problems that ought to be addressed destroying our health care system by bringing more government involvement into it is not going to solve the problem i hope the gentleman will hold more special orders so that we can get into the details and the numbers and put into the rec that the clinton administration just does not understand the problem if you do not understand the problem the solution will be disastrous"], [5.210463496041484e-05, 5.210463496041484e-05, 0, "i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time as many of you know i have not been a big fan of the nea however i think in fairness we should recognize the fact that much good is accomplished and in many communities across this country the nea funds become the seed money that results in a lot of private contributions many people look to the nea as a leader in determining what should happen i think the event at the walker art center funded by the walker art center in minneapolis was outrageous absolutely outrageous however if we abolished every agency of government that has done something outrageous there would not be many left and we forget that even though something like this was funded indirectly by the nea because of course the moneywent to walker art center and they in turn made the decision as to what they would fund we forget all the good things that have been accomplished by the nea encouraging local support i might say the tax policies of this country also encourage local support because the contributions to the cultural activities are deductible on a long form on the income tax so it is part of our national policy to encourage cultural things and nea is a key element i would like to share with you some testimony we heard in the committee i a high school teacher in a small comf munity of 35 000 in alabama said f i am constantly looking for ways to eni hance my students classroom experience and to make the words in a textbook come alive and real for my students i am here to thank you for your support of the nea which in turn has helpedto bring professional theater to alabama because nothing in my experience as a teacher brings the d words of shakespeare to life like a performance at the alabama shakespeare festival and without the alabama shakespeare fes tival there would be no opportunity for thousands of students in the south to discover the wonders of professional theater and he went on to point out how important it was and then one of the students testifled and i quote from him as mr thompson said my name is clint gullatte i am from a singleparent home and have lived in public housing for most of my life i am the oldest of four children i will be attending college where i will major in biology and hope to attend auburn uni7 versity school of veterinary medicine my first experience at the alabama shakespeare festival was a production of peter pan i had no idea theater could be so exciting next i saw a raisin in the sun which is still one of my favorites i could identify with walter lee younger he was the oldest son in a singleparent family with responsibilities and dreams of a better future i have faced some of the same oppression fear and expectation and the student went on to say how vitally important this experience that he had as a result of an nea grant to the alabama shakespeare festival had touched his life we had any number of witnesses similar to this that appeared before our committee i think it is important as we make a judgment on whether or not to continue the nea to recognize that while once in a while something outrageous happens such as was the case in minnesota that in contrast far greater numbers of very worthwhile things result from the nea funding and certainly generate in communities across this nation a large amount of support that is based on the neas seed money and things that are very beneficial to our society so i think we need to weigh that we consider the

identical legislation introduced by senator joseph lieberman of connecticut on march 26 1993 i appreciate this opportunity to provide my colleagues with some background on this disease and why the designation of this week is so important lyme disease is a bacterial infection that is spread by the deer tick which is slightly smaller than the dog tick although lyme disease was first officially reported lust 18 years ago in lyme connecticut it has fast become the most common tickbome disease and one of the fastest spreading infectious diseases in the united states once considered to be a regional problem found in the northeast 49 of the 50 states have now reported cases of lyme disease the deer tick lives in grasses along the shore in fields and at the edge of woodlands many people on eastern long island have expressed concern about going to the beach taking a walk in the woods or sitting in their own backyard for fear of getting this debilitating disease many people never even know that they have been bitten by a tick the parasite can attach itself feed detach itself and lay its eggs all without the hosts knowledge in addition due to its ability to mimic the symptoms of other ailments a person may be left clueless as to the cause of his or her ailment lyme disease is often mistaken for other illnesses such as ringworm influenza arthritis or heart disease however if left untreated lyme disease can cause partial facial paralysis meningitis encephalitis and abnormal slowing of the heartbeat severe headaches and depression destructive arthritis memory loss and chronic fatigue as early treatment of lyme disease is the key to warding off its worst effects and as there is currently no vaccine for lyme disease the best defense against it is prevention that is why education is vital if we are to minimize the effects of this painful disease the american public must know what to look for if they are to take precaution against this disease symptoms of lyme disease in its eariy stages include a characteristic rash at the site of the tick bite headaches fever pains in joints and swollen glands however a person might not develop the telltale rash at the site of the tickbite leaving the person puzzled as to the cause of such a rash moreover standard blood tests often do not reveal the presence of lyme disease the key words in combating lyme disease are protect and check protect meaning to protect yourself by wearing protective clothing and repellents and check meaning check yourself your children and your pets as soon as you get home checking is important because most experts believe the tick must be attached for more than 24 hours to transmit the disease in addition i am pleased to announce that a permethrlnbased repellent which has been approved by the environmental protection agency epa is now available to the public this spray must be used only on clothing not on the skin the spray used in combination with a longacting deetbased lotion on the skin can provide very effective protection against the tick and lyme disease mr speaker the prevention of lyme disease depends upon public awareness i want to thank my colleagues for their support in bringing this disease to the attention of the american public it is my hope that the designation of the weeks of june 6 1993 and june 5 1994 as lyre disease awareness week will help

me the senate bill would lift the requirement in current law that the va under secretary for health be a physician the committee concurs in principle with the apparent aim of that proposal to provide the latitude for appointment of the most qualified person available to the important position of va under secretary for health but the committee believes that that latitude must be balanced against the need to ensure that the highest levels of vha management retain physician leadership the senate bill was apparently based on a legislative proposal advanced by the department of veterans affairs on september 16 1993 the department submitted that proposal to the house and senate after a reportedly unsuccessful search of many months duration for a new under secretary and requested the introduction and enactment of legislation to lift the physician requirement for that position the department framed this request in terms of a quest for greater latitude to find the most qualified person for this important position va has been well served by physicians occupying the most senior positions in the veterans health administration and the department of medicineand surgery this committee does not lightly turn away from the vital and unique contributions physicianleaders can and do provide the veterans health administration whether in the role of advising a secretary of veterans affairs on the departments research budget negotiating with physician peers in other federal departments or appearing before committees of the congress a physician brings a unique expertise insight and stature yet there is force to the view that vha needs the most able leadership dramatic changes are underway within the national health care system which even without enactment of a national health care reform bill will require reforming the va health care system the inevitability of such change and the prospect that that change may be sweeping and complex underscores the importance of assuring the most able vha leadership while physicians have long provided that leadership it could conceivably also come from another clinical perspective or another sector with respect to the under secretary post the departments request that congress lift the physician requirement however raised questions its request provided no insight into the kind of analysis that led the department to the specific legislative solution it proposed moreover the request provided no insight into the nature of the process by which the search itself had been conducted or the basis on which a search committee would proceed under the proposed legislation the department offered no hint for example as to how it envisioned the search committee would weigh physicians against nonphysicians in identifying the most qualified candidate it became clear to the committee that the departments administration of the search process was flawed the committee on veterans affairs would have anticipated that that process would be thorough methodical and constituted so as to avoid any reasonable criticism the evidence suggested otherwise the committee found particularly disturbing for example the departments failure to furnish the members of the search commission any criteria by which to evaluate candidates other than the requirements of the law itself the significance of that failure was all the more striking in light of the committees understanding that of some 54 candidates judged to be qualified only 8 were interviewed the composition of the search commission is set by law and includes substantial representation from activities affected by the veterans health administration va gains immeasurably from the experience and insight of eminent professionals who participate in such a process but it is unreasonable for the department to abdicate taking a role which extends much beyond establishing the search commission and hosting its meetings in fairness to the commission members themselves the department owes them substantial guidance on the criteria they should employ in conducting their evaluations and their determinations on whom to interview absent specific sound criteria the process is open to the criticism that it is not free from the potential for arbitrary and capricious decisionmaking neither the secretary nor the commission members could tolerate a process open to such a perception in the belief that the department would share that view the subcommittee on hospitals and health care sought assurances from the secretary that the department would address these and related concerns regarding the search process regrettably the secretary has declined to do so or to provide assurances to that effect the above concerns led the committee on november 9 1993 to address these issues legislatively in a committee amendment to h r 3400 the government reform and savings act of 1993 which it ordered reported as amended in so acting the committee sought through amendments to title 38 to address its concerns regarding the conduct of the search process while at the same time providing greater latitude in filing the position of under secretary for health my proposed amendment to s 1534 would incorporate the pertinent provisions of the committee amendment to h r 3400 the amendment would provide in essence that if at the time a search commission were established the positions of deputy and associated deputy under secretary were held by physicians the under secretary could be a nonphysician in either case however the amendment would require the secretary to develop and furnish to the search commission specific criteria which the commission shall use in evaluating candidates the amendment would further require that in the case where the physician requirement was not applicable in filing the under secretary position the commission shall accord a priority to the selection of a physician over a nonphysician this physician priority requitement does not mean that nonphysicians may only be considered if the commission cannot identify a physician who meets the specific criteria developed by the secretary it does contemplate however that the criteria reflect and give weight to clinical experience and particularly to that of a physician the committee would expect that the criterik would also be weighed in a manner that would ensure that those individuals recommended for appointment would have a background which would provide a level of sensitivity to patients needs comparable to that gained from clinical practice the physician priority should also be read in the context of the requirement in law that the commission recommend at least three individuals for appointment it is inconceivable that a meaningful priority could have been afforded physicians if such a list of recommended candidates included only a single physician or failed to include any the committee does not presume to dictate to the secretary the list of criteria that official should establish such criteria should however take account of vas potential role as a competitor under health reform they should also recognize vas broad and relatively unique role as a provider of longterm care and psychiatric care and should give additional weight to candidates with such experience as regards the two positions immediately subordinate to the under seoretary the measure would also amend section 7306 of title 38 to permit the appointment of a nonphysician to either the deputy or associate deputy under secretary positions when two of the top three positions in the veterans health administration are held by physicians my proposed amendment to s 1534 reflects discussions between the house and senate and i urge my colleagues to support the

brought into all of our living rooms over the television set i fear has brought us to the brink of intervention in a bloody 1 000yearold civil war in what was the former yugoslavia as we consider this as a congress and as a nation i think it is important that we consider it very soberly and consider the implications blueprint to lead us into this postcoldwar era a blueprint that has been used repeatedly over and over by our great military leaders since that time let me quote from that speech i believe the postwar period has taught us several lessons and from them i have developed six major tests to be applied when we are weighing the use of unitedstates combat forces abroad let me now share them with you first the united states should not commit forces to combat overseas unless the particular engagement or occasion is deemed vital to our national interest or that of our allies that emphatically does not mean that we should declare beforehand as we did with korea in 1950 that a particular area is outside our strategic perimeter second if we decide it is necessary to put combat troops into a given situation we should do so wholeheartediy and with the clear intention of winning if we are unwilling to commit the forces or resources necessary to achieve our objectives we should not commit them at all of course if the particular situation requires only limited force to win our objectives then we should not hesitate to commit forces sized accordingly when hitler broke treaties and remilitarized the rhineland small combat forces then could perhaps have prevented the holocaust of world war ii third if we do decide to commit forces to combat overseas we should have clearly defined political and military objectives and we should know precisely how our forces can accomplish those clearly defined objectives and we should have andsend the forces needed to do just that as clausewitz wrote no one starts a war or rather no one in his senses ought to do sowithout first being clear in his mind what he intends to achieve by that war and how he intends to conduct it war may be different today than in clausewltzs time but the need for welldefined objectives and a consistent strategy is still essential if we determine that a combat mission has become necessary for our vital national interests then we must send forces capable to do the joband not assign a combat mission to a force configured for peacekeeping fourth the relationship between our objectives and the forces we have committedtheir size composition and dispositionmust be continually reassessed and adjusted if necessary conditions and objectives invariably change during the course of a conflict when they do change then so must our combat requirements we must continuously keep as a beacon light before us the basic questions is this conflict in our national interest does our national interest require us to fight to use force of arms if the answers are yes then we must win if the answers are no then we should not be in combat fifth before the unitedstates commits combat forces abroad there must be some reasonable assurance we will have the support of the american people and their elected representatives in congress this support cannot be achieved unless we are candid in making clear the threats we face the support cannot be sustained without continuing and close consultation we cannot fight a battle with the congress at home while asking our troops to win a war overseas or as in the case of vietnam in effect asking our troops not to win but just to be there finally the commitment of unitedstates forces to combat should be a last resort as we as a nation consider this weighty decision i think that we must reflect back on these questions asked by secretary weinberger and also ask ourselves is this a fight we are willing to go to the finish i do not think so i hope that the carnage of the last weekend the tremendous emotional appeal and the desire of every honorable person
