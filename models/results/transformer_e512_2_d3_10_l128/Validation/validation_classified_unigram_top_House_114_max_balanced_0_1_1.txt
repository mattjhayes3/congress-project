democrats who came to the floor and who sat on the floor in the well of the house that was extraordinary no one has ever seen this happen before why did this take place how is it you can get every group in the democratic party to basically join in an action that had never taken place before what am i talking about i am talking about the womens caucus the black caucus the progressive caucus i am talking about new democrats i am talking about all of those in our democratic party who do not always agree with each other we work at it but we have serious and credible disagreements however you did not hear any denouncement from any of our democrats about what we were doing why did we do this and why did we have basically so much support for what we did when i say support i am not simply talking about democrats i am talking about people who left their homes their businesses and their workplaces and joined us outside they even stayed for hours in the rain to say to us thank you for finally giving voice to this problem that we have in this country on gun violence the members of the democratic party and those people who were outside basically said we are sick and tired of the influence that is exerted by the gun lobby you have the nra that owns too many members of congress and who can tell them what to do there are members who are intimidated by the gun lobby and the nra so what they do is they hide behind the constitution and they will tell you that they are defending their constitutional rights none of us in what we sat in about talked about taking away anybodys guns what we said was we have got to make sure that guns are not in the hands of people who should not have them people who have committed crimes people who have committed murder people who have shown that perhaps something is wrong with them psychologically or emotionally we should not make it easy for these people to have guns what should we do about it we have two very simple bills and we begged the speaker of this house to allow us to take up those bills to debate those bills to have them voted up or down well the speaker wont do it the speaker wont do it because as it has been described he too is a handmaiden of the gun lobby along with all of the other members afraid to come and represent and to deal with the tough issues that confront us what were those bills all about one is very easy to explain no fly no buy what does that mean it simply means that if you are on a list that says you cant get on an airplane because you are dangerous we know something about you that will not allow us to allow you to get on an airplane where you may commit an action that could endanger the lives of everybody on that plane and others even on the ground no fly no buy why should we sell guns to somebody who we have said are too dangerous to fly on the airplane that is all we wanted on that bill was a vote to say yeah that makes good sense if you cannot fly you should not be able to buy what is wrong with that that is very simple why cant they take up that bill arent they concerned about who gets on the airplane yes but if you are concerned about who gets on the airplane you should be concerned about who is able to buy a gun the other bill is just as clear just as simple universal background checks we need to know who is buying these guns somebody will say dont we have something about background checks in the law ladies and gentlemen we are not covering what is on the internet we are not covering the fact that these gun shows are selling guns out of the back of their cars

something i oppose i oppose it for a number of policy reasons but i thought i would spend my time today talking about what i view is a more fundamental analytical flaw in the budget and that relates to the overall goal of the budget because if you have the wrong goal you often make a series of bad decisions to support that goal so i think it is important that we talk about what the goal of the budget is and what the goal of the budget should be the goal of the republican budget is to have zero deficits within 10 years in my opinion that is the goal because it sounds good we have all heard the line that we should not spend more money than we take in that sounds really good but it ignores to many extents the basic math of budgets it is also an unrealistic goal and it is also an unnecessary goal and as a result of pursuing an unrealistic and unnecessary goal a series of very bad decisions are embedded in the budget which is why i want to talk about the goal it is an unrealistic goal when you look at the condition of the federal budget at this moment in time after several decades of this congress and several administrations ignoring in many ways the fiscal responsibility of this great country and allowing our debt to become such a high percentage of our economy we put ourselves in a position where we have had very significant deficits and the debt levels are such that we have very limited financial flexibility as a country and if interest rates were to go up it would increasingly consume a very large percentage of our budget that is the problem and that is the situation we find ourselves in in addition mr chair we are entering a phase where the demographic trends in the country and the aging on a relative basis of the population are putting tremendous pressure on the resources of the federal government so this is a very very challenging time to take a budget that has had very significant deficits and try to bring them to zero within 10 years that is why it is unrealistic it is also unnecessary because the most important metric in the financial health of the united states of america is our debt as a percentage of our economy if we want to lower our debt as a percentage of our economy what we have to do is have a budget where our deficits expressed as a percentage of our economy are consistently lower than economic growth so we should be targeting deficits of 1 to 2 percent with a view that the minimum baseline economic growth of this country will be 2 to 3 percent and definitionally over time that will take the debt of the country as a percentage of the country down it will give us more financial flexibility in the future and position us so that when interest rates rise which they will it will consume a much smaller percentage of our budget that should be the goal but because we have this unrealistic and unnecessary goal of getting deficits to zero within 10 years my republican colleagues are forced to overcorrect in the budget to achieve that goal there are two fundamental ways to overcorrect in a budget you either raise taxes very high to get revenues to get it to zero or you cut investments very significantly now my republican colleagues dont choose to raise taxes in fact what they choose to do is to cut taxes which makes an already unrealistic goal more unrealistic so the only thing that is left the only thing that is left to bring this budget to zero within 10 years is massive massive reductions in the investments we are making in our future and in our nation which to me is a very odd decision in light of the facts that are in front of us and the facts that are in front of us are very clear we are in a global and very competitive economy and we havent made the investments particularly in things like infrastructure to position this country to compete as successfully as it should in a world that is increasingly interconnected also we have to make investments in our children mr chair we are in a knowledgebased economy and to make sure that our kids are capable of being employed and having a rising standard of living across their lives we have to invest in their future so to achieve this unrealistic goal my republican colleagues make very significant very very significant cuts to these critical investments which you could argue it has never been more important to do that in fact they bring many of these levels down to half of what they have been historicallyagain and importantly expressed as a percentage of our economy because it is irrelevant to talk about absolute numbers the only numbers that should be talked about is the budget in terms of a percentage of our economy that is why i view this budget as so troubling and misguided mr chair i spent my whole career prior to coming to congress running publicly traded companies that i started i used to observe other managers who are running publicly traded companies from time to time make really bad decisions about what to do with their business those bad decisions were often based on a fundamental premise that they would pander to the market and put forth unrealistic expectations they would make bad decisions to achieve those expectations and the story would end badly the acting chair the time of the gentleman has expired"], [0.002146899700164795, 0.9978531002998352, 1, "i thank

problem in the united states of america for far too long we have minimized the problem some have even ignored the problem in short our response has been inadequate and we have failed to view hunger as a health issue which it is for our nations youngest and most vulnerable our children the negative effects of childhood hunger are pervasive and longlasting so last week i was pleased to see the american academy of pediatrics release its newest policy statement which for the first time recommends that pediatricians screen all children for food insecurity the new recommendations consist of two simple questions for pediatricians to ask parents of young children at their annual well visit to identify and address childhood hunger it also recommends that pediatricians become more familiar with our robust system of antihunger programs at the federal state and local levels when pediatricians know more about these antihunger programs and the resources they provide they will be better prepared to help families in need pediatricians are among the most respected if not the most respected voices on childrens issues and i hope that with the aaps policy statement more people will start paying attention to the devastating effects of childhood hunger on americas future it is shameful that childhood hunger even exists in this country the richest country in the world that one in five children lives in a food insecure household that 17 2 million households in this country struggle with food insecurity that the only reliable healthy meals some kids receive are the ones they get through school breakfasts or lunches their mothers and fathers are forced to skip meals so that their kids can have more to eat because the family simply cannot afford to put enough food on the table the harmful effects of hunger on children are well documented for example children who live in households that are food insecure get sick more often recover more slowly from illness have poorer overall health and are hospitalized more frequently children and adolescents affected by food insecurity are more likely to be iron deficient and preadolescent boys dealing with hunger issues have lower bone density early childhood malnutrition is also tied to conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease later in life lack of adequate healthy food can impair a childs ability to concentrate and perform well in school and is linked to higher levels of behavioral and emotional problems from preschool through adolescence i have personally heard from pediatricians who see kids in the emergency room come in for a common cold that has become much worse because they dont have enough to eat and their immune systems have been compromised stories like these are heartbreaking we know that consistent access to adequate nutritious food is one of the best medicines for growing thriving children childrens health watch a national network of pediatricians and child health professionals found that in comparison to children whose families were eligible but did not receive snap young children whose families received snap were significantly less likely to be at risk of being underweight or experiencing developmental delays if members of congress are not swayed by the moral arguments for ending childhood hunger they ought to be swayed by the economic ones ensuring that our kids have access to enough nutritious food saves money in the form of reduced healthcare costs and helps them become more productive contributors to our economy later in life without our robust federal antihunger programs there would no doubt be more hungry children in this country the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children or wic provides nutritious food and support for children and mothers the supplemental nutrition assistance program or snap is our nations premiere antihunger program and helps millions of lowincome families afford to purchase food every month about half of all snap recipients are children and our school breakfast and lunch programs summer meals and child and adult food care programs all provide nutritious meals to children in community childfriendly settings we cant forget about the incredible work our food banks food pantries and other charities do to provide healthy food for lowincome children and their families despite the incredible work that they do charities cannot do it alone the demand is simply too great charities need a strong federal partner to end hunger in this country for a while now i have been urging the

of gun violence that is harming our communities since the start of the yearjust 11 days agonine of my constituents have already become victims of gun violence including an elementary school teacher and an innocent mother pushing her child in a stroller just this weekend alone my community suffered three gun homicides my thoughts are with the victims family at this very terribly difficult time we have to do something enough is enough congress can and must do more to stop this senseless violence whether it is charleston oak creek sandy hook the streets of oakland or wherever too many people have already lost their lives too many families have buried loved ones and too many lives have been changed forever because of catastrophic injuries as a result of gun violence now is the time for

killed during a robbery just days before christmas this has been a very difficult period for council member mcelehany and her family so in addition to our prayers not only for my council members family but for all of those in our country who have been victims of gun violence we must do something we must do something in all of their memory let me be clear congress can no longer ignore the massive toll that this epidemic is having on our constituents their families and communities last week we joined with our colleagues and millions of americans in applauding president obamas actions to reduce gun violence in our nation thanks to the presidents leadership there will be more background checks better enforcement of existing gun laws improved mental health services and new research on how to end this epidemic of gun violence but more action is needed to stop the more than 30 000 gun deaths that occur in our nation each and every year congress must pass commonsense gun reform like closing the gun show loophole bipartisan measures that are supported by the vast majority of americans and gun owners congress must also fund the expansion of mental health services but this should not be an excuse of course to do nothing on gun safety we have got to provide the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives the resources it needs to enforce our nations gun laws as a member of the appropriations committee i have fought along with my colleagues to get these vital public safety resources in the appropriations bills which keep our communities safe we must also end the extreme data restrictions that restrict law enforcements ability to protect public safety and prevent policymakers from addressing gun violence as a public health issue that is why i introduced last year h r 1449 the tiahrt restrictions repeal act which would repeal the data restrictions on gun sales and background checks these data restrictions are commonly called the tiahrt restrictions they prevent data on gun background checks from being released to the public these provisions currently impede public safety by requiring the national criminal background check system records to be destroyedmind you destroyedwithin 24 hours prohibiting the atf from requiring licensed dealers to conduct annual inventory checks to detect lost or stolen firearms and restricting local and state law enforcement from using trace data to fully investigate corrupt dealers and traffickers this is outrageous we have got to restrict and repeal these tiahrt amendments right away it will help tackle the bad apple gun dealers who provide dangerous weapons to criminals it is estimated that just 5 percent of sellers supply the weapons used in nearly 90 percent of gun crimes the tiahrt restrictions block access to vital data that lawmakers law enforcement and federal agencies need to tackle gun violence in our community of course many of us are proud to support congresswoman kellys bill which would allow the surgeon general to study gun violence as a public health issue and the consumer product safety commission to regulate firearms the time for action is now lets start listening to the american people and insist that congress do something it is really disingenuous to criticize the president for issuing commonsense gun safety measures when we have been trying for years in this bodyfor yearsto get these sensible bills passed the speaker should allow these and many other bills to come to the floor so that congress can act no more excuses we should support congressman thompsons proposal to establish the select committee on gun violence the speaker should do this now so we cant continue to really allow the misinformation to get out about congress we need to do our job we have been trying many of us the congressional black caucus and others especially democrats for many years to try to get the speaker to bring these bills to the floor so what did the president do he had to do something

capped at growth levels that are lower than the projected increases in health care costs previous analyses showed that this type of plan would cut future spending by 5 900 per senior forcing them to spend more out of pocket and diminishing their access to quality care 3 additionally private insurance plans will aggressively pursue the healthiest least expensive enrollees thereby allowing

simply false you can go to any store today and see shelves of modern energyefficient incandescent light bulbs that meet the standard i have bought them myself they are the same as the old bulbs except

efficiency standards spurred innovation that dramatically expanded options for consumers critics of the efficiency standards claimed that they would cost consumers money in fact the opposite is true when the standards are in full effect the average american family will save about 100 every year that comes to 13 billion in savings nationwide every year but this rider threatens those savings and that is why consumer groups have consistently opposed this rider here is the reality the 2007 consensus energy efficiency standards for light bulbs were enacted with bipartisan support and continue to receive overwhelming industry support unitedstates manufacturers are already meeting the efficiency standards the effect of the rider is to allow foreign manufacturers to sell old inefficient light bulbs in the united states that violate the efficiency standards that is unfair to domestic manufacturers who have invested millions of dollars in the united states in those plants to make efficient bulbs here that meet the standards why on earth would we want to pass a rider that favors foreign manufacturers who ignore our laws and penalizes unitedstates manufacturers who are following our laws but it even gets worse the rider now poses an additional threat to unitedstates manufacturing the bipartisan 2007 energy bill requires the department of energy to establish updated light bulb efficiency standards by january 1 of next year it also provided that if final updated standards are not issued by then a more stringent standard of 45 lumens per watt automatically takes effect incandescent light bulbs currently cannot meet this backstop standard this rider blocks doe from issuing the required efficiency standards and ensures that the backstop will kick in ironically it is this rider that could effectively ban the incandescent light bulb the burgess rider directly threatens existing light bulb manufacturing jobs in pennsylvania ohio illinois across our region it would stifle innovation and punish companies that have invested in domestic manufacturing this rider aims to reverse years of technological progress only to kill jobs increase electricity bills for our

chair i thank the gentleman for his amendment in the nature of a substitute but at this time i have to oppose it i appreciate that mr takano does believe that we need to provide real accountability at the department of veterans affairs but as i said at our committee markup when he offered an almost identical amendment this substitute fails to achieve true accountability i am supportive of section 3 of his amendment which would limit administrative leave for all employees to 14 days and i agree with this commonsense policy but i would note that this limitation language is already included in my bill h r 1994 my main concern with the substitute lies within section 2 which would dramatically change the standard and the process set up in my bill of removing va employees the substitute would only give the secretary the authority to remove an employee if they represent a clear and direct threat to public health or safety which is almost an unobtainable if not immeasurable bar to reach this undefined standard would make it almost impossible for the secretary to remove any employee under this new authority thereby ensuring that the current stalemate that exists with the civil service rules would continue unfortunately as i said moments ago maintaining the status quo is not acceptable i would submit that the standard of a clear and direct threat to public health and safety would not apply to those employees involved with many of todays ongoing scandals at the va including the cost overruns of the denver hospital the budget shortfall that we are going to vote to fix later today a 3 billion budget fix the manipulation of data at the philadelphia regional office the allegations of inappropriate use of government purchase cards to the tune of 6 billion the allegations of employees at the los angeles regional office once again inappropriately shredding veterans claim information and the many other egregious actions that continue to come to light at va almost every single day members these are the very type of employees that our constituents and our veterans expect to be held accountable but the standard proposed in this substitute would not give the secretary the authority to provide the accountability we all know that va desperately needs i also have some concerns with the procedures that are laid out in the substitute to actually remove these employees i believe that unlike the procedures that i have laid out in my bill which set definitive timelines to remove someone while maintaining the due process and maintaining appeal rights the procedures laid out in this substitute could allow an employee to be on indefinite suspension for months if not years awaiting a hearing for the secretarys final decision it has been mentioned several times by my colleagues on the other side that passage of h r 1994 would return to a spoils or an atwill employment system nothing could be further from the truth let me compare a spoils or an atwill system to the protections offered in first a spoils system would allow the party in power to hire anyone usually partisan supporters that they want to reward for their political support with a federal job in contrast h r 1994 has no effect on the current hiring process second a spoils or a patronage system makes all employees at will and subject to firing for any or even no reason again that is hardly the case in my bill h r 1994 requires proof in the form of poor performance or misconduct additionally my bill requires the secretary to report the reasons for any such removals to congress within 30 days third in a spoils system a fired employee has no right of appeal in contrast under h r 1994 fired employees still have due process rights including 45 days to appeal their firing to the merit systems protection board fourth in a spoils system there is no such thing as paid administrative leave you are fired gone with no pay under civil service rules a poorperforming employee can be placed on administrative leave for essentially an unlimited time as we have seen with several miscreants identified during our investigations h r 1994 on the other hand would limit the secretarys authority to put someone on paid administrative leave to 14 days at which time the secretary must bring that person back to active duty fifth in a spoils system there are no protections for whistleblowers in an atwill system employees may or may not be covered by whistleblower protection employee discrimination et cetera type laws depending on the type of employer however under h r 1994 employees are protected by both of these types of laws plus the procedures and additional protections created under section 4 of my bill employees cannot be removed without osc approval if an open case exists and employees cannot be removed or demoted if they have an open case under the new process that is laid out in section 4 until the office of accountability review makes a final determination so ultimately not only does this amendment set a standard for removal that is not relevant to a majority of the issues that we see at the department it keeps intact the long and arduous timeline before a final approval is complete this is not fair to veterans to the department or to the employee in question to reemphasize i also have issues with the whistleblower protections that are laid out in this substitute or the lack of protections in this substitute the only mention of whistleblower protections made in this amendment says that a whistleblower may receive backpay if the merit systems protection board ultimately decides they were removed for blowing the whistle not only does this not provide any protections on the front end but it would also strip out all of the whistleblower protections i have included in section 4 of my bill we all know that the secretary has a tall task to restore trust and to rebuild the va we have to give him every tool possible to complete that mission this amendment does not come close to giving him the tool that he needs today so once again i urge members to support change and stand with veterans not the bureaucrats and the special

families and in their businesses that is why i am so proud to have introduced this bill h r 3791 is a very simple bill to help small banks and savings and loan companies get access to the capital they need so as to make credit available in their communities these small banking institutions are critical to the people and the communities in which they reside they support the credit needs of families of small businesses of farmers and of entrepreneurs a community bank is often the principal lending source for many people whether they are purchasing a home starting a new business or purchasing a vehicle in many counties around the nation a community bank is the only banking presence that residents have when these community banking institutions are overwhelmed with regulations and mandates many of which are meant for larger institutions it is the hardworking middleincome and lowincome families in those communities who suffer the most it is about people community banks give people the credit they need to pursue their dreamsto buy a home to start a business in fact proximity to a community bank increases the chances that new small businesses will be approved for loans and will have the chance to succeed by raising the consolidated asset threshold under the federal reserves small bank holding company policy statement from 1 billion to 5 billion in assets over 400 additional small bank and thrift holding companies will qualify for coverage under the policy statement and therefore will be exempt from certain regulatory and capital guidelines these capital standards were originally established for larger institutions and disproportionately harm small holding companies many holding companies that are above the current threshold face challenges with regard to capital formation just when regulators are demanding higher capital levels these exemptions provided in the policy statement make it easier for small holding companies to raise capital and issue debt this bill is about making sure regulations fit the size of the institution a similar effort was passed into law during the last congress under suspension in the house and by unanimous consent in the senate that bill raised the threshold from 500 million where it has been since 1996 to 1 billion that legislation also extended the exemption to savings and loan holding companies while we are glad that we were able to achieve that increase which helped roughly 500 small bank and thrift holding companies we would like to extend those benefits further h r 3791 would bring more than 400 additional small institutions within the scope of the policy statement one success story that we have already seen from the previous increase was an instance in which 35 bank holding companies pooled their resources to issue debt under the policy statement that debt was then downstreamed to the respective banks where the capital was then used to make loans in the communities they serve illustrating the great multiplier effect that the policy statement can produce h r 3791 seeks to extend that flexibility and success to a greater number of small institutions and the communities they serve opponents of this increase have alleged that changing the regulatory threshold would put communities and the deposit insurance fund at higher risk but the policy statement contains several safeguards that are designed to ensure that small bank holding companies that operate with the higher levels of debt permitted by the policy statement do not present an undue risk to the safety and soundness of their subsidiary banks to sum this up this bill is not about supporting banks it is about supporting families communities and small businesses it is about making sure that a smallbusiness owner like my constituent

their kitchen tables and are imagining the possibilities of renovating or of improving their homes it is about that entrepreneur who is starting a restaurant and being her own boss it is about the

about the dangers of being controlled by a very powerful militaryindustrial complex i think he would be shocked at how far we have gone down the road that he warned us against in his book ikes bluff evan thomas wrote eisenhower would periodically sigh to andy goodpaster his chief of staff god help the nation when it has a president who doesnt know as much about the military as i do pat buchanan wrote on march 20 in november 1956 president eisenhower enraged he had not been forewarned of their invasion of egypt ordered the british french and israelis to get out of suez and sinai they did as told how far we have fallen from the america of ike senator robert taft who was sometimes referred to as mr republican in the 1940s and 1950s once said no foreign policy can be justified except a policy devoted to the protection of the liberty of the american people with war only as the last resort and only to preserve that liberty most of the republican presidential candidates have attacked president obama for acting in some ways that are unconstitutional and he has but where in our constitution does it give us the authority to run other countries as we have been doing in iraq and afghanistaneven making small business loans and training local police forces my republican party was always the party of fiscal conservatism yet with a national debt of over 18 trillion how can we justify continually spending megabillions in religious civil wars between the shia and sunni some people and companies that make money off of an interventionist foreign policy always very quickly fall back on the slur of isolationism but most conservatives believe in trade and tourism and cultural and educational exchanges with other countries and in helping out during humanitarian crises we just dont believe in endless war we are told if we dont support an interventionist foreign policy that this means we dont believe in american exceptionalism but this nation did not become exceptional because we got involved in every little war around the globe it became exceptional because of our great free enterprise system and because we gave our people more individual freedom than any other country i have said in thousands of speeches that we are blessed beyond belief to live in this country and that the united states is without question the greatest country in the history of the world but there was much less antiamericanism around the world when we tried to mind our own business and take care of our own people and this nation had more friends when we followed the policy of peace

one of the gentlemen who earlier in this carbon debate several congresses ago has been involved with crafting a realistic carbon tax we had the reference to the inability to move the capandtrade which
