cannot support the program cuts it uses as offsets the objective of the amendment is to restore to the patent and trademark office pto the ability to spend 134 million in fees paid by patent and trademark applicants and thus to restore its ability to perform critical functions however i do not believe that we should restore these funds by cutting in half the funds provided to the cultural and educational exchange programs operated by the department of state i do not want anyone to interpret my vote against this amendment as a sign i condone the nowannual raids on pto fees to pay for other programs i unequivocally oppose these raids and will work to ensure that such raids cannot and do not occur in the future over the past few years congress has diverted to other agencies hundreds of millions of dollars in fees paid to the pto by patent and trademark applicants the congress has tried to cover up these diversions by engaging in an accounting shell game but the end result each year is the same hundreds of millions in fees paid to the pto go to fund other agencies this year the diversion has gotten totally out of control while the presidents budget for fiscal year 2001 proposed diverting only and i use that word cynicallys113 million from the pto the appropriators saw fit to divert another 134 million for an unprecedented total of almost 250 million in diverted fees in other words 25 percent of the fees paid to the pto or 25 cents out of every dollar paid by each independent inventor would be spent for totally unrelated purposes these diversions are not only an injustice to those who paid the fees but effectively kill the goose that lays the golden egg the unitedstates patent system and the pto that administers it deserve a large measure of credit for encouraging and sustaining the cur rant american technology boom as our founders clearly recognized the availability of patent protection plays a critical role in encouraging inventiveness sure enough many information telecommunications biotechnology and internet technologies are patented and as my colleagues are only too aware these recent technology advances are largely responsible for the greatest economic boom our nation has ever experienced dont just take my word for it the central role of the pto in advancing this technology boom can be seen through the array of technology companies from ibm and intel to amazon com and sun microsystems that have come out in strong opposition to these funding cuts the information technology industry council considers restoration of pto fees important enough to score this vote in its high tech voting guide these technology companies recognize that the pto must be adequately funded for the technology boom to be sustained it is not hard to see that the funding cuts made by h r 4690 to the pto budget will seriously impair the ptos ability to carry out its critical functions including review of patents and thus will have a deleterious effect on the american technology boom patents already take too long to be processed with the pendancy of a patent application currently averaging two years even before these funding cuts the pendancy of a patent was due to rise to 31 months by 2005 after these cuts will we be talking about 4 or 5 years for reviews of patent applications whether the pendancy is two years or five it is clearly too long to make a patent useful in internet time we should be shortening patent pendancies not lengthening them moreover these cuts couldnt occur at a less opportune time the workload of the pto has grown by almost 75 percent since 1992 this year alone patent and trademark filings are increasing at a dramatic ratea 40 percent increase in trademark applications filings and a 12 percent increase in patent application filings the complexity of this workload has also increased dramatically the technology boom in the united states has resulted in applications for patents on inventions in areas of technology that did not exist just a few years ago on a daily basis the pto is asked to review applications for patents on such things as genetic tests laser vision technologies software and intemet business methods to ensure that it can adequately process such patents and thus preserve the integrity of the patent system the pto must hire new examinerswith the requisite skills in these areas or fund extensive retraining for current examiners for example in the intemet business method area alone the pto needs to hire fifty 50 examiners with software engineering and business degrees the diversion of fees will greatly impair the ptos ability to handle this increasingly complex workload it is also important to note that the pto is completely funded by fees paid by patent and trademark applicants thats right 100 percent funded by fees the 250 million dollars that h r 4690 takes away from the pto were paid by patent and trademark applicants expecting to receive pto services for that money the small independent inventor who has paid approximately 500 to file an application or 1500 to maintain a patent should be outraged that his money has been diverted to other programs while his patent application remains stalled in bureaucratic limbo in summary i note again that diversion of pto fees provided for in h r 4690 will greatly impair the ptos ability to adequately fulfill its role in encouraging the current technology boom furthermore these fee diversions are a manifest injustice to the inventors who pay them however i cannot support eviscerating one valuable program to restore funds taken from another thus i must regretfully vote against this"], [0.49915075302124023, 0.5008492469787598, 1, "i strongly support this legislation of which i am a cosponsor i also want to recognize and honor the original sponsor of this legislation chairman jim leach of the house banking committee for his leadership inbringing this important issue to the floor today and for that of our colleague representative barbara lee who has been the main champion of this critical issue working with the chairman on the house banking committee we were able to approve this bipartisan legislation out of the full committee in march by a vote of 27 to 4 under this bill the unitedstates treasury department will negotiate with the world bank and its members to establish a trust fund to solicit contributions from governments the private sector and other nongovernmental organizations to provide grants to address the global hiv aids epidemic the grants provided by the trust fund would support measures to implement and establish effective hiv aids prevention measures as well as fund new research and development activities in the countries hardest hit by the epidemic participating countries with the highest rates of hiv aids infection rates would receive priority under this legislation and must agree to implement national strategies to combat hiv aids for payment to the world bank hiv aids trust fund the bill authorizes 100 million in each year from fiscal year 2001 through 2005 for a total of 500 million over five years almost 34 million people live with hiv aids of which about 95 percent live in the developing world approximately 16 3 million people have died of hiv aids with over 80 percent of those deaths occurring in subsaharan africa which accounts for only 10 percent of the world population worldwide about 5 6 million new infections will occur this year with an estimated 3 8 million in subsaharan africa3 8 million people will contract hiv every day 11 000 additional people are infectedi every 8 seconds all told over 34 million people in africadouble the population of the state of texashave been infected with hiv since the epidemic began and an estimated 13 7 million africans have lost their lives to aids including 2 2 million who died in 1998 each day aids kills 5 500 men women and children by 2005 if policies do not change the daily death toll will not be 5 500 it will be 13 000double what it is nowwith nearly 5 million aids deaths that year alone according to the white house office of aids policy aids has surpassed malaria as the leading cause of death in africa and it kills many times more people on that continent than war the overall rate of infection among adults is about 8 percent compared with a 1 1percent infection rate worldwide in some countries of southern africa 20 to 30 percent of the adults are infected aids has cut life expectancy by 4 years in nigeria 18 years in kenya and 26 years in zimbabwe aids is swelling infant and child mortality rates reversing the declines that had been occurring in many countries during the 1970s and 1980s over 30 percent of all children born to hivinfected mothers in subsaharan africa will themselves become hiv infected there are many explanations for why this epidemic is sweeping across subsaharan africa certainly the regions poverty which has deprived much of africa from effective systems of health information health education and health care bears much of the blame subsaharan africa becoming the only region in the world in which women are infected with hiv at a higher rate than men may also play a role hiv aids is becoming a major womans issue aids has largely impacted the heterosexual community in africa and it has established itself in such a way that it sweeps across and wipes out entire villages because of the regions poverty all too often treatment of aids sufferers with medicines that can result in longterm survival has not been widely used in africa despite these sobering statistics there is a bit of good news uganda is making significant headway with regard to prevention since 1992 the ugandan governments very frank and highprofile public education efforts have helped to reduce the incidence of hiv infection by more than 15 percent thanks to recent medical research there are now effective drugs that combat hiv aids for example some recent pilot projects have had success in reducing mothertochild transmission by administering the antihiv drug azt or a less expensive medicine nevirapine during birth and early childhood new studies indicate that nevirapine can reduce the risk of mothertochild transmission by as much as 80 percent nvp is given just once to the mother during labor once to the child within 3 days of birth taking three or four pills can mean that a child is prevented from being born with hiv in fact for 4 a tablet this drug regime has created an unprecedented opportunity for international cooperation in the fight against aids currently however less than 1 percent of hivinfected pregnant women have access to interventions to reduce mothertochild transmission administered in a treatment regimen known as haarthighly active antiretroviral therapyantiretroviral drugs can allow people living with aids to live a largely normal life and use of the drugs can lead to longterm survival rather than early death such treatment is proven highly effective in developed countries including our very own but despite these positive signs there are many fronts on which there has been very little progress virtually no one has access to drugs to treat the disease prevention is unquestionably the most important element of the equation but treatment cannot be ignored poverty should not be a death sentencenot when the infectious disease that is destroying african society can be treated even beyond the human tragedy there are vast economic costs to this epidemic aids affect8 the most productive segment of society it is turning the future leaders of the region into a generation of orphans the united states and the other industrialized nations of the world have the power to make these lifesavings drugs more affordable and accessible to africans if the unitedstates and other g7 nations fail to engage and address this crisis now i fear we will be forced to address it in more costly terms both economic and

carrying on the legacy set by mo and his brother stewart there are those today who will speak about mo udall the gentleman from arizona mo udall the presidential candidate mo udall the powerful chairman of the committee on interior and insular affairs and his vast legislative accomplishments mo udall the man i share the sentiments of my colleagues in these matters as a freshman member of congress i began serving on the interior committee in 1977 the year mo became its chairman under mos leadership the years that followed were extremely productive for the committee many of mos legislative initiatives were enacted into law such as the alaskan lands act under mo udalls guidance the committee produced a legendary amount of wilderness and park legislation that will stand as testimony to the will and foresight of this great man others will speak to those issues i will speak to but one of mo udalls legislative achievements one that left its mark on the lives of every citizen of this nations coalfields the landmark surface mining control and reclamation act of 1977 for many years leading up to the enactment of this law the gentleman from arizona saw what was occurring in the appalachian coalfields of this nation due to unregulated surface coal mining by the 1970s it became increasingly clear that the proliferation of acidified streams highwalls refuse piles open mine shafts and other hazards associated with past coal mining practices could not be ignored it was on february 26 1972 that a coal waste dam located on buffalo creek in logan county wv collapsed causing a flood of truly horrible proportions in loss of life injuries property damage and people left homeless this disaster coupled with mounting concems over the failure of several states to properly regulate mining ensure reclamation and the development of surface coal mining in the semiarid west for the first time raised the level of public attention to the plight of coalfield citizens adversely affected by certain coal mining practices from a local to a truly national level the congressional debates of the mid1970s and bills passed only to be vetoed set the stage for mo udalls introduction of h r 2 on the opening day of the 95th congress in as a newly elected representative from west virginia i was honored to serve on the interior committee at this time at the very time when mo udall took the leadership reins of the committee at the very time when after years of struggle it looked likely that a federal strip mining act would pass muster i was given a great compliment when mo udall chose this freshman member from west virginia to serve on the housesenate conference committee on h r 2 and stood in the rose garden with president carter and mo udall when the bill was signed into law as the surface mining control and reclamation act of 1977 this law has served the people of the appalachian coalfields well it has made the coalfields of this nation a much better place in which to live the vast majority of the coal industry is in compliance with the law and countless acres of old abandoned coal mine lands have been reclaimed under the special fund established by the act mo udalls original insight and foresight have proven correct and we are very much indebted to him when god made the mountains of my home state of west virginia he made a special breed of people to preside over them we are born of the mountains and hollows of our rugged terrain our state motto is montani semper liberi mountaineers are always free although mo udall is from the southwest from arizona he understood us he understood the true beauty of our hills and hollers he is in my mind an honorary west virginian and his years of diligence in not only gaining the enactment of the 1977 law but in pursuing its implementation will be long remembered by all west virginians now if mo was here i can imagine what he would say he would tell the story about a young man at a banquet this young man was getting an award and he was flustered and he said i sure dont appreciate it but i really do deserve it mo turned over responsibility on the committee for the surface mining act to this gentleman from west virginia his chairman of the subcommittee on mining and natural resources as i undertake my duties in this regard the words mo spoke on the 10year anniversary of the enactment of the 1977 law ring in my ears the act was and is more than a piece of legislation it is a vehicle of hope for those who live and who will live in americas coalfields mo left some big shoes to fill i cannot conclude without making note of one other mining initiative mo understood what was occurring in the coalfields but he also understood the abuses that took place in the west in hardock mining for copper gold silver and other such minerals under the mining law of 1872 it was also in 1977 that the effort to reform the mining law of 1872 came to a head mo udall a reform supporter however found that the press of committee business and other considerations would cause this particular initiative to be shelved for the time being ten years later in 1987 as his mining subcommittee chairman i resurrected the issue and today mining law reform legislation is being actively considered by the congress mo i will do my best to use the same judgment same humor you would bring to the

many other important issues i also welcome the support of the administration for needed benefit increases in the montgomery gi bill the administration has proposed to increase the basic monthly benefit to 670 per month effective october 1 of this year that would provide a very significant 25 percent increase in the monthly benefit i think every member of our committee believes that this increase is needed long overdue and a step in the right direction the administrations support for benefit increases in the gi bill is very welcome and i look forward to working with them in the future last year the gentleman from arizona and i introduced separate measures to improve the montgomery gi bill the legislation i authored with the gentleman from michigan h r 1071 is cosponsored by 143 members of our house of representatives this includes a large representation of the members and it is a great honor to support the gentleman from arizonas leadership on this issue h r 1071 would provide the meaningful increase in educational benefits i believe our nation should provide to the women and men who serve our country in the armed forces by restoring the gi bills purchasing power we know h r 4268 is only the first step toward improving the montgomery gi bill program in a meaningful way this legislation does comply with paygo congress can enact it it will provide real benefit increases for veterans and their dependents that is why i hope the house will approve this unanimously today first i want to thank chairman stump for his leadership on the legislation before us today

every member of the committee on veterans affairs believes this increase is needed long overdue and represents a step in the right direction i look forward to working with the administration in the future as we move forward with the subsequent steps necessary to restore the original purchasing power to the gi bill last year chairman stump and i introduced separate measures to improve the montgomery gi bill the legislation which i authored with congressman dingell h r 1071 is cosponsored by 143 members of the house h r 1071 provides the meaningful increase in educational benefits i believe our nation should provide the women and men who serve our country in the armed forces historically the mgib program has been the most important recruiting incentive for the armed services but the value of these benefits has failed to keep up with the spiraling costs of higher education enhancements to rectify this problem with the mgib are long overdue i strongly agree with the report of the congressional commission on service members and veterans transition assistance which concluded an opportunity to obtain the best education for which they qualify is the most valuable benefit our nation can offer the men and women whose military service preserves our liberty i applaud the commissions bold new plan for the mgib this proposal however must be further strengthened and enhanced if the mgib is to fulfill its purposes as a meaningful readjustment benefit and as an effective recruitment incentive for our armed forces since implementation of the montgomery gi bill on july 1 1985 there have been major changes in the economic and sociological landscapes that make revisions in the structure and benefit level of this program imperative of immediate concern is the ineffectiveness of the mgib as a readjustment program for service members making the transition from a military to a civilian workforce although costs of education have soared nearly doubling since 1980 gi bill benefits have not kept pace in fact during the 199596 school year the basic benefit paid under the mgib offsets only a paltry 36 percent of average total education costs and the disappointingly low usage rate of 51 for 1998 confirms the inadequacy of the current programs benefit levels under current law young men and women who serve in our armed forces have the option of enrolling in the mgib when they enter the military this includes their agreement to a 100 per month pay reduction during the first 12 months of service for a total contribution of 1200 once their initial term of service has been honorably served a veteran is eligible to receive the basic educational benefit of 536 each month he or she is enrolled in fulltime college study the benefit continues for up to 36 months assuming he or she is enrolled for a typical ninemonth academic year the veterans total benefit for that year is 4 824 with this modest amount he or she is expected to pay for tuition fees room and board the average annual cost of tuition and basic expenses at a fouryear public college is 8 774 for commuter students and 10 909 for students who live on campus not surprisingly the same annual costs for fouryear private colleges are even higher 20 500 for commuter students and 23 651 for residents the disparity between these everincreasing costs and a veterans ability to pay for them is clear this disparity recently prompted key military and veteran organizations to join together with organizations representing colleges to form the partnership for veterans education the coalition launched an energetic campaign calling for congress to at least go as far as increasing the basic benefit under the mgib to 975 per month enough to cover the 8 774 average annual cost of attending a fouryear public college as a commuter student as ive stated already h r 4268 will not meet these overwhelming education costs standing on its own it is an important step in the right direction though as congress seeks to find ways to fully restore the gi bills purchasing power to what was originally intended as introduced section two of h r 4268 would increase the basic benefit under the gi bill from 536 to 600 per month on october 1 2000 and to 720 per month on october 1 2002 for fulltime students with proportionate increases for pdrttime students section three would furnish individuals still on active duty who either turned down a previous opportunity to convert to the mgib or had a zero balance in their vietnam era veterans education assistance program veap account the option to pay 2 700 to convert to mgib eligibility section four would increase survivors and dependents educational assistance benefits for fulltime students from 485 to 600 per month effective october 1 2000 and 720 per month effective october 1 2002 with proportionate increases from parttime students an annual cost of living adjustment is also authorized section five would permit the award of survivors and dependents educational assistance payments to be retroactive to the date of vas adjudication of a serviceconnected death or a 100 disability rating section six would solve a problem that faces a small number of students whose schools have different schedules it would allow for m6nthly educational assistance benefits to be paid between term quarter or semester intervals of up to 8 weeks in duration section seven would allow the use of montgomery gi bill h3554 co benefits to pay for fee associated with a veterans civilian occupational licensing or certification examination to offset the costs of h r 4268 section eight of the bill as introduced would extend temporary authorities to 2008 that would otherwise expire on september 30 2002 these include a va enhanced loan asset authority guaranteeing the payment of principal and interest on vaissued certificates or other securities va home loan fees of threequarters of 1 percent of the total loan amount procedures applicable to liquidation sales on defaulted home loans guaranteed by va va department of health and human services income verification authority in which va verifies the eligibility of or applicants for va needsbased benefits and va meanstested medical care by gaining access to income records of the department of health and human services social security administration and the internal revenue service and limitation on va pension on veterans without dependents receiving medicaidcovered nursing home care in addition section nine of the bill would codify recurring provisions in annual vaappropriations acts and section ten would reinstate the requirements that the secretary provide periodic reports specifically these concern reports on equitable relief granted by the secretary to an individual beneficiary expires december 31 2004 work and activities of the department programs and activities examined by the advisory committees on former prisoners of war and women veterans expires after biennial reports submitted in 2003 operation of the montgomery gi bill educational assistance program expires december 31 2004 and the activities of the secretarys special medical advisory group expires december 31 2004 in addition section ten requires the secretary to include with any report an estimate of the cost of preparing the report the current structure of the mgib served the veterans of the second half of the 20th century very well however the mgib must now be reexamined in the context of a january 1999 report by he departments of commerce labor and education the small business administration and the national institute for literacy this report entitled 21st century skills for 21st century jobs has important implications for veterans entering the civilian workforce emphasizing the importance tothe nation of investing in education and training the report concluded changes in the economy and workplace are requiring greater levels of skill and education than ever before it predicted eight of the ten fastest growing jobs in the next decade will require college education or moderate to longterm training and jobs requiring a bachelors degree will increase by 25 the report also noted workers with more education enjoy greater benefits experience less unemployment and if dislocated reenter the labor force far more quickly than individuals with less education it also reports that on average college graduates earn 77 more than individuals with only a high school diploma if americas veterans are to successfully compete in the challenging 21st century workforce they simply have to have the ability to obtain the education and training critical to their success as noted by the transition commission education will be the key to employment in the information age according to the 1997 department of defense report entitled population representation in the military services 20 of the new enlisted recruits for that year were african american 10 were hispanic 6 were other minorities including native americans asians and pacific islanders and 18 were women the report further notes that although members of the military come from backgrounds somewhat lower in socioeconomic status than the unitedstates average these young men and women have higher levels of education measured aptitudes andreading skills than their civilian counterparts these young people most of whon5 do not enter military service with fi nancial or socioeconomic advantages have enormous potential and it is in the best interests of the nation they be given every opportunity to achieve their highest potential access to education is the key to achieving that potential it is also important to remember that through the sacrifices required of them through their military service this group of young americansmore than any otherearns the benefits provided for them by a grateful nation of equal concern to me as a member of the armed services committee is the mgjb progrims failure to fulfill its purpose as a recruitment incentive for the armed forces findings of the 1998 youth attitude tracking study yats confirm that recruiters are facedwith serious challenges and these challenges are likely to continue this survey of young men and women conducted annually by the department of defense provides information on the propensity attitudes and motivations of young people toward military service the latest yats shows the propensity to enlist among young males has fallen from 34 in 1991 to 26 in 1998 in spite of a generally favorable view of the military in addition to a thriving civilian economy which inevitably results in recruiting challenges the percentage of american youth going to college is increasing and the young people most likely to go to college express little interest in joining our armed forces interestingly these same youth note that if they were to serve in the military their primary reason for enlisting would be to earn educational assistance benefits the study concluded the propensity to enlist is substantially below predrawdown levels and as a result the services will probably not succeedin recruiting the number of young highquality men and women they need in fy 1999 highquality youth are defined as those who have a high school diploma and who have at least average scores on tests measuring mathematical and verbal skills the department of defense tells us about 80 of these recruits will complete their first three years of active duty while only 50 of recruits with a ged will complete their enlistment may 23 2000 gao notes that it costs at least 35 000 to replace a recruit who leaves the service prematurely the report states these findings underscore the need for education benefits that will attract collegebound youth who need money for school a segment of american young people we conclude are not opting to take advantage of the many other sources of federal education assistance the current structure and benefit level of the mgib must be significantly amended if these high quality young men and women are to be attracted to service in our armed forces the army has been missing its enlistment goals several times now additionally for the first time since 1979 the air force may be missing its targets too although the navy and marine corps are currently meeting their enlistment goals they will likely miss them in the future unless we take quick and effective action the cinc unitedstates atlantic fleet admiral paul reason recently reported to thesenate armed services committee that the last three carrier battle groups have deployed with forces below the required manning level specifically the unitedstatess theodore roosevelt battle group deployed last year with 9 of its positions unfilled these are strong indications of a coming readiness crisis and we must not ignore these disturbing signals many factors have come together to create what could soon develop into a recruiting emergency first our thriving national economy is generating employment opportunities for our young people additionally young americans increasingly see a college education as the key to success and prosperity in 1980 74 of high school graduates went to college but by 1992 that percentage had risen to 81 and is increasing as a result the military must compete headtohead with colleges for highquality youth as i have mentioned already the percentage of young americans who are interested in serving in the armed forces is also shrinking make no mistake about itthe strength of our armed forces begins and ends with the men and women who serve our nation just as education is the key to a societys success or failure it is also key to the quality and effectiveness of our military forcesand the mgib increases included in this substitute budget resolution are a step in the right direction toward providing that key veterans are not using the mgib benefits they earned through honorable military service and highability collegebound young americans are choosing not to serve in the armed forces significant changes in the program will increase program usage and will enable the military services to recruit the smart young people they need accordingly several bills have been introduced in both the jouse and the senate during the 106th congress that would significantly improve the mgib the

that same time 626 vessels were anchored in the san francisco bay when california became a state the legislature established san francisco county but with the explosive growth of the area just six years later in 1856 it was necessary to create the new county of san mateo from the southern part of san francisco county after the initial chaos of the early years of the gold rush the growth of these two counties was more orderiy but still robust san mateo county was given a boost by the tragedy of the massive 1906 san francisco earthquake when thousands of displaced and terrified residents fled the city and encamped in what became daly city as the bay area developed san mateo county likewise grew as a cluster of communitieseach filled with growing numbers of irish italian greek and

century and a half ago established the pattern of our state ethnic diversity is not just a concept in our area it is a daily reality one quarter of our population in the 12th congressional district are asianchinese filipino south asian japanese southeast asian and others over an eighth of our population is hispanic with a smaller population of african americans a recent article in the san francisco examiner on daly city referred to this diversity in praising the mixture of spanish tagalog and hindi heard in the citys markets and noted that ethnic diversity is a source of pride for the community as reflected in its integrated neighborhoods as the state of california moves from a majority white to a majority minority population and as our nations population becomes increasingly diverse the 12th congressional district is a harbinger of the benefits of a harmonious ethnically diverse community this is not to say that tolerance and multiethnic harmony has always been the case in our state california as the rest of the nation has had its share of discrimination and racism chinese and other asians suffered harassment and intimidation during the era of the chinese exclusion act during world war ii tens of thousands of american citizens of japanese ancestry were sent to relocation camps hispanicamericans have faced discrimination for using spanish and maintaining their national cultures but we have learned we have made progress and we continue to struggle with the complications of diversity a second element is the importance of the peninsula and of san francisco in our state and our nations economy a century and a half ago panning for gold made a few people rich quickly but those who made the real contribution to our state and our nations economy as well as real wealth for themselves were the individuals who brought the entrepreneurial spirit which gave rise to such legendary businesses as levi strauss ghiradelli chocolate and the wells fargo bank a century and a half ago gold was discovered at sutters fort on january 24 1848 but the first newspaper story about the discovery to appear in a newspaper in the eastern united states was only published eight months later in the new york herald on august 19 when california was formally admitted as a state to the union on september 9 1850 it required six weeks for the steamer bearing the banner california is a state to arrive in san francisco the celebration of statehood in california did not take place until october 29a full 50 days after statehood was a reality today california is in the forefront of the instantaneous communication revolution as intemet communication and ecommerce led by firms in silicon valley and san francisco revolutionize the way the entire world communicates today we continue to have an ebullient economy in the bay area and this is an important element of our states contribution to the entire nation as our distinguished governor gray davis said recently were experiencing a second gold rush people came here 150 years ago to find their fortune and the dotcom economy is bringing another generation of risk takers and entrepreneurs all this energy and vitality helps drive our economy and makes for the robust society we cur rently enjoy san jose mercury news september 9 z today legendary companies in the 12th congressional district such as oracle in the information technology sector and genentech in the biotech sector are leading the nation in creativity and innovation it is important today that we not only mark a century and a half of californias statehood with celebration and congratulation but that we also use this opportunity to reflect upon how our past has shaped our present and how the decisions we take today will determine our future if we commit ourselves to continue and strengthen the best of our states traditions we can assure that the future for our children and grandchildren will be even more golden than our past"], [0.49919581413269043,

programs that are of benefit not just to our farmers but to all americans however in a lastminute ploy the republican leadership decided to make deep cuts to this bill that call into question their commitment to both american farmers and american consumers who rely on adequate funding for these programs those cuts included important agricultural construction projects in califomia including improvements to the agricultural research services westem regional research center at albany and construction of the western human nutrition laboratory at davis these projects are supported by the department of agriculture they were in the presidents budget request and there was no opposition to including the necessary construction funds prior to today i am very disappointed that the republican leadership has chosen to pull the rug out from under these vital facilities h r 1906 as reported by the appropriations committee was not a perfect bill but i believe chairman joe skeen and ranking member marcy kaptur and their subcommittee members did a commendable job under tough budget constraints to fund the many deserving programs in this bill the lastminute amendment offered by rep bill young to appease the right wing of his party works against that spirit of bipartisanship this bills scope the socalled agriculture appropriations bill is sweeping from agriculture research rural development and land conservation programs to food safety and op erations of the food and drug administration administration of our farm programs and marketing of our agricultural commodities is also included yet the greatest share of the funding goes for nutrition programs including food stamps school breakfast and lunch and the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children or wic im particularly grateful to the committee for adding funding within the extension activities of the cooperative state research education and extension service for an afterschool program in los angeles our 4h after school activity program is operating at 21 sites and over 4 000 kids are participating in educational field trips getting homework assistance and receiving other types of mentoring this program is a wonderful antidote to the drug and gang activity to which many of the kids in my district are susceptible i very much appreciate this onetime infusion of funding so we can sustain the program and establish a longterm partnership between the government and businesses in our community i am also grateful that the bill contains an increase of 5 million for farm labor housing in the rural cooperative service and 9 million for rural housing assistance grants which can also be used for nonprofit organizations of farm workers migrant and seasonal farmworkers are some of the nations most poorly housed populations the last documented national study indicated a shortage of some 800 000 units of affordable housing for farmworkers however farmworker households are some of the poorest yet least assisted households in the nation so the need for housing is great and the committee has responded within its overall budget constraints to make some needed progress in this area the nutrition programs in this bill benefit many of my constituents and people of all ages across the united states however i share the concern that has been expressed about adequate funding for the wic program prior studies have demonstrated that for every 1 spent on the wic program up to 3 is saved in costs to medicaid and other federal programs that easily makes wic one of the most costeffective programs administered by the federa government although the committee increased funding by 81 million over last year the amount provided is 100 million less than the presidents budget request wic serves 1 2 million californians and we are making enormous strides in using the funds to serve all the mothers and children in need on may 24 the california department of health services lowered the maximum price it would pay for milk eggs cheese cereal juice and other foods in the wic market basket in order to avoid having to cut 25 000 poor mothers and children from its roster while other states may easily serve their wic recipients with the funds distributed to them califomia must use its funding shrewdly in order to serve all those in need the effective food and nutrition education program efnep of the extension service also plays an important role in working with wic mothers and others to help them build positive lifelong nutrition habits and skill i urge the chairman and the committee to reassess the wic funding level during its conference with the senate in order to ensure that no qualified women and children miss out on the benefits of this program which contribute to a healthy america california is the largest agricultural producing state in the nation and i am phased that the committee has recommended funding for other programs of benefit to our farmers unlike many producers in the midwest who have long benefited from agriculture price support programs many of our california producers have been engaged in marketoriented agriculture for many years thats why the market access program map is so important to our cooperatives small farmers and other producers who are making aggressive efforts to expand markets overseas im pleased that the committee has funded map at its full authorized level in addition agricultural research into the special problems that affect califomia cornmodities takes on added importance to our producers research into integrated pest management and into alternatives to methyl bromide are just some of the vital research projects under way at the university of california and funding for the agricultural research service for cooperative federalstate research for competitive research grants and for special research grants are all important parts of this bill there are many other programs in the bill that i could comment on including the food safety program and the youth antitobacco initiative in the food and drug administration these are areas where we would all like to do more if possible but the committee originally reported a responsible bill based on its budget allocation now these partisan floor shenanigans call into question our ability to improve funding for these programs if opportunities present themselves later in the appropriations endgame in short i would like to support this bill and the programs of benefit to my constituents and the people of califomia and the nation however i cannot in good conscience vote for final passage because the republican majority has made a decision to depart from the usual bipartisan manner in which we consider this bill in pursuit of their own political purposes i hope that the housesenate conference committee will make the needed improvements in this bill that will draw the customary widespread bipartisan support before we send the final version to the president late in this fiscal year"], [0.4991964101791382, 0.5008035898208618, 1, "i thank the gentlewoman i appreciate the comments of the gentlewoman from texas and the wisdom she brings us from her service on the committee on the judiciary i want to expand on one thing the gentlewoman pointed out and that is the perception that someone who happens to want an appointment in the bush administration and says so to the press and who chairs his campaign in florida would be making these decisions the ultimate decision should be made by the courts now they are not perfect either but i have spent the last several years in partisan politics and to leave this in the hands of a partisan politician is a big mistake instead the courts of the state of florida should carefully review the discretion of the secretary of state and make sure that she does not act in a capricious or arbitrary manner now i want to refocus our attention on the ballot in palm beach county and remind the house that in 1998 the florida supreme court ruled in beckstrom versus volusia county canvassing board that if the court finds substantial noncompliance with statutory election procedures and makes a factual determination that a reasonable doubt exists as to whether a certified election expresses the will of the voters then the court is to void the contested election even in the absence of fraud or intentional wrongdoing i do not allege any fraud or intentional wrongdoing in palm beach florida but the court decision of the supreme court of florida is clear substantial noncompliance with the statutory election procedures this ballot violates those two florida statutes for example the one that requires the name on the left and the hole to be on the right but the real confusion caused by this bailot became apparent on election day the washington post reported last saturday that by midmorning of election day voters were calling county commissioners state legislators and other elected officials to complain about the confusing butterfly ballot and request that something be done by midafternoon local radio talk shows were bombarded with calls by people complaining about the ballot then a hastily written memo late in the afternoon was distributed from the county supervisor of elections to the various polling places but they arrived after the vast majority of voters had already voted those who want to say that the complaints about this ballot began only when the pivotal nature of the vote in palm beach county was apparent to the world are wrong the protest began on election morning when the first voters left the polls confused by this ballot this illegal ballot now for example you had one individual kurt wise who is president of the united civic organization at the century village retirement community who said elderly voters confusion with the butterfly ballot was brought to his attention people were crying they were coming to us asking questions the ballot form was lousy they did not even know who they had voted for that is the report of the washington post from last saturday tears the very morning of the election not the morning after then when some elderly voters became aware that the ballot had caused them to make a mistake they were not given a second ballot as is their right under florida law if they turn in their damaged ballot bernard holtzer a retirement community inhabitant said that after he unintentionally voted for pat buchannan and after looking at this ballot you can see how he would make that mistake a clerk refused his request for a second ballot i told the clerk i made a booboo and that i wanted a new ballot and she told me there was nothing i could do about it that was the new york times reporting last saturday then there were the poll workers who were told not to help voters with the problem or any problem they were under strict instructions to turn away voters who came to them with questions louise austin a precinct worker in bolston beach said after getting beseeched by questions she and other workers turned the voters away who were seeking assistance people were coming up to me and i had to follow the directive do not help anyone do not talk to anyone that is the report of the new york times from last saturday so we see that there were a lot of problems in palm beach a confusing ballot a ballot in violation of florida statute and a florida supreme court decision from 2 years ago that makes it clear that under these circumstances a new vote in palm beach is called for but before we get to whether there is a new vote in palm beach we have to get an accurate count of the votes cast on election day and that is why i am so disappointed and saddened that the governor of texas is trying so hard to prevent an accurate count again let me turn to the statute he signed into law in texas a manual recount shall be conducted in preference to an electronic recount when confronted by this james baker had to stop talking about precision machines because the machines in florida and those in texas are identical and in texas governor bush signed the law that said the human being outranks omission from the congresthe machine sional record of friday not llfftf 13 onffl he instead had to talk about standards he has not shown us the standards in texas but what is worse he has not suggested particular standards to any county in florida if james baker has good standards if george w bush has good standards if somewhere in the deep bowels of the bureaucracy of texas there are standards that could be helpful in providing the best possible manual recount we ought to see them instead we are told that the machines are better than the human being a machine that would take the ballot of a veteran of world war ii and disenfranchise that veteran because there was a crease in the ballot that is not a machine that should determine the presidency of the united states so to sum up we have a misleading ballot in one county that was illegal and under florida law should lead to a new election in that county we have a recount that should ultimately under the laws of the state of florida lead to being the tally of manual recounts in the 40 counties in which those manual recounts were duly applied for and if mr bush wants to announce to the world that he is suddenly in favor of manual recounts then i do not see anyone who would oppose him if he tried to get a manual recount in some of those other counties i would point out though that i think james baker would have a tough time being his spokesperson on that issue speaking of mr bakers acting as spokesperson there is one small aspect of this i really want to focus on and that is the tendency of those on the bush side toinsult the parents of the campaign chairman on the gore side we have many heated debates here in the house but i have never insulted the father of any member and i never thought that even if the father of a member of this house had done something erroneous or wrong that that would be a reason to discard and discount what that member had to say so why is it that james baker finds it necessary to insult bill daley by insulting his father as if insulting a mans father proves the rightness of ones case if the best debater they have james baker has nothing to say but so is your old man then they have run out of things to say on the republican side with that i am hopeful that democracy will prevail in this country"], [0.4992014765739441, 0.5007985234260559, 1,

lawdeliberate speed that would have still yers lawyers they were committed to had us trying to desegregate the upholding and defending the dignity of schools today but these lawyers these the common man the black man the fearsome lawyers were in there fight black woman the disenfranchised ing for justice quietly sometimes they were true advocates and for sometimes with very soft voices as them and the likes of c b king we julius chambers always had some are grateful times with that big bass voice like i am happy to yield to c b king who could just as well have the distinguished gentlewoman from been a southern baptist preacher with houston texas a booming voice like that who was also an earl warren fellow that is what i remember about this and who grew in the legacy of these man who was about the size of the gen great legal giants like c b king and tleman from georgia he who like those of us who have spoken was not a big guy but he had that big before her this evening are living the magnificent voice and he had a sense legacy of their hard work of timing and understanding of what i am delighted to yield to her to hear was needed in the civil rights move her perspective on this great legal ment and no less commitment to giant chevene bowers king change than any of the people who ms jacksonlee of texas i thank were demonstrating in the streets but the distinguished gentleman

that the constitu to the gentleman from north carolina tion had committed to us and to the gentleman from and all of these wonderful lawyers south carolina that as julius chambers james ferguson the gentleman has called the role c b matthew perry ernest finney avon king is smiling williams don hollowell howard he is smiling i say to the gentleman moore fred gray c b king all of from georgia because the them had one thing in common they gentleman has come to this place would stand before a judge sometimes these hallowed halls and as he c b be called all kinds of names that we king has watched the gentleman legisdare not mention in this chamber late as he has watched the gentleman advocate he is smiling to see that in the tradition of a lawyers lawyer the gentleman has made his work to be not in vain i thank you for your leadership i thank you for honoring c b king both in terms of a fixed memorial in georgia and for this special hour i had the pleasure of being one of the beneficiaries as so many who are unnamed and who are not here of the kind of legal activism of a c b king so i could not miss this opportunity to cite him as one of the soldiers who complimented the activism of a john lewis and a martin king i marched with the gentleman from georgia in a recommemoration of the selma to montgomery march the marches i had were slightly different from those that were experienced by martin king and john lewis and jose williams and many others of the sclc and sncc we engaged in the black student movements in the institutions in the north throughout the 1960s and the 1970s i think the specialness of why we salute c b king is because their work in the courts was universal to all of us who advocated through agitation i think it motivated all of us who were given the opportunity to go on to college and then choose a way of acting out this activism to choose law school and out of the opportunity to see and admire those heroes in the courtrooms in the days when it was not as light as the times that we may have gone who established the precedent upon which we could argue our cases i am reminded of my activism on death penalty cases being able to use the old civil rights laws or the cases that many had already plowed ahead this is a special time to honor c b king he is not an unknown hero he is part of that cadre of men and women we should be repeating time after time in our schools and in our celebration and commemoration of black history month these were the mechanics the intellectual mechanics these who fixed things and put them back together again they were fearless they were articulate they stayed up long hours they were paid few dollars their hearts and their minds were strong on this coming sunday april 16 it will be census day in houston texas census sunday in fact and i will spend my time encouraging our churches and those who gather in them the value of being counted the value of acknowledging that you are somebody the value of saying to the united states of america we need to be counted we are claiming our birthright and claiming our rights and our responsibility as a citizen and we will act upon it why is that relevant to c b king it is relevant because c b king was part of the mechanics to translate what one person one vote truly meant he is part of the mechanics of allowing us to assemble peaceably to partition against segregation to allow us to vote freely and to speak upon who we want to represent us c b king would be proud if we got ourselves counseled for he is well aware that approaching in the year 2000 we will be looking ahead to see whether or not these seats of which all of us hold from the south all creatures of thurgood marshall and c b king and julius chambers and horace ward and so many others all creatures of this whole concept of the voting rights act and redrawing of the lines to ensure there is one vote one person would it not be a tragedy in 2001 similar to 1901 100 years ago when congressman white stood in this very place as he was drawn out of the united states congress the last african american congress person to have come through the reconstruction and to stand here in these chambers but he said to this very hollowed body the negro will rise like the phoenix although this is my last opportunity to debate my last opportunity to be representative the negro would rise like the phoenix to c b king i owe him much i owe his mother and his father who trained him well i owe the fact that he left albany georgia and went on to case western reserve law school but he came back home i owe the fact that i had the honor of working for the southern christian leadership conference as a young college student i came to albany georgia to continue part of the albany movement that was still going on in the 1970s to press for the right to vote and the right for individuals to choose their elected representatives this evening as we honor these heroes i would like to accept the challenge of the gentleman from north carolina the gentleman from georgia i would like us to chronicle the numbers of heroes who use the law in the courtroom as the gentleman from georgia has done for us this evening maybe we can collaborate and get all of these individuals who silently worked starting with thurgood who we well know but there are others who quietly worked in the 1940s who we may not even have knowledge of them to be able to say that they truly took the law the tools that were given them and did not use them selfishly or for personal self aggrandizement but they used them to free a people america is a better place because they worked to make us free with that i thank the gentleman from georgia for giving me the courtesy of allowing me to salute a gentleman that i admired greatly and that i tried among others to emulate as i got the skills of a lawyer i hope we will be able to honor them more and more i rise tonight to pay tribute to chevene b king an outstanding man and distinguished attorney as a participant in the earl warren naacp legal defense and educational fund training program i am honored to inform the american people of a man who championed civil rights and carried the movement into the political arena chevene bowers king was born on october 12 1923 in albany georgia the third of eight children of clennon w king the owner of an apparel shop and supermarket and mrs margaret slater king mr king attended mercer street elementary school and madison street high school in albany after graduation he attended tuskegee university for a year and then decided to enlist in the united states navy after three years of service mr king left the navy and enrolled at fisk university where he earned his bachelors degree in political science pursuing his political education mr king attended case western reserve university school of law in cleveland ohio after law school he became a preeminent civil rights attorney in southwest georgia working with other african american lawyers from atlanta macon and savannah he worked closely with the local chapter of the naacp and was a cooperating attomey with the naacp legal defense and educational fund his accomplishments and work spanned the entire range of civil rights from school desegregation to the voting rights act he represented african american voters and candidates for office in the struggle against at the time unconstitutional segregation and discrimination he led the way in making the basic right to serve on juries a reality in rural georgia by bringing a series of lawsuits that exposed the discriminatory practices that had continued for more than 100 years after the unitedstates supreme court first held that discrimination in the selection of jurors violated the fourteenth amendment when the civil rights struggle secured the ability to work in america free from discrimination mr king fought to ensure that this right was enforced mr king brought a number of actions to enforce the provisions of title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 and to provide equal job opportunities for african american workers mr king was known as a great scholar of jurisprudence and a superb orator his regal demeanor in the courtroom brought a thoughtful and tranquil specter to the meaning of the civil rights movement in the tradition of men like charles houston thurgood marshall and william h hastie he approached the practice of the law with activism and a commitment to excellence in legal scholarship because of his reputation he was counsel to dr martin luther king jr elijah muhammad and the albany civil rights movement of the early 1960s in 1960 mr king ran for president of the united states and for governor of georgia in both cases as a write in candidate in 1964 with utter determination he ran for the congressional seat of the 2nd district of georgia for his courage and commitment to civil rights he received the n c b l lawyer of the year award in 1975 a t walden library award in 1977 and the l s c r r c pro bono public award of the state of georgia on march 15 1988 mr king passed away at the age of 64 survived by his wife carol roumain and his four sons chevene b jr leland clennon and his daughter peggy in closing i am reminded of the great quote by president theodore roosevelt the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs and comes short again and again who knows the great enthusiasms the great devotions and spends himself in a worthy cause who at best knows the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat chevene bowers king the american people will always remember your contributions and we shall always remain in your debt"], [0.49920183420181274, 0.5007981657981873, 1, "i thank the gentlewoman from the district of columbia for yielding to me i would like to begin as i did in the appropriations committee by thanking chairman istook for the way he has chaired the d c subcommittee and prepared todays legislation he has made a sincere effort to familiarize himself with the affairs of the district of columbia by walking the citys streets meeting with mayor williams and the city council on several occasions and touring the districts schools its low income housing the courts and the administrative offices i know he shares my observation that many of the challenges and issues confronting the district are identical to those confronting most older urban communities at the same time there are a number of circumstances that make the district unique its a creation by congress under article i of the unitedstates constitution and the seat of the federal government it has a large amount of federal property within its boundaries and its local laws and budget may be subject to congressional review and approval the fact that we are considering the district of columbia appropriations act for fiscal year 2000 reflects the districts unique status in reviewing this legislation let me begin by highlighting some of its positive aspects it fully funds the consensus budget both the spending priorities and the tax cuts it provides the federal funding level requested by the administration in fact it brings additional federal money to the districts aid providing 8 5 million for adoption incentives for foster children 20 million for severance pay for the mayors management initiative more than 13 million for expanded drug treatment programs 17 million to fund the instate tuition benefits initiative and close to 20 million to help the office of offender supervision tackle the very serious crime problems caused by repeat offenders and it helps address a number of city concerns from the operation of the districts courts to the hospitals on the whole this legislation is an improvement over the bill that came before us last year with all that said i must still object to a number of provisions that are in this legislation these provisions known collectively as riders prohibit or tie the hands of district officials and its citizens to carry out and implement their own prerogatives perhaps when there was a large direct federal payment to the districts general funds some could justify prohibiting the districts needle exchange program its domestic partners law or even the counting of ballots on its medical marijuana initiative the last direct payment in the fiscal 1999 appropriations act combined with federal grant assistance comprised more than 43 percent of the districts budget federal funds could comingle with local funds making it difficult to distinguish what was funded locally or with federal taxpayer dollars the 1997 revitalization act changed all that and eliminated the concern that federal funds could comingle with local initiatives deemed inappropriate by a majority in congress for all intents and purposes the 1997 act discontinued the direct federal payment to the districts general fund 1 any funds congress may now appropriate to the general fund are for a specific spending purpose and can only be spent for that purpose in return for the elimination of the direct federal payment the federal government assumed direct financial responsibility for obligations and responsibilities traditionally assumed by state governments instead the district will receive direct federal grants identical to those received by most local jurisdictions or federal payments to defray the cost of responsibilities assumed by most states and now assumed by the federal government in the case of the district 1jim the table on page 22 of the committee report states that 26 950 000 in federal funds go to the districts general funds while true from an accounting perspective all 26 950 000 is restricted on how it can be spent 17 million for instate tuition 8 5 million for incentives for adoption s1 2 million for the citizens complaint review board and 250 000 for human services in this light adding language prohibiting the district from implementing local initiatives where no federal funds are involved is a blatant abuse of congressional power using this bill to prohibit the district from using its resources to fund a needle exchange program a program proven effective at reducing the spread of aids is no different than congress passing a law prohibiting needle exchange programs specifically in oklahoma city oklahoma but permitting other locally funded needle exchange programs elsewhere to continue prohibiting the district of columbia from expending its use of local funds to provide abortion services for its lowincome residents when other jurisdictions are free to use local funds for similar programs is just plain wrong banning the use of local funds to prohibit the district from seeking redress in federal court on its voting rights claim is like telling the city of boerne it could not challenge the religious freedom restoration act that it successfully argued before the supreme court barring the district from implementing its local domestic partnership law is like congress passing a law to overturn wichita kansas and jasper alabamas health benefit plan for their public employees teachers and police officers and preventing the districts election officials from counting the ballot on a local referendum is just plain antidemocratic you may object to the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes but to deny the election result from being tallied is like telling the citizens of farmington missouri or manchester new hampshire they cannot approve their referendums to finance building new schools have we become so arrogant in power and fearful of local initiatives that we have to block election results i know some will argue that these riders are merely an extension of current lawthey are but the context and circumstances with which congress might have justified past intervention is now gone with the elimination of the direct federal payment federal taxpayer funds are no longer involved we should therefore no longer concern ourselves with the actions of one local jurisdiction unless what we choose to do with it is applied equally to all jurisdictions if a majority in congress can accept the laborhhs restriction on abortion as a cormpromise then this congress should accept similar language restricting just the use of federal funds on these social riders i was pleased to see that a majority of thefull committee shared this perspective and approved two amendments that will permit the district to use nonfederal funds to count the ballots on its referendum on the medicinal use of marijuana and revive its needle exchange program i should also note that the white house opposes these social riders as well the white house strongly opposes the prohibition on the use of both federal and local funds to provide abortion services objects to a provision prohibiting the use of federal or local funds to implement or enforce the districts health care benefits expansion act domestic partners act strongly objects to the limit on attorneys fees in special education cases and strongly opposes and may veto any bill that includes a prohibition on the use of local funds for needle exchange programs i encourage the house to respect the districts right to pursue its own prerogatives with its own funds regardless of how members might feel about the merits of the specific local initiative we should refrain from imposing any additional restrictions on the districts use of its own funds and support possible floor amendments that seek to remove those restrictions that still remain now the gentlewoman from the district of columbia is absolutely right and i just want to reiterate her comments the amendment of the gentleman from california was intended to do the right thing for the children of the district of columbia tobacco usage is wrong it is harmful and we want to work with him to reduce the amount of tobacco smoking on the part of youth particularly given the fact that almost 3 000 children start smoking teenagers every day and about a thousand of them are going to die as a result so we had no objection to the good intentions on the part of the gentleman from california the only problem is the appropriateness of that kind of legislation that normally is considered by the committee on the judiciary and in other manners other than the committee on appropriations but again we thank him for his amendment we particularly thank him for withdrawing it at this time and we certainly want to work with him in other constructive approaches to reduce the amount of tobacco usage in the district"], [0.499203085899353, 0.500796914100647, 1, "i rise in strong support of the conference report on s 2790 the water resources development act of 2000 the biennial authorization bill for programs and projects of the unitedstates army corps of engineers since the landmark water resources legislation of 1986 the former public works and transportation committee now renamed the transportation and infrastructure committee has worked to maintain a consistent twoyear authorization schedule for the corps it is critical to maintain this twoyear cycle to provide continuity to the program and certainly to the nonfederal local sponsors who support corps projects this biennial cycle also affords congress the opportunity to monitor and if necessary amend the workings of the corps program this conference report authorizes projects for the entirety of the corps civil works program it includes navigation flood control shoreline protection and environmental restoration and protection this bill both builds and rebuilds the nations infrastructure it will allow us to expand international trade through projects to improve our coastal ports and inland navigation system through flood control and hurricane and storm damage reduction measures it will help to meet critical needs to protect lives and property it is no secret that one of the issues that delayed house consideration of this bill until last month was the applicability of the davisbacon act to nonfederal contributions to federal projects of the corps i have always believed that davisbacon applies to all aspects of a federal public works project regardless of whether the corps is performing the work or a nonfederal sponsor is contributing the work the key element is that these have always been federal public works projects and davisbacon should apply i was surprised that the corps was not consistently applying the davisbacon wage protection provisions to the nonfederal contribution for corps projects i was prepared to offer legislative language to the bill to rectify this situationensuring that the corps would apply davisbacon act protections to all aspects of its program i am pleased to say that such legislative action is no longer necessary following numerous meetings with the corps the department of the army and the department of labor there is agreement within the administration that my view of the applicability of the davisbacon act is the correct one the davisbacon act wage provisions apply to nonfederal contributions to federal corps of engineers projects it applies regardless of whether the nonfederal contribution is in cash or inkind work for which credit or reimbursement is sought i appreciate the administration working with me to make sure that the protections of the davisbacon statute are provided to all workers on all federal public works this bill contains an important tribute to our late colleague and my friend bruce vento this bill will rename a portion of the boundary water canoe area wilderness in my district as the bruce vento unit of the boundary waters canoe area wildemess bruce served people of his district nobly with dignity with passion and with purpose he did the same for the nation particulariy in preserving and enhancing its parks and wilderness areas bruce has been credited with championing hundreds of bills into law that protect and preserve our precious natural resources i believe that it is most appropriate that one of those precious resources in our home state of minnesota bears his name in perpetuity and i am proud that this tribute will be in my congressional district local newspapers have devoted a lot of time and effort over the past nine months to criticizing the corps but the corps is a proud institution with a long history it deserves our praise and respect let me share some of its history with my colleagues first i welcome the opportunity to pay tribute to the organization frequently mentioned in debate here but whose accomplishments are almost never discussed the corps of engineers the corps celebrates its 225th birthday this year during those years it has established itself as the nations oldest largest and most experienced government organization in the area of water and related land engineering matters it has provided extraordinary competent lifesaving economic development enhancing service to this country for two and a quarter centuries few people today know that the corps of engineers among its many responsibilities once had jurisdiction over yellowstone national park the corps managed yellowstone park for 30 years lieutenant dan kingman of the corps who would later become the chief engineers wrote the plan of development which i have submitted is given upon the supposition and in the earnest hope that it will be preserved as nearly as may be as the hand of nature left it a source of pleasure to all who visit and a source of wealth to no one a few years later john muir founder of the sierra club said the best service in forest protection almost the only efficient service is that rendered by the military for many years they have guarded the great yellowstone park and now they are guarding yosemite they found it a desert as far as underbrush grass and flowers are concerned but in two years the skin of the mountains is healthy again blessings on uncle sams soldiers as they have done the job well and every pine tree is waving its arms for joy another great american said the military engineers are taking upon their shoulders the job of making the mississippi river over again a job transcended in size only by the original job of creating it that was mark twain those statements together pay tribute to what the corps of engineers has done so admirably and the great legacy they have left for all americans protected in floods enhanced with river navigation programs and of immense importance to me by protecting the great resource of the great lakesonefifth of all the fresh water on the face of the earth the corps of engineers deserves recognition for all of these works and the great contribution it makes to the economic wellbeing and to the environmental enhancement of this country i find it ironic that even while some criticize the corps the central piece of this legislation is a project to invest nearly 8 billion in federal state and local funds for the greatest environmental restoration project ever conceived a project that has the support of the administration members of congress from both sides of the aisle the environmental community florida affected indian tribes local governments and the business community of south florida this critical project has not been entrusted to an agency incapable of carrying out its mission no the project has been entrusted to the only agency capable of carrying out the mission the everglades are dying from years of population growth and a corps project that works all too well in draining them while some criticize the existing corps project for having harmed the everglades it should be recalled that the current system of canals levees and pumps that redirect water from the everglades to the ocean was built with the support and encouragement of florida and local residents the project has provided the desired flood and hurricane protection as well as water supply for south florida unfortunately when the project was constructed no one envisioned the dire consequences for the everglades ecosystem the restoration project initiated in this bill will help restore the everglades by changing the plumbing of south florida to more closely resemble historical patterns and amounts today the everglades receive the wrong amount of water at the wrong times of the year the everglades restoration project when fully implemented will provide a more natural flow through the everglades and the everglades national park it will do so without diminishing flood and hurricane protection for south florida scores of individuals worked for many years to develop the comprehensive plan to restore the everglades for many their efforts have been acknowledged here and in the senate however i will compliment one individual who has worked tirelessly toward the everglades restoration project and whose name has not been mentioned on this floor mr gary hardesty of the corps of engineers headquarters office has given of himself above and beyond the call of duty to make the everglades restoration happen he coordinated the comprehensive everglades restoration plan was responsible for drafting the report of the chief of engineers wrote congressional testimony for numerous hearings and provided detailed and accurate information to the house and senate in the drafting of the bill as members of congress know well there are less visible individuals who make the work we do possible for the everglades mr hardesty is one of the individuals that made the everglades restoration possible he deserves the nations recognition and gratitude the conference report is not just the everglades and other projects it also includes a number of provisions to improve the operation of the corps program but i am disappointed that more of the program improvements contained in the house amendment were not acceptable to the senate in particular it is unfortunate that the conference report does not include house language to ensure that corps projects will successfully mitigate any adverse environmental impacts associated with its projects i intend to revisit this issue next congress the conference report expands the ability of nongovernmental entities to participate as nonfederal sponsors of projects this is particularly important for environmental restoration and improvement projects where local organizations are anxious to work with the corps to improve the environment this water resources bill is worthy of strong bipartisan support it is consistent wiht other water resources acts that congress has approved overwhelmingly over the past 15 years we should give this conference report that same overwhelming support today i urge all members to support the conference report on s 2796 the water resources development act of 2000"]],

policies and practices used by the united nations population fund the united states cannot give taxpayer money to an organization that is intricately involved with human rights abuses that are taking place in china and other places around the world i wish to read the words of a woman who worked to enforce chinas population program mrs gao was the administrator at the fujian province planned birth office from 1984 to 1988 these are her own words before the subcommittee on international operations and human rights of the committee on international relations my work at the planned birth office in cluded establishing a computer data bank of all the women of childbearing age in the town i also issued birthallowed certificates to women who meet the policy and regulations of the central and provincial planned birth committees and are therefore allowed to give birth to children should a woman be found pregnant without a certificate an abortion is performed immediately regardless of how many months pregnant she is this case about a miss chen liren who was a female resident of a village outside of yonghe town in 1996 she became pregnant in spite of the fact she was not married and did not have a certificate its a violation of the planned birth policy to become pregnant without a birthallowed certificate to avoid heavy monetary penalties and abortion she in order to save the childs life when she was 3 months pregnant left the town but when she was 9 months pregnant somebody informed on her the planned birth enforcement team of yonghe town began searching for her they were unable to find her so they tore down her husbands familys house and also threatened to also tear down the house of her parents one day when she was at her parents house the enforcement officials forced their way into the house they found her and immediately stuffed her into a car and escorted her to the municipality planned birth induced delivery center where the abortion was performed this is the document that we issue to people who have already given birth to a son its the birthnotallowed notices such notices are sent to the couple when the data concludes they do not meet the requirement of the policy and are not allowed to have any further children any couple who has already given birth to a son will receive this notice and such notices are made public the purpose of this is to make it known to everyone that the couple if they are having a second child is in violation of the policy therefore facilitating supervision of the couple we also issue control device inspection and pregnancy test notices according to the specific data on each woman every woman of childbearing age is notified that she has to have a contraceptive device reliability and pregnancy examinations when necessary should she fail to present herself in a timely manner for these examinations she will not only be forced to pay a fine but our supervision team will apprehend her and force her to have such an examination this is the document that we issue to women who must undergo sterilization or other birth control methods we also imposed monetary penalties on those who violated central and provincial regulations if they refused to pay the penalties our supervision team members would apprehend and detain them until they paid such fines we also analyze informant materials submitted in accordance with the informing system and then put these cases on file for investigation most planned birth offices in fujian provinces rural areas have their own detention facilities in our town the facility is right next door to my office it has one room for males and one room for females each with the capacity of about 25 to 30 people to catch violators our planned birth office does not need consent by the courts or judicial departments or the public security departments our actions are completely independent of them there are no paperwork formalities and there are no time limits associated with the detention detainees pay 8 rmb per day for food they are not allowed to make phone calls or mail letters the majority of the detainees are of course either women who are pregnant without birthallowed certificates or women who are to be sterilized or women who have been fined as i explained previously if we do not apprehend the women themselves we detain their family members such as a father a mother a sister brothers or their husband and we detain them until the women themselves come forward to be sterilized or to have an abortion i led my subordinates to yinglin town hospital to check on births i found two women in zhoukeng town had extraplan births i led a planned birth supervision team composed of a dozen cadres and public security agents with sledge hammers and heavy crowbars in hand we went to dismantle their houses we were unable to apprehend the women in the case so we took their mothers in lieu of them and detained them in the planned birth offices detention facility it wasnt until about half a month later that the women surrendered themselves to the planned birth office they were sterilized fined heavily and their mothers were finally released i myself did so many brutal things but i thought that i was conscientiously implementing the policy of our party and that i was an exemplary citizen and a good cadre once i found a woman who was 9 months pregnant but did not have a birthallowed certificate according to the policy she was forced to undergo an induced abortion in the operating room i saw the childs lips were moving and how its arms and legs were also moving the doctor injected poison into its skull and the child died and it was thrown into the trash can afterwards the husband was holding his wife and crying loudly and saying what kind of man am i what kind of husband am i i cant even protect my wife and child do you have any sort of humanity all of those 14 years i was a monster in the daytime injuring others by the chinese communist authorities barbaric planned birth policy but in the evening i was like all other women and mothers enjoying my life with my children i couldnt go on living with such a dual life any more it is also

0.5008599758148193, 0, "in my remaining time i want to gpeak a little bit about patient protection legislation we have been working on this issue for 5 years now back in 1995 when i first came to congress reports came out about how hmos were writing contracts that had gag clauses in them in which they basically said that before a physician could say to the patient what their treatment options were they first had to get an okay from the company now think about that for a minute let us say that a woman with a lump in her breast goes in to see her doctor the doctor takes her history examines her and knows that there are three treatment options for this lady but one of them may be more expensive than the other and because he has this gag rule written into his hmo contract he has to say excuse me maam leaves the room goes to a telephone gets on the phone dials a 1800 number and says mrs so and so has a lump in her breast she has three treatment options can i tell her about them i firmly believe that patient has the right to know all her treatment options and that an hmo should not censor her physician that is a blow right to the patient doctor relationship that should be outlawed so i wrote a bill in 1995 called the patient right to know act i went out and i obtained 285 bipartisan cosponsors and i could not get that bipartisan bill to the floor which would have passed with over 400 votes my leadership the republican leadership of this congress would not even allow a simple bill like that to come to the floor despite promises that they would so the next year came along and we wrote a more comprehensive bill because we also knew that in the meantime hmos were refusing to pay for emergency care let us say a patient has crushing chest pain we have just seen on tv that crushing chest pain can be a sign of a heart attack pass go go immediately to that emergency room because if one delays they could have a heart attack and die on the way the american heart association says that so people would have crushing chest pain break out in a sweat know that that ould be a heart attack they go to their emergency room they would have a test and some of the time it would not show a heart attack some of the time it would show severe inflammation of the esophagus or the stomach instead the ekg would be normal so expost facto the hmo would refuse to pay for that emergency room visit because you see the patient was not having a heart attack after all well when word of that type of treatment gets around people start to think twice about really whether they are going to go to the emergency room when they need to because after all they could be stuck with a bill is that fair is that just no but it is one of those ways that hmos have tried to cut down on care to increase their bottomline profits well we had hearings on patient protection legislation we had a hearing back in may 1996 4 years ago buried in the fourth panel at the end of a long day was testimony from a small nervous woman this was before the house committee on commerce by that time the reporters are gone the cameras are gone most of the original crowd had dispersed she should have been the first witness that day not the last she told about the choices that managed care companies and selfinsured plans are making every day when they determine what is known as medical necessity linda peeno had been a claims reviewer for several hmos i want to relate her testimony to my colleagues she began i wish to begin by making a public confession in the spring now this is a former claims reviewer medical reviewer for an hmo she said in the spring of 1987 i caused the death of a man although this was known to many people i have not been taken to any court of law or called to account for this in any professional or public forum in fact just the opposite occurred i was rewarded for this it brought me an improved reputation in my job it contributed to my advancement afterwards not only did i demonstrate that i could do what was expected of me i exemplified the good company employee i saved half a million dollars as she spoke a hush came over that room i think you may have been in the room when this lady testified the representatives of the trade associations who were there averted their eyes the audience shifted uncomfortably in their seats alarmed by her story her voice became husky and i could see tears in her eyes her anguish over harming patients as a managed care reviewer had caused that woman to come forth and to bear her soul she continued since that day i have lived with this act and many others eating into my heart and soul i was a professional charged with the care or healing of his or her fellow human beings the primary ethical norm is do no harm i did worse she said i caused the death instead of using a clumsy bloody weapon i used the simplest cleanest of tools my words this man died because i denied him a necessary operation to save his heart this medical reviewer continued i felt little pain or remorse at the time the mans faceless distance soothed my conscious like a skilled soldier i was trained for this moment when any qualms arose i was to remember i am not denying care i am only denying payment well by this time the trade association representatives were staring at the floor the congressmen who had spoken on behalf of the hmos were distinctly uncomfortable the staff several of whom became representatives of hmo trade associations were thanking god that this witness was at the end of the day her testimony continued at that time this helped me avoid any sense of responsibility for my decision now i am no longer willing to accept the escapist reasoning that allowed me to rationalize that action i accept my responsibility now for this mans death as well as for the immeasurable pain and suffering many other decisions of mine caused this is testimony from a medical reviewer for an hmo before congress in 1996 congress has dilly dallied for 4 years and has not done anything to fix this she then listed the many ways that managed care plans deny care to patients but she emphasized one particular issue the right to decide what care is medically necessary she said there is one last activity that i think deserves a special place on this list and this is what i call the smart bomb of cost containment and that is medical necessities denials even when medical criteria is used it is rarely developed in any kind of standard traditional clinical process it is rarely standardized across the field the criteria is rarely available for prior review by the physicians or members of the plan she says we have enough experience from history we have enough experience from history i think she was referring to world war ii to demonstrate the consequences of secretive unregulated systems that go awry after exposing her own transgressions she closed urging everyone in the room to examine their own conscience she closed by saying one can only wonder how much pain suffering and death will we have before we have the courage to change our course personally i have decided that even one death is too much for me at that point in time the room was stonecold quiet the chairman mumbled thank you well let me tell you about some of the reallife people that have been affected by hmo abuses it is important when we talk about the details the technical details of some of these bills that we remember that there are actually people involved with the consequences of hmo decisions it has now been about 4 years since a woman was hiking about 40 miles east of washington here she fell off a 40foot cliff she fractured her skull broke her arm had a fractured pelvis she was laying on the rocks at the base of a 40foot cliff close to a pond fortunately she did not fall into that her boyfriend who was hiking with her managed to get her lifeflighted to a hospital this was that young woman jackie lee being trundled up put on the helicopter she spent about a month in the icu she was really sick she had severe injuries she was on intravenous morphine for pain after she got out of the hospital her hmo refused to pay for her hospitalization why was it that her hmo would not pay well the initial answer was jackie had not phoned ahead for prior authorization she had not phoned ahead to let them know that she was going to fall off a cliff and be injured boy i would tell you you would need a real crystal ball to get care from that hmo or maybe when she was semicomatose lying at the base of that cliff she was supposed to with her nonbroken arm pull a cellular phone out of her pocket and phone a 1800 number and say hey guess what i fell off a 40foot cliff i need to go to the emergency room well then after she contested that then the hmo still refused to pay for her bill because they said well you were in the hospital for a while you did not phone us within the first few days that you were in the hospital her rejoinder was i was in the icu on a morphine drip i guess it did not enter my mind that is one of the examples that we are dealing with under the bill that passed the house of representatives a couple of months ago this woman would be taken care of because we have a provision in that bill that says that if one needs to go to the emergency room and if a layperson would agree that this is an emergency would anyone not agree that that is an emergency if a layperson would agree that that is an emergency then that hmo is obligated to pay the bill we passed that provision for medicare patients we still have not done anything for all of the people in this country well what about hmos like this medical reviewer talking about making determinations of medical necessity that are contrary to what ones own doctor or physician consultant would give this woman was featured on the cover of time magazine several years ago she had cancer her doctor and her consultants all recommended a type of treatment her hmo denied it there was no specific exclusion of coverage for that type of treatment or contract but under federal law her hmo can define medical necessity in any way theywant to if one gets ones insurance from ones employer does ones state insurance commissioner have any say in that no congress took that away from state insurance commissioners 25 years ago under current law hmos that make decisions medical necessity decisions through employer plans can define medical necessity any way they want even though this womans doctors all recommended that she have this treatment that could have saved her life they said no and she died let me tell my colleagues about another type of medical decision that an hmo made 5 or 6 years ago about 3 00 in the morning lamona adams was taking care of little jimmy when he was 6 months old he had a temperature of about 104 105 and he was pretty sick she looked at him and she talked to her husband and they thought he needed to go to the emergency room so they were good hmo clients they phoned that 1800 hmo number they got somebody 1 000 miles away who knew nothing about the atlanta georgia area where they lived the person said yes i will authorize you to go to an emergency but you can only go to this one emergency room little jimmys mother said well where is it thbe voice at the end of that 1800 line said well i do not know find a map so at 3 30 in the morning mom and dad wrapped up little jimmy got into the car there is a severe storm outside they start their trek to this authorized hospital which is about 70 miles away 70 70 miles away they live clear on the south side of atlanta and this authorized hospital is on the north side so they have to go through all of metropolitan traffic on their way about halfway there they passed three emergency rooms that they should have been able to stop at but they were not medical professionals they knew he was sick but they did not know how sick they knew if they stopped at one of those unauthorized hospitals that the hmo would not pay and this could be really expensive unfortunately before they got to the authorized hospital jimmys eyes rolled back in his head he stopped breathing and he had a cardiac arrest so imagine dad driving like crazy mom trying to keep her little baby alive they finally pull into the emergency room mom grabs her baby jumps out of the car screaming save my baby save my baby a nurse comes out gives him mouthtomouth resuscitation they start the ivs theygive him medicines and they save his life but they do not save all of this little baby because of his cardiac arrest his decreased circulation he ends up with loss of circulation in his hands and his feet and gangrene sets in both his hands and both his feet have to be amputated here is james after his hmo treatment without his hands and without his feet i brought him to the floor of congress when we had our debate he can put on his leg prostheses with his arm stumps and he gets around pretty good and he is a great kid he will take a pencil and he will hold it with his stumps and he can draw and write like that but i would submit to my colleagues that this little boy will never play basketball or sports this little boy when he grows up will never be able to caress the cheek of the woman he loves with his hand do you know that under federal law the hmo which made that medical determination that he had to go to that hospital that caused this to happen is liable for the cost of his amputations if he died then they would not have been liable for anything is that justice is that fair is that the type of system we ought to have that covers 75 percent of the people in this country who receive their insurance from their employer i think not let me give you another example of the problem with hmos being able to determine medical necessity in any way that they want here is a little baby born with a defect the type of which i fix this is a cleft lip and a cleft palate it is a birth defect this is not a quote cosmetic defect this is a functional defect this little boy when he eats has food come out of his nose this little boy because he does not have a roof of his mouth or a palate will never be able to learn to speak normally so what is the standard treatment for this surgical correction we can go a long ways towards making these kids whole again and able to go out in public and able to speak and able to eat normally by a surgical correction of their palate you know what there are some hmos that are defining medical necessity as the cheapest least expensive care the cheapest least expensive care you may say in this age of cost containment what is wrong with that i will tell you what is wrong with that the standard of care for this little baby born with this birth defect is surgical correction of his palate using his own tissues so that he is able to eat and speak normally under that bizarre definition of an hmo they can give his parents a little piece of plastic to shove up in the roof of his mouth what is called an obturator a plastic obturator it would be like an upper denture yes that would keep food some of the time from going up his nose he might be able to garble out some type of speech but you know what it would not be an optimal result under federal law as it currently exists today that hmo can put that definition into their health plans something in the fine print that none of you would ever know about they could totally justify this and you would have no recourse other than maybe going to your newspaper and exposing them that is wrong this house passed by a vote of 275 to 151 a strong patient protection piece of legislation called the bipartisan consensus managed care act the gentleman from georgia a very conservative republican and i and the gentleman from michigan wrote that bill we have had two motions to instruct for our conferees on this managed care patient reform bill to follow the house bill this house voted on the senate bill which is a donothing fig leaf bill where the fine print is worse than the status quo this house voted on that you know what this house voted by a vote of 145 for the senate bill to 284 against the senate bill we have a chairman of this conference who says we are going to stick to that senate bill we can do better we can do better for this little baby we can do better for james adams we can do better for this lady and her family we can do better for a woman who falls off a 40foot cliff and is told by her hmo sorry you did not notify us before your fall we have waited on this legislation too long it is time to fix it the president has said put that bipartisan consensus managed care reform act the one that passed this house with 275 votes put it on my desk and i will sign it we should do that tomorrow because i can guarantee you there are people out there at this very moment that are being harmed by hmos that are being denied necessary medical care who may lose their hands and feet or their life because of arbitrary decisions i call upon members of both side of the aisle to work hard to bring a real patient protection bill out of conference to this floor and put it on the presidents desk if the conference brings back that urisatisfactory senate bill then i am just afraid we are all going to say no let us fix this problem and let us fix it now people need their care"], [0.5008132457733154, 0.5008132457733154, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume the visa waiver pilot

set up under the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 to collect information on alien postsecondary students and exchange visitors in 1995 the immigration and naturalization service issued a report which found that americans have a fundamental basic expectation that their government is effectively monitoring and controlling foreign students because there have been high profile instances where terrorists and criminal aliens have been linked to student visas there is a growing degree of public concern about this issue section 641 of iirira required the implementation first as a pilot program of a system which would collect electronically information from schools on foreign students including identity and address current academic status and any disciplinary action taken by a school against a student as a result of the commission of a crime the system is soon to go into effect nationwide this bill clarifies that the fee funding this program shall be collected by the attorney general prior to the issuance of a visa and not by the institution of higher education or exchange visitor program when the alien registers or first commences activities in addition the bill provides that aliens subject to the program who are admitted under j exchange visas as au pairs camp counselors or participants in summer work travel programs shall pay a fee of no more than 40 finally the bill provides that employers utilizing the h1b program do not have to file amended petitions for alien workers as a result of their being involved in corporate

thank my friend and colleague the gentleman from colorado for yielding me time and i appreciate his giving me the opportunity tonight to be able to make some comments of my own on such an important subject but first i want to thank him for his giving the attention to such a complex sensitive and yet important subject that it deserves and also thank the gentleman from colorado for his expertise and for his knowledge of immigration which i think provides a great contribution to those of us here in the house who certainly can benefit from his personal knowledge firsthand knowledge of immigration as it impacts his state of colorado i would like to call the attention of my colleagues to the destructive effect of our current immigration policy it is having a destructive impact on recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens and also how a more enlightened immigration policy would benefit american minorities and in fact the overall american economy each year close to 900 000 legal immigrants enter the united states of these about 300 000 have less than a high school education and their competition forscarce jobs does have a destructive impact on the opportunity of american workers with no more than a high school diploma who are disproportionately and unfortunately recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens among reports of a growing prospering economy are other more troubling reports on a growing gap between the welltodo and the working poor the national unemployment rate is about 4 percent where for those with less than a high school education it is more than twice as high over 8 percent in many cities where there are high recent immigrant populations the unemployment rates are in double digits for those with less education where is opportunity for these individuals and their families numerous polls indicate that black and hispanic americans know this only too well this is no surprise given that they are hurt disproportionately by our immigration policy today we cannot pretend that the adverse impact of mass immigration on minorities does not exist we can and should find solutions to protect the jobs and wages of recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens how often do we read about the longterm unemployed or the working poor or single mothers with no mention of the serious impact of immigration on their employment wages and working conditions how often do we hear comments about the growing gap between the welltodo and the working poor that do not mention that almost half the relative decline in wages of those who do not finish high school is caused in fact by competition from immigration think of a single mother barely surviving in a minimum wage job who sees her annual wages depressed by 2 000 because she must compete with more and more unskilled immigrants she very well might be a recent immigrant herself seeking a better life for herself and her children or she might be able to trace her roots in this country back generations and is simply seeking the american dream that has been denied her ancestors think what she can do for herself and her children with that lost money buy a used car so she does not have to take a bus to work put a down payment on a modest home or even fix the furnace before winter comes worse think what would happen if she actually loses her job because of the neverending competition from new arrivals it is certainly not the immigrants themselves who are to blame and who understandably want to come to america it is our immigration policy that is to blame but who knows how many people have been hurt by the unintended consequences of our outdated immigration policy a series of recent studies have all documented the effects of immigration policy on lowskilled american workers and recent immigrants the national research council of the national academy of sciences concludes that immigration was responsible for about 44 percent of the total decline in relative wages of high school dropouts between 1980 and 1994 the rand corporation reports that in california the widening gap between the number of jobs available for noncollegeeducated workers and the increasing number of new noncollegeeducated immigrants signals growing competition for jobs and hence a further decline in the relative earnings at the low end of the labor market the unitedstates commission on immigration reform chaired by congresswoman barbara jordan finds that immigration of unskilled immigrants comes at a cost to unskilled unitedstates workers the hudson institute states that unitedstates immigration policy serves primarily to increase the number of unitedstates residents who lack even a high school degree america must stop recruiting workers for jobs that do not exist or exist only at the lowest wages the brookings institute published a paper concluding that immigration has had a marked adverse impact on the economic status of the least skilled unitedstates workers the center for immigration studies calculates that immigration may reduce the wages of the average native in a lowskilled occupation by over 1 900 a year cis also found that the poverty rate for persons living in immigrant households of 1997 was 22 percent almost double the 12 percent rate for persons in native households it concluded that reducing the flow of less skilled immigrants who enter each year would have the desirable effect of reducing job competition between more established immigrants and new arrivals for lowwage jobs reducing the supply of this kind of labor would create upward pressure on wages and benefits for the working poor including immigrants already in the country over time this should reduce poverty among immigrants who work these studies reinforce what common sense already tells us in addition add three other facts together first immigrants will account for half of the increase in the workforce in the 1990s second the skilled level of immigrants relative to americans has been declining for years thirtyfive percent of immigrant workers who have arrived since 1990 do not have a high school education compared to only 9 percent of nativeborn workers some 300 000 illegal immigrants without high school educations arrived last year and will total 3 million this decade third close to 90 percent of all future jobs in america will require more than a high school education the mismatch is clear nearly half of all immigrants today are not prepared for the jobs of the future current immigration policy has many americans and recent immigrants competing with hundreds of thousands of newcomers without high school degrees for a fixed number of lowskilled jobs this is a recipe for disaster for millions of bluecollar workers and their families no one should complain about the plight of the working poor or the persistence of minority unemployment or the levels of income inequality in america without acknowledging the unintended consequences of our present immigration policy of course immigration is neither all good nor all bad immigrants benefit america in many ways but we should design our immigration policies so that it enhances rather than diminishes opportunity for american workers we should protect the jobs of working americans and we can make a better life for all americans wherever they were born just as american minorities would benefit from a reduced number of lowskilled immigrants the american economy and american firms trying to prosper in this era of global competition would benefit enormously from an increased flow of more educated immigrants american industry is pleading for more skilled and educated workers the chairman of the national association of manufacturers recently stated that the shortage of skilled employees is not a distant threat anymore the skills gap is now catching up to us and could threaten the amazing growth and productivity gains of the past decade finding an adequate supply of qualified employees is the number one issue for american industry today nam found that 88 percent of manufacturers are experiencing a shortage of qualified workers 60 percent find that current workers lack basic math skills and that 55 percent find serious deficiencies in workers basic writing and comprehension skills these problems can be solved with more educated workers and because immigration accounts for such a high percentage of workforce growth almost onehalf an emphasis on more educated immigrants would be an important part of the solution the result would be a more productive american economy and more productive american businesses as the productivity of the american economy increases so will the prosperity of all americans american citizens and legal residents will benefit in another way from more educated immigrants to borrow a line from a new book by george borjas skilled immigrants earn more pay higher taxes and require fewer social services than less skilled immigrants the national academy of sciences states that over his or her lifetime each immigrant with less than a high school education will cost american taxpayers 89 000 that is the government benefits consumed by each immigrant will exceed taxes they paid by 89 000 to citizens concerned about how we are to rebuild our schools and protect and preserve social security in the next century these numbers should set off alarms more than 300 000 immigrant workers with less than a high school education entering our country this year will require 27 billion more in government services and benefits than they will contribute in taxes that is 27 billion for example that will not be available to rebuild our schools and protect and preserve social security and medicare next year another 300 000plus immigrants will enter the country with less than a high school education over their lifetimes they will claim another 27 billion that could provide education and training to recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens who have less than a high school education and who are disadvantaged in our economy common sense tells us that we should align our immigration policy with the needs of america the economy is crying out for more educated workers and one of the easiest and most costfree ways of providing these workers is through immigration reform doing so would mean more economic opportunity for all americans now i am happy to yield back to the gentleman from colorado"], [0.5007981061935425, 0.5007981061935425, 0, "i rise reluctantly to express my opposition to the teacher empowermeni act although h r 1995 does provide more flexibility to states than the current system or the administrations proposal it comes at the expense of increasing federal spending on education the congressional budget office cbo estimates that if congress appropriates the full amount authorized in the bill additional outlays would be 83 million in fiscal year 2000 and 6 9 billion over five years h r 1995 is not entirely without merit the most important feature of the bill is the provision forbidding the use of federal funds for mandatory national teacher testing or teacher certification national teacher testing or national teacher certification will inevitably lead to a national curriculum national teacher certification will allow the federal government to determine what wouldbe teachers need to know in order to practice their chosen profession teacher education will revolve around preparing teachers to pass the national test or to receive a national certificate new teachers will then base their lesson plans on what they needed to know in order to receive their education departmentapproved teaching certificate therefore all those who oppose a national curriculum should oppose national teacher testing i commend chairman goodling and chairman mckeon for their continued commitment to fighting a national curriculum furthermore this bill provides increased ability for state and local governments to determine how best to use federal funds however no one should confuse this with true federalism or even a repudiation of the modern view of state and local governments as administrative agencies of the federal government after all the very existence of a federal program designed to help states train teachers limits a states ability to set education priorities since every dollar taken in federal taxes to fund federal teacher training programs is a dollar a state cannot use to purchase new textbooks or computers for students this bill also dictates how much money the states may keep versus how much must be sent to the local level and limits the state governments use of the funds to activities approved by congress in order to receive any funds under this act states must further entrench the federal bureaucracy by applying to the department of education and describing how local school districts will use the funds in accordance with federal mandates they must grovel for funds while describing how they will measure student achievement and teacher quality how they will coordinate professional development activities with other programs and how they will encourage the development of proven innovative strategies to improve professional developmenti wonder how much funding a state would receive if their innovative strategy did not meet the approval of the education department i have no doubt that state governments local school districts and individual citizens could design a less burdensome procedure to support teacher quality initiatives if the federal government would only abide by its constitutional limits use of the funds by local school districts is also limited by the federal government for example local schools districts must use a portion of each grant to reduce class size unless it can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the statethat it needs the money to fund other priorities this provision illustrates how this bill offends not just constitutional procedure but also sound education practice after all the needs of a given school system are best determined by the parents administrators community leaders and yes teachers closest to the studentsnot by state or federal bureaucrats yet this bill continues to allow distant bureaucrats to oversee the decisions of local education officials furthermore this bill requires localities to use a certain percentage of their funds to meet the professional development needs of math and science teachers as an obgyn i certainly understand the need for quality math and science teachers however for congress to require local education agencies to devote a disproportionate share of resources to one particular group of teachers is a form of central planningdirecting resources into those areas valued by the central planners regardless of the diverse needs of the people not every school district in the country has the same demand for math and science teachers there may be some local school districts that want to devote more resources to english teachers or foreign language instructors some local schools districts may even want to devote their resources to provide quality history and civics teachers so they will not produce another generation of constitutionallyilliterate politicians in order to receive funding under this bill states must provide certain guarantees that the states use of the money will result in improvement in the quality of the states education system requiring such guarantees assumes that the proper role for the federal government is to act as overseer of the states and localities to ensure they provide children with a quality education there are several flaws in this assumption first of all the 10th amendment to the united states constitution prohibits the federal government from exer4 cising any control over education thus the federal government has no legitimate authority to take money from the american people and use that money in order to bribe states to adopt certain programs that congress and the federal bureaucracy believes will improve education the prohibition in the 10th amendmentis absolute it makes no exception for federal education programs that allow the states flexibility in addition to violating the constitution making states accountable in any way to the federal government for school performance is counterproductive the quality of american education has declined as federal control has increased and for a very good reason as mentioned above decentralized education systems are much more effective then centralized education systems therefore the best way to ensure a quality education system is through dismantling the washingtondcbased bureaucracy and making schools more accountable to parents and students in order to put the american people back in charge of education i have introduced the family education freedom act which provides parents with a 3 000 tax credit for k12 education expenses and the education improvement tax cut act which provides all citizens with a 3 000 tax credit for contributions to k12 scholarships and for cash or inkind donations to schools i have also introduced the teacher tax cut act which encourages good people to enter and remain in the teaching profession by providing teachers with a 1 000 tax credit by returning control of the education dollar to parents and concerned citizens my education package does more to improve education quality than any other proposal in congress the teacher empowerment act not only continues the federal control of education in violation of the constitution and sound education principles but it does so at increased spending levels i therefore urge my colleagues to reject the approach of this bill and instead join me in working to eliminate the federal education bureaucracy cut taxes and thus return control over education to americas parents teachers and students"], [0.500792920589447,

article delineated the department of defense policy regarding the fate of these valiant dogs after completion of service to their country i learned that military working dogs remain in their assigned unit until they are 8 to 10 years old unfortunately as the situation currently stands there is no easy solution for these loyal dogs after their body is no longer able to sustain the workload of their mission at this point the future becomes bleak in a bestcase scenario the dogs are sent back to lackland air force base their original training school where they are used to instruct their human counterparts to become handlers after they have served this final duty they are kenneled for an undetermined amount of time and then put down in some instances military working dogs are caged as long as a year until they meet their final outcome equally as sad if no kennel space is available the less fortunate are terminated directly upon arrival to lackland after learning about the bleak future of military working dogs not only did i become concerned for their final treatment but i was also troubled by the fact that they were robbed of a quiet retirement why simply because the dod policy prohibits the adoption of retired military dogs even by their handlers my colleagues may be familiar with the plight of robby a professional military working dog as an 11yearold belgian malinois he is no longer deployable suffering from missing teeth and arthritis his ability to work at full capacity has been hindered common sense would say that robby could now retreat to a quiet existence on the contrary robby is to report to lackland air force base for one final deployment sadly he will be caged and eventually euthanized last week i had the opportunity to meet robby i was able to pet robby through the cage when i initially arrived as a 3time pentagon champion his body is showing the wear of a full military career it was obvious to me that robby is a dog who has faithfully served his country however now his physical body is failing to the point that he is hardly able to perform minimal responsibility necessary for completing his mission it was also obvious to me that robby has a special bond with his handler understandably so as the two spent several years working side by side the level of trust maintained between the two while in the line of duty is still present today robbys handler would like to spare his life through an adoption by either himself or another handler however the dod would not allow it in light of seeing robby and his handler together i feel that dods prohibition on handler adoption is pointlessly tragic i feel despite the dogs deteriorating health he could still have the opportunity to experience the comforts and joys of normal companionship disallowing a handler the option to adopt their canine partner runs contrary to normal logic why should military working dogs be kept from a calm existence upon retirement when the only other alternative is more work before a final death upon further research i learned that the 1949 federal property and administrative services act enacted after world war ii reclassified military working dogs as equipment according to the military mentality any piece of equipment no longer operable becomes a hardship to the unit and must be disposed of in 1997 the federal property and administrative services act was amended at that time the act was altered to permit federal dog handlers such as those in the drug enforcement administration to adopt their aging canine partners oddly enough the department of defense canine partners were the only federal canine group not to be included in the modification again i ask the question why are these worthy canines any less deserving than people of living out the remainder of their days than other federal working dogs clearly not the bill i bring before the house today h r 5314 makes the adoption of a retired military working dog a reality for the handler i have labored hard to ensure that the language was constructed at the best vantage point for all parties involved the decision to allow a handler to adopt their partner rests on the shoulders of those who know the dog best the dogs last unit commander and the last unit veteinarian made on a dogbydog basis the commander and veterinarian are obligated to give their consent before the adoption process can move forward furthermore h r 5314 provides an additional safeguard at the federal level upon receipt of the dog the adopt handler waives all liability against the federal government h r 5314 will effectively accomplish two goals it offers the dod a solution to their dilemma of maintaining aging canines and lifts the restriction that prohibits the adoption of military working dogs former dog handlers individuals with comparable experience or law enforcement agencies will be able to provide a loving home for such deserving animals through the passage of this legislation not only will the military working dog be taken from caged status but also the dog will be given the opportunity for a positive home environment i know my colleagues will agree that after a lifetime of service there could be no better reward for both dog and handler in closing h r 5314 has been endorsed by the humane society of the united states the american veterinary medical association the society for animal protective legislation the doris day animal rights league and the american society of the prevention of cruelty to animals please join me in passing this positive

6ritical firwt step in reconciling our iegq stem wth modern day te 14e sigl bill is essential to fostering the continued growth of electronic commerce that is propelling americas economy and our prosperity in the information age electronic commerce has been growing at a tremendous pace with the number of americans with access to the internet increasing nearly 900 percent since early 1993 in 1998 electronic commerce generated more than 300 billion in unitedstates revenue and was responsible for over 1 2 billion jobs as of 1998 one estimate places the dollar volume of businesstobusiness electronic commerce in 1998 at 27 4 billion and the projected volume for 1999 is 64 8 billion those numbers are expected to quadruple in the next 2 years alone consumer online sales have reached more than 7 billion this year and are expected to exceed 40 billion by2002 if the trend continues it is likely these predictions are conservative the need for legal certainty and uniformity of laws is compelling if we are to encourage the continued growth of electronic commerce one of the biggest barriers to the explosion of electronic commerce as the marketplace of the 21st century is the lack of certainty surrounding the legal acceptance of electronic signatures used in conducting online contracts or agreements with the internet as the communications network of the future increasing its use depends on developing and retaining consumer and business confidence in this unique problem although 44 states have already enacted legislation that would recognize digital signatures the differences among these states and the lack of legislation in others are an impediment to the growth of ecommerce because many parties are unwilling to risk entering into contracts on line without the certainty that those signatures are legally binding nationally h r 1714 establishes a single standard for the acceptance of electronic signatures and records and will give both businesses and consumers the same confidence in the legal validity of an online agreement that they have today in a written binding agreement signed by two or more contracting parties another critical feature of this legis lation is the balance it strikes between encouraging growth in electronic commerce and minimizing the role that the federal government plays in the marketplace in addition to the gap this measure fills in establishing a uniform standard what is equally important is that this legislation does not entrench specific electronic signature technologies by dictating what methodi will be used for verifying and validating digital signatures and records instead the esign bill allows the parties to set their own procedures for using electronic signatures and electronic records in interstate commerce as a result when the future brings new technologies it will be the marketplace not government regulations that drives the development of those that succeed a vote for this legislation is a vote for technology and a vote for ensuring the evolution of internet commerce and the vitality of the american economy for this reason i urge my colleagues to support the legislation i wantto take a second if i can to respond to some of the charges coming from the other side that this legislation contains anticonsumer provisions i have heard that this preempts existing consumer protection laws i have heard that this legislation will force consumers into electronic transactions i have heard this will discriminate against consumers that do not have computer access these claims are false first consumers are absolutely free to choose or not choose to enter into electronic transactions this bill clearly states that nothing requires any party to use or accept electronic records or electronic signatures this bill simply offers consumers the option by mutual consent to use electronic transactions should both parties determine that to be their preference if a consumer does choose to conduct an online transaction that consumer is protected by the underlying federal or state laws governing that transaction if a state law requires that a notice or disclosure be made in writing then those traditional writings must continue to be delivered from the consumer nothing in this bill will nullify such existing state consumer protection laws for example if a law requires that a consumer be provided a copy of a warranty when purchasing an appliance that consumer has to receive a copy of that warranty whether that consumer is at a shopping mall or on line this bill does absolutely nothing to alter this longestablished principle however before a consumer can receive an electronic copy of a warranty a consumer has to separately and affirmatively consent to receive that document electronically that is a consumer specifically must approve of receiving electronic documents in that portion of a contract or agreement telling the consumer that documents he or she should receive electronically may not be buried in the fine print if the consumer wants to receive a traditional paper warranty he is absolutely entitled to under this rule and under this bill but if a donsumer consents to receive such documents electronically as i think many of my constituents would like todo that does not mean that they may never return to receiving paper documents should they so wish a consumer could withdraw tge consent to electronic documents at any time there are two main subsections in the consent portion of the bill that explicitly constitute a consumers assent in the bill one of these critical subsections mandates that once the consumer withdrawals his consent to receive documents electronically the materials must be delivered in the traditional paper writing finally h r 1714 requires that electronically delivered documents must accurately reflect the information agreed to at the time of the transaction in addition any electronic copy of a contract or documefit must be able to be printed or saved for future use by a consumer in sum the allegations that h r 1714 contains anticonsumer ideas are unfounded we have worked very hard throughout the process to reach consensus with both sides of the aisle and are confident that this bill represents a solid balance between protecting consumers and entering into agreements in the electronic arena it is vitally important for consumers to have safety security and privacy in their online transactions if consumers do not feel comfortable using this new technology they will abandon it i believe that the consumer provisions of h r 1714 will help consumers to feel comfortable when conducting online transactions they will have the information they need to make an informed decision and they will have the right to accept if they so choose important documentation in electronic format i urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation that will help to promote the growth of electronic commerce and at the

to thank the gentlewoman from connecticut and the gentleman from maryland mr cardin for asking me to come to the floor to speak on this issue mrs jackie ashby a constituent from my district wrote the following letter which best expressed the need for change she originally wrote in support of h r 671 however her comments are just as applicable to 102 miss ashby is a social worker in my district she writes dear representative tubbsjones it has come to my attention that the house resolution is being debated concerning abused and neglected children who are aging out of foster care i would strongly urge you to support this bill i work in an independent living program in cleveland the children i work with are 18 years old and are exactly the children for whom this resolution is aimed i know from firsthand experience that these kids need your help ten years ago i kept watching children leave our residential center or even our group home to the street because they had nowhere else to turn once they turned 18 they were too old for the child welfare system to take care of them anymore and they were unprepared to manage job school bills relationships drugs sex and all the other things that go with adult life they ended up back with the same parents who abused or neglected them or in relationships that mirrored those poor parental relationships often this resulted in them becoming homeless abusing drugs or becoming either victims or perpetrators of crime there were many good programs out there and my agency gave me the freedom to look at these programs and find a model that worked for these kids and start it five years ago three staff and myself began the independent living program we had our share of troubles the scenarios above still happen for some kids but i can tell you more kids now graduate from high school more kids than before learn what it takes to be a good worker and how to keep a job and more kids know that they can never go home at least not to stay again and they do have other choices the sad thing is that sometimes all those revelations happen after they have been kicked out of the childrens welfare system being homeless jobless or overcome by drug abuse are powerful lessons that many kids could be helped with when they ask for it but the system doesnt allow for reentry into the childrens system once they are 18 the adult system here in cleveland although better than most doesnt cater to the specific problems of young adults consequently young people who are belligerent present poorly and are reluctant to follow through without a good deal of followup by the case manager wont get services let me give you an example linda spent her whole life in foster care from foster care home to foster care home even a failed adoption all she wanted was to be able to live with her mother for whom she knew was parenting her other three siblings reunification was tried and failed one home after another couldnt tolerate her belligerent attitude skipping school and her sexual acting out out of frustration certainly not because she was mature enough the child protection worker recommended an independent living program linda loves the idea finally she has a home of her own and for the first month of the program she does wonderfully she is compliant eager to learn and has made a nice connection with the staff school starts to fall apart she was behind in school so now she starts cutting classes she has allnight parties with all her friends in her apartment and now her counselor thinks she is using marijuana the program tries intervention after intervention linda states she wants out out of the system and out on her own her wish gets granted mostly because there are so few services to offer an adult who is unwilling to comply with basic rules so linda goes back with mom which is where she always wanted to be but lindas fantasy of having mom waiting at the door with open arms is quickly dashed by the reality of a mom who now has other children to attend linda and mom never worked out the problems of the past so the past repeats itself and linda at some point either leaves moms house or gets kicked out linda now ends up either going from friends house to friends house if she is lucky to have friends or on the street now linda is calling the program back saying gee i learned my lesson you were all right all along take me back ill be better and the social worker says sorry we would love to have you back i really believe you have learned your lesson but youre not a kid any more youre an ablebodied adult and you should get yourself a job and make a life for yourself after reading this you might say tough love is the best medicine and for some a good dose is but how many 18 years old do you know who have had sometimes 20 caregivers over the course of their young life and who have to decide where they are going to live how they are going to support themselves what theyre going to do without anyones support all by their 18th birthday it is tough when you have no one to rely on this kind of funding that the house resolution offers is a chance to give a child like linda help at a time when she can really use it the letter goes on but i think it specifically states what we are all talking about here on the floor she says i have 20 more stories like this her words can better express based on her

officers at all levels of government the selection process established by h r 46 is simple and inexpensive the bill creates a permanent medal of valor review board comprised of 11 members serving 4year terms who shall review and select recipients of the award each year the board members must be individuals who have knowledge or expertise in the field of public safety the board is not required to chose any names in a given year but may select up to six recipients annually the legislation also establishes a national medal office within the department of justice which will establish criteria and procedures for the submission of names of nominees from the law enforcement community and the public the national medal office will staff the medal of honor review board the congressional budget office has reviewed h r 46 and estimates that full implementation of the legislation would cost only about 250 000 annually i believe this is a very small price for the federal government to pay to express its gratitude for our nations most heroic public safety officers and to set the example nationally that we need to set to encourage those who perform such acts i also want to note that this legislation will not displace the medal of honor as our countrys most significant award americas entire system of medals and awards which has become known as the pyramid of honor was established by an act of congress in 1918 that act was passed to protect the integrity of the national medal of honor but it had the farreaching effect of establishing degrees of distinguished service and clearly delineating the type of deed necessary for the awarding of a medal h r 46 is patterned after the medal of honor but it will not disrupt its place at the top of the pyramid finally h r 46 requires the attorney general to consult with the institute of heraldry an office housed within the departmentof defense which designs and creates medals and ribbons the staff at the institute of heraldry puts great thought into every aspect of a medal and every color and detail is significant to avoid overlapping with a previously established medal the attorney general is required to consult with the institute we can never fully know what inspires a person to commit an act of bravery even to risk his or her own life to save the life of a stranger congress must however find significant and positive ways to express our thanks and to encourage such acts i believe that creation of this medal is one way to recognize the frequent and too often unsung acts of valor committed by public safety officers this legislation is supported by nearly every national law enforcement association including the fraternal order of police the national association of police organizations the international brotherhood of police officers the national troopers coalition and the law enforcement alliance of america i want to thank the ranking member of the subcommittee on crime the gentleman from virginia for his support in this legislation and his cooperation in quickly moving the bill to the floor i look forward to working with my friend from virginia this congress to find common ground in the battle against crime i also want to thank nicole nason on the subcommittee staff for her hard work on this bill nicole is leaving the subcommittee and we will certainly miss her service we wish to thank her

the forgotten war that is what many of our korean war veterans think about their service in korea and the korean era and yet there are so many names in the korean war that are permanently installed in the american lexicon such names as inchon the 38th parallel heartbreak ridge pork chop hill how is it that we have come to forever remember the places of war but overlook the people that sacrificed and endured i would like to share a soldiers story and there are many stories that individuals can share whether it is in the sea or on the ground or in the air but i would like to tell this one of a teenager from white county indiana by the name of bill green on june 23 1950 before dawn north korean artillery opened fire across the 38th parallel with preparatory fires a half hour later the north korean army commenced a fourprong attack with an estimated nine divisions numbering 80 000 men 150 tanks and numerous artillery pieces at the time mr green served with k company the 21st infantry and the 24th infantry he was stationed in japan as part of the world war ii army of occupation under general douglas macarthur in less than a week mr green and his unit were air transported to korea and formed task force smith the force was tasked to delay and defend the attacking north koreans at osan only 50 miles from the north korean border task force smith was comprised of the 7th the 24th and the 25th divisions as well as the 1st cavalry they were severely undermanned and totaled 66 percent of the normal combat strength the 24th division to which mr green was assigned had only 10 800 men of a required 18 900 strength in fact when mr greens company arrived in korea it carried only two 81mm base plates and two mortar tubes but no bipods to stabilize the weapon and no sights to aim the weapon in addition k company had no recoilless rifles the main weapon used against tanks and the only jeep in the weapons company was a privately owned vehicle belonging to one of the privates furthermore the artillery attached to task force smith possessed only 13 antitank artillery rounds on july 2 1950 the task force moved north from pusan south korea pushing through endless lines of bewildered refugees and retreating south korean army units on july 5 1950 a strong force of north korean infantry and tanks struck task force smith as it stood alone in the roadway between attacking communist forces and the rest of a free south korea the outnumbered americans fired artillery bazookas mortars and their rifles at north korean communists and their russianmade tanks during the battle task force smith was hopelessly outgunned and outnumbered in the area of operations for the 24th division mr greens 21st regiment was outmanned nine to one approximately 9 000 to 1 000 the 21st infantry with only two rifle companies a battery of 105 howitzers two mortar platoons and six bazooka teams received its baptism of fire in korea by holding an entire enemy division for 7 hours escaping impending doom near osan the 21st fought its way out of encirclement and retreated 12 miles south following the battle at osan task force smith defended the town of taejon half way between the north korean border and pusan the last stronghold of american and south korean forces in august and september mr green participated in the defense of pusan which was only one area between advancing north korean forces and the sea on september 19 1950 task force smith attacked across the naktong river breaking out of the pusan perimeter and beginning the rapid advance to the north thus escaping the fall of south korea and the certain death of thousands of americans and south koreans the reason i pause to share this is this was an individual who was like many others teenagers young men in their 20s even they went and served in the military this was the aftermath of world war h they found themselves in the comfort of an occupation force they were not adequately trained they were not adequately manned and staffed they were not even adequately resourced yet they were called because their country called them to duty and that is what they were called to duty and they had to face an outnumbered force yet they fought with truly an american character they fought for no bounty of their own but to only leave freedom in their footsteps the korean war over 55 000 lost their lives in the korean war it is only proper that we pause and think about those many of whom had just served in world war h some of whom were not young enough to have served in world war ii but they found themselves in a similar position as mr green my father john buyer is a korean warera veteran he went to culver military academy he went to the citadel after all those years of military training he decided to decline his commission and wanted to go into medicine but he got drafted and instead of all his peers serving in the officer corps my father taught me many things in his silence he ended up as a sergeant in the army not once did he ever complain not once did he ever say oh i could have been an officer no his country called and he did his duty like millions before i do not know whoever

our control in 1995 the president proposed increases of 4 percent 3 percent 1 percent 5 8 percent we have given double digit increases every year for the previous 5 years prior to the republican control spending went from 1 5 billion to 2 3 billion in that 5 years is an 800 million increase when we took over spending went from 2 3 billion to 5 4 billion we have more than doubled the spending

local television signals in addition to the national programming that these companies have traditionally offered that was the good news the somewhat less than good news is that those companies have decided that they can only make a profit by offering the new local into local service in the largest cities accordingly mediumsized and small cities and rural portions of the nation will not be served

delivered by satellite then for the first time there will be on a nationwide basis a truly viable competitive alternative to cable television with the addition of the local tv service satellite companies will be able to offer exactly the same programs including local broadcast signals that cable television has traditionally offered for the first time cable rates will be set through a competitive market and will be restrained for the first time the residents of many rural regions such as the mountainous portion of virginia that the gentleman from virginia and i represent who are

armed services no later than march 31 2001 so i offer this amendment because it has been brought to my attention that acceptance of tricare patients presents a variety of problems business concerns to rehab providers because of these concerns rehab practices are reluctant to accept tricare patients and that is wrong for example most patients with a diagnosis of a stroke for example require two and sometimes three rehab disciplines depending upon the severity of the stroke therefore the stroke patient may require physical and occupational therapy and possibly speech therapy if the speech centers of the brain are involved the concern here is that only the physical therapy services are covered as reimbursable service without prior written authorization while speech therapy services require prior written authorization confusing that is what this study will determine the proper way to go occupational therapy would not be covered as it can only be covered in an institutional facility in most cases this creates a significant inconvenience for patients who now must receive their physical and speech therapy in one facility and have to travel to a separate institutional facility for occupational therapy services another good example concerns patients who are referred with a diagnosis of let us say a head trauma or upper extremity trauma they would have similar rehab needs as stroke patients and most likely experience similar inconveniences providers are also concerned about the potential for interpretation of fraud by utilizing a physical therapy assistant in the treatment of tricare patients that should not occur in hospitals skilled nursing facilities and outpatient rehab facilities it is common for the therapy staff to be comprised of physical therapists and physical therapy assistants when the rehab staffing is compromised due to sickness educational leave vacation et cetera the rehab provider is limited to the staff who can treat tricare patients these tricare patient appointments may need be canceled and the therapy interrupted due to the compromised staffing pattern this situation does not o6cur in treating traditional medicare patients neither does it occur with federal employee health benefits the requirement for utilizing only registered physical therapists serves to create a more expensive model in which to deliver rehab services in florida for example physical therapy assistants by their practice can perform all of the therapy services rendered by a registered physical therapist with the exception of performing a patient evaluation changing a patients plan of care or treatment or discharging a patient the risks associated with a tricare patient accidentally being treated by a physical therapy assistant presents a significant concern to all these rehab providers so i think this study will try to determine how these prob lems can be resolved my district has many active duty and retired military and their

celebrate or cry by that combination but the fact remains that the handgun control advocates and nra support this because it is very sensible and it really has to do with what many of us have been trying to do over the last several weeks here in the congress and that is pass legislation that prevents those with criminal backgrounds from getting guns this legislation is simple and straightforward it bans the most violent juvenile offenders in our society from possessing firearms for life as a matter of fact it is a commonsense issue that is hard to believe was not law already the fact remains a juvenile that has been convicted of murder a juvenile that has been convicted of aggravated assault aggravated criminal sexual assault can still buy guns under our legislation we will apply the same rules to juvenile offenders as we apply to adult offenders if a juvenile is convicted of the more serious felonies murder rape aggravated assault armed robbery that juvenile will be prevented from legally owning firearms as adults young people convicted in juvenile courts of serious violent crimes such as murder rape assault with attempt to commit murder still can under present law possess the right to own firearms on their 18th birthday even though as i said moments ago adults are barred from doing so since an average of 116 000 juvenile arrests for violent crimes are referred to the juvenile court system every year this loophole leaves the door wide open for the most violent offenders toobtain firearms and gives them the opportunity only to use them to commit more crimes history has proven that criminals are ready willing and able to walk through that door time and time again case studies recently compiled by the violence prevention and research institute at the university of california have cited dramatic instances of violent juvenile offenders who had no business purchasing firearms legally obtaining them and using then to commit serious crimes in one particular case a 17yearold california youth who served time in ju venile detention in the juvenile detention center for assault with a deadly weapon wasted no time in exercising his legal right to purchase a handgun as soon as he turned 21 over the next 10 years he was arrested 14 times for crimes including burglary theft and murder in a second case an 18yearold who was processed through the juvenile court systemin california on two occasions for assault with a deadly weapon and assault with intent to kill was also able to legally purchase a handgun when he turned 18 in fact he was 27 at the time at that point he was later arrested and convicted of felony robbery with a gun in short and in summation our amendment would treat the most serious class of violent juvenilesas adults for their adult crimes and stop them from getting weapons to hurt others in our society i urge my colleagues to join us in supporting what i think in this case really is truly a bipartisan effort i reserve the balance of my time"], [9.5367431640625e-07, 0.4999990463256836, 1, "this bill that we are considering today would set the procedural hurdles in the way of legislation that would mandate requirements on private businesses what are called unfunded mandates the underlying rationale of the legislation is that the congress ought to be sure of all the impacts of legislation before a vote is taken especially if we are going to have an unfunded mandate the amendment that i am offering in no way changes the underlying legislation my amendment does not weaken h r 350 in any way i want to repeat that so that there is no confusion about what we are doing in offering what we call the defense of the environment amendment we do not change any of the procedural provisions in the conditportman bill we do not affect how the bill would work for any new privatesector mandates instead what my amendment would do would merely extend the same protections to other issues that are of great importance to the american people requirements that had been established under existing law to protect the public health safety and the environment this amendment is based on legislation that is called the defense of the environment act which is supported by every major environmental group and the aflcio and other outside organizations as well because if we are going to consider repealing current environmental or public health protections or safety protections or worker protections we ought to do so with full information and adequate consideration it is the same rationale for the underlying bill it is just common sense it addresses a serious problem with the way environmental policy has been determined over the last 4 years during the last two congresses when we looked at environmental legislation we did not get a chance to consider it separately to debate it on its merits and then to vote on antienvironmental riders what we had were provisions attached to appropriations bills or other mustpass pieces of legislation what resulted often was absolutely no debate or consideration by the committee of jurisdiction what also happened was that we did not get a chance to have a debate or vote on the house floor just as the authors of this bill do not want us to pass mandates on the private sector without a chance for consideration and a vote we feel the same procedural assurances ought to be given to those who are concerned about repealing existing laws that affect environment safety and public health let me talk about some of the examples that have happened in the last couple of congresses we had antienvironmental riders that increased clearcut logging in our national forests we had riders that would have crippled protection of the endangered species and stall the superfund program we had provisions that would have hindered our ability to ensure the groundwater protection from contamination from old nuclear facilities we have blocked the regulation of radioactive contaminants in drinking water and delayed our efforts to clean up air pollution in the national parks the defense of the environment amendment would not prohibit the house from taking any of these steps or passing any of these measures but it would guarantee that we at least have the option of having an informed debate and a separate vote on these proposals it would at least give us an opportunity to protect our clean air laws our clean water laws our toxic waste laws and all of our laws that protect health and safety of workers and our families"]]}
