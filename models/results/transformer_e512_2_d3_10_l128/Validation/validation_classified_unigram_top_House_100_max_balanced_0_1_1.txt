procedural abuses in the house and its committees the rules committee has been a particular problem in this area we have seen the increasing use of gag rules which restrict members ability to offer

committee rules members of the rules committee are entitled to 48 hours notice of a meeting in case of an emergency the chairman may dispense with the 48hour notice this sounds like a reasonable rule and it would be if it were not abused for years the current chairman and his predecessors used the emergency meeting procedure only for legitimate emergencies but recently we have seen a trend toward abuse in this area as well for example the routine bill before us today the treasury postal appropriation bill was declared to be an emergency last thursday afternoon so that the 48 hour notice could be dispensed with the committee met on friday morning with no final printed copy of the committee report available it didnt even have to be this way this bill could have been considered tomorrow and tomorrows appropriation bill for which a rule has not been requested could have been considered today last week we saw the same thing with the national science foundation bill that bill was declared to be an emergency in the rules committee so that it could be rushed through without the required 48 hours notice on may 25 once again there was no printed committee report available and little opportunity for members to learn about the provisions of the bill then after all the rush the rule was not even called up until 2 weeks later on june 9 p we all understand the need to move quickly in case of a real emergency but the abuse of the concept is the problem by repeatedly dispensing with the normal 48hour notice requirement it means that members are forced to vote before they have had an opportunity to properly review the legislation i hope that in the future the call of emergency meetings will be restricted to real emergencies aside from its emergency designation there is nothing unusual about the provisions of this rule it waives points of order against the bill for lack of authorization and because there are legislative provisions in this appropriation bill it also waives points of order to protect an amendment to be offered by the gentleman from pennsylvania providing for a drugfree workplace this is a longer version of the walker amendment which is technically legislation on an appropriation bill there has been particular interest in a legislative paragraph in this bill which provides for a 4percent pay increase for all federal employees including members of congress that language is legislation on an appropriation bill but it is protected from a point of order by the provisions of this rule however there is nothing in this rule which restricts the

only fair while individual thrifts are entitled to share in gains on preferred stock the emphasis should be on the word share remember the fhlmc issued the 15 million in preferred stocks free of charge to the federal home loan banks in december 1984 in part to establish a type of return on equity to the banks which had capitalized the fhlmc in 1970 the banks distributed the shares to member thrift institutions based on their holdings of fhlb stock a sharing of a gain in stock value however is not to be the boards action blows the proxmire approacha taxpayeroriented approach which i supportout of the water while public sale of stock may well have a marginal effect on certain insolvent thrifts the wall street journal reported today insolvent thrifts own less than 11 percent of freddie macs preferred stock so much of the benefit will go to healthier institutions the windfall wont do much to help the fslic or lessen the likelihood of a taxpayer bailout of failing institutions

at the same time we are preparing to further reduce our presence abroad by closing consulates and drastically cutting personnel at key embassies the soviet union is increasing"],

nation and of the world on may 25 1787 the constitutional convention which was called by congress to amend the articles of confederation formally convened with delegates from seven states in attendance on that day robert morris a delegate from pennsylvania proposed that gen george washington be chosen president of the convention this was seconded by john rutledge of south carolina and general washington was unanimously elected to that position other business of the day consisted of the electing of the committee of three to draw up the rules for conducting of the conventions business this committee consisted of george wythe of virginia alexander hamilton of new york and charles pinckney of south carolina it is my intention each day we are in session to enter into the congressional record the important events that occurred in the constitutional convention of 1787 with the help of susan carleson and others at the commission on the bicentennial of the united states constitution i will seek to identify events debates and historic moments that still have significance and which can give us insight as we debate the issues of this historic 100th congress i recommend to all of my colleagues that they study the events of that historic summer to gain the insight and wisdom that is as much needed today as it was in 1787"], [0.000923842191696167, 0.49907615780830383,

have not changed that during the presidents speech he used the term freedom 10 times and it was not heard once in the democratic response 90 miles off the coast of florida sits the tiny island of cuba the cuban people live under the harsh and absolute domination of a communist tyrant there are many who say that because there is no open hostility or no armed hostility in cuba today that the cuban people are at peace eut certainly they are not free my generation of americans like all generations of americans before understand how precious freedom is that in fact freedom is the core of all human progress there were those who argued today that if we were to continue to aid those fighting for freedom in nicaragua that we would bring an end to the peace process well that argument does not hold up under scrutiny if that were the case daniel ortega never would have agreed to direct negotiation on a ceasefire with the contras he never would have lifted the state of emergency after we passed additional military aid in the continuing resolution in december to renege today on aiding those who are fighting for freedom will in fact impose on the people of nicaragua the peace of cuba and not give them the opportunity to experience the freedom of grenada"], [0.000923842191696167, 0.49907615780830383, 0, "3 weeks ago the house republican leadership took a special order to point out the pattern of increasing procedural abuses in the house and its committees the rules committee has been a particular problem in this area we have seen the increasing use of gag rules which restrict members ability to offer amendments and resolutions waiving all the standing rules of the house however there are some other problems affecting the rules committee which have received far less attention under its own committee rules members of the rules committee are entitled to 48 hours notice of a meeting in case of an emergency the chairman may dispense with the 48hour notice this sounds like a reasonable rule and it would be if it were not abused for years the current chairman and his predecessors used the emergency meeting procedure only for legitimate emergencies but recently we have seen a trend toward abuse in this area as well for example the routine bill before us today the treasury postal appropriation bill was declared to be an emergency last thursday afternoon so that the 48 hour notice could be dispensed with the committee met on friday morning with no final printed copy of the committee report available it didnt even have to be this way this bill could have been considered tomorrow and tomorrows appropriation bill for which a rule has not been requested could have been considered today last week we saw the same thing with the national science foundation bill that bill was declared to be an emergency in the rules committee so that it could be rushed through without the required 48 hours notice on may 25 once again there was no printed committee report available and little opportunity for members to learn about the provisions of the bill then after all the rush the rule was not even called up until 2 weeks later on june 9 p we all understand the need to move quickly in case of a real emergency but the abuse of the concept is the problem by repeatedly dispensing with the normal 48hour notice requirement it means that members are forced to vote before they have had an opportunity to properly review the legislation i hope that in the future the call of emergency meetings will be restricted to real emergencies aside from its emergency designation there is nothing unusual about the provisions of this rule it waives points of order against the bill for lack of authorization and because there are legislative provisions in this appropriation bill it also waives points of order to protect an amendment to be offered by the gentleman from pennsylvania providing for a drugfree workplace this is a longer version of the walker amendment which is technically legislation on an appropriation bill there has been particular interest in a legislative paragraph in this bill which provides for a 4percent pay increase for all federal employees including members of congress that language is legislation on an appropriation bill but it is protected from a point of order by the provisions of this rule however there is nothing in this rule which restricts the normal open amending process for general appropriation bills there are several provisions in the bill to which the administration strongly objects if these provisions are in the bill when it reaches the presidents desk it will be vetoed i have no requests for time"], [0.000923842191696167, 0.49907615780830383, 0, "3 years ago my amendment to the dod authorization bill was adopted to implement in conjunction with the strategic defense initiative a research program on the medical and material science applications of the free electron laser i believed then as i do now that we must make this promising technology available for civilian uses and benefits as soon as possible to accomplish this at least five multidisciplinary universitybased research centers were to be established to investigate potential medical applications expedite scientific and engineering training and develop programs to utilize this advanced technology in support of dod basic and applied research since 1984 interest in and expectations for the fel have continued to grow and progress has been made prof john madey inventor of this unique tunable laser and director of research at stanfords new photon research laboratory informs me that at the two centers where fels already existed experiments have been conducted to modulate the metabolic rate of cell cultures activate photochemical anticancer drugs dissect gallstones and evaluate laser opthalmic hazards in the nearinfrared i am pleased to note the work being done and am also pleased to offer once more language to insure that mfel research receives funding the armed services committee and the full house have strongly supported this effort on a bipartisan basis i am sure that the benefits we will derive from this research will show that support to be well founded however care must be taken in the allocation of resources for this important initiative so that the greatest good can be achieved in my view the regional centers are the most costeffective approach to gain widespread study and application of the fel for civilian uses and sufficient training and education nationwide thus i hope to hear of further progress toward operational regional centers as originally envisioned in closing i state again my ongoing support for the mfel program and urge my colleagues continued support as well"]]}
