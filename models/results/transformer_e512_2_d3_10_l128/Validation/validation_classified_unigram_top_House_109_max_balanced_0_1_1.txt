agreement coupled with this trade deficit our trade deficit the presidents next trade agreement with the rest of the world was 38 bilthe free trade area of the americas lion in 1992 last year 2004 our trade deficit was 620 billion 618 billion precisely from 38 billion to 618 billion by any stretch of the imagination it is hard to argue that our trade policy is working and that is why the opposition has been bipartisan to cafta to the central american free labor the central american free trade agreement that is why the opposition has been bipartisan that is why the opposition has been overwhelming last month 2 dozen democrats and republicans in congress joined more than 150 business groups and labor organizations sending the message vote no on this central american free trade agreement last week more than 400 union workers and members of congress gathered in front of the unitedstates capitol again delivering that message vote no on the central american free trade agreement now those of us opposed to cafta which clearly is a majority in this congress or we already would have voted on it those of us opposed to cafta say we are not opposed to trade we want to see fair trade agreements instead of free trade agreements because we know what free trade agreements do we know what this trade deficit does to our country it means according to the first president bush according to his economists it means literally 12 000 lost jobs per 1 billion of trade deflcft that means a million lost jobs it means more than that a million lost manufacturing jobs in this country in my state alone we have lost 200 000 manufacturing jobs not entirely because of trade agreements but that is a big component of it so we know what these trade agreements do to individuals when they lose their jobs what it does to family members when they lose their jobs what it does to communities when a community has a plant closing what it does to the school districts and the schools as they h3336 co lose funding because these workers have lost their jobs and because this plant has closed what it does to our country as a whole when we have this kind of trade deficit we understand that that is why those of us opposed to the central american free trade agreement want to throw out this dysfunctional cousin of nafta and want to negotiate a trade agreement that will lift workers up in central america while promoting prosperity here at home there is no reason that our trade agreements need to look like this need to have a result like this instead congress can move forward in passing a fair trade agreement the gentleman from texas the majority leader the most powerful republican in the unitedstates congress and the chairman of the ways and means committee the gentleman from california both promised to vote on the central american free trade agreement by the end of may now if you will look at this chart you will see that the end of may happens to be the 1year anniversary of when cafta was sent to congress so we should vote no on the central american free trade agreement bury this trade agreement and pass a trade agreement that is good for american workers and american

lives in iraq it is time to end this war let us bring our troops home and restore unitedstates credibility in the world community this war was based on fiction that is a fact that is no longer disputed there were no weapons of mass destruction and no ties to al qaeda there was no imminent threat this administration with the acquiescence of congress rushed into a war that according to secretary of state colin powells former chief of staff lawrence wilkerson has made our country more vulnerable not less to future crisis the bush administration has stubbornly refused to reassess the situation they have refused to listen to the words of military and diplomatic leaders who have warned that a continuing unitedstates presence in iraq will not calm the violence or lead to a more stable iraq the unitedstates presence in iraq is now a major part of the problem al qaeda is in iraq today because we are there the abuse and torture by unitedstates forces of detainees at abu ghraib prison and the near 3year occupation by us troops have made us an unpopular force in iraq even among those who originally supported the unitedstates invasion we have spent over 300 billion on the war with no end in sight it is estimated that another 2 years of war will boost that amount to 1 trillion our military is stretched to the limit with much of the burden falling on our guard and reserves

holy father i thank him for his leadership in helping us express our condolences as well my mother used to always say of john paul ii he is a saint walking the earth indeed he was it is in that spirit and with deep sadness at his passing but with great thanks and joy for his life of good works that i rise today to join my colleagues in paying tribute to pope john paul h 0l 1500 pope john paul ii

am very honored to be part of the congressional delegation to the popes funeral on friday and i hope that our delegation can help convey the thoughts prayers and deep sympathies of the american people on his passing we will be pleased to join our president in doing that pope john paul ii was a man of god and he was a man of the people he was passionate in his commitment to doing gods work here on earth st francis of assisi who was the patron saint of my city of san francisco said preach often sometimes use words the life of john paul ii was a sermon he preached every day by example his ministry fed the hungry cared for the sick and invited the stranger he was a champion for the poor promoting justice and economic development around the world his work built on the legacy of pope paul vi not his immediate predecessor except for 33 days his predecessor who believed if you want peace work for justice pope john paul ii helped to bring justice and healing to the ielationship between catholics and jews and i know how important that is to the gentleman from california his commitment to nonviolence and to peace on earth was heartfelt and steadfast with a concern and caring for all of gods children john paul ii reached out to people of all ages nationalities and faiths as we all know he traveled to so many countries in his service as pope and he spent more than 2 years in his papacy outside of rome i like to say that he was aptly named john paul john the apostle of love and paul who preached the gospel to such a wide range of people in the earliest days of christendom in doing so himself pope john paul ii brought the redemptive message of the catholic church to places it had never been and he inspired millions of individuals who saw in his conviction and in his example the light of god he had a special bond with the youth of the world i remember when i met him in san francisco when he came there and it was so exciting for us to welcome the holy father and when he landed at crissey field in a helicopter it was so dramatic and when i met him our archbishop archbishop quinn said as we were chatting your holiness i have confirmed the congresswomans children and he said thats good thats good and he said your holiness i have confirmed the c6ngresswomans five children and he said thats very good thats very good and as i said he had a special bond with the youth of the world he spoke with them as a spiritual leader but also as a teacher and as a friend the guidance he offered to todays youth will benefit the world for years to come likewise his influence on world events will be felt for generations john paul ii played an enormous role in the fall of communism and ending the cold war and that has been mentioned here he was a man of peace as a priest in poland he waged a persistent struggle for nearly three decades against the communist government over the building of churches and the right of his people to worship as they choose he continued that work as pope inspiring the polish people and the solidarity movement and offering spiritual strength to others working to free themselves from communist regimes in his later years the pope offered the world a very different but significant form of inspiration suffering from parkinsons disease and with failing health he struggled until the end to share gods word he taught us about the dignity of every individual and showed us that we must always seek to make a difference on this earth it is written in the book of genesis thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace thou shalt be buried in a good old age john paul ii is with our father now we were blessed that he preached peace in this world for so long as we honor his memory as we sing his praises we must also heed his message the catholic church recently gave us a guide the compendium of catholic social justice for how we can address some of the issues the previous speaker talked about addressing the needs of the poor the vulnerable and the weak president bush mentioned that when he gave his holiness the presidential medal of freedom he mentioned that he had championed the sapril 6 2005 co work for the poor the vulnerable the needy he said and the weak we must do that in our work here it would then be an appropriate honor and remembrance for the life leadership service and holiness my mother said as i

barracks in 1983 lebanon embassy in 1983 uss cole khobar towers nairobi tanzania i have so much that i want to say i will just say this if we were to set a date the mujahedin would say we defeated the russians in afghanistan we defeated america in iraq and the jihad would take place all over this world this would be a very very dangerous thing to say so i rise in strong strong support of this resolution and say we can and will win this war i remember when i read the book by whittaker chambers he was a witness he said when i left the communist party i believed i was leaving the winning side and joining the losing side whittaker chambers was wrong because of people like ronald reagan we must be resolute i rise in support of the resolution i rise today in support of h res 861 and to show my support for our troops serving in iraq and afghanistan who are on the front lines in the global war on terrorism i commend our forces for the recent actions in targeting abu musab alzarqawi the insurgent leader killed in an airstrike june 7 1 also commend president bush for his visit earlier this week to iraq to meet with prime minister nouri almaliki and encourage the work of the new iraqi government i share the deep concerns about the continuing violence in postwar iraq which is taking the lives of unitedstates military personnel and civilians i continue to pray for the protection of the men and women who are putting their lives on the line every day to help the iraqi people as they build their own government and also for their families here at home who continue to make tremendous sacrifices i recognize there were good and reasonable people on both sides of the decision to send unitedstates armed forces to iraq but whether or not you agreed with that decision we are there now and cannot just walkaway too much is at stake the success of our efforts in iraq and the success of the iraqi people in establishing their own government are critical to the overall war against terror and to the security of our country and the world our efforts in iraq many believe are an important campaign in the global war on terrorism our world is a dangerous place and as we learned on september 11 2001 terrorism is not something in a far away land we did not seek this war we were attacked on our own soil and this war is a different kind than any our nation has ever fought but it is one we are fighting to make our own nation and the world more secure it is critical that we remain resolute in this fight i believe a case can be made that the war on terrorism really began more than 20 years ago with the attacks against america at the unitedstates embassy in beirut lebanon the bombing there in the spring of 1983 killed 63 and wounded 120 later that year 241 unitedstates servicemen220 marines 18 navy members and three army memberswere killed when a truck bomb exploded at their barracks in beirut those attacks were followed in 1993 by the first world trade center bombing in new york city in 1996 by the khobar towers bombing in saudi arabia in 1998 by the unitedstates embassy bombings in kenya and tanzania and in 2000 in the attack in yemen on the uss cole after the attacks on the two embassies in africa in 1998 i became very concerned about the unitedstates response to terrorism and authored the legislation creating the national commission on terrorism on the cover of that report is a photo of the twin towers in new york on fire after the 1993 attack the foreboding nature of that photo is now all too real as we relive the destruction of the world trade center on september 11 2001 late last summer i returned to iraq for a third time i have now visited all but the kurdish areas in northern iraq with each successive trip i have seen improvementsrenovated schools cleaner water systems new iraqi army constituted i also have seen the continuing and serious security problems and other challenges facing a liberated iraq and i have heard caution from varied sources about the potentially cataclysmic consequences of america withdrawing before our mission is complete i had the opportunity to speak with our troops who are performing their duties with professionalism and dedication they are positive about their mission and are doing an outstanding job in fulfilling it one interesting comment i heard on that trip is that we cant expect to rebuild iraq on our timetable but rather it must be on iraqs timetable lifeand timetablesin iraq are nofthe same as in the united states this is a very key point and one the bush administration needs to do a better job of explaining it also is important to remember that the united states had its share of growing pains while our revolution was in 1776 it was 11 years before our forefathers began to draft a constitution and it wasnt ratified until 1789 few remember that our constitution was debated in complete secrecy delegates knew that they would generate heated differences and did not want to advertise their own dissensions or put crippling arguments into the mouths of the opposition we also had leaders like george washington ben franklin george mason and james madison who had the benefit of understanding british history in addition to being exposed to the workings of the house of commons democracy and an elected government is truly a foreign concept to the iraqi people the bush administration also needs to do a better job of explaining what the consequences of failing in iraq would mean to the average person in chantilly va topeka ks or portland or i repeatedly asked people i met during the tripfrom generals to state department officials to members of the iraqi governmentwhat they thought failure would mean the responses were frightening i heard references to somaliathink of the movie black hawk down and the former yugoslavia with all its ethnic cleansing the images that flashed in my mind when i heard these countries were disturbing i was in somalia during the crisis in 1993 i traveled to sarajevo and the yugoslavia region several times in the early to mid1990s where so many were killed in fact all the people i met with in vukovar croatia in 1991 were killed several months later and are now buried in mass graves many speculated that civil war would break out in iraq and even more foreign fighters from across the region would pour into iraq in hopes of influencing the outcome i was told almost all of the insurgents carrying out the suicide attacks are foreigners most coming across the syrian border from places like syria saudi arabia egypt sudan and afghanistan i was told militias continue to fight each other on a regular basis in some parts of the country if our mission fails and civil war comes the country would almost certainly break into three parts the kurds in the north the sunnis in central iraq and the shias in the south it is believed the kurds would most likely be able to keep from being drawn into the fighting and govern themselves in the central region of the sunni triangle warring factions would fight for control and most agree that there would be sheer chaos irans presence was felt in the south as it tried to influence the recent elections and if civil war were to break out elements in ifan may well involve themselves in the south with civil war almost everyone i asked said that iraq would become a haven from which terrorist groups could launch attacks against the united states and other countries no one has to be reminded of what happened on 9 11 thirty people from my congressional district died that day among the 3 000 who perished al qaeda and other terrorist groups would like nothing more than to have a new base from which to operate much like afghanistan in the 1990s after the soviets were defeated there is no denying that the terrorists have designs on the united states and as one officer told me we must win the war so we dont fight the next war in america terrorists are doing everything in their power to prevent the united states and its coalition partners from being successful in iraq they believe time is on their side and that they can wait out the united states they will do anything= including blowing themselves up in busy marketplacesto disrupt our progress and turn the iraqi people against us they believe that the war being fought in iraq is not a military war but rather a political war and american public opinion will dictate when the united states leaves not military success there is a general belief among terrorism experts that the top priority of terrorists is to seek chemical biological radiological or nuclear weapons the video of two commercial airliners being flown into the world trade center is ingrained in every americans mind i shudder to think what terrorists would do if they obtained a biological or chemical weapon many i spoke with also said failure in iraq could destabilize the entire gulf region and possibly lead to the downfall of the governments of jordan egypt and saudi arabia failure also could have serious impact on the worlds economy japan gets more than 75 percent of its oil from the region western europe 30 percent and the united states 22 percent we saw what happened in the wake of hurricane katrina as consumers feared gas shortages failure in iraq would make oil costs even higher and have a major negative impact throughout our entire economy others said they believe the united states has a moral obligation to the people of iraq to successfully complete what it started they asked how the american public would feel if civil war were to break out and thousands upon thousands of innocent iraqis were slaughtered in the subsequent fighting finally many believe the united statess credibility is at stake in a piece in the washington posts outlook section last september victor davis hanson a military historian at stanford universitys hoover institution and the author of a war like no other wrote if we fled precipitously moderates in the middle east could never again believe american assurances of support for reform and would have to retreat into the shadowsor find themselves at the mercy of fascist killers jihadists would swell their ranks as they hyped their defeat of the american infidels our forward strategy of hitting terrorists hard abroad would be discredited and replaced by a return to the pre9 1l tactics of a few cruise missiles and writs and loyal allies in eastern europe the united kingdom australia and japan 4long with new friends in india and the former soviet republics would find themselves leaderless in the global struggle against islamic radicalism failure cannot be an option in iraq nor can creating an arbitrary deadline for pulling out unitedstates troops the ramifications on our country and other countries in the west would be huge our withdrawal must be event driven and not artificially tied to a calendar many i talked to said we must set conditions for victory not dates for withdrawal the bush administration needs to do a better job articulating just what is at stake and the potentially catastrophic consequences no one believes we will lose the war on the ground in iraq its here at home that there is a concern i had one general officer say point blank that the center of gravity for our success in iraq is the american public that said i strongly believe that it would be of great value to have an independent review of ongoing operations in iraq i call this effort fresh eyes on the target and offered this suggestion following my latest trip to iraq on march 15 i was pleased to attend the announcement of the formation of the 10member bipartisan iraq study group being led by former secretary of state james baker and former congressman lee hamilton who cochaired the 9 11 commission the members as are their coleaders are among americas most honorable and venerable citizens former cia director robert gates former unitedstates attorney general ed meese former clinton adviser vernon jordan former clinton chief of staff leon panetta former defense secretary william perry former virginia senator chuck robb former wyoming senator alan simpson and former supreme court justice sandra day oconnor the study group was launched in partnership with the united states institute of peace the center for strategic and international studies the center for the study of the presidency and the baker institute for public policy at rice university its mission is to undertake a bipartisan forwardlooking assessment of the current and prospective situation on the ground in iraq its impact on the surrounding region and its consequences on unitedstates interests and it will focus on political military security and reconstruction in iraq the group will travel to iraq and report to the american people i understand they will meet with president bush this week it will assess what is working and what changes should be made in helping the iraqi people to establish their own government and stop the terrorist insurgency which is continuing to foment the violence of the saddam hussein regime one of the most critical jobs of this panel is to determine the ramifications of failure to accomplish our countrys mission in iraq and to explain that to the american people in the 1930s the world failed to stand up to fascism when wewith our allies did stand up and fight we defeated fascism it also took some time for the world to stand up to communism but when we did we defeated communism now we face al qaeda and its leader osama bin laden who in his own words has said he will use chemical biological radiological and nuclear weapons against us we must continue the determined effort now that we have had in the wars over the years as we fight terrorism standing together l believe we can defeat this threat to the freedoms and liberties and way of life we have fought to maintain for well over two

well allow me as a member of the ecumenical community many different faiths to be able to express our sympathy as well it is important to note what many of us believe pope john paul ii stood for an unyielding spine backbone someone who was larger than life who believed in humanity and itssafety and love and as well had the common touch a man who understood suffering having lost his mother at an early age of 8 years old his older brother of scarlet fever just a few years later and his father who was a sergeant in the army in 1941 he understood suffering yet he was the first pope to expand his reach and understand the value of the worlds religious communities coming together and so he paid homage to the victims of the holocaust he was the first pope to visit auschwitz and as well to visit the synagogue of rome in march 2000 pope john paul ii went to the holocaust memorial as well and yes he visited syria pope john paul h was also the first pope to visit a muslim mosque when he traveled to damascus syria later on with the strength of his conscience he said to us war is a defeat for humanity and that wars generally do not resolve the problems for which they are fought and therefore prove ultimately futile so i simply have these words to say simply to thank pope john paul ii for his legacy and his life to appreciate the fact that he was willing to lift those who could not lift themselves and thank him for teaching us about the genocide in sudan and allowing us to lift ourselves to be able to stand against it and to fight with every breath in our body to be able to live his legacy and that is a man of peace and a man who loved humanity i rise today as a cosponsor of the house resolution honoring the life and achievements of his holiness pope john paul ii and expressing profound sorrow on his death truly billions of people around the world both catholic and noncatholic alike mourn the death of pope john paul ii he held one of most influential positions on earth but his life will be remembered as a man of the people a man who never saw any barriers between people i plan to travel with the congressional delegation to pope john pauls funeral at the vatican in rome along with an estimated two million mourners this man has touched the life of so many both with his words and with his actions that people now come together to honor this great man pope john paul was born karol wojtyla on may 18 1920 in wadowice poland his early life was not easy his mother died when he was only eight years old three years later he lost his older brother to scarlet fever his father who was a sergeant in the army died in 1941 by the age of 20 he had lost three of his closest family members but as he would throughout his life he summoned his courage and his remarkable resolve to remain true to his religious upbringing he would grow up in poland during an era of nazi occupation and repression he worked as a common laborer and even as religious expression was being quelled by the nazis he continued his catholic teachings he would become the youngest bishop in modern polish history at the age of 38 as the archbishop of krakow nine years later he was the youngest cardinal guiding the catholic faithful in a country that was officially atheist he was known even then for his stance against communism and the forces of oppression and hate on oct 16 1978 at the age of 58 john paul ii was selected to lead the roman catholic church as the youngest pope of the 20th century his relative youth allowed him to be extremely active and meet with people throughout the world his charisma and grace allowed him to touch the hearts of people and convey a message of peace and collective humanity as pope john paul ii traveled the world to directly speak to the issues that confronted society whereas previous pontiffs often remained distant never straying far from the vatican john paul maintained a busy travel schedule he completed 102 pastoral visits outside of italy and 144 within visiting almost 130 countries during his 26 years as pope he logged more kilometers of travel than all other popes combined his first visit as pope was to his homeland of poland which was still beset by communist rule he advocated for the solidarity movement and he pushed for change but he insisted above all else that any movement in order to be successful must be peaceful it was pope john paul who aptly stated that social justice cannot be attained by violence violence kills what it intends to create his influence and guiding hand brought down the rule of communism in poland and ushered in a new era throughout europe and indeed much of the world i was honored to recently jbave meetings with both former polish president lech walesa and current president aleksander kwasniewski and it seems clear that together with the popes influence poland was able to transform from an oppressive communist country under strict soviet control and with a weak economy to an independent and democratic country with a fast growing freemarket economy the end of communism fell like a series of dominoes in nations throughout the world and truly pope john paul was among the most influential in setting off these series of events pope john paul also used his travel to improve relations between the vatican and people of other faiths he grew up in an area of poland where he lived next to many people of jewish faith during the era of nazi persecution where he saw his jewish neighbors face brutality as pope he wrote and delivered a number of speeches on the subject of the churchs relationship with jews and often paid homage to the victims of the holocaust in many nations he was the first pope to have visited auschwitz concentration camp in poland in 1979 and his visit to the synagogue of rome was the first by a pope in the history of the catholic church in march 2000 pope john paul ii went to the holocaust memorial yad vashem in israel and touched the holiest shrine of the jewish people the western wall in jerusalem promoting christianjewish reconciliation the pope said at that time that jews are our older brothers pope john paul was also the first pope to visit a muslim mosque when he traveled to damascus syria he used his position of influence to bring people of all faiths together and for that we should be grateful at each stop he made as pope he reiterated that we only have one lifetime to live and that we must ensure that we use this time to achieve peace instead of suffering in war it was pope john paul who stated war is a defeat for humanity and that wars generally do not resolve the problems for which they are fought and therefore prove ultimately futile his words certainly ring true for the present as well as the past and future indeed pope john paul ii was a great man for all ages it was he who stated the future starts today not tomorrow his presence and stature will be missed and we are right to mourn this great man however the pope john paul would be the first to tell us that the future is now and we must continue to move forward we must all use his words and the lessons leamed to help guide future generations

be here tonight i am grateful for the words of our colleagues earlier congressman gohmert and congresswoman schmidt i appreciate what they have said and you i am really proud to be a part of the official truth squad and while i did not hear all of the comments that were made just prior to our beginning our session here i did want to respond to one thing that you said that is that we all are entitled to our opinions but the facts are the facts and it is important that we get the facts straight here and i think many bf the things that we are responding to are things that have been purported to be facts which are not facts at all and i think it is important that we set the record straight i also noted tonight in the presentation by the blue dog coalition that they are very concerned about the deficit but they want to do away with the tax cuts and spend more money the problem with the deficit is that we are spending too much and we need to cut back on the spending and that is a fundamental issue i think it is pretty much a fundamental law of economics which i do not think can be done away with simply by talking about it i think that we are going to have to come to grips with it as our colleague from ohio was saying it is such a great honor to be able to serve in this house and i want to say that i grew up in a house in western north carolina with no electricity no running water about as poor as anybody you will ever meet and it is a true miracle that someone with my background could come here and represent the 5th district of north carolina and i am in awe every day of the fact that i have this great opportunity and am grateful for it and i think about the way this country was formed and i think it is impor tant that we talk a little bit about that i am troubled that so few people even know the basis of our government people do not know the constitution they do not know the basis of our laws they do not know the historyv of this country and i want to talk some more about that but i know we are not going to have as much time tonight as we had thought we would originally so i am going to make a recommendation of a couple of books which i think are wonderful books to read anything by david mccullough is great i know that he was being quoted earlier i had a chance to read 1776 recently which is the story of the first year of the revolution and it is wonderful and tonight i was reviewing the founding brothers by joseph ellis and he talks a lot about the things that came together to make the united states possible to make the revolution possible and i do want to quote one piece from ellis or maybe a couple of pieces from the book founding brothers i do highly recommend it as something so easy to read but he said no one had ever established a republican government on the scale of the united states and the overwhelming judgment of the most respected authorities was that it could not be done well here we are over 200 years later proving that it can be done butit is our job as representatives of the people to make sure that this wonderful experiment in liberty is sustained and as again our colleague from ohio said it is a great honor to serve here and some people may not know this and i think it is important to know that the only way anybody can serve in the united states house of representatives is to be elected people can be appointed to every other office in the united states but they cannot be appointed to serve in the united states house of representatives one must be elected and we are elected every 2 years and i hope in this course of time as we talk about the principles of this country that we will do something that i do not think people do often enough that is read the constitution i think it is helpful for us to reflect on the constitution and as we talk about the truth squad i want to read two pieces from the constitution tonight and then turn it back to you mr price to conclude our time here but i think so often even the constitution itself is not quoted accurately and i think that part of our job should be to remind the people what the constitution says and how it is the basis for everything else that we do now i am going to read just the preamble to the constitution and by the way i borrowed this from the parliamentarian and i find it interesting that we tie back to mr jefferson and the founding fathers this is in one manual the constitution jeffersons manual and the rules of the house of representatives as i understand it in almost every elected body in the united states they go back to jeffersons manual when there is any dispute on whether the rules apply or not and so i think the fact that we do that is a great tribute to again our founding fathers and particularly mr jefferson and the care he took with these things let me read the preamble we the people of the united states in order to form a more perfect union establish justice ensure domestic tranquility provide for the common defense promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity do ordain and establish this constitution for the united states of america i think that the key words for me here are provide for the common defense that is the role of the federal government that is the number one role of the federal government we do want to promote the general welfare but that is not the primary goal of the federal government it is to provide for the common defense promoting the general welfare can be done in lots of different ways and i have heard some people on the other side say we should change those words around and say provide for the general welfare and promote the common defense i think that that is one of the problems that we are having in our country these days and the other piece of the constitution that i want to read tonight that i think is a part of tying back into our being the official truth squad is amendment 1 to the constitution congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom ofspeech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assembly and to petition the government for a redress of grievances i find that in most days when people want to quote the first amendment they often quote that first phrase and leave out the second phrase and i think that that is so important i think it is a part of tying back again to the truth squad many times you hear people quote congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion that says we should take the words in god we trust off of our money the words under god out of our pledge but what is so important is the second half of that sentence or prohibiting the free exercise thereof unfortunately those who would take away our freedoms are the ones who so often leave off the second half of that phrase and it is extremely important that we not distort the words of the constitution and it is important i think that our truth squad remind people of those words so often and i think we need to do that i hope we will in our sharing things with the people talk more about the constitution and how the truth of the constitution itself has been distorted by some of our colleagues"], [0.0006871819496154785, 0.5006871819496155, 0, "if i might inquire of the gentleman on the other side if he has no more speakers i am prepared since i believe he has the power to close i am prepared to make a closing presentation and i will yield myself accordingly such time as i may consume there are obviously a couple of things on the record that need to be corrected one of the earlier speakers made a comment about it being hogwash i think was his elegant term that the progrowth policies that this majority put in the tax code have helped the economy have helped economic growth in this country which has achieved record rates have allowed us to generate new revenue that in turn would bring down the deficit and yet in the contrary position chairman greenspan just a few months ago when he was still in office testified before our joint economic committee and made very clear that the tax policies of this majority particularly as they apply to the more dynamic side of the tax code have been successful in generating economic growth and have been successful in helping the economy it is precisely about maintaining these tax policies and not doing a tax increase that we consider this motion to instruct i thinx this motion to instruct would be perverse it has been challenged here whether this motion to instruct in fact represents a tax increase it is curious that some in washington still argue that when you have put rates into place and the market has adjusted for them that if you allow those rates to lapse somehow that is not a tax increase only in washington is that kind of fantasy engaged in what is fairly clear is the tax policies that are our majority and our majoritys budget resolution attempt to preserve are tax policies that have been beneficial to the economy and the alternative is clearly a tax increase let us consider the amt for a moment and i think this is very important to listen to the other side talk about the need to deal with amt relief through this budget reconciliation overlooks the fact that the house passed an amt bill by a margin of 4144 a few months ago at that point clearly an overwhelming majority over 400 members of this body felt that passing a bill specifically to deal with the amt was the right way to go so when we had another member on the other side suggest that it was essential for someone to vote for this instruction if they are serious about dealing with the amt is absurd the house has already dealt with the amt and in a manner that i think is appropriate it is appropriate for our tax conference to be in a position to deal with other issues including extending existing tax policies now the gentleman from maryland pointed out at the beginning of his remarks that the current tax rates are going to be in place until the year 2008 on capital gains and on dividend income and that is quote unquote plenty of time i would suggest to the gentleman that the markets may disagree with him the markets are assuming that we are going to extend current rates and certainly in the past we have never scheduled a tax increase in these areas in advance and telegraphed the punch i would suggest that markets might respond to this in a very strange way and by adopting this motion to instruct conferees in fact i would suggest it would send exactly the wrong message at a time like this to the markets some might argue that going back to the old higher rates raising taxes in that manner might generate revenue and yet we have heard testimony before the ways and means in recent years that suggests that the revenuemaximizing rate in capital gains according to one expert might be between 20 percent and 15 percent but in the next order of probability might be between 15 percent and 10 percent i would suggest since the gentleman from new jersey raised the question of morality there is not really a coherent morality in setting tax rates in a particular area that are above the level at which they will generate the most revenue i think that the current rates on capital gains clearly have been beneficial and it is not clear that we are going to generate additional revenue if as the gentleman on the other side would like to do we increase those rates we have generated revenue that was not captured in our calculations by lowering these rates our experience with raising capital gains rates over the years is that the revenue that was supposed to occur rarely does and that suggests to us that perhaps the 15 percent rate might be an ideal place to generate the most revenue not that there is ever really a compelling argument for setting a rate at the revenuemaximizing rate i think there are also some things that we ought to consider about some of the figures that were thrown out here i in my initial remarks pointed out some of the clear benefits to the middle class that have accrued from the current tax policies and the gentleman on the other side of the aisle challenged that and trotted out some figures i should simply point out for the record that the joint committee has given us different figures and the other gentlemans argument i found to be a saturnalia of static analysis so i think that those who are following this debate can listen and make up their own minds i think that clearly the current tax policies are justified on the facts and the other side has not really offered a coherent position for adopting a new tax policy my feeling is that workers who have taxable assets who have seen the value of those taxable assets which they are holding toward retirement increase because of the growth increase because the market hasgone up may i suggest that they have seen a real benefit from our tax policies one that is not captured in the static analysis used on the other side but one which is important and is a real measure of wealth and is a real measure of their satisfaction i was intrigued by some of the rhetoric on the other side in which on one hand a speaker called for us to use civility and then accused us of siding with millionaires that is an uiusual approach to civility but i would suggest to the speaker that by supporting the current tax policies and supporting the growth that so clearly is their result we are siding with entrepreneurs we are siding with workers who depend on small businesses and the people who run them to create the jobs that they need we are siding with the capitalist economy that has created more wealth and more opportunity in this country than anywhere else in the world we are siding with the dynamic side of our economy and that part of our economy that we think offers the promise of new opportunities throughout america i believe that we have a great opportunity in this tax conference to move forward and to continue this houses policy of supporting progrowth tax policies i certainly hope that the house tonight makes very clear that we continue to support those policies and on the eve of this tax conference i hope that we come together to send a clear message by rejecting this instruction i think there is a clear philosophical difference here we believe in growth we believe in expanding opportunity we believe that the capitalist economy can create those opportunities we believe that american workers and american companies where given the opportunity and where the tax code and the taxman does not get in their way can compete anywhere in the world with that i call on my colleagues to reject this instruction perhaps wellmeaning but poorly conceived and clearly a tax increase at the wrong time and at the wrong place i yield back the balance

homeland security and the committee on international relations but that is not the experience i would like to talk about tonight i would like to discuss my experience in the justice department prior to running for congress which in my opinion is very relevant to this discussion i served as a federal prosecutor in the public integrity section at main justice when the socalled wall between the criminal division and the fbis foreign counterintelligence was in place after 9 11 i served as the chief of counterterrorism and national security for the unitedstates attorneys office in the western district of texas my jurisdiction included the presidents ranch the state capitol and the mexican border i worked very closely with the fbi and the cia on the joint terrorism task forces in that capacity i practiced law as a federal prosecutor under the usa patriot act provisions including the one that brought down the wall i also served as deputy attorney general under then attorney general and now united states senator john cornyn i would like to take us back to the last decade in 1995 the unitedstates attorney general adopted policies and procedures for contacts between the fbi and the criminal division concerning foreign counterintelligence investigations this policy prohibited the criminal division from directing or controlling foreign counterintelligence investigations eventually those procedures would be narrowly interpreted to act as a wall to prevent the fbi and intelligence officials from communicating with the criminal division as noted by the 9 11 commission report this wall may have created a climate that helped contribute to 9 11 an fbi agent testified that efforts to conduct a criminal investigation of two of the hijackers were blocked due to concerns over the wall frustrated he wrote to fbi headcquarters saying someday someone will die and wall or not the public will not understand why we were not more effective in throwing every resource we had at certain problems let us hope the national security law unit will then stand behind their decisions especially since the biggest threat to us now osama bin laden is getting the most protection this was 9 11 another illustration of the wall creating dangerous confusion is in the case of wen ho lee and the los alamos investigation the first time the chief of the counter espionage section in the justice department heard the name wen ho lee was when he read about him in the new york times indeed in my own experience i was assigned to investigate allegations that china attempted to corrupt and influence our elections with the cooperation of witnesses we were able to uncover some evidence that the director of chinese intelligence may have funneled money to influence the presidential elections the frustration came from the lack of coordination and communication with the foreign counterintelligence side of the house particularly when our criminal investigation moved into the intelligence arena ultimately these examples portray an inefficient system in which the left hand literally did not know what the right hand was doing as stated by the foreign intelligence surveillance act quarterly review they said indeed effective counterintelligence we have learned requires the wholehearted cooperation of all government personnel who can be brought to the task a standard which punishes such cooperation could well be thought dangerous to national security today thanks to the patriot act that wall has come down the patriot act helps us connect the dots by removing the legal barriers that prevented law enforcement and the intelligence community from sharing information and coordinating activities in a common effort to protect national security it dismantled the walls of separation and enabled a culture of cooperation that is essential to our integrated antiterrorism campaign the president and the attorney general recognized that without the ability to share information including intelligence we risk the very survival of this nation as stated by senator leahy about the patriot act this bill breaks down traditional barriers between law enforcement and foreign intelligence this is not done just to combat international terrorism but for any criminal investigation that overlaps a broad definition of foreign intelligence my experience in the justice department after the wall came down was profound and dramatically improved as chief of counterterrorism i spearheaded the efforts of the joint terrorism task force no longer did the barriers of communication exist indeed the fbis foreign counterintelligence agents and the intelligence community were full partners at the table forthe first time the fbi intelligence files were reviewed by criminal division prosecutors and agents our greatest task and our greatest task today remains to identify and locate the terror cells which may be in this very country one of the tools we used to achieve this goal was through the use of national security wire taps under the foreign intelligence surveillance act in addition to these wiretaps the patriot act provides many other tools for law enforcement in the war on terror first the patriot act updated the law to the technology of today no longer will we have to fight a digital age battle with antique weapons legal authorities left over from the era of rotary telephones next it promotes efficiency by providing for nationwide search warrants in terrorist cases investigators and prosecutors save valuable time because they are able to petition the local federal judge who is the most familiar with the case and who is overseeing the nationwide investigation while most of the matters i worked on since the patriot act remain classified one example that i can share this evening was a provision in the patriot act which was extremely helpful in a case involving allegations of a terrorist attack on july 4 2003 in late june we received intelligence from a specific and credible source that a terrorist attack was going to occur on july 4 in my home state of texas at the same time we also received emails from an internet chat room from an individual named apostasy hears voices he threatened to commit terrorist acts at numerous locations throughout the united states as a member of an unknown terrorist cell and specifically the individual threatened on july 4 2003 significant locations in austin texas washington d c new york miami charlotte san francisco seattle and portland would be attacked by terrorists the voice stated i have planned a little event for july 4 roasted americans on independence day it will be the second largest terrorist demonstration in unitedstates history he described himself as having the name ali aussie a student at the university of texas who had been on a mission for 4 years on a student visa as a member of a terrorist cell he stated that each cell acts independently for the most part so that if one cell gets caught the other cells are not compromised which is consistent with how al qaeda operates he concluded with the following words i did enjoy watching americans burn alive in the wtc event bbq americans we were getting this realtime from the internet chat room the jttf quickly went into action sharing intelligence information and coordinating with multiple jurisdictions by utilizing the patriot act iwas able to save valuable time by obtaining a nationwide search warrant for electronic evidence for terroristrelated activities given the urgency of the matter and the potential loss of human life time was critical and of the essence these provisions allowed us to execute search warrants on the internet service provider in realtime once we received the information an arrest warrant was obtained and the defendant was arrested on july 3 the day before the planned attack the defendant was charged with using the internet to make threats to kill or injure persons by an explosive device fortunately the threat on that day turned out to be a hoax but had it been a real threat and we have to assume they all are we would have saved lives that in my judgment is what the patriot act is all about protecting and saving lives there has been much talk from critics of the patriot act regarding allowing many of the informationsharing provisions in the law having served under its provisions before and after the bringing down of the wall and the implementation of the patriot act i can envision no bigger national security mistake than to go back to the way things were the patriot act takes laws which have long applied to drug dealers and organized crime and applies them to terrorists for example for years law enforcement has beenable to use roving wiretaps which follow all communications used by a suspect as opposed to just one telephone line the patriot act simply authorizes the use of this technique in national security intelligence investigations and amends the foreign intelligence surveillance act to conform to the parallel provision found in the federal wiretap statute contrary to critics assertions the justice department cannot do anything without court supervision the usa patriot act does not abrogate the role played by the judiciary in the oversight of activities of federal law enforcement federal agents still have to obtain judicial approval before they can search a residence and before they can install a wiretap i would like to leave members with the following words which are disturbing but i think kind of ring home why we are here tonight and talking about this important issue the confrontation that we are calling for with the apostate regimes does not know socratic debates platonic ideals or aristotle diplomacy but it does know the dialogue of bullets the ideals of assassination bombing and destruction and the diplomacy of the cannon and the machine gun islamic governments have never and will never be established through peaceful solutions and cooperative councils they are established as they always have been through pen and gun by word and bullet and by tongue and teeth the words that i just read are the preface to the al qaeda training manual these words demonstrate the widely held belief that the question is not if the terrorists will strike us again but rather when and where and we had better be prepared thomas jefferson once said the cost of freedom is eternal vigilance those words ring more true today than ever before we owe it to the citizens of this country to reauthorize the usa patriot act for if we do not and another terrorist attack occurs on our soil on our shores we will surely all be held accountable"], [0.0006881952285766602, 0.5006881952285767, 0, "i rise in support of h res 861 and believe many of my colleagues on the other side of the isle have said that the war in iraq has nothing to do with the global war on terrorism i could not disagree more with their assessment iraq is the central front in the overall global war on terrorism an immediate withdrawal would merely embolden our terrorist enemies and lead to open season on america and our allies we cannot allow this to happen we must prevail in iraq the stakes are too high to fail coalition forces are having a great deal of success in iraq the recent killing of terrorist leader abumusab alzarqawi along with seven of his aides is a serious blow to alqaedas operation the man osama bin laden called the prince of al qaeda in iraq arguably had more innocent blood on his hands in the last few years than any other terrorist zarqawi led one of the most deadly insurgent groups in iraq in a bloody campaign of bombings shootings beheadings and kidnappings aimed at killing iraqi shias to incite sectarian violence and derail democracy in iraq furthermore after receiving confirmation of zarqawis death coalition and iraqi security forces conducted 17 simultaneous raids in the baghdad area yielding a treasure trove of information and intelligence that is being analyzed for future use iraqs national security adviser mouwafak alrubaie said today that these documents and computer records would give the iraqi government the upper hand in its fight against alqaeda in iraq we believe that this is the beginning of the end of alqaeda in iraq alrubaie said add ing that the documents showed alqaeda is in pretty bad shape politically and in terms of training weapons and media now we have the upper hand he said we feel that we know their locations the names of their leaders their whereabouts their movements through the documents we found during the last few days he also said that he believed the security situation in the country would improve enough to allow a large number of unitedstates led forces to leave iraq by the end of this year and a majority to depart by the end of next year and maybe the last soldier will leave iraq by mid2008 he said throughout american history we have been tested in times of war but virtually every time we stayed the course and prevailed we did not experience quick victory in the american revolution in fact it took our founding fathers years to win our hardfought independence we were defeated at the battles of long island harlem heights white plains and others and we will never forget the dark days at valley forge yet we did not give up our desire for freedom and lets not forget in world war ii where we suffered rapid and repeated defeats at guam wake island the philippines and kassenne pass we must also remember that the terrorists were at war with us long before we were at war with them in april 1983 63 people including the cias middle east director were killed in a suicide truckbomb attack on the unitedstates embassy in beirut later on that year simultaneous suicide truckbomb attacks on the american and french compounds in beirut killed 242 americans and 58 french in 1988 all 259 people on board pan am flight 103 were killed when a bomb believed to have been placed on the aircraft by libyan terrorists exploded these are just a few examples unfortunately mr speaker there are others noted islamic scholar bernard lewis has written that the sources of islanc antagonism toward the west stems from the belief that the american way of life is a direct threat to islamic values but it is basic western democracy that especially threatens islamic extremist because within its own community more and more muslims are coming to value the freedom that political democracy allows lewis has also written that attitudes toward the west have evolved through contacts with first the eastern empire in constantinople then spain portugal and france and through years of direct conflict in the crusades and the colonial wars of the 19th and 20th centuries as we can see the war on terrorism did not begin the global war on terrorism will not be won next week next year or even in the next 10 years like the cold war this struggle is a generational conflict potentially spanning decades the cold war stretched from asia to africa to the very heart of europe just as our struggle today reaches from the philippines to the mountains of afghanistan to as we recently saw our neighbor canada terrorism knows no bounds and will strike wherever freedom reigns from london to madrid to a quiet field in pennsylvania victory cannot be found on a single battlefield or a single treaty signing our enemy does wear a uniform and is not governed by international rules of war they have one goal kill as many americans as possible and establish tyrannical regimes that rule according to a violent and intolerant distortion of islam the war on terror will be a long war yet we have mobilized to win other long wars and we can and will win this

troops told us that we are winning the war because of our intervention a murderous dictator and a totalitarian regime have been overthrown free elections have been held a new constitution has been drafted and ratified and a new national unity government has been completed iraq is only one theater in the overall global war on terror and success in iraq is vital to victory much has been

here to raise the issue on a number of bits of subject matter and as i sat and listened of course the subject changed a little bit as i listened to the group here on the other side and i think that it is important to edify americans as to the difference between republicans and democrats and i am just really grateful that when i was born and i was reared in a family i began to build a certain attitude about life and as that attitude unfolded i was taught from the beginning to fend for yourself you are going to have to get out there and make something out of yourself in this lifetime because nobody is going to do it for you your ship will never come in take control of your life so at an early age i realized that when i was born my glass was half full and it was my job to get out of bed go to work every day and go ahead and fill that glass up i was not raised with an attitude and neither did i gather an attitude that my glass was half empty i was always grateful that i was born here in america and when i would ask my parents what is the best country in the world to come from they would always answer the united states of america is the best country in the world eat your cold mashed potatoes there are people starving in china that is kind of the composite of the upbringing that i had but grateful for this nation and i would always ask why what is the difference and probe into these other countries and of course the people starving in china part was what we talked about then but country after country in the aftermath of world war i we were the only surviving industrial nation and this nation that had preserved freedom for the world for the entire globe and had we not done that we would not be standing here today speaking in english for example but speaking in a free way with free ideas and having this free exchange i stand at the same spot on which tom delay gave his last speech here in this congress and he made a point that i think is an important one and that is that yes there is partisanship and yes we have sharp disagreements we have those disagreements because we have a constitution that protects our rightto do so but he made a point that was you show me a nation that does not have partisanship and i will show you a tyranny so when we disagree we need to be grateful that we can disagree and we should base that on fundamental philosophical differences and highlight those but there is a difference in human nature part of human nature is like me that sees our glass half full part of human nature is like the people on the other side of the aisle that see their glass and the glass of their constituents as half empty and that is all right if you look at it from that perspective but then you have to take it to the next level and the next level is those that see their glass half full set about going to work to fill it and we pull each other up the ladder because we know that as we all go out and work and produce and market and save and invest that that helps everyone that this economy grows this is not a zero sum game it is not a goose that has so many golden eggs in it where we can just simply slaughter the goose and harvest the eggs it is an economy that needs to have inputs it needs to have capital investment both intellectual capital and real dollars in a real way we need to have entrepreneurs we need to keep generating new ideas this organism of our economy has a lot of components in it and it needs to be working and churning and when we go in there and we tap into this organism of our economy and we start to take from it and not put into it then it slows down the growth of our economy and it grows slowly but this was an economy that when ronald reagan was sworn in outside this building in 1980 the dow jones was below 1 000 i do not remember the exact number but i know it was below 1 000 today it is at 11 000 that is a good measure of what has happened with our economy and that should be something that should tell the american people that when your glass is half full and you go to work to fill that glass up the rest of the way and you help your brethren up the ladder along the way that the sum total of the size of the pie which is divided up amongst now 300 million americans gets greater and greater and greater and that means when the pie is bigger the size of the pieces can be bigger for each individual that is involved this is not a matter of taking from the rich and giving to the poor this is a matter which the argument that i am hearing really slows down this economy and that when you tax someone for the labor they do you punish them for that labor ronald reagan also said what you tax you get less of e 1830 so we have a first lien on all productivity in america the federal government has the first lien on all productivity in america so we tax production we tax earnings savings and investment we tax social security we tax your pension we tax your capital gains your income tax your corporate income tax your partnership income tax also we tax your earnings on investments and your alternative minimum tax all those things are taxed well when there is a tax applied to anything it is a disincentive to produce so the first lien on all productivity in america slows down the productivity in america but it does gather dollars from those wages to run the federal government now if you think your glass is half empty and it is not a growing economy but simply something a same size pie every year that gets divided up differently depending on who has the political power not depending on who produces into this economy eventually what you are doing is you are killing the goose that lays the gololen eggs harvesting the eggs and thinking some how there is going to be another goose come along it will not there will not be another goose come along this is the one we are going to have to nurture this economy that is growing the one producing the golden eggs that are popping out here it is because people have invested capital and taken risks and put in sweat equity and had a vision and made a sacrifice with their time and their dollars and sometimes from their families to make their businesses run or to go to their jobs to help their companies operate or sit in the basement or up in the attic working sometimes working on inventions that become creative inventions that increase and contribute to this dynamic economy that we have so much was said about the national debt my glass is half full and i am going to work to fill it up most americans are doing that that is why republicans have control of the house the senate and the white house some folks believe their glass is half empty and if they sit around with their tin cup then let me tell you that cup will never be full you have to take charge of your life now that doesnt mean that we dont have compassion in fact everybody in america has access to high quality health care we have the highest percentage of personal ownership of their homes ever in the history of the united states and i would submit in the history of the world that home ownership was at 68 percent the last time i checked if you go into the poverty regions you have a higher home ownership there than ever before this administration has been great for people who are on the lower income side of this and i have got a proposal i will talk about that will make it even better yet but i want to give everybody hope i want to give them all hope that there is a reason to get out of bed to go to work and make your life better in fact to solve the pathologies in the united states it is a pretty simple equation and that is simply this for people who are going to have children to get married and stay married get a job and keep a job statistically that solves almost all of societys pathologies it is not a complicated equation we need to encourage people to go to work most do out of 300 million people in america there are 7 5 million on the unemployment rolls those numbers have been actually inching down as new jobs have been created there is about another 4 3 million that are on welfare and another 5 3 million that have exhausted their unemployment benefits that are still looking for a job but are not technically listed on the unemployment list that as a percentage of america isnt particularly large but altogether between the ages of 16 and on up through retirement there are 77 5 million nonworking americans in this society we have a large labor force there that we can go to when we need that labor force but we have made good progress with the unemployment lists also there we havent reached the lowest unemployment i would point out that when people say we are at full employment at 5 percent unemployment or 4 7 percent unemployment i dont accept that number the lowest unemployment that i can find statistically throughout at least the last 100 years or so that we have kept records is 1 2 percent unemployment and that was during world war ii so i qualify that statement but that was when we had all hands on deck if we really get in trouble we can be all hands on deck again we havent needed to do that so we do have a large labor force that is here and we can draw from that but as i listened to the members on the other side of the aisle the group that has consistently been down here using the word republican as if it were a four letter word i dont know how to spell it with only four letters but i know how they say it when it sounds like a four letter word they talk about the national debt they talk about a balanced budget and they talk about the balanced budget under bill clinton i can tell you there was a balanced budget under bill clinton but there were budgets that were sent to president clinton that were vetoed because he sent them back and demanded more spending over and over again this government was shut down by a veto of bill clinton not because he was insisting that we should balance the budget he was insisting that he wanted more money that was the issue here back during the clinton years i will admit that there was a partisan divide going on during that time and i will say that the republicans in this congress presented those first balanced budgets that we had seen in decades and they insisted that the budgets be balanced and that is what happened it wasnt because bill clinton was ponding on his podium asking for balanced budgets he was demanding more spending now a decade later i hear members of his party come here on the floor it take credit for the balanced budget during the clinton years when yes he signed them all right he did not have a lot of choice but this congress this republican congress made him balance the budget in fact they balanced the budget and they required him to sign it then in the aftermath or in the latter months of the clinton administration we had this thing going on called the dot com bubble i dont know if we realized it was a dot com bubble until it burst but when you think about it it had to happen in fact my instincts were telling me that it was this that we had technologically because of great inventions by americans and the stimulation that we have here and the structure that rewards productivity invented the technology that allowed us to store and transfer information more effectively more efficiently and cheaper than ever before it was an amazing ride to see that dot com bubble go up in our stock markets because the people were investing in these dot com companies on the anticipation that there would be a financial reward on the other end that would be in proportion to our ability to store and transfer that information more cheaply than ever before well it didnt work out quite that way because information has value but it isnt measured just by the amount of information it is measured by its commercial value and information as a commercial value has to allow you to produce a good or service and that deliverthat good or service more efficiently than before otherwise as a business you dont have an interest for paying for that information in the case of the internet would be a good example it is also marketable that you can get people to pay for their internet service so that they can have recreational information on the internet service so you can use that internet for business purposes and you will pay for that and people also pay for it for recreational purposes that is the only two ways that information has a value in the marketplace so we overspeculated on our ability to store and transfer information more cheaply and more efficiently than ever before and that was the dot com bubble well the lawsuit on microsoft i believe was the lance that pierced the dot com bubble it would have burst anyway because it was a growing bubble that was speculation but when that lawsuit came and the lance of the lawsuit against microsoft pierced the dot com bubble then we saw the stock market begin to contract in fact a lot of us will say we were moving into a recession and i will say we were and that was at the end of the clinton administration on top of that we inaugurated president bush out here on the west portico when that happened he was in the middle of this bursting of the dot com bubble and the decline in our stock market and our economy we hardly got a handle on what was happening there and along came september 11 the terrible damage to our financial institutions in the heart of new york city at ground zero the twin towers and of course the attacks on the pentagon and the crash of the plane in pennsylvania that was an attack on our financial centers that sent it into a further downward spiral so we had two things working against this economy the formerly balanced budget running into the dot com bubble that shut down the revenues here and dramatically reduced our revenues here in the federal government and on the heels of that came the september 11 attack and the impact on our financlals in the united states of america was dramatic then on the heels of that we had to create a homeland security department that spent billions of dollars to protect 300 million americans and has done so very effectively we have not been attacked on our own soil since that time in any effective way and additionally we had to appropriate money because we went to war in the global war on terror all of those things stacked against this economy and do you know we are growing back out of this thing because there was vision on the part of president bush there was vision on the part of his financial advisers and vision on the part of the leadership in this congress that had the fortitude to come to this floor and propose tax cuts that stimulated this economy if president bush had not had the vision and the courage to do that if this congress hadnt had the vision and courage to step forward and propose and initiate these tax cuts the bush tax cuts as we know them now we would have seen a depression not just a recession but a depression in this economy and that would have been the pri6e we would have paid if we would have stuck with i will say the philosophy that we have heard over here on how we ought to be running a balanced budget the people on the other side of the aisle if they had been in the majority in this congress would have proposed tax increases they would have said well first of all lets not take on these global terrorists lets figure out a way that we can curl up into a national fetal position and perhaps we could have just put enough guards at every school and every bus stop and every theater and every church and maybe even every home and turned america into one great big huge israel and somehow or another cowered away and apologized to the terrorists and maybe they wouldnt have attacked us again but they would have they attacked us in the first place didnt they so under the leadership of the other side of the aisle there would not have been a proactive tipofthespear effort in afghanistan there would not have been a proactive tipofthespear effort in iraq they would have turned the united states into one huge israel and that would be a defensive posture with enemies all around wondering where they are going to come from next that is not the way i want to live i refuse to live that way i insist that we exercise our rights to live in freedom and freedom requires risk it requires sacrifice and there is danger involved but it is worth it it is worth it from the time patrick henry articulated it so well it is worth it from the time that it has been articulated so well by my colleagues on this floor on this side of the aisle and i am honored just to be a part of that but we took on the war on terror and it is interesting to me that before our troops went into afghanistan there was much objection to the foolhardy nature of mounting a military operation in a country that had never been invaded successfully and occupied before in all of history and yet that took place successfully on the part of our united states military working with our coalition forces many of our coalition forces they said it couldnt be done they said it was another vietnam they said the passes in the mountains would be impassable and no one could sustain a military operation through there because they would be ambushed over and over again and that the people in afghanistan couldnt handle freedom they had never had that freedom before they had never voted there before this wasnt the kind of people that could handle freedom well they were right about one thing they had never voted there before but there were american soldiers and american marines that were on the ground guarding the travel routes to the polling places guarding the polling places and i am very proud of the iowa national guardsmen that were there at that time on that soil that provided an opportunity for the afghani people for the first time in the history of the world since adam and eve to go to the polls and choose their leaders and direct their national destiny of 25 million people a huge accomplishment when that liberty bell rang across the globe and the inspiration that comes from that carries over to the issue of iraq now this issue with iraq it is the same size country 25 million people in afghanistan 25 million people until iraq the complaint i hear on the other side of the aisle is that secretary rumsfeld and president bush didnt listen to the military advisers because the people on the other side of the aisle found a general that disagreed i dont know if it was a sunday afternoon or monday morning quarterback but they found a general that disagreed well i understand there are about 9 000 generals in our military and if you can find one that disagrees in fact i saw six that disagreed and it tfkes a long time to gather those kind of people 1 i will bet that some of those people will show up in the campaigns for the presidency working for candidates by the year 2008 i expect i will see some of those generals that claim that they counseled for the opposite working with and foi presidential candidates for democrats on the other side of the aisle i am not suggesting that they have a motive i am just suggesting that they have a different philosophy about the ifuture of america even though they are generals and even though they are literally a handful out of the 9 000 generals that we have buttthe advice that the president followed and the advice that secretary rumsfeld followed was the same people advising in afghanistan for the most part as advised in iraq the same number of people 25 million people in afghanistan 25 million people in iraq we heard the same arguments its another vietnam its a quagmire you never can do that no one could go into iraq and invade and occupy that country we didnt really we liberated them we had an armored column go across iraq to baghdad in less time than ever in the history of the world baghdad itself was the largest city ever in the history of the world to be invaded and occupied by a foreign power absolutely a true statement berlin was the next largest that i could find and that was far smaller than baghdad but they only occupied it for a split second as they erroneously put up the american flag and then realized this is the wrong message to send to the iraqi people were here to liberate you and they ran the iraqi flag back up the flagpole you havent seen an american flag fly around there since then because the iraqi people are liberated they give me smiles and they give me thumbs up when i go to that country because they are still grateful the gentleman from pennsylvania that has been on the floor so many hours here in the last couple of weeks he finds a different view you can find whatever it is that you want to support your argument but in this case i stand with our soldiers i stand with our marines i stand with the judgment that said go to iraq and in fact there have been some announcements today that i could take up in a little bit i am very happy at this time to yield so much time as he may consume to my friend mr ehlers for any remarks he may choose to make"], [0.0006892681121826172, 0.5006892681121826, 1, "i come to this house debate discuss h res 861 the republican leaderdeeply frustrated over the chaos in iraq i ship has been promising for weeks that the voted against authorizing president bush to house would have a genuine debate about take us to war in iraq i believed in 2002 and the future of unitedstates military involvement in iraq am more certain today that this war has been given that promise i am disappointed that h a grave mistake res 861 is a truly hollow effort despite the i have nothing but respect for eloquent words used the resolution has no lethe honorable american service men and gaily binding impact it does nothing to require women who have been put into harms way a reevaluation of unitedstates policies in iraq or to however the goodwill i feel for these brave change the status quo it does nothing to adamericans is contrasted by my lack of con dress the mistakes that have been made in fidence in president bush and the defense iraq the american people particularly our department leadership once they got us into troops serving honorably in difficult cirthis war they have time and again ignored cumstances in iraq deserve more than sound military planning and blatantly dis cheerleading and sloganeering unfortunately regarded the violent grinding reality that has empty promises are all this resolution offers steadily descended on iraq over the past 3 a vote for this resolution is a vote for the years status quo it is a vote for staying indefinitely as members of congress it is one of our in iraq perhaps a decade or longer it is a highest duties to hold the civilian and military vote for continuing with the current policies leadership accountable when they take our with no end in sight i cannot support endorsnation to war to date 2 500 american serv ing the status quo on march 21 2006 presiice men and women have been killed and dent bush actually said that the question of more than 18 000 more have been injured bringing home unitedstates troops from iraq will be there are no higher stakes than these unfor decided by future presidents signaling that tunately h res 861 does nothing to demand unitedstates troops will not be home until 2009 at the that the bush administration correct its disas earliest the american people need to undertrous policies in iraq stand that a vote in favor of this resolution is earlier this year general anthony zinni a vote to stay in iraq until at least 2009 former commander of the unitedstates central com let me address my specific concerns with mand pointedly expressed the views of many the text of the resolution many americans about iraq when he said first i am concerned that the resolution in we are paying the price for the lack of cred appropriately lumps iraq in with the socalled ible planning or the lack of a plan ten years global war on terror it was osama bin laden worth of planning were thrown away troop and aiqaeda who attacked the unitedstates on seplevels dismissed out of hand these were tember 11 2001 not saddam hussein and strategic mistakes mistakes of policy made iraq i believe it was a mistake to move intelback here ligence and military assets away from the fight my constituents and people against alqaeda which did not have a presacross the nation want a clear plan for suc ence in iraq prior to the unitedstates invasion in order cess in iraq americans want to believe that to attack iraq iraq did not pose a direct threat there can be a successful end to this conflict to unitedstates national security had not attacked the and that our soldiers marines and other per u 3 and could be contained with sanctions sonnel will return home soon unfortunately it inspections and nofly zones is hard to hold onto this hope given the presi second and perhaps of most concern the dents stubborn refusal to acknowledge the resolution endorses keeping unitedstates troops in failures in his iraq policy we must change iraq until there is a sovereign free secure course and united iraq by that standard the unitedstates the united states has a critical role in help will be in iraq for a decade or more that is ing iraqis to build a peaceful democratic soci unacceptable and unnecessary and in fact it ety i am certain however that an open undermines unitedstates national security by indefiended unitedstates military presence in iraq will not nitely tying up unitedstates intelligence and military assets that could be better used finding osama bin laden and breaking the back of alqaeda around the world the unitedstates cannot impose freedom security and unity in iraq by force those worthy goals can only be achieved by the iraqi people themselves which will only happen when the iraqi people and their leaders decide to put aside their sectarian differences the unitedstates cannot force sunnis shias and kurds to make peace or to act for the common good they have been in conflict for 1 400 years nor should the unitedstates military be forced to remain in iraq essentially as an army for one side of a civil war as long as the unitedstates military remains stuck with the presidents pledge of unending openended support iraqi politicians and security forces will use the unitedstates presence as a crutch establishing a timeline to bring the bulk of our troops home and redeploy others to fight alqaeda would force the iraqi people politicians and security forces to resolve their differences establish an effective and inclusive government end sectarian violence and create a secure society the unitedstates military cannot solve the sectarian problems in iraq only the iraqis can proponents of the resolution say that those like me who want our troops to come home are defeatist and want to cut and run from iraq to the contrary i believe the unitedstates military has already done all that has been asked of them saddam hussein is on trial the threat from alleged weapons of mass destruction programs in iraq has been neutralized the programs do not exist and didnt before the war for that matter the iraqi people have written and adopted a new constitution and elected a new government it is time to turn over control of the country to the iraqi government iraqi security forces and the iraqi people to build their own future second the resolution contains the blatantly false assertion that negotiating a timeline for bringing unitedstates troops home with the iraqi government undermines unitedstates national security such a statement shows a misunderstanding of the enemy we face in iraq although today the president and proponents of this resolution fail to distinguish between the various enemies we face in iraq in a speech on december 12 2005 the president actually did make important distinctions between the insurgent elements in iraq he mentioned rejectionists which are mostly sunni arabs who miss the privileged status they enjoyed under saddam hussein he mentioned saddamists who are former regime elements who want to return to power again they are sunni arabs and he mentioned foreign terrorists affiliated with or inspired by alqaeda which even the president acknowledged was the smallest element of the insurgency the one huge element he left out was nationalist shias such as those influenced by moqtada alsadr the reality is that the rejectionists saddamists and nationalist shias who combined make up the vast bulk of the insurgents in iraq have no interest in attacking the unitedstates homeland they just want unitedstates military forces out of their own country they have no designs on our country so it is misleading at best to argue that if we dont fight the insurgents there we will fight them in the streets of the united states even the foreign terrorist elements in iraq seem more focused on igniting a shiasunni civil war in the middle east and attacking regimes they consider infidels in the region such the jordanian monarchy it is also misleading to pretend that if the unitedstates leaves that somehow osama bin laden will take control of iraq there is no chance that the shias and kurds who represent around 80 percent of the population in iraq will allow foreign terrorist elements to take over the country even the majority of the sunnis have grown tired of foreign terrorists operating in iraq with respect to the argument about waiting us out as long as the sunni shia and kurds cannot resolve their political differences violence will continue in iraq it is not a matter of whether were there or not it is ridiculous to assume that the insurgent elements will stop attacking once a timeline for bringing unitedstates troops home is announced and will wait to start again until after we leave i believe that negotiating a timeline for bringing unitedstates forces home is a prerequisite for stabilizing iraq over the next several months announcing the termination of the openended unitedstates military commitment in iraq and providing a concrete plan including a timeline negotiated with the iraqi government for bringing our troops home would undermine support for insurgents public opinion polls show that nearly 9 in 10 iraqis support announcing a timeline for unitedstates withdrawal and 70 percent want the unitedstates out by the end of 2007 the unitedstates cannot want to stay in iraq more than the iraqis themselves want us there as the commander of unitedstates forces in iraq general george casey testified to congress last year the perception of occupation in iraq is a major driving force behind the insurgency a specific withdrawal plan with benchmarks for measuring success in stabiliing iraq could unite iraqis sunni shia and kurd against the foreign terrorists operating in iraq that would be a key turning point in stabilizing the country a timeline for bringing unitedstates troops home that is negotiated with the iraqi government would also boost the iraqi governments legitimacy and claim to selfrule and force the iraqi government to take responsibility for itself and its citizens negotiating a timeline and strategy with the iraqi government could more than possibly anything else improve the standing of the iraqi government in the eyes of its own people a significant achievement in a region in which the standing of rulers and governments is generally low similarly establishing a firm timeline for bringing our troops home could accelerate the development of iraqi security forces and deepen their commitment to defending their own country and their own government it would eliminate the conflict they now feel by working with what many of them see as an occupying force it would allow them to defend a sovereign iraqi government rather than fight alongside unitedstates forces a plan to bring the bulk of our troops home from iraq and free up intelligence and defense assets to redeploy to fight alqaeda particularly in afghanistan and along the afghanistanpakistan border could also help the united states in our broader fight against islamic extremists with global ambitions it would makethe unitedstates safer by taking away a recruiting tool and training ground former director of the cia porter goss testified to congress that islamic extremists are exploiting the iraqi conflict to recruit new antiunitedstates jihadists these jihadists who survive will leave iraq experienced and focused on acts of urban terrorism he went on to say the iraq conflict while not a cause of extremism has become a cause for extremists in addition to a timeline i have proposed that unitedstates troops be removed from front line combat positions in iraqi cities and towns turning over daily security patrols interactions with citizens and any offensive security acti6ns to the iraqis themselves the training and equipping of iraqi security forces should be accelerated the unitedstates must renounce any unitedstates interest in constructing permanent unitedstates military bases in iraq it is also important to accelerate reconstruction spending and grant the bulk of reconstruction contracts to local companies employing iraqis rather than multinational corporations whom have proven inefficient inflexible sometimes fraudulent and have even imported workers rather than employing iraqis the unitedstates embassy in baghdad should also be reduced to normal size and authority rather than establishing one of the largest embassies in the world third i am concerned that the resolution continues to mislead the american people about the threat posed by saddam hussein saddam hussein was a brutal tyrant i am glad he is now on trial for crimes against humanity but opposition to a dictator is not the measure i use when deciding whether to send our men and women in uniform off to war and possible death for me there must be a direct threat to unitedstates national security to justify the sacrifice of the blood and wealth of fellow americans in the case of iraq i didnt see that the resolution claims that hussein supported terrorists and constituted a grave threat against global peace and security saddam hussein did pay the families of palestinian suicide bombers so in that sense he did support terrorists but he did not support the terrorists who attacked the unitedstates the 9 11 commission and other experts have found no operational links between iraq and alqaeda further as i previously mentioned saddam hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction programs and could be contained by sanctions inspections and nofly zones finally i would like to bring my colleagues attention to a survey of 100 top foreign policy experts just released by the center for american progress and foreign policy magazine the survey indicates that despite the cheerleading were hearing on the house floor today the unitedstates is not winning the war against islamic terrorists and iraq has undermined our efforts more than 80 percent of the experts surveyed believe the unitedstates is becoming less safe even 71 percent of the selfidentified conservative experts said the unitedstates is not winning the war on terror twentyeight percent of respondents including 26 percent of the conservatives said the iraq war is the principal reason the unitedstates is less safe second only to the more generic reason of rising muslim hostility toward the unitedstates an astonishing 87 percent of respondents including 69 percent of conservatives said that the war in iraq has had a negative impact on unitedstates security and nearly 60 percent said the unitedstates needs to put more focus on bringing our troops home the results of this survey of top foreign policy experts from across the ideological spectrum are sobering and directly contradict the blind optimism and endorsement of the status quo that is reflected in h res 861 it is unfortunate that the republican leadership continues to prohibit an open and honest debate about the fight againsf radical islamic terrorists like aiqaeda and the distinct issue of the best strategy for bringing our troops home from iraq the american people deserve better"], [0.0006893277168273926, 0.5006893277168274, 0, "i thank the gentleman from iowa for his leadership on this issue and how much we appreciate that leadership you know i stand tonight for our men and women in uniform and in my district the men and women and families at fort campbell and also our guardsmen and our reservists and all of those that are deployed how much we appreciate their sacrifice how much we appreciate the great work that they do in order to be able to be certain that we preserve freedom that we have the ability for children in this nation to know that they are going to grow up in freedom 1815 this is so those children will have the ability to dream big dreams to look at the future with hope with the expectancy of opportunities that will come their way we do thank our men and women in uniform and i thank them i thank this house today that approved a bill that will allow for a pay raise for our military we are grateful for that and for the actions of this body i am so pleased to join you tonight as we turn our thoughts to iraq and what is happening in afghanistan because those are centers and they are battles in the war on terror the war on terror is a global war when we talk about the war on terror we are not talking about one specific place or one specific battle the global war on terror is something that is localized right now in iraq but we do know that while this is the battleground of today while afghanistan is the battleground while the middle east is the breeding ground for much of the terrorism that has been disbursed all across the globe we know that we have to look at this as a global war we have to know that this is going to be a long war we have been told that by our leaders we have been attacked we know that we were attacked for two full decades before we stopped looking at terrorism as an act of civil disobedience and we started responding to terrorism as an act of war that seemed to all come to a head when we looked at iraq when we had a very evil dictator who continued to defy u n resolutions who continued to just repeatedly snub the u n and snub the free world and say i can be the bully of the region if i want to aild that came to an end after september we commend our men and women in uniform that have gone there to set free to set free a people to begin stamping out terrorism and to be certain that we are standing up democracy and partners in democracy that will yield a peace dividend for our children and our grandchildren i appreciate that the gentleman from iowa took a few moments to talk about some of the women in iraq and some of the women that have fought so valiantly for freedom and for democracy and for liberty i have had the opportunity to work with our iraqi womens caucus and work with our department of state and stepped forward and helped to mentor some of these women as they take those baby steps and then as they lead in putting democracy in place you know it is so amazing to talk to them and to read the emails that they send to us as we seek to encourage them and their work and their efforts some of the stories that they have told about atrocities that they have lived through how they watched the vicious nature of saddams henchmen and how they would brutalize people brutalize families and how these women have lived through that and have moved forward to take that leadership role and to step forward and say do not leave us now do not leave us now we are on the right track and we know it looks messy and we know it is going to be a long process and we know this is not easy but do not leave us i cannot help but think when i have these conversations with these women and when i see some of them maybe they are missing a finger maybe there is something that is wrong maybe they have suffered pain and torture and agony and you can see it in their faces and you can see it in their bodies but in their spirit what you hear is the desire to be certain that they have their shot at freedom that is what they want they want the opportunity to live freely to enjoy the benefits of freedom and i thnink that we have to keep that in mind as we move forward one of the things we repeatedly hear and of course i know the gentleman from iowa is like me we all want to see our troops come home come home victorious and we would like to have them all come home but i think we have to keep in mind that there is not going to be one specific event or one announced time where we say all right the work is done because this is a work in progress it is a work in progress and we have seen tremendous progress we have seen some tremendous stepping back we have seen some failures but we are seeing progress and we are going to continue to see progress take place we have seen the elections in january of 2005 all the way to the election in december of 2005 we have watched the formation of a new government and now we can look forward as they are putting in place a permanent government this is not a provisional government there is a government that will rule in that country they will govern they will be making the laws setting the laws and at the same time we are watching the iraqi security forces train develop the competencies that they need in order to secure their nation and begin to stand up and take charge it is exciting to see that type of progress take place it is exciting to see progress in afghanistan it is exciting to see that there is that hope there and it raises our concerns we have about the rest of the middle east about iran about the areas that surround there and you know i think we have to keep in mind why we do this why we are there why we are rooting out terrorism why we have rooted out a brutal dictator why we do this is because if we are fighting there we are not going to have to be fighting that over here how very important for us to keep that in mind taking this battle to them right there in the middle east in that breeding ground of terrorism taking the battle there helps us to do our best to keep this nation secure to allow us to continue to be a trustee of this great and wonderful legacy that we call freedom i want to thank the gentleman from iowa for yielding i want to thank him for his excellent work that he continues to do to speak out to support our men and women in uniform and to support our troops with the good work that they are doing and always his good words in protecting the cause of freedom with that i yield back to the gentleman"]]}
