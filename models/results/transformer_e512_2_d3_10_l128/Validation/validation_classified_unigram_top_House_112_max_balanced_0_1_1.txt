is a discussion focusing on jobs we need to get america back to work we have been focusing now on this side of the aisle in our committee work day after day after day to present proposals weve moved them weve adopted them here in the house the focus is on policies that are going to promote the private sector that are going to promote the development of an environment where people will take the risk and become job creators and put people back to work here in america i talk often in my office back in the district as i go out to town hall meetings and have conversations with people as i go down the street to our local supermarket and to our local stores i focus on four areas that we need to adopt legislation on here in washington d c or repeal legislation on in washington d c that will create an environment where jobs will be created for generations to come the first and probably the most appropriate and important focus that we should be spending time on today is the question of getting our fiscal house in order we have had a lot of debate over the last few months weeks about this debt ceiling thats coming to roost and the vote that were going to have to take here in the house i would imagine one of the reasons why that issue is so critical to us at this point in time is we need to demonstrate to the world that america is going to get its fiscal house in order once and for all so that our markets recognize that we are serious about this issue that we recognize that 14 trillion of national debt is just not sustainable and that it really will destroy america as we know it and more importantly what it will do when we send a message if we can adopt a policy here out of washington d c that deals with the debt ceiling but fundamentally deals with the underlying debt it will send a message that the american market is something that you can invest in again around the world that foreign investors domestic investors will have the confidence and the certainty that america is a place to invest your dollars your foreign currency to create the new environment the new marketplaces the new facilities the new manufacturers the new industrial base to put people back to work again i am extremely confident that we here in the house of representatives and particularly on our side of the aisle can come to a reasonable solution to this debt ceiling issue and do it in such a way that takes care of the debt ceiling crisis but that also takes care of the underlying debt crisis that put us into this situation and will continue to put us in this situation unless we get serious and deal with it now this is the time this is the moment and that will send that indication to the world that america is strong and we can invest here and put people back to work the second thing that i tell people as i go around and i talk to them in my district and i talk to people on the street and see them as we go down the road is that what we need to do in washington d c is to set the agenda out of the house that will create an environment where regulations out of washington d c are cut are repealed are streamlined so the bureaucratic red tape that our job creators that the private sector in america faces day in and day outas a private business owner myself before i came to this chamber starting and opening four businesses i can tell you as i went through employing people and taking the responsibility and taking the risk of putting my capital on the line putting my family on the line for all the time and the resources that we committed into it the bureaucracy that i dealt with in creating those businesses and putting those people back to work was mindboggling i talk to business owners all across america and people that want to go out and start their own businesses and what they tell me is all i want to do is manufacture my widget all i want to do is go out and provide the service that i enjoy doing that i have made my career or my passion in life but yet what i find myself doing when i go down this path is complying with paperwork complying with regulations spending hours upon hoursnot innovating not creating new technology not figuring out a better way to deliver services at a better price and in a better fashion or creating a new widget or creating a new product in a more efficient manner i spend hours filling out paperwork to comply with regulations coming out of washington d c and out of my state capitol and i will tell you that resonates with me thats why we need a policy here in washington d c that calls upon every regulatory body in washington to look at the impacts of their regulations from an economic point of view how its going to impact that creation that innovation of the private sector in a negative way and balance that in relationship to what the goal of the regulation is and sometimes those goals are very good a lot of our environmental laws are reasonable and regulations are reasonable but they take a balanced approach to accomplishing what we all wantclean air clean water a clean environment to pass on to our kids and to the next generation but at the same time we cant do it without recognizing that if we kill the american way of life that there will be no america for our children to enjoy so we have to have a commonsense balanced reasonable approach to this government and this regulatory expansion thats coming out of washington that needs to be crippled and needs to be cut and needs to be repealed so i have focused a lot of my effortand a lot of my colleagues have spent a lot of timetalking about and implementing legislation that will cut the agencys ability to promulgate those regulations that will destroy america unless theyre reined in so we need to focus on that second point the third point i have talked to so many folks about our tax code until im blue in the face as a member of the ways and means committee i can tell you that going through the 70 000 pages plus of the tax code and the tax regulations is mindnumbing and the problem is that were forcing all americans to try to comply with that code we have talked about this since we took the majority since i came here in november as an elected new member of congress i have spent a tremendous amount of time trying to advocate for comprehensive tax reform that will streamline the code make it much more competitive bring down the corporate rates and the individual rates to a point with the passthrough entities that have to be taken care of so that we are competitive on the world stage in dealing with our tax code i was glad to see the president the other day talking about in this debt ceiling debate how he was targeting some loopholes and exemptions and the corporate jets like were here on the republican side we came to congress we left our families we left our businesses because we want to protect corporate jets come on thats not being honest with the american people we have been talking about comprehensive tax reform from day one were ready to go im glad the president now has conceded that thats where we have to go and thats part of the debt ceiling conversation and it needs to be so the bottom line is is we make that tax code more competitive we streamline it so honest hardworking americans can comply with it and we revamp the code reform the code in such a way that its a competitive tax code that doesnt excessively burden those in the private sector and all taxpayers across america with that tax burden thats just going to kill america if we dont get this spending under control which those revenues from the tax code go to take care of the fourth point that i stress to people as i go around and i talk to them is that we need a domesticorientated energy policy that taps into our energy in such a way that its comprehensive it is an alloftheabove approach and what i mean by that is when i was the mayor of the city of corning and we would have people coming in and talking to us about siting a new facility or a new manufacturing base or a new operation there was always the part of the conversation that we got to that was okay why should i invest in the city of corning in the state of new york what are your tax rates what is the tax burden im looking at what are the insurance costs that im going to have to pick up by coming to the state of new york the city of corning the other issue that was repeatedly discussed in the top three of those conversations was what are your utility costs what is the cost to me for producing this new product or this new technology going to run me and thats where if we have a comprehensive energy policy focused on domestic supplies of energy not only will we be taking care of a national security issue with having these supplies of energy being produced from domestic sources of things such as natural gas from the marcellus shale or utica shale in my part of the state or shell formations and tight sand formations all across america but we have oil supplies that have been identified and are available to us if we just unleash those resources we have to say we go after these energy sources in a clean responsible manner environmentally safe and everybody i talk to supports that on our side of the aisle no one here is going to destroy the environment for the sake of getting energy out of the ground for the sake of hurting our children or our grandchildren thats not what we stand for but we stand for focusing on those energy supplies that are here and promote those energy supplies so that we have a source of energy thats dependable that will provide us with longterm lowcost sources of energy supplies to our manufacturing and industrial bases and reignite america again so that we become a powerhouse in the area of employment and put our people back to work so those are four key principles that we bring to the table and one additional piece that id like to talk about tonight that is ripe and ready for us to take is the expansion of opportunities of our exports we have three free trade agreements that are ready to go we have south korea we have colombia we have panama they have been negotiated there has been a long history many years of going back and forth with these countries and asking these countries to engage in honest negotiations that deal with all the issues that you deal with when you enter into a free trade agreement and both partieswe as the united states of america the governments of south korea colombia and panamahave come to the table in good faith and we have finally gotten to the point where we are ready to move on these agreements all the issues have been negotiated all the issues of the free trade agreements have been taken care of now i know there is an issue in washington d c that were still dealing with when it comes to trade adjustment assistance but fundamentally the free trade agreements have been negotiated and worked out with these countries and were ready to go but what are we doing were waiting on the white house to send them up here were waiting on the president who set in his state of the union message a goal of doubling our exports a great goal i applaud the goal but in order to double our exports out of america weve got to create an environment in which the private sector flourishes such as those four points and focus on those four points that i just talked about but we also have to expand the markets upon which those new products and our existing products can be sold to so that we can increase and meet that export goal thats why i supported the free trade agreements when i came to congress and as i went out on the campaign trail we have three great agreements that are ready to move be moved and ready to be voted on and i think have strong support on both sides of the aisle under the presidents own numbers these three agreements are looking to create at least 250 000 jobs this is coming out of his administration the agencies under his control are projecting that these agreements will provide opportunities for at least 250 000 new jobs to me this is a nobrainer we shouldnt be haggling back and forth and trying to figure out whats holding these agreements up ready for a vote these countries have negotiated with us in good faith weve had those hard negotiations and now were ready to go the president even mentioned the other day on tv when i was watching some news reports that he wants to move forward on these agreements but yet he hasnt sent them up to the congress as hes required to do by our laws in order to get them implemented i think its troublesome when you hear the president talk about setting a goal of increasing exports by 50 percent and say to the public that he is committed to these free trade agreements and that all congress has to do is pass them but yet when you look at the details all he has to do is send it up to congress and well take care of it but he hasnt taken the step necessary to do that and that is solely under his control to do so i call upon the president send these free trade agreements up were ready to go we have support lets open up the south korean markets lets open up the colombian market lets open up the panama markets lets give our people in america the benefits of these new export opportunities that each of these countries represents i come from a part of the state of new york where we have a lot of wine grape growers wine producers apple growers and i will tell you in the agricultural area this is going to be a great asset in particular these markets will represent new sources of opportunity to farmers who have been plowing and working this land for generations yet we here in washington d c just cannot figure out how to get this done because the president wont send it up for us to get the process taken care of so i call upon the president to move on these free trade agreements as soon as possible hes indicated to the american public his support for them he indicates that hes ready to pass them and sign them and ill just tell you im here to call him out on it and say we need to do it lets do it one other thing i wanted to talk about tonight is kind of my concern about the whole issue of this debt ceiling debate and where were going with it and ill tell you i am greatly concerned about the political rhetoric that we seem now to be committed to i see us in washington d c going down a path where were talking about situations where were going to hold back social security checks were going to hold back payments for funding our troops and i just dont see how thats productive what we have is a debt problem we have clearly articulated a plan on this side of the aisle we have come up with budgets that weve passed out of this house we have put down on paper proposals of where cuts could be made we went through the whole process of h r 1 back and forth for 7 days with an open debate on the floor of the house in front of the american people identifying areas that could be cut and that could be streamlined and we laid out our plan its in black and white but today i still dont know where the president of the united states is i hear a lot of news reports about some type of position that the president has taken on 4 trillion and it supposedly has 3 trillion worth of cuts and 1 trillion worth of tax increases ive never seen that actually ive heard discussions that have cited sources in the white house or sources off the hill that show the package having 3 trillion of tax increases with only 1 trillion worth of cuts now i dont know if thats the case because i dont know what the presidents really standing for because i have never seen it in black and white but what i would ask is that the president put it on a piece of paper because if hes asking me as a member of congress to support debt ceiling relief in exchange for 3 trillion worth of new taxes im not going to do that because that taxes everybody in america every man and woman and business in america it violates a campaign pledge made by the president in his campaign where he would not raise taxes on the middle class so i want to see what hes proposing i am greatly concerned that were also at the point where we need to have this conversation in front of the american people we need to have the american people weigh in on what the detailed proposal is you know weve been very transparent weve been very openwe here in the house especially on this side of the aisle the house republicans have put the budget out have gone through h r 1 have put documents out that have been scored by the cbo as to what impact theyll have financially but we havent seen anything from the president and the american people deserve the opportunity to know where the president is at in these discussions what we cannot do we cannot get to the 11th hour and say here it is america take it or leave it thats just not right thats just not responsible governing what we need to do is have a thoughtful honest debate back and forth with our positions mr president you said the other day dont call my bluff im going to go to the american people i tell you go to the american people i want to go to the american people i came to congress to have this discussion in the open in front of the world because its time we need to and until we see a plan we cant have that honest debate that our forefathers our founding fathers and so many have sacrificed to give us the transparency of democracy the transparency to come to this chamber that is filled with so much history and have the debate go to the senate floor and go into the living rooms of the american public and say this is what were talking about this is what were fighting about now i am ready to have that debate im ready to have that conversation and i know at the end of the day where i will come out i will stand for a product that gets this nation taken care of for generations because its fiscal house is once and for all taken care of if that means we have to compromise well compromise but lets have it we can only compromise upon which we know that is why it is so important that the president come forth in written fashion with his proposal i sent a letter to the white house today with many of my colleagues in the freshman class of which i am a proud member calling upon him to do that and hopefully he will do that my intent is to go down there physically next week with hopefully numerous other members of the freshman class and stand in front of the white house and say hey were new members of congress were here to have the conversation were ready to act give us what you stand for put in black and white what you stand for and what your position is and lets debate were ready to go so the bottom line is that as we go down this path through this debt ceiling crisisand we do have two crises we have the debt ceiling crisis that everyone knows about august 2 but we have the underlying debt crisis that causes us to have this debt ceiling problem that we now face we have to take care of both becausemake no mistake about itif we just do a simple raise the debt ceiling or something gimmicky that gets us through that august 2 or whatever the final date shall be and if we do it in such a way that theres really no meat on the bone and there is no substance to the proposalmake no mistake about itthe world markets are going to look right through that and see right through it and theyre going to say you guys are not serious about this 14 trillion worth of debt you guys in america are not serious about getting 1 6 trillion of annual budget deficits under control do you know what we have an obligation now to advise all of those members of the world who are going to invest in america that this is not that aaa rating that we have all enjoyed since 1917 i believe that america will be downgraded on its debt regardless if we default or not because we have not taken the moment we have not seized the moment to be honest with the american people and with the world and said were going to get it taken care of thats where i am at i am ready to get it taken care of thats what i came to washington d c to do thats what i know many of my fellow colleagues in the freshman class came to washington d c to do we dont care about reelection we dont care about politics were talking about the substance that will make sure that america is here for generations to come a few of my other colleagues had intended to join us this evening but i know we have a tradition here in the house that i am becoming aware of with the baseball game thats going on between the democrats and the republicans and i think as they attend to thatand thats a great tradition and i applaud my colleagues for taking the time to continue on in that traditioni know i have got another member potentially coming down here i have been given word i dont stand on these issues alone i dont stand with these comments in a vacuum i dont stand here today as one man in 435 members of congress who believes in what i am articulating there is an army of people in washington who are standing with me and with whom i am standing who believe the same way that it is time to get our fiscal house in order that it is time to advance an agenda out of washington d c that once and for all shows a firm commitment to the private sector and reins in government so that government does not kill the private sector and the dreams of all the americans that are yet to come so i am looking forward to continuing this debate and moving forward on the issues that we have talked about and as we deal with these issues i do it mindful of the situation that we face on a daytoday basis of the politics of washington d c but i will tell you even though i am aware of those politics the issues that we are talking about todaythe issues that we are facingtranscend politics i was pleased today that i was able to get an amendment offered on the floor in some of the debates in our appropriations process where i reached across the aisle to a colleague of mine from buffalo from the other side and we legislated we adopted policy we adopted an amendment to that appropriations bill that i think is going to be good for america and it showed i think in that instance to me and i hope to many others that we can work together that we can work together in a bipartisan fashion to tackle the issues that are facing america such as that which we took care of today between mr higgins and myself and that philosophy is alive and well i know the press likes to gin up headlines based on the partisan debate that we often have here in the chamber and they try to paint us all as we are in one camp on the republican side and they are in the other camp on the democratic side i can tell you in living it day to day that truly is not the case there are many good people on both sides of the aisle that are more than willing to sit down and talk to each other and try to work out these issues but a lot of times that rhetoric those headlines cause us to act in ways that are extremely divisive and kill that bipartisan effort and support that we should be nurturing and promoting thats why today i was pleased to see the results of that effort on our behalf and on mr higgins behalf to pass that legislation so i am going to continue along those avenues i am going to call out and hold people accountable for their positions theres nothing wrong with that theres nothing wrong with having a good oldfashioned honest debate and passionately disagreeing with people with different philosophies so long as you do it in an honest and respectful manner i work day to day whenever i get into a disagreement with some of my colleagues and also members from the other side of the aisle and i always start with the premise okay where are you coming from why do you believe you are right and i try to look at it truly from the eyes of the people that have the contrary opinion many times that has opened up my eyes and allowed me to learn from that exchange and strengthen my position maybe cause my position to bend a little bit or as i learn and grow to maybe change those positions but i can tell you that we should always start by having that conversation i have seen where a lot of times people dont want to do that they dont want to really take the effort or make the effort or take the time to really try to look at it through the eyes of the other person understand where theyre coming from and what their philosophy is really all about i think if we at least do that if we at least promise to each other that were willing to do that this chamber would work tremendously much better as a body as a whole my colleagues in the senate would also be working in a much better fashion and as we work with the white house and with the president of the united states we could also develop that type of relationship so i encourage all my colleagues and all my friends to continue with that effort as i pledge here today to do as we go forward i guess i will keep that in heart and i will continue to do my part in that effort as i started this conversation tonight ladies and gentlemen of america and this is about jobs this is about adopting a philosophy a new culture in america that recognizes that the private sector is that engine thats going to be the spark of this economic recovery and we need to focus on that we need to expand on our opportunities that are right before us with these free trade agreements when you talk about south korea colombia and panama i would ask all my colleagues to always focus on getting americans back to work because if we do that we will have a recovery and we will address much of this budget deficit problem because of the increased revenue that will come from that expansion of getting people back to work and getting that economy going and we will have a much better world upon which to legislate going forward with that i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.4484434425830841, 0.4484434425830841, 0, "i was talking to my good friend on the other side of the aisle a democrat greg meeks and greg said that if we would raise taxes put taxes on the table that he would be willing to put cuts and entitlements and other things on the table in an equal measure and i told him that there was no way that we could raise taxes enough to offset the things that really needed to be dealt with we have got to control spending we have got to cut spending we have got to look at the entitlements and the rules and regulations that we have to live by and make dramatic changes in government if were going to balance the budget this year we have reached over 15 trillion in debt 15 trillion that kind of goes right past most people because they cant imagine what a trillion dollars is but 15 trillion just to put it in perspective it took the presidencies of george washington all the way to bill clinton to amass the same amount of debt that president obama has racked up in 32 months now think about that from george washington to bill clinton the amount of money in debt that weve added has been reached in 32 months by president obama we have to get control of spending its absolutely essential otherwise well be in the same shape as many of those countries in europe like greece the presidents solution to the burgeoning problem is to increase taxes as i said so i went through the amount of taxes it would take and what we would have to do to reach the goals that the president talks about now if you raise the taxes on everybody that makes over 250 000 to 100 percentin other words you take every dime that they make 100 percent above 250 000that would yield about 1 4 trillion and that would keep government running for 141 days so if we took all the money that people make over 250 000 you would still only run government for less than half a year if you gave the 400 billion of profits that was reaped by the fortune 500 companies and gave them the same 100 percent tax treatment you could add another 40 days to the amount of time that we could run the government so taxing is not going to solve the problem now herbert hoover when he was president decideda republicanthat the way to help stop the economic tragedy that was about to occur was to raise taxes on businesses and individuals and what happened we ended up with the greatest depression in the history of this country now president obama said the one thing that you dont want to do during a time of recession is raise taxes and yet thats what hes advocating and my democrat colleagues are advocating right now raise taxes during a time of economic recession when people talk about unemployment in this country they say well now its 8 2 percent but if you look at the people who dropped off the unemployment rolls and those who are underemployed the unemployment rate is probably closer to 15 percent so the figures we are getting from the administration are really not that accurate its extremely important that the administration and my democrat colleagues here in the house and especially in the senate take a hard look at where were going the projections are over the next 10 years were going to increase the deficit by at least 1 trillion a year we cannot afford that this country will go completely bankrupt youll see inflation that you wont believe right now the fed is printing money to cover the expenditures that were incurring day after day after day that money theyre using theyre buying bonds with it treasury bonds so that money is not actually being seen in circulation but the fact is that were increasing the debt by printing money at the fed on a daily basis in europe the european central bank is doing the same thing with the euro this country and the rest of the world is heading toward an inflationary problem thats going to be unbelievable now people say in this country right now we havent seen any inflation if you look at the figures that are coming out from the administration inflation last year went up about 1 to 2 percent but theyre including in that figure all the new technologies that are taking place theyre not going to the grocery store i went to the grocery store last week and bought four apples at a cost of almost 5 three tomatoes cost almost 5 if you go to the gas pump todayand my colleague from indiana talked about that just a few minutes ago if you go to the gas pump today its almost 4 for a gallon of gas so the inflation rate on staples on things that we use on a daily basis is probably well over 10 percent maybe even higher than that we dont know but the administration says its only 1 to 2 percent talk to the wives and husbands of people that are really strapped for cash right now and you will find that its costing them a great deal more than that on a daily basis for gasoline food clothes and everything else its extremely important that we get control of spending this is not the time to raise taxes the president has said that himself especially back in 2008 and 2009 yet now they are taking a different tack and saying we need to raise taxes that would be like throwing gasoline on a fire we should not be raising taxes we should be addressing the spending side of the ledger and if we do that we will get this country back on the right track i just got back from europe i took a codel over there to brussels to meet with the finance people in the european union to find out where they are heading and theyre heading in a very difficult direction right now if greece goes belly up its very likely that youre going to see other countries go belly up and we have investments in money market funds and bonds that weve purchased in those countries and if those countries default its going to affect the united states as well so we need to get our house in order so that we dont end up in the same bailiwick that europe is in right now that could cause severe economic problems in this country so ill end by saying its important to get control of spending this is not the time to raise taxes a poll was taken recently by the politico magazine here on capitol hill and 75 percent of the people in this country that were polled said not to raise taxes so the people get it i just hope that the white house will the united states still finds itself in a spending driven debt crisis the national debt has now surpassed an unprecedented 15 trillion dollars house republicans approved a budget that would have put a stop to spending money that we dont have as well as cutting 6 2 trillion dollars more than the presidents budget the democrats blocked it the unitedstates debttogdp ratio is now officially over 100 percent approx 110 percent at the end of 2011 to put the severity of this crisis into perspective it took from the presidencies of george washington to bill clinton to amass the same amount of debt that president obama has racked up in the past 32 months the presidents solution to the burgeoning problem his administrations reckless behavior has caused increase taxes the problem according to the president is simply that the most successful among us simply arent paying their fair share this sentiment has most recently manifested itself in the presidents proposed budget in which he has increased taxes to the tune of 1 5 trillion dollars the simple reality of the situation is that this is nothing more than campaign rhetoric employed in hopes of fomenting class warfare and dividing the american people you cannot tax your way into prosperity we learned this after the 1929 stock market crash when herbert hoover a republican signed legislation to sharply increase taxes on businesses who were seen as the catalyst for the market crash hoovers draconian tax increases fueled by a similar populist outcry heard today ultimately served as the first salvo in a series of policy missteps that would ultimately lead to the great depression of the 1930s keep in mind that even if congress imposed a 100 percent tax taking all earnings above 250 000 per year it would yield 1 4 trillion dollars that would keep the government running for 141 days the problem is there are 224 more days left in the year if we gave the 400 billion dollars of profits reaped by the fortune 500 the 100 percent tax treatment we could fund the government for another 40 days it was not too long ago that president obama himself was quoted as saying you do not raise taxes during a recession if only he had the resolve to heed his own advice the american people also believe that the course of action taken by hoover and endorsed by obama is not the right way forward in a recent poll in the hill newspaper 75 percent of americans polled felt that the most appropriate top tax rate for families earning 250 000 or more is 30 percent or less this would be 5 percent less than what this income group currently pays this is in stark contrast to the 40 percent tax rate that obama and likeminded democrats in the congress have called for to enact in 2013 when one couples this with the expiration of the bush tax cuts we are creating an environment where the entire tax code as we know it will cease to exist if we continue in this vein in 2013 the 8 out of 10 businesses in america that file taxes as individuals will see their tax rate go to 44 8 percent this will effectively kill what little growth our embattled economy has left despite the top marginal tax rate varying between 35 percent and 91 percent since 1960 federal tax collections have been between 15 and 20 percent of the nations gross domestic product every year since 1960 from this we can infer whether taxes are high or low people make adjustments in their economic behavior so as to keep the government tax take at 15 to 20 percent of the gdp history has proven unequivocally that tax rates have always had a greater impact on economic growth than they do on federal revenues it is no longer good enough to kick the can down the road and make this the next congresses or next presidents problem unless we wish to bring the problems of europe to our shores it is incumbent on us to champion responsible spending restraint a repaired safety net reforms that ensure real health and retirement security and a simplified tax code oriented toward economic growth i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.44923776388168335, 0.44923776388168335, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume youve caught me both on my first rule on the floor and a day where i am just so pleased to be here because of the things that are going on here today because of the changes that i believe in both in terms of fiscal responsibility and in terms of openness here in the process now i understand this rule isnt going to make everyone happy it doesnt make me happy because were only here today and its been very confusing for folks back home we talked so much about receiving the presidents budget on capitol hill yesterday of course that was his budget for fy 2012 were still here working on the budget for 2011 this is the fifth continuing resolution that weve had to try to get that process right and its the first one since ive been sworn in that weve been involved in now i can tell you as much of a voice as you have in this continuing resolution today we have not seen this much debate or this many amendments in the last four continuing resolutions combined in fact im told that last night more than 400 amendments were filed to be eligible to come to the floor now i hear from my friends on the democratic side of the aisle for whom i have deep respect and admiration that they believe this bill was put together in a hasty process ill tell you weve been working on this bill day and night for weeks but then i hear from my friends that theyre disappointed that we have a preprinting requirement to allow for the thoughtful consideration of amendments and they would rather it just be a willynilly process that happens here on the floor as folks come up with good ideas one by one well ill tell you i look forward to that process i very much hope we can have that as the appropriations bills move forward but folks this is a time of urgency we have troops in harms way overseas we have economic development

credit where credit is due and blame where blame resides both parties over the last decade have been guilty of this horrendous practice of bringing continuing resolutions to the floor today we bring forward a bill that will put a stop to this process that will get us through the end of 2011 and allow us to go through regular order to bring the remaining appropriations bills to the floor and its a process i very much look forward to i see my friend mr mcgovern in the chamber this morning he and i had a discussion last night in the rules committee about how to go after some what i would call egregious tax subsidies those things that happen on the tax side of the ledger that shouldnt happen i believe in a fair code i believe in a code thats transparent that people understand youll see my fair tax pin that im wearing here today i believe in fundamental tax reform but today we only have a chance to talk about fy 2011 spending i want to have that discussion about fundamental tax reform i want to have the discussion that the gentlelady from new york wants to have about entitlement reform because i know precisely what my colleagues know which is if were going to be serious about budgets thats where the dollars are thats where the growth is thats where the change has to come but today we have because its an open process simply one bill that we can deal with simply one idea that we can deal with and that one idea is spending for fy 2011 it would have been easy for this new house to have punted on making tough decisions it would have been perfectly legitimate for this new house to say we didnt cause this problem we inherited this problem from last years congress and were just going to continue a continuing resolution on until the end of the year because we dont have the time or the commitment to start making tough choices but we didnt and im just so proud that we didnt what we said is we have 7 months left in the year lets start right now lets start right now and lets lay these ideas out one by one by one not in big general terms but in specifics line item by line item by line item across literally thousands of appropriations accounts and we didnt say its my way or the highway we said if you have a better idea if you have a better idea come to the floor and lets talk about it if you have a better idea if we did too much here tell us where we did too much and tell us how we can do better and if we did too little here tell us where we did too little and tell us how we can make it better i so look forward at the end of this rules consideration as we pass this rule and move forward in the general debate to being able to engage in those amendments one by one not in a back room somewhere not off in the corner where its just the leadership involved but here on the floor of the peoples house for all of america to see line item by line item by line item about where our priorities are now ill tell you you know as i know that every nickel we collect in federal revenue today goes to fund entitlements and service our national debt and every nickel that we spend on every program were going to talk about today every program on the discretionary side on the nondefense discretionary side is a nickel that we borrow so when we talk about are these things good to do i promise you that thats not where my heart is today i know there are some good programs out here that are doing good things what i also know is were borrowing every nickel to fund those programs from our children and our grandchildren when we talk about priorities one of those priorities is paying for what it is we commit this nation to again my good friend mr mcgovern was very persuasive last night when he said for petes sake they are programs i dont agree with but dadgummit if were going to be involved in them we ought to fund them and i couldnt agree with him more thats hard we received the presidents budget just yesterday and over a 10year window our systemic deficit never falls below 3 percent of gdp we dont even qualify to join the european union we are so devoid of fiscal responsibility at this point in our nations history that we do not even qualify to join the european union i tell you thats a low standard we should do better we should do better we can do better we brought h r 1 to the floor today this rule well bring it to the floor this afternoon so that we can do better i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.45243918895721436, 0.45243918895721436, 0, "thank you your comments also point to another aspect not only your caring about america caring about those that are fighting for us and your desire to fight for those here in washington who are fighting for us but it also shows a great deal about your humility because you and i both know you have been working on this issue just every bit as long and as hard as i have and yet you are giving jack and me great credit and i appreciate that but the truth is you have done every bit as much work perhaps more as jack and i have and the cosponsors we have here but you know things here in washington obviously dont get done in a vacuum and it means so much when we have people like kristi rob nan folks that are out here we got over 100 i am not sure how many over 100 now cosponsors on the bill these are people that want to make sure that the military is not used as pawns in this game a lot of us havent been thrilled about the shortterm crs but it does point out one thing that the leadership of the republicans in the house are committed and have paid the price of being criticized by people like me for doing shortterm crs they are so committed to trying to do everything they can especially speaker boehner he has really gone as far as humanly possible to do all that he could to avoid a shutdown making it clear he doesnt want that some folks have been critical that he needed to stand up and be ready to do so he has made it clear he doesnt want one he doesnt believe its good for america and so i know my friend from round rock texas sitting in georgetown as a judge for so many years often looked at things like i do as another former district judge you look at evidence to bear things out who is at fault the american people are going to be looking around who is at fault well you look at whats happened and the evidence is quite clear you have a group here a majority in the house that has done absolutely everything possible to try to placate the senate we passed lots of bills trying to get the funding done and why was that well the evidence is clear the democratic majority last year refused to do what was required and pass a budget no budget passed no appropriation to fund things why you can only speculate about that it was an election year perhaps there was concern that if people really saw the total amount that they were going to be appropriating in all these areas that it might have even been worse in the election in november the people saw through and the majority switched here in the house so here we are with these bills that have been filed pushing another bill this week here in the house in response there has been nothing passed in the senate people that know the rules know that the senators any one of themand of course it would have to be a democrat that would have any chance of getting something passed because the democrats under harry reid are in the majority so a democrat any democrat down there could take the bill the bills that we have done the crs that we have done they could take those and do as they did in obamacare you know that was boy here again its the military the obamacare bill was a bill to assist with a tax credit for firsttime homebuyers who were veterans and what did the senate do with that bill since it had to originate in the house under the constitution they took it and in their bill they said they are taking the firsttime homebuyer bill for veterans stripping out every word and substituting therefore about 2 700 or 2 800 pages of their obamacare bill well now if they dont agree with what we have done they could have taken any one of these crs that we passed and said we dont like it its dead on arrival they could have taken those stripped out every word just like they did for the veterans to count every word that helped the veterans and substituted therefor their disastrous bill in obamacare they could have done that with their own cr what they were going to fund what they wanted to see happen not one person down there in the majority of the senate has taken the leadership to do that some have said well why isnt the white house involved in whats going on in the senate why arent they showing some leadership down there i heard someone say well thats the white house its a separate branch the vice president of the country is and has been the president of the senate he has not only a vested interest he is the presiding officer of the senate we have heard over and over from this president that joe biden is going to make sure things are done right and yet what did he do when the going got tough maybe he is tough because he got going to russia and he disappeared when the going got tough for the president he went to brazil and played golf and then issued an order from down in south america sending troops into battle and we had a former president bush who quit playing golf he said it just didnt feel right to know our troops were in harms way and i would be out on some golf course this president not only doesnt have a problem playing golf with people in harms way he takes time out of his golf round to send more people into libya into harms way and to be assured today that hey we really are going to get around to turning everything over to nato and it wont be usmy friends 65 percent of nato is american military its not a lot of comfort to me but the least we could do is to make sure that our military and that includes reserves and so that the military knows it includes all pay all allowances youre not going to miss anything if the senate will just do right by them we have a standalone bill that could be passed in the next day or two it is house bill 1297 it could be done but as my friend from round rock has pointed out our leadership speaker boehner has brought a cr for 1 week he didnt want to do that we know he didnt but he was concerned about the military and it funds all aspects of the military through the end of the year then we have this fallback bill that if the senate is doing as theyre indicatingoh its dead on arrival were not even going to pick it up and put our ideas and pass it through the senatethen obviously the evidence is clear judge it seems to me the evidence is all in and its very clear they want a shutdown they think they win politically by forcing a shutdown and then blaming the republicans in the house its not only not the republicans in the houses fault its also clearly them playing games with our military with the vital function in this country and it isnt right i thank you for yielding i do thank you so much i know weve got several of our critical key sponsors here on the house floor and i am so grateful for the leadership were talking freshmen were talking people that havent been here all that long and yet they have grabbed this issue and have shown such leadership i appreciate you so much thank you

prosperity just today i had a businessman in my office relaying to me a conversation he had with one of the liberal democrat senators and he was talking about the issues that concerned him and his business she was arguing over and over again about how government needs to do all the regulatory constraints on business and how businesses need to be taxed higher and its not fair for businesses to be making money at the levels that they are in fact just today we saw some of our democratic colleagues talk about the oil companies and the kind of money that they have been making with increased prices of gasoline finally in frustration this democrat senator said to this businessman all youre concerned about is profit you just want to make a profit well thats what business does it makes a profit for its shareholders if its a corporation it makes a profit for small businesses the policies of this administration the policies that weve seen from our democratic colleagues when nancy pelosi was running the house now with harry reid running the senate and certainly the obama administration theyre trying to destroy profits theyre trying to destroy our economy in my opinion in fact the president himself has said that he doesnt mind seeing gasoline prices go up as long as they go up incrementally he doesnt want to see the massive increases but as long as they keep going up his own energy secretary dr chu fairly recently said somehow we have to find a way to make gasoline in the united states at the same price that it is in europe which is roughly 8 a gallon today the policies of this administration are doing just exactly that today in the science space and technology committee we were talking about fracking the epa scientist that is studying fracking admitted that there has not been one single incidentnot onewhere fracking has been implicated in contaminating drinking water not one but i believe this administration is doing everything it can to try to destroy energy production in this country and to try to destroy the free enterprise system in fact the president himself said that if his policies go into effect to use his own words energy prices will necessarily skyrocket well whos going to be hurt whos going to be hurt when fuel prices go up and food prices go up not only gasoline and diesel fuel i was talking to a manager in a restaurant just last week in athens georgia and was asking him about his food prices in his restaurant and what is going on because of the high cost of gasoline he said his suppliers are adding a fuel surcharge onto the cost of the foods that hes buying and selling in his restaurant and its the policies of this administration that are doing that just yesterday i had a constituent of mine whos an egg producer in georgia come in and talk about some of the issues that he faces i am from georgia im a good southerner and i love my grits and cornbread for folks who are not southerners grits are made from corn cornbread obviously thats selfexplanatory where that comes from i think even yankees will know that cornbread comes from corn too the thing is that i as a good southerner cannot see driving down the road burning up my grits and cornbread in the fuel tank of my gmc yukon that i used as my office actually when i was making house calls as a medical doctor i hear our democratic colleagues talk about we need to remove the subsidies for the oil companies well the american people need to know that those subsidies are actually tax credits theyre not true subsidies as such in fact harry reid was recently wanting a subsidy for gold mining in his own state of nevada he also wanted us to continue funding the cowboy poetry festival in his home state weve got to stop spending these outrageous funds that the federal government has been spending and we need to start creating jobs in a strong economy the best way to do that is to get rid of the policies of this administration that are destroying jobs destroying our economy increasing the cost of gas and diesel fuel for farmers and everybody in this country but back to my egg producer friend ive got a chart here that we made up in our office a dozen eggs in georgia we have the subsidieswhich are really not subsidies for the oil companies theyre just tax credits but we have subsidies for ethanol production which are true subsidies our administration has tried to pick winners and losers one of the winners that they picked is the ethanol production thats been a total failure and what that has done is increase the cost of gasoline its increased the cost of food across this country too in fact the major ingredient in feed for chickens is corn corn when i when i was farming back a number of years ago was 2 50 a bushel now its approaching 8 a bushel in 2005 before this ethanol subsidy the total feed cost per dozen eggsso when a consumer goes out and buys a dozen eggsthe food cost in that dozen eggs was 21 cents per dozen of eggs now 2011 its approximately 52 cents per dozen so who pays for that does the egg producer no its the consumer when you go to the grocery store and buy a dozen eggs youre paying more money for the failed policies of this administration particularly when it has to do with energy if we start drilling for oil tapping into our natural gas supplies start producing coal particularly doing the clean coal technology that we have having an alloftheabove energy policy whats going to be the longterm outcome for the american consumer for every single american its going to lower the cost of eggs and milk and bread because its going to lower the cost of the production of all the foodstuffs every single good and service in this country is affected by these high costs of gasoline and fuel oil diesel fuel et cetera the people who are going to be hurt the most are the poor people those on limited incomes our senior citizens i hear over and over again our democrat colleagues say that republicans are in the back pockets of big oil wrong i would like to see us end all subsidies all of them but particularly the ethanol subsidy which has not made any sense whatsoever and lets start developing our own energy resources which will create jobs here in america just yesterday and today weve been debating three bills that came out of our natural resources committee those three bills will enable us to start tapping into the godgiven energy resources that we have in this country help us to be less dependent upon foreign sources for energy if the president will ever sign those three bills into law the shortterm effect i think its been estimated is that 200 000 new jobs are going to be created so 200 000 new jobs will be created just with those three bills just to be able to open up developing our own energy resources here in america that the president is blocking long term those three bills its estimated will create 1 2 million new jobs here in the united states american jobs and help create a stronger economy the failed energy policies of this administration are hurting job creation they are hurting our economy theyre raising the cost of gasoline theyre raising the cost of diesel fuel theyre raising the cost of fuel oil theyre going to hurt egg producers and thus egg consumers consumers of all goods and services your food costs are going to go up the cost of every good and service in this country is going to go up all because of the failed policies of this administration because we cannot develop our own energy resources our godgiven resources that we have in this country i submit if a nation is not energy independent its not a secure nation and thats where we are today weve got to become energy independent and how is that going to happen former unitedstates senator everett dirksen one time said when he feels the heat he sees the light the most powerful political force in america is embodied in the first three words of the unitedstates constitution we the people when we the people start contacting members of congress particularly the democrat members of the house and the members of the unitedstates senate and demand that we develop our own energy resources here in america that we have an all of the above energy policy that looks at everythingnuclear energy alternative sources clean coal oil gaseverything which we must do and thats what republicans are fighting for if enough people all over this country will contact their senators and their members of congress and say lets develop our own energy resources lets develop american jobs lets develop a strong economy here in america then we can do so but its up to we the people to be able to demand that from your elected representatives thank you mr pearce for yielding to me i appreciate the great job youre doing as chairman of the western caucus and im honored to be a part of that caucus before i close i encourage people to go on my web site broun house gov and they can actually look at all the things on this chart they can look at it in fine detail and understand how high energy costs are creating high prices for eggs in the grocery store thank you mr pearce"],

i have been on the job for 60 days but the fiscal year began back on october 1 of 2010 how did we get here we got here because the work of the peoples house didnt get done last year and i regret that candidly im not sure how i hear so many folks talk about the partisanship in the congress and the partisanship in washington dc and people cant get things done because of the partisanship but of course last year democrats controlled the house the senate and the presidency and yet we still sit here today without a budget without the appropriations that the speaker knows we need for the government to continue its operations how did we get here i dont know but i know this nobody elected me in november to come up here and point the finger of blame they elected me to work with my friend to clean up this mess irrespective of how we got here we have to move forward i have to say because i was at home for the past week with my constituents working through these very same issues we are talking about today the question i got over and over and over again is rob that is a great start but lets do more thats a great start but lets do more you know getting started is what is hard it is hard to get started over and over again we have heard our friends on both sides of the aisle say you know this program it can be fixed it can be fixed i wonder if we will have a day here where we can start from a blank sheet just a blank sheet and say what is it that is worth borrowing from our children for what is it that is worth increasing our childrens credit card balance for what is it that is worth mortgaging our childrens future for let me just say to my friend because i know he has a great passion for education and it is a passion i very much respect i have the great fortune of coming from the part of the world called gwinnett county georgia and gwinnett county was the recipient of the broad prize for the single best urban education school district in america we made it as a finalist 2 years ago but last year we won and we won in spite of federal government interventionnot because of it in spite of it we won because as a community we got together back in 1996 and said there is a better way what can we do to enable our children to succeed better we were doing standardized testing in gwinnett county before standardized testing was in vogue because we knew we had to have a way to measure we knew we had to have a way to sort out what works and what doesnt well folks we need some of that standardized testing here on capitol hill what works and what doesnt and there are a lot of things that arent working not only do we need to get the bad out of the budget weve got to decide that were going to choose between good and good between good and good because every school group i spoke to over our district workweek is a school group from whose future we are borrowing whose future we are mortgaging over and over and over again it has to be said that the house worked its will in an unprecedented fashion an unprecedented fashion i dont say that lightly i mean never never before in modern times has the house worked its will on a continuing appropriations bill the way it did last week again i dont care whose fault it is i dont care why we couldnt get it done last october i dont care why we couldnt get it done in november i dont care why we couldnt get it done in december what i care about is we have an opportunity to get it done and we did that last week the house worked its will and we had some winners and we had some losers i voted for a number of amendments that failed i didnt get everything that i wanted in that bill i know my friend from colorado didnt get everything he wanted in that bill but the house worked its will with unprecedented openness and h r 1 was the result well i asked my staff to call over to the senate before i came down here i wanted to find out exactly how much debate the senate had been putting in on h r 1 of course we debated it for almost 50 hours we went through the night on a couple of nights we wanted to make sure that the entire house had an opportunity to be involved my staff tells me not a moment not a moment i hear the sense of urgency from my friend from colorado that we have to take action this is no way to run a government i think he is right i think cleaning up this mess means passing a single continuing resolution that gets us through to the end of the fiscal year for petes sake the appropriations committee is already taking testimony to try to get us into the 2012 budget cycle this is leftover work that simply didnt get done last congress not one second has been spent on the senate side from what my staff tells me not one second has been spent considering a bill on which the entire united states house of representatives worked its will a bill that was the only open process that this house has seen on a continuing resolution a bill that allowed members from both sides of the aisle to come down here to the house floor and represent their constituents back home by doing exactly what my friend from colorado is suggestingtrying to make good cuts trying to make those things present those things on the house floor that make the most sense to folks back home well we are where we are no one wants the senate to act expeditiously on the work of the peoples house more than i do but given that not one moment has been dedicated to that we have to come down here and fund the government one more time it is the responsible thing to do it is the responsible thing to do the better thing to do would be to act on h r 1 which the house passed last week with the support of members in this body but now we have to come down here and extend for 2 weeks to give us time to finish those negotiations with the senate side and if that is not enough time i suspect we will be back down here again my friend from colorado and i will be back down here in this well doing this same thing but it is no way to run the government it is no way to run the government this is just what we have to do while we wait on the senate to take up that bill on which the house worked its will

minutes about an interesting topic it is something on the minds of americans everywhere and that is about jobs about the deficit and about federal spending and what we have to do in those areas i think sometimes it is helpful you hear so much detail that you need to step back at the 30 000foot view and say what is the big picture of what is going on so i have here one of those traditional pietype charts and it has an overview of the total spending of the federal government in the year 2010 so what i want to do is just take a look at that and then talk about what that means relative to the problems we have in overspending in the federal government also this connects to unemployment in this sense that when the federal government spends too much money and is too intrusive and takes too much in taxes all of those things destroy the jobs created by small businesses so lets just be completely clear we have heard stories about unemployment and these heartless republicans the problem is that if you destroy businesses you dont have any businesses you dont have any jobs and that is what we have been doing how is it we destroy businesses one we overtax them two we overregulate them with red tape three we make it hard from a liquidity point of view to get loans from banks because the federal officers are looking over the bankers shoulders secondguessing the loans fourth we create an era of uncertainty because we dont know what the silly government is going to do next and last of all we spend money like mad which then makes the economy that much harder for our businesses to compete in a world competitive environment but lets take a look at this pie chart here and there is something here that when you start to think about it is really a little bit on the frightening side lets take a look at some of the big chunks of money the bottom one down here is defense the constitution of the united states says that the congress will provide for the national defense it is the one main thing that congress is supposed to do states cant do it locales cant do it it is something that has to be done by the federal government that is why our unitedstates constitution says even in the preamble to provide for the national defense that is 692 billion here in the 2010 budget so there is defense this over here is the nondefense what is called discretionary these are the funds that congress spends every year and that is 666 billion this includes things like the education department the energy department the department of commerce it would be jails and prisons things like that all of those the park service would all be in this nondefense discretionary area so these two kind of similar size running in there about a little bit under 1 5 trillion in total now the other one that i want to call to your attention though is all the rest of these this is social security this is medicare this is medicaid and so what these things are a lot of times people call them mandatory spending what does that mean well what it means is that sometime a long time ago a congress came along passed these laws and the law works like a little machine and the machine spits out dollar bills whenever anybody meets certain criteria so we call it an entitlement these little machines are spitting out printing out dollars and the congress doesnt have to do anything at all and the federal government is spending lots of money how much money well social security there is 700 billion there is another 519 billion in medicare and medicaid 273 billion another thing that works a little bit like an entitlement is the debt so if we sell a treasury bill we have to pay the interest on it and when we do that we get this interest and then there is these other mandatory things which are really other kinds of entitlements so it is not just social security medicare and medicaid you have got schip you have got food stamps and things like that that are additional entitlements so these things here when you put all of these together this is kind of a spooky number these things come out not too far away from a little over 2 trillion maybe 2 3 trillion and what does that mean 2 3 trillion what that is that also is the amount of revenue in a given year for the federal government so what has happened is all these entitlements now plus the interests on the debt have gotten to the point that they are chewing up all the money that the federal government takes in in taxes in a given year so then the question is well how about defense how about nondefense discretionary how about these things do we have any money no the point of the matter is you can zero this out zero these out and these together are using all of the money that the federal government is taking in in revenue in a given year now that is kind of scary what that says is that we are starting to run deficits of over 1 trillion in fact the obama deficits for the last 2 years have been about 1 5 trillion that is a lot of money that is three times a bigger deficit than president bushs worst budget deficit so you take his worst budget deficit which is about 450 billion and we are talking the last 2 years we are running at a 1 5 trillion deficit so this is what is going on so lets take a look if you are like an awful lot of americans you want to solve a problem we have got a problem here we are apparently spending too much money so you say well what are our alternatives how do we approach this i am thankful this evening also that we have got one of our very bright young freshmen congressmen from the state of colorado scott is here to join"], [0.45554980635643005, 0.45554980635643005, 0, "i thank the gentleman from georgia for yielding i appreciate the hard work that you have been doing for years as i have on this issue i appreciate the comments from my colleague from illinois who just talked about just what is happening here in the last 2 weeks we were in our districts and i got the opportunity to go through parts of my district when you talk to people about what is happening in this country with the economy the biggest question that comes up beyond the shortterm issues of the economy and jobs is the high price of gasoline and just why is it that right now people are paying almost 4 if not 5 in some parts of the country 5 per gallon for gasoline and we are still not even into the heart of the summer it is very clear as people look it is very clear that the policies of this administration that have completely shut off our ability to produce go and explore for and produce energy in america is one of the main contributing factors to this high price of gasoline of course you dont have to go far in south louisiana to see the direct impact because as my colleague from georgia just pointed out not only the moratorium that was imposed about a year ago but the permatorium that we are still experiencing today where the administration wont let our people go back to work exploring safely for energy people that had absolutely nothing to do with the bp explosion of the deepwater horizon people in much deeper waters drilling safely back then that now cannot go back to work we have lost over 13 000 jobs in the energy industry in south louisiana in the past year specifically because of president obamas policies that have shut those areas down it has literally run thousands of jobs 13 000 by the white houses estimateswe think the number is much higher but i will just use the white houses numbers13 000 people in this country who have lost their job in the energy industry highpaying jobs by the way that have gone to foreign countries we have tracked some of these deepwater rigs that have left of course the president goes to rio de janeiro a few weeks ago and brags that he wants to drill in brazil i would suggest mr president lets drill in america safely where we know there are billions of barrels of oil here in this country where we can create thousands of highpaying jobs and generate billions of dollars that the federal treasury would take in because of all that economic activity and the royalties that would be paid by those oil companies that would lower our deficit and yet no the president says we want to shut you down and put your people out of work but we want to go and spend our resources drilling in brazil this is the backward policy that this administration has pursued that has gotten us to this point where we are paying over 5 in some places in this country 4 close to 4 in my districtfor a gallon of gasoline and we are not even in the heart of the summer so then when you look at what the administrations plan is clearly our plan is we want to let our people go back to work exploring and drilling safely for energy creating thousands of good jobs bringing all that tax revenue into this country to lower our deficit but the presidentss answer is you would think maybe he would be agreeing on us with this this should be a bipartisan issue there is bipartisan support by the way to do what my colleague from georgia and i are talking about but the president not only doesnt support our plan but the presidents proposal is to raise taxes on american energy he goes out and i guess every time he speaks he wants to go and beat up on an american industry and right now it is the oil companies well frankly the oil companies that are out there right now many of them are producing in other countries but our local producers the small businesses these arent the big guys these are the small businesses that are barely hanging on by a thread struggling to survive that he would be shutting down by raising taxes his plan is to raise 22 billion in taxes on american energy production now his plan by the way coincidentally doesnt apply to foreign countries so when he goes to rio and says drill in brazil his package that he actually has asked congress to pass and i sure hope we dont pass it but his package not only raises taxes on american energy that same tax increase doesnt apply to the drilling in brazil or in saudi arabia or some of these other middle eastern countries that use that money to do things that are counterproductive not only to american energy security but our homeland security so the president would say to raise 22 billion in taxes on american energy production which by the way runs even thousands more jobs out of our country and increases our dependence on middle eastern oil this is counterproductive policy but that is the presidents answer to high gas taxes is to raise taxes on american energy which means higher prices at the pump and by the way we are already paying too much at the pump gas prices have more than doubled since president obama took office it is not just bad luck that gives us high gas prices it is bad policy that comes out of washington d c that is why i really appreciate the gentleman from georgia bringing us here tonight but also the legislation that we will be voting on tomorrow that actually starts to address this problem and says you know what if people in america want to safely explore for and produce energy here in america we are going to let them do that we are going to let them go to work here so that we dont send those jobs and those billions of dollars to countries like brazil and even worse middle eastern countries who want to do us harm so clearly the policy impacts the price of gas we are paying at the pump we have got to reverse these policies that make absolutely no sense that are coming out of this white house and get back to an allofthe above strategy that actually allows us to utilize our resources here in america in a safe way that produces thousands of goodpaying jobs and brings billions more dollars into the federal treasury to pay down the national debt"], [0.45618176460266113, 0.45618176460266113, 0, "i appreciate you being with us this afternoon and giving me the opportunity to come down here and talk about where we have been this week on capitol hill trying to find a pathway forward now as with every decision we make as you know you and i have been here for 18 months with a voting card in hand trying to make those decisions for our constituents back home trying to bring their voice to be heard on capitol hill and were facing one of those choices right here today which lane will we choose mr speaker we proposed passed today here in the house in a bipartisan way a proposal that will create 1 million new jobs now im going to go on and bring out some other studies and where those jobs are coming from but one of the folks were going to hear from thats going to confirm the jobcreation opportunities that exist in this proposal is going to be president barack obama because he will have stood about 10 feet behind me in a state of the union address just 18 short months ago and advocated in favor of this jobcreation proposal i dont know what has changed in 18 months but what we saw here on the floor of the house today is our democratic colleagues advocating for a different choice a choice that ernst young in an independent analysis of legislative proposals said will destroy 710 000 jobs it will lose the opportunity to employ 710 000 americans as we are hearing what is unquestionably the worst recession in my lifetime and when presented with a choice between creating a million new jobs or losing 710 000 others we are faced with a choice the house made the right choice today the house chose to create 1 million new jobs but just in the last 7 days the senate made the wrong choice the senate chose a path that study after study after study shows us results in failure why is that mr speaker why is that what i have here is a chart youll remember from our budget debate im just so proud i serve on the budget committee here in the house and you know weve brought two budgets to the floor in the short 18 months that ive served here in congress weve brought two budgets to the floor that made tough decisions tough decisions when youre running 1 4 trillion deficits and when youre trying to create jobs for a nation thats hurting when youre trying to prevent jobkilling tax hikes from being imposed on american job creators therere no easy decisions theyre tough decisions and they have consequences but this is what i learned in our budget debate what i have here is a chart that shows tax revenue from 1947 just after world war ii all of the way out to 2077 about 130 years of tax revenue and what well see is tax revenue thats actually come in represented by this green line and then the tax revenue thats projected to come in youll see thats a flat line its taxes as a percent of gdp and what we see is whether we operated america with some of the highest tax rates in history and weve had 90 percent income tax rates in this country90 percent income tax ratesor whether we operate america with the lowest income tax rates in this nations history we bring in about the same amount of money either way i know thats not intuitive i could bring up chart after chart after chart that shows how its true i can show what happened in the kennedy years when he cut those top marginal rates and more revenue came in we can look at what happened in the reagan years when we cut those top marginal rates and more revenue came in and we can look at what happened in the bush years when we cut those marginal rates and more revenue came in over and over and over again but rather than dwell on those charts i just want you to see that over time revenue is relatively constant americans are willing to give the federal government about 18 percent of the size of the economy and if the government asks for more than that americans change their behavior so they dont have to give it but the red line represents spending in this country spending going back to just after world war ii going out to where we are here today and a projection forward based on current law based on current law folks look at this chart and they see this giant red line government spending as a percent of gdp as it threatens to consume all of american gdp and they think golly what in the world who are the crazy people proposing that we do that who are they thats what happens if we do nothing if we fail to proactively offer a solution if we fail to confront the challenges that are facing this country with respect to spending if we do not act this is what we get no president need sign a law to create this dangerous circumstance the laws have already been signed the question is what are we going to do about it mr speaker we dont have a taxation problem in this country in terms of needing to tax americans more we have a spending problem in this country in terms of the federal government needing to spend less and just to put that in sharp relief ive reflected here in this green the path to prosperity this is debt as a share of the economy this is americas debt as a share of the economy you remember when we had all hands on deck in world war ii when we were literally fighting for the future of the world debt crested 100 percent of gdp we borrowed an amount equal to the entire size of the united states economy well were right back there today we will be over the next decade and if we do nothing again that spending will create a debt pattern that will completely consume not just all of the revenue it will consume all of the wealth of this country if we took everything from everybody if we confiscated every stock and every bond if we confiscated every small business and every large business if we took everybodys bank account and took everything out from under their mattress if we sold everyones car everyones home we still wouldnt have enough money to pay for the promises that previous congresses have made to america its a spending problem its not a revenue problem but this green line represents the budget that you and i and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle came together to pass its not about blaming folks did all of this red line come from previous congresses before i got here you better believe it but its not about finding out who was to blame in those previous 5 years 10 years 15 years 20 years its about finding out whos going to offer the solution to get us out of this mess and you know who it is mr speaker its this freshman class that you and i have the great fortune of being a part of its the conservatives who have served in this congess calling out in the wilderness time and time again the senior leaders of this conference and this congress who are going to come together and provide solutions this green line represents not just a proposal that one man wrote not just an idea that maybe 10 or 15 people agree on this green line this solution represents the budget that passed this united states house of representatives in a bipartisan fashion dont let folks tell you its hopeless is it dire yes it is but we have proffered solutions we have debated solutions and we have passed on the floor of this house solutions the problem is not that taxes are too low in this country the problem is that spending is too high in this country and we have offered solutions to that thats been the debate on the floor of the house this week before i get into the debate that weve actually had this week ive brought a chart of who benefits from tax loopholes who benefits from tax loopholes we talk a lot about tax loopholes im a cosponsor of the fair tax im a big believer in the fair tax the fundamental tax reform proposal it has more sponsors than any other fundamental tax proposal in the house or in the senate its h r 25 here in the house it proposes that we turn our tax system on its head to stop punishing people for what theyve earned and begin to tax people based on what they spend if youre going out and youre buying a brand new mercedes i dont care what kind of job you have you can afford to pay the tax if youre driving a used ford festiva i dont care how much money you earn youre plowing that money back into the economy instead of taking it out this is what we see who benefits from tax loopholes the bottom 20 percent get next to nothing from tax loopholes the bottom 40 percent you see get nothing from tax loopholes the bottom 60 percent the bottom 80 percent get next to nothing in terms of tax loopholes the top 20 percent that finally starts to show up on the chart but its the top 1 percent of all income earners who benefit the most from all the tax loopholes in this case its just over 250 000 each now why is that im not picking on our top 1 percent the top 1 percent pays about 40 percent of all the income taxes in this country the top 1 percent pays 40 percent of all the income taxes the bottom 50 percent pays zero if the bottom 50 percent is paying zero that means the top 50 percent has to pick up the whole tab we pay more on the top 1 percent so it only makes sense that if you have a complicated tax code that allows for lots of loopholes exemptions deductions and carveouts those loopholes exemptions deductions and carveouts are going to benefit the people who are paying all the taxtop 1 percent paying all the tax and so top 1 percent benefiting from all the loopholes why am i talking about those folks in the top 1 percent because im not picking on them i admire them i just want to make that clear i admire them im not one of them but i aspire to be i hope i come up with that next great idea like bill gates like steve jobs i hope that i do something that makes a difference for america i hope that im one of those folks who owns a business back home that provides jobs for families jobs for my neighbors income that supports peoples families i want to be one of those guys i dont demonize the 1 percent i admire folks who have gone from nothing but the power of their ideas and the sweat of their brow and created something golly thats what america is to me thats what it is but there are some in this congress there are some down at 1600 pennsylvania avenue who are intent on demonizing that 1 percent and what they have now today this week on the floor of the house has been a proposal to raise taxes on all of those job creators there in that category fully 50 percent of all of the income generated by small businesses is what my colleagues in the senate my colleagues here on the democratic side of the house have proposed to raise taxes on those 50 percent of small business owners who are providing all the jobs thats where my colleagues believe a major tax increase should be levied we have put forth a proposalim just so proudthat says rather than raising taxes on job creators killing jobsi showed my choice of two futureswhy not introduce fundamental tax reform that eliminates those deductions and loopholes those carveouts and exemptions that all of america knows are in the tax code that all of america would like to see eliminated and if we know that eliminating those has the greatest impact on the highest of our income earners why do we need a class warfare thats going on down here on the floor of the house i say to my colleagues who want to demonize the top 1 percent join me in eliminating deductions and carveouts and loopholes and exemptions and you will raise taxes on that community because those are the folks who benefit because those are the folks who pay the taxes theres a better way thats not just some hardcore freshman republican who is the sponsor of a fundamental tax reform bill talking the president of the united states this president of the united states stood not 10 feet behind me at this podium at that microphone right behind me and he said these words in january of 2011 over the years a parade of lobbyists has rigged the tax code to benefit particular companies and industries those with accountants and lawyers to work the system can end up paying no taxes at all but the rest are hit with one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world president obama said that and he followed it with this it makes no sense and it has to change hitting job creators in america with the highest tax rate in the world makes no sense and it has to change this was january of 2011 1 month after december 2010 when the president signed the tax package for 2 years that the house passed today i ask the speaker where is the contention today this is the same proposal that was passed 2 years ago when the president acknowledged the challenges facing our job creators and said it has to change we have a bigger plan for fundamental reform that changes the debate in washington forever but right now we are about the business of stopping the largest tax increase in american history from destroying jobs in this country beginning in january of next year the president acknowledges it and said it had to change right here behind me in january 2011 he says this so tonight im asking democrats and republicans to simplify the system get rid of the loopholes level the playing field and use the savings to lower the corporate tax rate for the first time in 25 years without adding to our deficit it can be done it can be done says president obamaand hes right our ways and means committee has held more hearings on fundamental tax reform than any other ways and means committee in my lifetime we are talking about those fundamental reforms that the president has asked to talk about and this week this week we passed a framework that gives expedited procedures we all know how things get slowed down in washington d c we all know how easy it is for somebody to latch on to something and stop it from passing because they want to stand in the way of progress we passed expedited procedures to do exactly what the president has asked us to do this is not republican politics this is not partisan politics this is folks coming together to try to save what is a fragile economy today is it the strongest economy in the world youd better believe it is tomorrow going to be brighter than today in america youd better believe it but not by holding our tongues not by sitting on our hands and not by fighting amongst ourselves about who gets the credit i dont care ive got a fundamental tax reform bill that i believe solves this problem you can call it anything you want to call it the democratic plan to save america it doesnt matter to me we dont care who gets the credit we care about solving the problem and thats what our president charged us to do he goes on january 2011 10 feet behind me we measure progress by the success of our people by the jobs they can find and the quality of those jobs by the prospects of a small businessowner who dreams of turning a good idea into a thriving enterprise my colleagues here are trying to raise taxes on 50 percent of all the income those small businessowners make the job creators in this country are faced with the largest tax increase in american history our president has asked us not to do that he goes on to say this by the opportunities for a better life that we pass on to our children thats the project the american people want us to get to work on together and we did we passed our plan for fundamental tax reform together in a bipartisan way this week talking about the agreement that the president passed and signed in december of 2010 the very same agreement that were trying to pass today he said this we did that in december thanks to the tax cuts we passed americans paychecks are bigger and these steps taken by republicans and democrats will grow the economy and add to more than 1 million private sector jobs this year did you remember my saying the president was going to back up that this proposal was going to create 1 million private sector jobs he said it in january add to more than 1 million private sector jobs created last year ill close with this that was 10 feet behind me january 2011 ten feet behind me january 20 2012 the president said this we have a huge opportunity at this moment to bring manufacturing back to america but we have to seize it we have to seize it i bolded this so everybody could see it we should start with our tax code right now companies get tax breaks for moving jobs and profits overseas meanwhile companies that choose to stay in america get hit with one of the highest tax rates in the world it makes no sense everyone knows it so lets change it thats the bill the house passed this week the bill the senate passed this week continues to punish those small businessowners and continues to reward those companies that do their businesses overseas dont let an election year get in the way of doing whats right the president called for it the ways and means committee delivered it the house has passed it and we can do it i call on my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to believe as i believe that tomorrow can be better than today with that i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.4561850428581238, 0.4561850428581238, 0, "this marks the first of what i hope to be many times to address you and my colleagues on an issue that i have been graced with having the responsibility to deal in the public policy arena and thats the issue of nuclear waste when people talk about nuclear waste and this debate about where it is and why its there they primarily talk about our nuclear utilities especially after fukushima daiichi people understand that when you store highlevel nuclear waste onsite and if theres a disaster that occurs and if the pools run dry then you might have a melting which might spread radioactivity and thats not good for anybody thats a good debate to have because we have nuclear waste stored all over this country but im not here really to talk about the private forprofit sector the nuclear industry today im here to tell another story another story that really talks about why we have government and why theres still a need for some government entities back during world war iiand we just heard my colleague talk about the honor flightsback during world war ii we decided as a nation to win these wars one way to make sure that we wouldnt lose thousands upon thousands of soldiers in an invasion of japan was to develop the nuclear bomb two were dropped the war ended many people historically know that development that occurred because of the manhattan project what i think a lot of people dont know is that we still are dealing with much of the history of winning the war in the manhattan project and that winning the cold war relied upon a strong military and a strong nuclear deterrence so even after world war ii we continued to develop nuclear weapons which we deal with today so i had a chance to visit during our last district work period i took a day and visited a place called hanford washington hanford washington was part of the manhattan project hanford was the site that the unitedstates military picked to help produce plutonium the fat man bomb was developed there that area was picked for a lot of reasons there werent a lot of people there as you can see the columbia river is right next to it you had some lowcost power production and so it was a good site and hence people got moved off the land the government took over and the government has been controlling hundreds of acres in washington state even today the result of the cold war and winning world war ii is that millions of gallons of nuclear waste now reside in hanford washington and im not exaggerating in fact 53 million gallons of nuclear waste is onsite and whats interesting about hanford of course when you started storing this nuclear waste our technology our information our knowledge was not as great as it is now the way we stored this material then would not be an acceptable process today it is an environmental disaster and a hazard that has to be cleaned up you have approximately 174 storage tanks these storage tanks are from 750 000 gallons to a million gallons all with nuclear waste in these tanks these tanks are buried as it says here 10 feet underground and 250 feet above the water table a mile from the columbia river some of these tanks are leaking its just not a good thing for us to have and so the government has been trying to deal with this one site of nuclear waste in this country why do i bring this before you and why is this important because in 1982 part of the process of dealing with hanford was to pass a law the law was called the nuclear waste policy act and in that law it says weve got a solution were going to collect all the highlevel nuclear waste and we have a storage facility that were going to place it in and that place is yucca mountain now many of you may have heard about yucca mountain before ive visited it twice yucca mountain is in a desert and its a mountain so i do the sidebyside comparisons here right now at hanford we have 53 million gallons of nuclear waste on site yucca mountain which is a site we designed we picked we studied for decades we spent 12 5 billion we currently have no nuclear waste there the nuclear waste at hanford is stored 10 feet underground the nuclear waste at yucca mountain would be stored a thousand feet underground the nuclear waste at hanford is 250 feet above the groundwater the nuclear waste at yucca will be stored a thousand feet above the water table the nuclear waste at hanford is a mile from the columbia river the closest river to yucca mountain is the colorado river which is 100 miles away ill come back to this floor throughout the year and highlight different locations around the country where theres waste and start pleading with my colleagues to help us stop two peoplethe president of the united states and majority leader harry reid majority leader reid has blocked our ability to continue to move forward and take nuclear waste from around this country and place it underneath a mountain in a desert this location is exhibit number 1 there is no more compelling location in this country that cries out for this waste to be moved than hanford in fact in the cleanup process the scientific design of the casks that will be used to clear out these 53 million gallons of waste and put into storage containers they are designed specifically for yucca mountain again we have spent 12 5 billion to prepare this site to receive nuclear waste the house went on record this year on a vote in the appropriation bill for energy and water and said yes yucca mountain is still where we believe highlevel nuclear waste ought to go and that vote was 297 members voting to increase funding to complete the safety review of the doa application so that yucca mountain could move forward one senator is blocking this one senator from the state of nevada but its time for the other senators from these other states who are affected regardless of their party to say i dont want this highlevel nuclear waste in my state we have a federal law to move it to underneath a mountain in a desert and its time for them to stand up and be counted thats why this is my first trip to the well identifying one location in this country i think the most compelling argument for yucca mountain and its not even tied to that nuclear power generating forprofit industry it is tied to our world war ii legacy and the environment and the health of not only the land here in washington state but also the great columbia river so who are we asking to stand up and be counted and help us move this well we just happen to have four unitedstates senators two from the state of washington two from the state of oregon senator cantwell senator murray senator wyden and senator merkley now if you look at this site the columbia river those of you who know your geography know that the columbia river when it gets closer to the west side of the state separates the state of oregon and the state of washington to the north north of the columbia is washington state south is oregon these senators need to step up to the plate and these senators need to do their job they need to speak to the majority leader we understand the majority leader who wants to protect the state of nevada so im not trying to lift mountains that i cant personally lift but what i can do is start making the clarion call to senators around this country who have highlevel nuclear waste in their states when we have already spent 12 5 billion for a single repository and as ive said numerous times underneath a mountain in a desert the numbers here in washingtonon the house side we have an overwhelming majority in the other body their majority is not as big as it once was and because of that these centers are even empowered more to be able to go to their leader and plead for their state and make the compelling argument again if you cant make it for hanford you cant make it for anywhere im from southern illinois i dont have a nuclear facility in my congressional district although i am from the state of illinois and illinois is a huge nuclear power state we have six locations 11 reactors so we have highlevel nuclear waste stored 40 miles from downtown chicago now does that make sense does that make sense in a day when weve already spent 12 billion to prepare locate research a single repository that can be kept safe secure and stored it doesnt make sense so thats why in the coming weeks youll see other posters like this ill definitely keep this one but well compare yucca mountain to downtown chicago well compare yucca mountain to boston massachusetts well compare yucca mountain to savannah georgia if you live in a state and may not have a nuclear power plant you may very well have the legacy of world war ii manhattantype projects and nuclear waste that has to be stored elsewhere than in the place where it is today as the chairman of the environment and the economy subcommittee my congressional responsibility is that of nuclear waste it is a challenge for this country it is a challenge that we already have a plan to deal with in fact ratepayers of states that have nuclear power have been paying an additional charge on their utility bills to prepare yucca mountain to receive this waste to have one man and a president whos complicit in his design to stop this is not in the best interest of this country and i will continue to come down to the well to fight this fight so that we take full advantage of the great resources we have and follow up on the planning and the funding that weve done for decades to have a single repository with that i thank you and i yield back the balance of my time"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.538250744342804, 0.46174925565719604, 1, "i thank the gentleman reclaiming my time very interesting comments he makes of course he leaves out some things he talks about the jobs that were lost those jobs were lost of course as this administration took office this administration has gained back 2 million of the 8 million jobs that were lost during the economic program that my friend from virginia voted for for the most part eight million jobs were lost and the month that this administration took office in january 780 000 jobs in one month were lost the last month of the bush administration thats not very distant past but let me tell you i heard the same rhetoricyou said youve changed i heard the same rhetoric in 1993 same rhetoric when we adopted a program that we said would balance the budget bring the economy back and create jobs the same rhetoric oh no you wont do it the program that youre going to adoptnone of which you voted for you werent here i understand thatbut the same rhetoric applied you thought we were going to tank the economy kill jobs explode the deficit and have high unemployment in fact as my friend well knowshe didnt read those statistics because he thinks theyre ancient history because you opposed that policy but that policy created 22 million jobs thats a 30 million job difference between the bush administration that was the followon administration and the clinton administration thirty million job difference i tell my friend under the policies that you adopted and you supported in the 2000s so i would hope that my friends comments are correct that you have decided to change in point of fact we need change and in point of fact the american publicwhich is divided itself but would like us to come together and im hopeful that well do that and my friend and i have had the opportunity to talk about this we do have significant differences but none of us can put something on the table and say if you dont agree im going to tank the economy im going to have america default for the first time in its 200plus years of history if you dont agree and do it my way i have said the leader has said on this side everything is on the table we understand that you have to pay for what you buy and we also understand we have to buy less and we are prepared to do both in fact we have agreed to do both in the biden talks now my friend talks about economists the most successful investor in america i think most people will agree is warren buffett warren buffett said we raised the debt ceiling seven times during the bush administration and now in this congress under the republicans theyre using it as a hostage and you really dont have any business playing russian roulette to get your way in some matter we should he said be more grown up on that to that extent he echoed the comments of our speaker who is trying in my opinion to get to a place where we can come together compromiseas is critical in a democracypay our bills and reduce our obligations and reduce spending buffett went on to say we should as i said be more grown up on that if we dont meet the august 2 deadline he observed youre playing with fire when you dont need to play with fire and we dont need to tell the rest of the world that any time people in congress start throwing a tantrum that were not going to pay our bills that is not responsible behavior its not adult behavior its not good for anybody in the united states of america and its not good for the international community in fact senator alan simpson was referring to tom coburn who has said look youve got to have everything on the table including yes revenues yes taxes some bard has said that taxes are the price we pay for democracy they should not be any higher than they need to be but we ought to pay for what we buy and if we dont if people dont want to pay for it we ought not to buy it unfortunately the reason we racked up 6 trillion of deficits during the reagan and both bush administrations is because we bought things and didnt pay for them as you heard me say at the white house we both partiesyou werent herevoted for some things and didnt pay for them weve got to stop that thats why we put in place statutory paygo but very frankly you say well weve changed you passed a budget that doesnt balance the budget for the next 27 years you passed the budget you voted for that i didnt vote for that budget it doesnt balance the budget for 27 years almost three decades very frankly i dont think that does it thats why we went down to the white house yesterday and almost everybody in the room said we need to do a comprehensive disciplined courageous honest principled resolution of doing what you say you want to do that your party wants to do and what im telling you my friend we want to do because there is no option we must bring this deficit down we must the debt we have confronting us is not sustainable so i would urge my friend and i want to congratulate speaker boehner who at the white house said look we need to do this and we need to have a comprehensive agreement thats what democracy demands im not going to agree with some of the things that are in that bill youre not going to agree with some of the things that are in that bill if in fact we pass a bill but if we come together if we act as adults if we do what every responsible financial economist and adviser has told us we must do then america will be pleased with us but i tell my friend from virginia if we dont do that if we continue to buy things that we dont pay for and we continue to ask the people to get it for free then frankly your children and my grandchildren and children and greatgrandchildren will not be happy with us so i urge my friendhe and i will be going to the white house on sunday i urge him to come to the table as i will come to the table i tell him with the understanding that compromise is essential that the crisis that confronts us is real and that america expects us to act in their best interest and have the couragenot the politics not the ego not the view of the next electionbut the view of the long term as we come together and try to confront this issue for which all of us are responsible no one party no one member all of us are responsible but

value that we must place on the contribution of all of our colleagues especially when we are blessed with the life service and leadership of someone like donald payne there are very few people that you can say someone like donald payne because he was exceptional and unique when the distinguished mr cleaver and reverend cleaver says that we have to fill in where and take his mantle that would be almost impossible to do because over a lifetime in public service and a long time in the congress of the united states donald payne gained standing on issues that takes years to do but he did teach us along the way he gave us guidance on what paths to follow what clues to recognize and doing the right thing whether it was in the continent of asia africa or latin america wherever it was and in our own country i had the privilege of traveling with donald payne when we were going to darfur he didnt want to go to the sudan hed been there many times darfur but he was at that moment boycotting the regime in khartoum because of how they treated their people there and while we were in khartoum and in darfur he was in ethiopia and somalia and the rest always working always working to have policy advice to all of us and caring about what the impact of that policy was on people what was interesting to us though it was on that same trip to africa which many of the members of the congressional black caucus were on including our distinguished assistant leader mr clyburn when we went to liberia it was a boiling hot day and we all went to the ame college there the ame university and they were honoring donald payne for his everything for what he knew about africa for his values and how he was concerned about again policy as it related to people the encyclopedic knowledge that he had the great wisdom that sprang from that knowledge the plans that he always had to make things better and the way people just flocked to him because they would learn they would be inspired and they would love donald payne it was boiling hot and we go there and they decide that were all going to dress alike that day so it even got hotter as we donned our robes and here we were seeingnot only telling them the esteem with which he was held in congress that was the least of it because what we were hearing was what people from around africa the esteem in which they held him named a library for him at that university in liberia he was a schoolteacher and he never forgot how important it was for us to put our students first he called them the bright lights of our nations future for investing in their potential for inspiring them to succeed igniting the sparks that they had within them to do their very best he was very proud of newark and serving there i remember when he first came here his work on behalf of his constituents his neighbors the middle class working people people who were striving to reach up into the middle class he was always working for them he was new jerseys as has been mentioned first african american member of congress he remained a committed champion of equality and opportunity for all his accomplishments both on his committee where he served with congressman george miller who holds him in the highest esteem and now the foreign affairs committee where he serves with congressman howard berman well to hear the two of them talk today as if they have lost a

just think last week we had a visit to our office from bill gates coming to our office to talk about the issue of global health and he asked if donald payne could be in the meeting we had hoped that would be possible but then had to say that he was not feeling well that day that was a week ago but up until the end he was in demand recognized for his again standing on issues that related to the alleviation of poverty the eradication of disease again alleviation of hunger throughout the world what more could be about the gospel of matthew than ministering to the needs of gods creation which the bible tells us is an act of worship to ignore those needs is to dishonor the god who made us donald payne was all about worshipping god by ministering to the needs he was an expert on economic political and security situations throughout africa and i had the honor of nominating him recognizing his extraordinary work around the world i was proud to recommend that president george w bush name congressman payne our representative of the house democrats at the united nations usually it was just for one term in the case of donald payne we went well beyond that in recognition of the extraordinary contribution that he makes so again whether it was in his own district whether it was newark new jersey or across the world he was a powerful and passionate voice i hope its a comfort to his childrento donald jr to wanda and nicoleand all who loved donald payne his dear brother bill who traveled with him frequently and loved him so much i hope its a comfort to them that so many people who knew him well loved him so much mourn their loss and are praying for them at this sad time with that i again thank mr roe and congresswoman christensen for the opportunity to say just a few things about our dear friend who will be sadly missed and long remembered his legacy lives on in the congress of the united states"], [0.5286430418491364, 0.47135695815086365, 1, "i am going to start something tonight in an attempt to engage more of our american people in the process i know that you know that it is no secret that america is still emerging from the recent economic downturn we still grapple with high unemployment rates and our national debt we are doing better than we were doing 2 years ago but we have to do much better and we will do much better because we are americans that is our history that is what we do we persevered through the great depression of the thirties and the depression of the eighties and the recession of yesterday we supported one another and persevered through hurricanes through floods through tornadoes we mourned together and persevered through the assassinations of john f kennedy through robert kennedy and through martin luther king we persevered in addition i personally remember the attempted assassination of president reagan i remember writing president reagan a get well note in the second grade i even remember getting a note back saying thank you we persevered again fifty years ago today an interracial group of americans left washington d c on a bus trip to new orleans with the goal of desegregating bus terminals they were the first freedom riders they never made it to new orleans they were beaten and bloodied throughout the south but they sparked off a movement of over 400 freedom riders with the same goal and the same dogged determination and perseverance eventually our nation repudiated segregation and embraced equality we persevered if we are going to shake off this economic downturn we need to embrace the freedom riders spirit of perseverance and dogged determination that is so very american america will only rise up again on the strength of our collective ideas americans make up america the people make up the nation and it is the people who will keep this nation great the unitedstates house of representatives is the peoples house and it is time that we listened directly to the ideas from the people i am inviting the american people to join in this conversation here is how to contact me here is how to talk to me here is how to talk to congress you can email me at myidea mail house gov again that is myidea mail house gov that is because i want to hear your ideas or you can go to facebook and follow me or leave a message on the wall or go to facebook and contact me or you can follow me and i will follow you on twitter so we can have a free exchange of ideas i want to give credit where credit is due you and the house republicans last year launched youcut based on a similar idea and i applaud that again youcut requested that americans identify what funding they would cut from the governments funding and i am glad that you engaged the people but i think we need to go further we should and must request that americans share how they feel about everything what bills do they want us to champion what laws do they want changed what programs do they want extended or ended under house rules i unfortunately cant directly address the american people i must address my comments to you however if i could speak directly to the american people i would request that they send me their ideas for how to keep america great i would request that they send me their thoughts on whatever they want to talk about the american people can again email me at myidea mail house gov i will lead a conversation with the american people in which they will be an active participant i will bring your thoughts up here and i will talk about them i will engage you and congress so that people can read what you write and read your ideas i will also put your name on it i dont want the credit i just want a better country for our seniors and for our children every couple of weeks while the house is in session i will make sure to come down here and start this conversation with america again although it is a conversation by me alone right now i would suspect that we will get other colleagues joining in the conversation as we get other americans joining in the conversation but right now we are going to stop and i want to talk factually for a second about our financial situation and i want to do it as nonpartisan as i can and not lay blame on one party or one president i just want to talk about where we are we can start with recent history according to the unitedstates treasury when president clinton took office the national debt was 4 188 trillion when president george bush took office the debt was 5 728 trillion when president obama took office the debt was 10 672 trillion remember the total debt is the sum of our accumulated annual budget deficits so it shows a history of outofcontrol spending so what is our current budget deficit last year the unitedstates government spent about 3 5 trillion and collected 2 1 trillion in revenue the deficit was right at 1 2 trillion the nonpartisan congressional budget office estimates that this fiscal years budget deficit will be in the neighborhood of 1 4 trillion the deficit for this fiscal year is projected to be higher than that of last year due to increases in mandatory spending and less growth in revenues as a result of the temporary payroll tax reduction as a part of last years bipartisan tax deal so here we are the total amount of unitedstates debt today is in the neighborhood of 14 trillion and the current debt limit is 14 294 trillion the department of the treasury estimates that the debt will reach very close to this limit the week of may 16 at which time we will be forced to do some courageous things to avoid jeopardizing the full faith and credit of the united states of america so what is the big picture well the fact is over the last several years the unitedstates experienced an imbalance between spending and revenues as a result of the recession we spent much more than we brought in i would like to point out that our recent spending spurred hiring in the private sector it also provided small businesses with unprecedented tax relief it helped home buyers purchase homes in this tough market it helped police teachers and firefighters continue to get paid and it helped cities and towns across america weather this financial storm last monday night while leaving afghanistan i was having a conversation with a colonel in our armed forces i was talking about this special order and i was going back and forth with him about his input and about ideas on how to engage people he volunteered to be the first person to start the conversation and to pose a question he didnt really have much of a comment but he wanted to pose a question to the american people and his question was very simple and it dealt with how big and what we do as americans so right now i will start with his question and that was as americans what do we have what do we want the government to provide and how are we going to pay for it i think that thats a very basic question but its at the heart of the debate from democrats and republicans and independents so thats what i think that we will start tonight with that if i could ask the american people a question i would request of them to tell me how they feel about that statement what do we have what do we want the government to provide and how are we going to pay for it everyone agrees that where we are now is not where we need to be were dealing with big issues that demand big solutions we have an aging population rising health care costs crumbling infrastructure and uneven educational outcomes fortunately for us america does great things i believe that we can find a balanced approach that combines some reductions in spending on some programs but combining that with increases in revenues for those who are most able to afford it and other policies that will promote faster economic growth like during the clinton era the current budget proposals both the presidents budget and the republican budget proposed by congressman ryan dont exactly get it right they both leave room for improvement we have to get this right the only way that we can get this right is by both parties working together and sacrificing we know that the american people dont want to underfund education or investment to grow the workforce we know that they dont want us to sacrifice our longterm global competitiveness for shortterm gains americans believe that we can walk and chew gum at the same time we can invest in tomorrow and still get our fiscal problems and our fiscal house in order how do we move forward there are a number of options but one thing is for certain we should be honest about the tax burden currently faced by americans i want to briefly show you another board which were not making any proposals but we want to talk about for a second the effective tax rates the congressional budget office just finished completing an analysisin fact they finished it in 2010about the effective tax rates which are the actual average rates of taxes paid what were going to look at today is the taxes on the top earners were far lower than the top tax rates the tax rates for the top earners in this country are right at 35 percent of their income well when you look at it after deductionsand legal deductionsand policies that we set as a country those tax rates are far lower than 35 percent the top 10 percent of earners representing approximately 12 million households in this country paid an average tax in the neighborhood of 16 2 percent now after paying taxes their average income was 289 000 lets look at now the top 5 percent of earners which only represent 5 9 million households theyre taking home an average posttax aftertax income of 440 500 theyre paying an effective tax rate of 17 6 percent so you can see that when you look at 16 2 and 17 6 those numbers are far below the 35 percent thats in statute now when we get to the top 1 percent of earners in this country representing only 1 2 million households they took home an average aftertax income of 1 3 million while paying only a 19 percent individual tax rate so they fall right at 16 percent under the tax rate thats on the books again im not proposing what the numbers should be but what we do know is that the top number is 35 and the lower three numbers are 16 2 17 6 and 19 percent as the effective tax rate so the question to america the question to this congress is what is the appropriate number if were going to continue to pay down the debt stop running deficits but at the same time continue to take care of our seniors invest in our children do all of those things that continue to make this country what it is the next thing ill talk about what is the biggest takeaway from these facts its about sacrifice what are we willing to sacrifice to do the things and allow government to do the things that government should do what are the sacrifices we will make to take care of our seniors to take care of our children to invest in innovation to protect our homeland to spread democracy and to do all those critical things that we want to do these are the facts i encourage the american people to draw their own conclusions based on the factsnot hyperbole not conversations from either side not political rhetoric but from the facts so as i have laid out our debt situation i would ask that you send me your ideas on what you think the numbers should be this is the peoples house we see how they feel in the polls but we need to hear their stories directly from them i will request that the american people send me those stories tell me about their hardships tell me if they think theyre paying too much but give me a specific example tell me how that tax rate that tax liability that tax burden affected your family i want to know i think congress wants to know we dont presume and i certainly dont presume to know everything i think its very critical my grandmother told me a long time ago smart people know what they know and know what they dont know im telling you today that i dont know everything and im willing to listen to the people that do after all we need everyones creativity everyones inventiveness everyones ideas if were going to keep this country great this is america home of amazing structural feats the san francisco golden gate bridge in california the hoover dam on the arizona and nevada border mount rushmore in south dakota this is america one of the most inventive nations in the world we brought the world bifocals and the modern suspension bridge dental floss and the doorbell the airplane and peanut butter america brought the world the defibrillator and the traffic light digital recording and the super soaker water gun the artificial heart and the personal computer this is america a nation of firsts and a nation where our inventive spirit rings from sea to shining sea this is america where we do big things because we have big ideas as president obama said in this years state of the union address were a nation that says i might not have a lot of money but i have this great idea for a new invention i might not come from a family of college graduates but i will be the first to get my degree i might not know those people in trouble but i think i can help them and i need to try im not sure how well reach that better place beyond the horizon but i know well get there i know we will we do big things those were president obamas words from the state of the union in which he laid a course of where we are where we need to get to and why we all know well get there again i wish i could directly address the american people if i could again i would invite them to reach out to me on facebook on twitter or by email email me at myidea mail house gov weve been through rough patches before and we got through them because were americans we will work together and we will listen to the american people our perseverance ingenuity creativity and work ethic are unmatched were going to get through this because of our people last week i had the opportunity to travel to afghanistan batumi and baku and over there i just want to say that the energy and the optimism in our troops were unmatched because they were representing america they were representing what that flag stands for they were representing the sacrifice that stands in this countrys history we didnt always get it right since our founding but weve always always made it a goal to strive to be a more perfect union i hope that through this conversation we will continue to pursue being a more perfect union i want to take a detour for a second and just thank the new orleans hornets and thank their gm dave dickerson who when they found out that i was going over to afghanistan to visit with some troops that they sent care packages and tshirts and bands and stickers and magazines to our troops because they understood the sacrifice that our troops were making and they wanted to make sure that they participated in just saying to our louisiana troops thank you job well done we appreciate your sacrifice tonight thank you for allowing me the time to have a conversation with you about what i believe the american people stand for about the greatness we have inside ourselves about the great things that i know we can do when we stand together and thank you for allowing me to invite the american people to participate and become their own representative in this congress and talk about their ideas and express their desires their wishes and what theyre willing to sacrifice and those things they think we need to do i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.5280381739139557, 0.4719618260860443, 1, "i want to thank my colleague from california for having this special order and talking about the hurricane damage and what needs to be done in the future i have to say that the damage to my district was catastrophic we had many towns where initially at least it looked like the majority of the homes and businesses were wiped out when we go back and look again some of them can be saved but were talking about thousands of people who lost their homes and many others who lost their businesses it really created a humanitarian crisis in that first week or so because we were trying to get fema in with the disaster recovery centers and with the red cross and the salvation army over the first week the main concern was just humanitarian trying to find shelter for people trying to make sure they had food and water and clothes i have to say the response was overwhelming so many of the towns in my districtbasically it was a voluntary effort because in the first few days it was pretty much the people locally that were doing all those things towns had shelters set up people were bringing in food making hot meals i never saw such an outpouring of support if you will and it continues this weekend by this last weekend there were disaster recovery centers set up by fema in many of the towns particularly those that were hardest hit and i have to say that locally fema did a very good job the people who came out and set up the disaster recovery centers or helped with the humanitarian needs they really were excellent but i wanted to talk a little bit today if i could not that the humanitarian concerns have disappeared because they havent i dont want to suggest that but i wanted to talk a little bit about longterm needs if i could and take just a little bit of your time we met with the fema director this morning and i talked essentially about four needs that we really need to address one was what i call temporary housing in other words i want people to get out of the shelters and either be able to go back to their homes or some kind of temporary housing that would last them for a year or 18 months we set up and i think it should open by this weekend at fort monmouth which is one of the military bases that was closed under brac but we have identified at least 600 units i believe now where we can put people temporarily who lost their homes and cant go back to their home but i talked to the fema director today about trying to get trailers in and he said that was going to happen but it hasnt happened yet because many of the people right now are still living in a house that has no power and is not functional but because it is not terribly cold or hasnt been they are able to stay there once it gets cold they wont be able to and will have to go back to a shelter and we want people to get out of these shelters so im hoping that not only will we have some housing at fort monmouth but we can also supplement that and get some trailers in from fema that could actually be put in place on peoples own property so they dont have to go to fort monmouth or elsewhere over the next year or 18 months this is sort of the second stage out of the shelter and into some temporary housing for a year or 18 months and then back to your own house once it is repaired or rebuilt the second thing is that and i think you were getting at it before we have a lot of the beach replenishment and the dunes and the seawalls that were being used as protection some of my towns are actually below sea level and if it wasnt for the seawall or the dunes or the beach replenishment artificial beach replenishments that have been put in place the loss would have been even worse and now those are gone not completely but in a town like keansburg new jersey the dune is gone and in many towns along the atlantic coast the slope of the beach has gone down 6 or 7 feet and so they dont have any protection anymore seawalls have been broken up i asked the corps and fema today the fema director to give the corps the goahead to do emergency work right now in keansburg for example if you have another storm not even a hurricane since the dune is not there the water will come right in and youll have the same problem again so we got a positive response on that but we need to find out when that is going to happen when its going to begin the third thing is the match i have a lot of very small towns some of my towns have 1 000 people 2 000 people when you talk about longterm work on infrastructure municipal or state infrastructure there is a 25 percent match we are trying to get that reduced or eliminated because the towns cannot afford that the last thing many people have asked and im sure were going to have a debate i have no doubt that these more severe and frequent storms are a consequence of global climate change i have been around 60 years and ive never seen a storm like this nobody has they say it is the 500year storm im afraid my colleagues that the 500year storm is now the 10year storm and the noreaster that we would get every 20 years is going to happen every year i hope not but it certainly seems that way so we have to look at in some cases buyouts in other words people have said look we cant do this every 2 or 3 years so can we have the government buy our home well there is no home but whats left of it rather than rebuildand in many areas if the homes could be lifted and put on a platform or piling then maybe they could stay because the water would rush underneath i also brought this up with the fema director and he said there are programs at the federal level that would accomplish that so we are now looking and im not taking away from the humanitarian problem that still exists it definitely does but we have to look at some of these issues in terms of housing rebuilding and changes in the way we build over the long term i know that all of you and all of our colleagues hopefully on a bipartisan basis will be supportive of trying to get funding for all of these things the fema director said for emergency purposes there is adequate funding at least until the spring but when we talk about some of these longterm things undoubtedly there will have to be some kind of an appropriation that were going to have to pass here and i hope and i pray that were all going to work together to accomplish that thank you for the time"], [0.5269076824188232, 0.47309231758117676, 1, "good morning i want to thank my friend mr scott from south carolina for yielding me the customary 30 minutes and yield myself such time as i may consume a lot of verbiage is going on here this morning but mr and ms america let me tell you what were doing herenothing we were promised that we could have a vote to concur in what the senate did 8910 give it to the president and make sure that the payroll tax continues but thats not what were doing here today what they changed that to is to reject what the senate did and ask for a conference which the other side the leader of the senate says he is not going to do we could have done all of this last week but instead 435 of us have been flown back here this week to do absolutely nothing at the end of the day here we will not have accomplished a thing there will be no payroll tax there will be no unemployment insurance there will be no doc fix it just simply says we reject what they did 8910 which is a miracle in itself but were not going to do anything here were just going to kick it over to the other side in addition to this the president has not signed the omnibus bill i think he was going to wait for this one which means that come friday the government could shut down we have once again this brinksmanship of hanging by our thumbs so if i can make any point today for america dont pay any attention to that man behind the curtain here we are not doing anything we could have but we are not and after that great expense of shuttling us all back and forth last weekend we come here today and we really had a rare opportunity to truly come together and provide the vital assistance to americans in need the senate certainly answered the call in a bipartisan bill which was really quite wonderful it made us all feel really good about the congress it may have even made us go up from 9 to 10 points for all i know but they passed a bill with support of 89 senators and 80 percent of the republican senators and im very proud of them not only did they vote for that but they are signaling their great displeasure that the house cant do the same and until saturday night this bill had the blessings of the speaker of this house after a year of bitter battles in washington we stood on the brink of a bipartisan agreement to lower taxes and provide muchneeded assistance to those who are struggling to get through the holiday season through no fault of their own having lost their employment that is until a small army of ideologues said no and demanded that a truly bipartisan bill be tossed out in the cold what a shame so we meet today at the height of the christmas season as the timeworn tales of tiny tim and mr scrooge are playing out in theaters across the country and here in the house will we come together to provide a gift for the american people or will a small group of ideologues let taxes rise and the unemployed go without housing and food as we ring in the new year it is my belief and certainly borne out i think by not a shortage of media this morning that one of the reasons that the vote today is to reject the senate bill was had we had a vote to concur in it instead and say that we agreed with what the senate had done then it would have passed now i spoke about this game of brinksmanship last week and certainly you know weve gone the whole year hoping that there would be no payroll tax on the other side they didnt believe in that and certainly did not believe in the extension of unemployment now suddenly today we cant just have two months weve got to have a year the reason they couldnt get a year in the senate was the difference of opinion on how to pay for it it was decided that with the 2month extension we would keep it that we would not lose it after 2 months during those 2 months the house and senate we would hope would be working out ways we could continue it for a year there is not going to be that great hardship of bookkeeping that everybody is talking about we were going to take our time to fix it during those 2 months but the 2 months is basically an emergency measure which is being turned down by the house of representatives wed love to live in a world where every single principle we believe in could be made true where those who disagree with us would bend to our wishes and support our views but quite simply we dont live in that world after the majority spent the entire year ignoring the need for an extended tax break and renewed insurance for the unemployed ive heard frequent refrain in the last 24 hours that the policies we are considering today should not be implemented for 2 months but rather for a year that is pretty recent the majority should be heartened to know that hardly a soul in the body disagrees with it we all wanted a year as did the president of the united states as ive said before we know that we will get that year and that we will have the 2 months to work on getting that extension however after weeks of negotiation 435 legislators cant agree on an equally important point how to pay for the tax cuts for a year the democrats have said that millionaires and those who have benefited the most in the past decade should pay for this tax break the majority has said that seniors receiving medicare should pay instead which was indeed in the bill passed here last week this simple but profound disagreement is part of what has led us here today the other part of the equation is that the majority needed to design a vote by which no matter the vote totals they would never lose isnt that clever if we had another month to work on resolving our disagreement we could continue to debate without pause however the clock is about to hit midnight and the taxes of millions of americans and the unemployment insurance of millions more are about to be harmed because we wont strike a deal by now it should be obvious why we must pass this senate agreement its time that all of us accept the world as it is its time that we came to a compromise a compromise to benefit millions of americans in this time of holiday cheer for some there will be many more debates in the months to come about how to help the american people but now we must seize our opportunity and provide for the millions of americans who sent us here in order to make sure the season can be a little better than the last so im going to urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question when we get to that point but i want to reiterate again that nothing is happening here today when we leave here the tax cut will not be extended unemployment will not be extended we will simply go back home to await the consequences of what were doing here today i deeply regret that because i would have liked nothing better than the bipartisanship that the senate showed in this time of need to have been on display here as well in the house of representatives i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.5259097516536713, 0.47409024834632874, 1, "thank you very much for this opportunity we have been engaged for this last hour in a discussion about what to do with one of the most important parts of americas public agenda which is the transportation systems of this nation weve heard a lot of backandforth we actually heard that there was some agreement that we ought to get on with it indeed we ought to get on with it we ought to get a transportation bill before the american public and we ought to get it to the president unfortunately there is a gridlock and a deadlock behind all of the gentle rhetoric on the floor this evening there are some profound differences in how we move forward with the transportation bill well discuss some of those as we journey through this 1 hour or some portion of this 1 hour i think i would like to start maybe more than 200 years ago there is a lot of discussion that we often hear here on the floor and in the rhetoric across the nation that the founding fathers would do it this way or that way and if we only listened to the founding fathers most of our problems would be resolved usually those discussions really speak to not doing something it turns out that the founding fathers really did have a great deal of wisdom i came across a book written by mr thom hartmann called rebooting the american dream and in it in his very first chapter he goes back to the founding fathers and he talks about what george washington and george washingtons secretary of treasury actually did on the day he was inaugurated mr washington said that he did not want to wear a suit made in england he wanted to wear something made in america well make it in america is one of the principal things that my colleagues and i on the democratic side have been talking about for some time so when i came across this book i said wow this is interesting george washington instructed his secretary of treasury alexander hamilton to develop a manufacturing program for the united states and alexander hamilton did that he didnt do it in 2 000 or 3 000 pages as we might do it today he did it in just a short maybe 20 or 30 pages and he developed an 11point plan for americas manufacturers it turns out that many of those 11 points are what we have been proposing on the democratic side here for our make it in america agenda but tonight i want to pick up one of those 11 points and it happens to be the 11th of the 11 points that alexander hamilton presented to george washington in 1790 and it was on american manufacturers so point no 11 facilitating of the transportation of commodities the language is rather ancient english but it still speaks to the following improvements favoring this object intimately concern all the domestic interests of a community but they may without impropriety be mentioned as having an important relation to manufacturers there is perhaps scarcely anything which has been better calculated to assist the manufacturers of great britain than the meliorations of the public roads of that kingdom and the great progress which has been of late made in opening canals of the former the united states stands much in need he goes on to talk about the necessity for transportation here and copying what had gone on in great britain that is the development of public roads then he says the following remarks are sufficiently judicious and pertinent to deserve a literal quotation good roads canals and navigable rivers by diminishing the expense of carriage put the remote parts of a country more nearly upon a level with those in the neighborhood of a town they are upon that account the greatest of all improvements so here we are in mr hartmanns book rebooting the american dream talking about what the founding fathers wanted to do in 1790 i would also point out that by 1792 nearly all of those 11 points had become law and laid the foundation for the great american industrial revolution so back to infrastructure the word we use today we use infrastructure when we talk about our highways our canals our roads and our transportation systems there were in fact some public transportation systems at that time now speaking specifically of roads and jobs we often talk about jobs here we need to understand that today if we were to pass the senate version of the public transportation bill we would put 2 million unemployed construction workers back to work this year this year 2 million would go back to work if we were to take up the senate bill unfortunately we have been in a gridlock and there has been no effort to compromise my colleagues on the republican side are demanding fundamental changes in the transportation systems and the way in which we apportion that money those changes have not been acceptable to the senate and indeed those changes were not acceptable to even their own caucus the republican caucus was unable to reach agreementthey have more than enough votes to pass a bill out of this housebut they could not reach agreement among themselves let alone with the senate and yet they are demanding that the senate take up what they could not agree to on our side we have simply said lets go with the senate bill after all 74 senatorsboth democrats and republicansvoted for it leaving some 26 that chose not to support it so 2 million americans are waiting for action by the house of representatives and the senate 2 million americans want to go to work and yet we have this deadlock we just found some support amongst ourselves to tell the conferees get it done by the end of this week or take up the senate bill listening carefully to what we heard on the floor not more than an hour ago compromise is not going to be found keystone pipeline no public transportation funding eliminate the environmental protections that have been in place for more than 40 years streamline meaning eliminate programs so compromise is not there what has happened over the last several months well while our republican colleagues have been trying to get their own act together here is whats happened to employment in the construction industry way back in january some 5 570 000 americans were working in the highway construction and public transportation and construction sector in may that number had fallen to 5 510 000 some 60 000 americans lost their jobs while the republicans were trying to figure out how they could come to an agreement with themselves on a transportation bill they couldnt so 60 000 americans 60 000 families lost their ability to earn a living as the majority in this house failed to even agree amongst themselves on what to do the senate moved forward with a bill its been there nearly 2 months before this house available a conference committee was formed and gridlock continues so now there are 60 000 families without an income as a result of the gridlock and the inability of our colleagues to come to an agreement its time for us to move on its time for us to put a 2year bill in place as the senate has proposed one that would put 2 million americans back to work immediately states could move forward states would know that over the next 2 years there would be funding from the federal government right now the word from my friends on the other side of the aisle is well were going to go with the 60day extension states cannot work with that they dont know what would be available at the end of the 60 days they dont know whats available today because were up against a deadline its time for us to move with the senate bill its time for us to end this continuing decline this is may if we were to take the june figureswhich are now unfortunately coming forwardmore and more construction workers have lost their jobs they are in my district contractors in my district are saying there is no further contract available to us we wont be able to put our people to work we dont have a contract the states cant offer new contracts so it wont be just 60 000 at the end of june it will probably be 70 000 or 75 000 or perhaps more that have lost their jobs as this gridlock continues here in the house of representatives we can do better how important is this to the economy its very important to the economy and not just the construction workers not just their families the 2 million that could go to work if we accepted the senate bill and its a good bill it provides adequate funding for transportation for repairing the bridges that we heard so much discussion of for paving the roads that we heard so much discussion of just less than an hour ago of providing the money for the public transportation sector so that the buses the trains the planes can continue to operate its a good bill but not perfect not as large as many would want it doesnt have the keystone pipeline in it it doesnt eviscerate the environmental protections that are necessary as we build these projects so what would happen if we were to accept the senate bill end the gridlock put 2 million american workers back to work end the decline for every dollar we invest in infrastructurethats the highway bill and the transportation bill 1 57 is pumped into the american economy that comes from mark zandi chief economist for moody analytics spend a dollar on transportation and you increase the gdp you increase the economic activity of this nation by 1 57 so theres more than just transportation at stake here what is at stake here as we see is the continuing decline of the transportation and construction sector as a result of the gridlock thats been with us nearly this entire year what is at stake is the growth of the american economy its the grocery store that will have a customer coming in and not spending an unemployment check but rather spending a check thats given to them by the contractor and that money circulates in the economy so that the hair dresser the barber maybe even the gun shop owner will see their business increase 57 percent for every dollar spent 1 57 is generated in the economy putting other people to work beyond the construction industry now theres more to it than that one of the provisions that we would like to see in the bill which actually is in the senate bill is a tightening of the waivers that have been so injurious to the american economy the waivers that have been overused in the last two decades waivers that push aside the buy america provisions that we presently have in the law push those aside and say we dont care whether that money is spent on americanmade equipment we dont care whether that money is spent on jobs in america just pushing aside the buy america provisions the senate bill has a very important provision that will create even more jobs in america because it tightens up the waiver provisions and says to the department of transportation no you cannot just willynilly provide a waiver you must adhere to the law that says buy america a 60 percent minimum american content in the steel in the bridge thats going to be repaired in the asphalt and concrete thats going to be laid over the roads minimum of 60 percent content on the buses and the trains that are going to be paid for with your tax dollars what that means is make it in america that provision that is in the senate bill will enhance american manufacturing by limiting the waivers that have been so numerous over the last two decades as to hollow out the american manufacturing sector manufacturing matters this is the american middle class the construction industry and the manufacturing industry is the heart and the soul and the foundation of americas middle class and so in the senate bill it tightens up the waiver provisions and says that americans will have the jobs not some foreign employee of a company that has gained the contract i want to give you a specific example in california the largest public works project ever is the reconstruction and the rebuilding of the san franciscooakland bay bridge a new bridge billions of dollars the steel in that bridge was made in china six thousand jobs in china no jobs in america its said to be 10 percent cheaper it turned out that at the outset the chinese steel manufacturers could not produce the steel but they got the contract and what they did was to figure out how to produce the steel they built a new steel mill six thousand jobs in america no in china yes it turned out that the steel was not 10 percent cheaper it was shoddy the welds were not adequate they had to go back delays occurred it turned out to be even more expensive had that occurred in america that new steel mill would have been built in america and it would be there for the next contract the next bridge to be built in america or around the world but oh no were going to save 10 percent we lost american jobs if the senate bill were to come to this floor and become law the waiver that was allowed and given to the state of california a waiver that allowed the chinese steel company to have the contract would not have been allowed six thousand jobs would have been in america and we would once again make it in america and americans would make it but oh no it didnt happen manufacturing matters i would like to see another provision in the bill but i wont demand this and my democratic colleagues who support this are not going to demand it because we want to get on with providing those 2 million jobs for american workers in the construction industry but let me take a moment to explain what it is this is a bill that i introduced at the beginning of last year its h r 613 and what it says is that our tax money the money that is being spent by every american when they buy a gallon of gasoline or a gallon of diesel that that money goes into the highway trust fund and h r 613 says it must be spent on americanmade equipment highways this is the steel thats in the bridges this is the rebar thats in the roads this is the concrete the asphaltamerican made if you want to build a highspeed rail as we do in california then that highspeed rail is going to be financed with your tax dollars and it will be an americanmade highspeed rail train you want a train you want to improve your transit system it will be american made is it possible does this work let me give you have an example in the american recovery act sometimes known as the stimulus bill there is a provision for amtrak trains upgrade the amtrak system i think it was a little over 12 billion some wise staffer wrote next to that 12 billion a sentence that said this money must be spent on americanmade equipment one hundred percent americanmade equipment oh you cant do that well it turns out that you can do that a german company one of the largest industrial companies in the world looked at it and said 12 billion we can build it in america and they did they built a manufacturing plant in sacramento california and they are producing 100 percent americanmade locomotives because the law said that it must be done h r 613 says precisely that if you want the tax money then it must be americanmade equipment use our tax dollars to create americanmade jobs not steel made in china not trains made in germany not locomotives from japan its our tax money it will be spent on americanmade equipment thats what this does and we have the proof that it can be done its being done today in sacramento california by siemens a german company that built a manufacturing plant to take advantage of money that was available if the product was made in america another sad example the bay area rapid transit system bart needs to replace its 40yearold trains 3 2 billion the minimum in the law today is 60 percent the bids went out two bidders were in the finals one a french company alsthom another a canadian company bombardier bombardiers bid was 23 percent lower than alsthoms however there was a significant difference bombardier said we will build 66 percent american content alsthom the french company said we can do better a little bit higher price but we can do better we will build 95 percent american content the difference 1 billion in american jobs sixtysix percent 95 percent a 2 percent 3 percent difference in price"], [0.5256325304508209, 0.4743674695491791, 1, "thank you and i yield myself such time as i may consume yesterday the majority brought to the floor a bill that would replace the interior departments 5year offshore drilling plan today the majority is bringing a bill to the floor that would require the interior department to conduct the offshore drilling plan it is already doing now why would we be taking up a bill to replace the plan yesterday and a bill to implement the plan today is it because the majority is having buyers remorse about their own bill that would put drilling rigs off of the beaches of california the beaches of maine new hampshire massachusetts connecticut new york new jersey delaware maryland and virginia are they having remorse putting all those rigs out there off the beaches with no new safety procedures adopted post the bp spill overnight have they had some regret conscience stricken perhaps thats not a good idea that would be a very hopeful sign i think for all of us who care about the environment care about safety and care about protecting the beaches and the fishing industries of our country or is it because they were so compelled by arguments that the democrats made during the debate on the floor yesterday that they now intend to reverse their position and actually support president obamas offshore drilling plan that makes 75 percent of all of our oil and gas resources available for drilling while protecting the east and west coasts i dont think so because i am quite certain that the chairman of the committee intends to vote against his own bill here today and that the only reason the majority is bringing this bill up is to defeat it it appears that the majoritys dislike of president obama is so great and so overwhelming that they are about to actually vote against more oil and gas drilling offshore even in an era where president obama has already demonstrated his commitment to drilling there are more rigs out drilling now in the united states than all the rest of the world combined were at an 18year high in production of oil in the united states you have to go all the way back to 1993 to find a day where there was more oil being produced on a daily basis than today we have reduced our oil dependencethat is how much we have to import from overseasfrom 57 percent when george bush was president just 4 years ago down to only 45 percent during the obama administration thank you president obama thank you for the fantastic job youre doing in reducing our dependency upon imported oil that is something that did not happen during president bushs years in office and thats quite a record isnt it that were at an 18year high for oil development were at a point where weve reduced our dependence on imported oil from 57 percent down to 45 percent just in 312 years since president obama was sworn in we have more rigs than the whole rest of the world combined drilling for oil here in the united states that is quite a record and we thank you president obama for your excellent job but we know what the republican majority is trying to do here today theyre trying to remessage here that somehow or other president obama hasnt done a historically good job the majority is about to make their own history hererewrite history they are so bent on voting against president obama that they are going to actually oppose policy they hold most dearmore drilling we appear to have found the one thing that can stop the majority from voting for drilling over and over again this would be like red sox fans rooting against the red sox just because they signed derek jeter all of a sudden they would want to not support them any longer and the majority is putting this bill on the suspension calendar today even though we know they have no intention of supporting it so why are we here why are we wasting the time of this house when there are so many other pressing issues facing the nation we should be focusing on creating jobs for our constituents on passing a farm bill that helps farmers who are being harmed by drought and taking action on a spending and tax plan to avert going off the fiscal cliff of sequestration but are we doing any of those things no we are not the majority is not only asking us to suspend the rules to pass this bill they are asking us to suspend reality they are asking us to suspend the reality that president obama has reduced our dependence on oil from 57 percent down to 45 percent that we are at an 18year high in oil production in our country and that we have 50 percent more floating drilling rigs operating in the gulf of mexico than we did before the bp spill let me say that again there are 50 percent more floating drilling rigs operating in the gulf of mexico than before the bp spill and we have more drilling going on than the whole rest of the world combined the reality is that president obama is about all of the above thats his energy plan what the republicans do is they just keep bringing out things that really make the oil industry happy but towards the goal of killing the wind industry and killing the solar industry because theyre doing nothing for those industries and that agenda is oh so clear its transparently clear what this agenda is 1310 we actually support an aye vote on the presidents plan and a no vote on the republican plan we should not be drilling off of the beaches of our country when 75 percent of all the oil and gas resources have been made available and the oil industry hasnt even begun in a significant way to capture all those opportunities at this point i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.5249225497245789, 0.47507745027542114, 1, "i thank the gentleman for yielding and i congratulate him on his tremendous leadership as the ranking member on the appropriations committee when he was speaking today i was thinking back to when i was a relatively new member of congressnot even here 2 yearswhen we had the loma prieta earthquake in the san francisco bay area it was shocking to us of course it was a complete surprisea terrible natural disaster the bay bridge was out of commission and cracked the homes were on fire for days and days and daysa true natural disaster when i came to the floor when this issue was brought up by the chairman of the appropriations committee the honorable jamie whitten of mississippi he came to the floor and with his words of comfort and assurance to the people who were affected by this natural disaster his comments made all the difference in the world in listening to him no one had any doubt that the federal government was going to honor its commitment to the american people that when in time of natural disaster we will be there we have a compact with the american people how different the conversation is today when were talking about saying when in a time of natural disasterand by the way there have been many more natural disasters than in the san francisco bay area the loma prieta which stretched for long distances in northern california today weve had hurricanes earthquakes tornadoes floods forest fires still raging out of control in some parts of the countrytexas until recently in that situation i hope that its under control now or that the rain we all prayed for there is coming and what do we do we come to the floor and say now were going to institute a new policy that says in time of natural disaster were going to have to find some place to pay for it now whats next where are we going next to pay for it the distinguished chairman has said well weve paid for emergencies before and indeed we have im talking about something of a much different caliber im talking about a natural disaster im talking about the fema disaster relief fund with all of the disasters that are happening at once we dont know when the next one will come but what is frightening also is we dont know where this majority wants to go to pay for it i have serious objection to the payfor in this legislation i have a bigger objection that we would have to pay for a disaster we never paid for the tax cuts for the rich they never were paid for we never paid for the wars in afghanistan or iraq they were never paid for but all of a sudden we have to pay to try to make whole these people who have been affected who have lost everything ive visited there i wish you would maybe you have but its not that the joblessness story is finished its not that as we go to a new disaster were finished with the old one its just compounded someone mentioned earlier in the electionpeople talked about thisthat the american people whether in election or out of election want jobs and exactly what this bill does is cut jobs instead of creating jobs which is the number one priority of the american people this republican bill will cost goodpaying jobs its amazing because the bill that were debating here will cost at least 10 goodpaying american manufacturing jobsmake it in americaand perhaps tens of thousands more by cutting the advanced technology vehicle manufacturing loan program im not even going to speak too much about it because our colleagues already have theyve talked about how this takes us to the next place in innovation and competitiveness for our country the next place in technology for cars that will reduce emissions which will help to stop some of these natural disasters these loans are proven to be effective they have already created 42 000 jobs putting america to work making cleaner more efficient american cars we shouldnt have to choose between creating jobs and caring for those struggling in the aftermath of disasters like hurricane irene and the earthquake that preceded it and the floods that continue one of the speakers a gentleman whom i respect said this is a political move well if there is anything that is not political in our country it is a natural disaster do you want to talk politics when somebody is suffering a natural disaster there is no place for that at some place we walk on a ground that is more hallowed than the normal terrain on which we debate and that terrain is the terrain of the disaster that has affected the american people if you looked in their eyes you would feel so helpless that you could not make them whole you may not be able to provide them the personal effects of their families ive seen it so many times will they economically be made whole will their homes be restored in a way that makes it the home it was before that they loved that created a sense of community one home after another so were at a very very sad place for all of these people we dont know who is next what makes me suspicious about what the majority has put into thisand i want you to know thisis we havent paid for natural disaster assistance before theyre using this advanced technology vehicle manufacturing theyre taking 1 billion of it to pay for the disaster there is a half a billion dollars left and theyre rescinding it in this bill theyre eliminating it so this isnt about paying for the disaster this is about destroying an initiative that is jobcreating that is innovative that keeps america number one that creates goodpaying jobs in our country its really hard to understand what the motivation is for that but one thing is clearthey are using the disaster to eliminate that initiative and thats just not right but even if they had the best offset in the world i still think it is wrong for them to go down a path that says this time for your disaster were using this technology program whats next with all of the disasters that we have where do we have the room to say on those days at that specific time this is how well pay for it lets instead do something that gives hope to people that creates an economic boomlet in these places that have been affected and not a discouragement that they are being treated differently than anybody else has been in time of natural disasters i heard the distinguished chairman use the term emergency its a different story its a different story it is with great sadness that we try to meet the needs of people at this difficult time its in great sadness that we even have to have a debate about it i urge our republican colleagues to withdraw this bill come back clean let us vote together to address the natural disaster that has afflicted our country recognizing that we dont know whats around the corner as one of my colleagues said we said were going to pay for everything we dont know what god has in store for us for the next disaster we hope and pray that whatever it is we have the strength to meet the needs of our people in a way that has nothing to do with politics but everything to do with america with that i urge my colleagues to vote against this reluctantly because i would love for us to join together but not in its present form"], [0.524865984916687, 0.475134015083313, 1, "staff was and appreciate the fact that they took me and part of my staff down there to see the way it is in arizona but here is a map of arizona and the portions of arizona where i was were in the southeastern portion of arizona over here everybody has heard of tombstone but i was a little further south than tombstone all the way to the border and douglas arizona which is in the corner the southwestern corner of arizona and next to new mexico and along that portion of the southern border of the united states visiting primarily with the people that were in charge of border security the border patrol and the ranchers who live along the border let me talk about the ranchers first one of those ranchers mr krentz a year ago was murdered on his ranch apparently by illegals coming into the united states he was gunned down and killed the culprits that committed that crime by the way have not been brought to justice i met with other ranchers in the entire region and just asked them the question tell me what its like to live on the border of the united states and mexico as a ranch owner and they went on forever and forever and told me things that i was just really somewhat surprised about how they feel like the border is wide open that people cross across their ranches people come in they destroy their property they destroy their water lines all of this costs money to the ranchers and of course they have to be the ones that pick up the bill for the destruction on their property and they dont feel safe about the people that cross into the united states across their land they feel like the federal government has really not protected them and their rights and seems to neglect them even though the border patrol who i also met with i believe is doing as good a job as they possibly can do i want to make that clear the border patrol is doing as good a job as they can do as we will let them do as a nation and they are trying to protect the border the best that they possibly can and so i talked to both groups but in reality the people who live there are very concerned about their own safety and the consequences they have to pay for people illegally coming into the united states i heard something that was kind of surprising to me when illegals not all but when some come into the united states and they are captured by border patrol some of them ask the question are they in the 9th court or the 10th court and i said what are they talking about the 9th court or the 10th court well what theyre talking about is the 9th circuit court of appeals or the 10th circuit court of appeals you see the ninth circuit court of appeals that is a federal appellate court has jurisdiction that includes arizona but goes up to the new mexico border and so when illegals cross into the united states near new mexico or arizona some of them ask the question am i in the 9th court which would be in arizona or the 10th circuit court of which the jurisdiction is new mexico and the reason for that in my opinion those two courts have different reputations about enforcing the rule of law on the border and of course those that cross into the united states hope if they are caught the 9th circuit court of appeals would eventually have jurisdiction over their case when in their perception its a much more friendly court to folks who cross in illegally than the 10th circuit so i thought that was somewhat interesting they are also given when they come into the united states if captured their property some of them you will find a whole list of things and places they can go the churches that give them sanctuary places that they can go for medical help and they are given in a very organized way what they can do when they come into the united states that is provided in some cases by the coyotes that make money off those immigrants who come into the united states because immigrants have to pay the coyote money and sometimes the coyotes and the drug cartels all work together because you see drugs and people are going north and money and guns are going south because you see mexico doesnt protect its border any better than the united states does but in any event while i was down there in the corner of arizona i learned firsthand about the seriousness to the ranchers the people who live on the land their concerns about the fact that they believe that the border is not secure in reality they have to worry about their own safety on a daily basis after visiting a corner of the southeastern corner of arizona we moved and traveled across interstate 10 to interstate 8 over here to san luis arizona so that travels goes up to san luis across interstate 10 interstate 10 turns into interstate 8 comes all the way across arizona into california goes into yuma arizona and i went down here into the southwestern corner of the state of new mexico to also see what that border was like now coming across interstate 8 right here interstate 8 we pulled off the side of the road to the sonora national reserve and that is a national reserve that the federal government controls because i wanted to see the sonora national reserve interestingly enough you get about a quarter of a mile almost a halfmile off of interstate 8 right up here by the sonora desert and you come across this sign this sign is facing toward mexico so interstate 8 would be to this direction and mexico would be behind the sign how far behind the sign its 80 miles to the mexican border and here is a big sign that says traveling caution smuggling and illegal immigration may be encountered in this area so it seems to me that the federal governments answer to border security is to warn people that it is a smuggling and illegal immigration area once again this sign is not on the border this sign is 80 miles this side of the border so what is the government saying are they just ceding that entire portion of arizona to the drug cartels saying its a smuggling area and that you need to take care of yourself because we cant protect you i dont know but i was somewhat surprised to see that our federal governments answer to border security was to erect this sign and other signs that are similar to it i dont believe of course thats the answer to border security you wouldnt need these signs if the border were secure in reality not in just political statements that seem to be made by different individuals the texas department of public safety has issued some statistics regarding crossborder crime i have already mentioned about how the 34 5 percent of the people in local county jails on the border are foreign nationals but just since 2010 january 2010 the texas department of public safety has identified 22 murders 24 assaults 15 shootings and 5 kidnappings among other crimes directly related to spillover violence from mexico now sometimes we hear this comment well the violence in mexico isnt coming to the united states the question is is the crime from mexico coming into the united states we have already shown that that is occurring because 34 percent of the people in those local jails are committing crimes and theyre foreign nationals but also the violence is coming into the united states because of the statistics that i just gave you and now we learn of another phenomenon that is taking place you dont hear much about it because the victims of these crimes dont say much about it people who live in border towns the populous border towns in the united states periodically would get somebody who would come to their front door or they would get an email or a text from someone who says we know your cousin who lives in mexico and unless you pay us so much protection money your cousin in mexico is going to disappear something to that effect so we hear reports of that extortion on the american side of the border this is primarily among hispanic americans and what do they do well they may or may not report it what they i think generally do is pay the extortion because they want their relative in mexico on the other side of the border to be safe so we have that extortion racket taking place if the border were secure that certainly would not have occurred so it concerns me that we have that crime on the american side going back to the southern border of arizona i was asking the border patrol which was very gracious and explained a lot of their operations to me how do they bring drugs into the united states and they said every way they can bring them into the united states one of the ways that they are using now is the concept of ultralights an ultralight for lack of a better description is a kite that has a motor on it one person can fly that at very low altitude and they bring in 200 or 300 pounds of drugs into the united states they never land the ultralight into the unitedstates they just fly across from mexico into arizona and they drop their load 200 300 pounds of drugs and then they fly back to mexico then there is someone at a rendezvous point who picks up those drugs i say that because the drug cartels are using every means necessary to exploit the open borders and do everything they can to make sure that they bring in those drugs and they will continue to do so the border patrol is the agency that we have to protect the border of the united states like i said i think they are doing as good a job as we will let them do but primarily the border patrol patrols the border up to 2535 miles inside the united states that is their duty that is their jurisdiction the place that they are supposed to protect the unitedstates past that 35 miles or so they dont patrol that that is somebody elses responsibility now of course the bad guys know that is the duty of the border patrol to patrol that section of the border so when people are smuggled into the united states when drugs are smuggled into the united states the goal is to get past the border patrol demarcation line because once you do that you are pretty much in my opinion home free to get into the united states with people or drugs so that is the area of their primary concern and it is certainly the area of the jurisdiction that they are trying to patrol the best they can i have asked the border patrol tell me how you do this and i think they use as many different means as they can to patrol the border they will have vehicles go up and down the border they will have border patrol agents behind the border they will have some use of the national guard behind the border with the use of electronic equipment to view what takes place on the border so they use the equipment that they can but they obviously dont have enough border patrol agents to be directly on the border so they have some on the border and some behind the border monitoring the activity of the people coming into the united states and then they try to catch those that they can when i was visiting with one of the border patrol agents this is a photograph of one of their vehicles it is a typical border patrol vehicle that patrols near the border of the united states and mexico now you notice that this vehicle has steel mesh on the windshield and on the side windows it has steel mesh even above the lights the red lights on top so i asked the border patrol agent that drives this vehicle explain to me the steel enclosure you have on your vehicle he said here is what happens we will drive close to the border as we drive close to the border there are people on the other side of the border who when they see us start throwing rocks at us they throw them over the fence if we dont have this protectionand they are not little bitty pebbles these are rocksthey throw them over the fence and break the windshield the border patrol agents are injured they do that for various reasons one of those reasons is a diversion they will try to divert the attention of a border patrol agent at one location so that other folks illegally can sneak into the united states now we dont hear much about assaults on border patrol agents unless somebody is murdered which has occurred but in the last couple of years assaults on border patrol agents by people illegally coming into the united states is about 1 000 a year a thousand assaults on border patrol agents a year in the last couple of years and they are by every means necessary including the rock throwers who try to injure border patrol agents so you can see the relentlessness of some people who want to come into the united states they violate the law of course by coming here illegally and they will continue to violate the law and take on our border patrol agents even by assaulting them so they can sneak into the united states so it seems to me maybe we need to refocus on the primary mission of the federal government and its responsibility the federal government does have the responsibility under the constitution to protect the american people and the united states government should do that now the united states protects the borders of other nations we protect the border of afghanistan with pakistan we are protecting the korean border between the two koreas we protect the borders of other nations and we use our military to do it why dont we have the same resolve to protect the american border both borders the southern border and the northern border because in my opinion we dont have the moral will to do so we should make sure that we understand that people and other people should understand you dont come to the united states without permission it is the rule of law you dont come to the united states without permission now we have to solve that immigration issue that is a different issue but you cant solve that issue until you solve the issue of people illegally coming into the united states you know we are getting everybody we are getting the good the bad and the ugly and right now were getting a lot of bad and ugly crossing into the united states so the rule of law must be enforced by the federal government that is their duty now many of us do not believe the federal government has secured the border obviously people in arizona feel that way because they have passed legislation to try to protect their own state using state law enforcement of course the federal governments answer to that was rather than help arizona sue arizona take them to court you know its kind of like this sign their answer to border security is erect a few signs and sue states that try to protect themselves why dont we deal in reality and make sure that the border is secure and make sure that it is an area that is safe on both sides by securing our side we can protect the mexican side as well of course we need to work with the mexican government to do so they are our neighbors to the south while the united states now has decided to go into libya and spend 100 million or 200 million a week i dont know by bombing that country maybe we should come back home and focus on national security in the united states and spend that money on border security and securing the united states at the border because it is not secure in spite of what the secretary of homeland security has said border patrol it seems to me should have the mission to secure the border i will say again they are doing as good a job as we will let them do but they cannot stop people from coming into the united states although they are trying to when they had those vehicles going up and down in front of the border that keeps people from coming across we have fences in some appropriate areas we dont have fences everywhere but we have some fencing also the border patrol knows they cannot stop people from crossing so they try to catch them if you can that is the phrase that i think is our policy catch them if you can in other words they cross into the united states we see them we try to catch them but once we catch them they become our problem and then we have to send them through the entire legal process as we should but they are our problem they become our medical problem they become our prison problem if they go to prison if they have committed a felony then we have to deal with them and we have to try to get them back to the country they belong to in spite of those countries that refuse to take back criminal aliens so it is catch them if you can why dont we rethink that and prevent people from crossing into the united states if our policy was border security not behind the border security but have security on the border then people coming up to the border cant get across why because there are more boots on the ground and i think we should use whatever we have available we certainly should use the border patrol but also maybe we should use the national guard we have a few national guard troops that are down on the border although they are being relieved and their primary purpose is not to be on the border but behind the border looking at cameras watching folks cross now that is great to watch people cross but when they cross and they come into the united states once again they become our problem once they have crossed and we catch them if you can and send them back home if we can so it would seem to me to be a better use of the national guard to put them on the border i have introduced legislation to put 10 000 national guard troops on the 1 957mile border between the united states and mexico and put them on the border to not allow people to cross into the united states it is the federal governments responsibility of national security to protect the people so the federal government should pay for that and get the money out of the department of defense or somewhere reappropriate money to have the national guard paid for but put them under the supervision of the four state governors so that the governors can control their own border and protect them from entering the united states unlawfully no matter who it is i do not believe that we can say our border is secure when the government accountability office by their own statistics say that only 15 percent of the border is airtight that doesnt seem like a winning percentage to me and when they say under the best circumstances 44 percent partially secure what does that mean well it is sort of secure but sort of not but when you have 56 percent of the border is wide open spaces for anybody that wants to come back and forth that is not protecting the dignity and the sovereignty of the united states so it is long past time we quit talking about border security and actually secure the border from people coming into the united states without permission everyone and to say that the crime doesnt occur in the united states well it does not just to mention the border county jails that i mentioned the 27 percent that are in federal penitentiaries that are foreign nationals that are illegally in the united states but all of the drugs that are sold throughout the united states those are all criminal gangs primarily that are working with the drug cartels in mexico and colombia selling those drugs so the crime affects the united states the insecurity of the border is something that all of us pay for we pay for it in every way possible whether its with health care whether its with education we pay for it in the criminal justice system americans pay and legal immigrants pay the united states has the greatest the most liberal immigration policy in the world we let more people into our country legally every year than does any other country on its own so we have to fix that immigration issue but we have to secure the border first because when all is said and done so far more has been said and less has been done i urge my fellow members of the house of representatives that we come back home that we come back to the united states that we think about the security or insecurity of our borders and that we make sure that the federal government under the constitution fulfills its first obligationto protect americans and thats just the way it is"], [0.5239977240562439, 0.4760022759437561, 1, "for how she has put forth boundless energy making sure that we keep this issue of joblessness in front of us let me first of all say that i did two interviews during the votes today one with abc news and as i stood before the cameras they showed me two comments one from a gentleman who said that he was so disgusted with congress because nothing is being done and he believed that we needed to start trying to deal with the problems he thought that we should not be raising the taxes on what he called ordinary people or lowincome working people the other interview i did was on fox and was an interview where i was interviewed about the joblessness among african americans i think both of those intersect and the reason for this is i said to people that as a democrat i was embarrassed that during the last session of congress we failed to listen to the american public the public said they were interested in jobs i would go home to my district in kansas city missouri and people would simply talk about the need for jobs i would come back to washington and the only thing we talked about was health care and health care was important i supported itit was not the bill that i wanted but i supported it anyway and many of us supported it because of the way in which you dr christensen as a physician presented us with how valuable it would be but the point is we never ever dealt with jobs we are now into our 194th day into this congress and i am sorry and i am embarrassed that we have not created one single job african american unemployment is at 16 2 if you use what the labor department uses to factor real unemploymentits called u6the u6 unemployment for african americans is at 30 percent this is higher than the depression the 1929 fall of wall street created unemployment that devastated not only this country but the entire world i am saying here on the floorin this sacred wellthat african american unemployment is at a crisis level why would that be important to somebody whos not african american or who lives in a community where there are no african americans well in the first place we ought to be concerned about all americans period and the day that i am not concerned with all americans i want that to be my last day in this body i would say at this point that the congressional district from which i come is only 18 percent african american but the people of good will in my district understand that all americans should have equal access to jobs there are a plethora of reasons for the african american unemployment being so highi wont get into all of thembut i want to tell you that if we had unemployment among any group in america whether they were news anchors whether they were comedians no matter what the group i think that this country would be in a crisis mode we would have commissions we would have the top economists and labor experts becoming involved trying to figure out how can we erase or reduce the level of unemployment among this particular group now unemployment is at 9 2 percent with all americans that is unacceptable in the most powerful industrialized technologically advanced nation on this planet 9 2 is unacceptable 16 2 is sinful it is sinful in this country i believe that we have got to figure out ways in which we can get something done one of the gentlemen said during the preinterview with me that he believed to quote him exactly that congress is broke it pains me ive got to tell you that i think he is right i think it is a broken body but the public has participated the public is culpable as well and that is this we have people who run thermonuclear campaigns and instead of public people saying anybody who would run a nasty campaign is going to be nasty when they get in office so im not going to vote for him or her but thats not what the public says they cheer they rahrah this negativity on and the people who run the nasty campaigns on both sides end up in this body and they just simply escalate it with more publicity and until the united states citizenry comes to the conclusion that they are sick and tired of whats going on and begin to punish people for being nasty its going to get worse and worse and worse i would love to be able to some day close my eyes fall asleep among the elders and believe before i go that the united states of america will present to my childrenand their children and even their progenya state that has opened up opportunities to everyone and a state where the government works we cannot get anything done because anybody who raises their head and presents something if they belong to the wrong party theyre not going to get recognized and nothing is going to get done republicans do it democrats do it its wrong no matter who does it what we are facing right now is a situation that is grave and i dont even think the republican nor democratic parties in this body understand that we cant simply go as we are going were talking about the debt ceiling it has to be raised it is absolutely ridiculous to say that we shouldnt raise it i sit in my apartment across the street from the capitol at night looking at television and listening to people who know better say that its all right its no problem we can let the debt ceiling remain under the 14 3 trillion and nothing cataclysmic will happen and they know better i would feel a lot better if people would say something and really meant it because they didnt know better but they do know better but many in the public dont and so they think theres no big deal look if we dont raise the debt ceiling we can pay 60 percent of our debts but weve got to make some concrete choices on who gets that 60 percent and no matter who gets it it will create a cataclysm for the united states and perhaps the entire world italy spain greece and ireland are already in trouble in europe and they dont have central banks like we have we have the federal reserve and so to some degree we can go out and have an auction of treasury notes and bring in revenue they dont but if we end up having a very very serious economic problem in this country its going to trigger a worldwide recession nobody wins nobody comes out on top if this happens and the unemployment numbers 9 2 they are going to rise i dont want people looking at this tonight or any of my colleagues believing that those are my numbers or that i am the only one who believes there is going to be trouble ben bernanke reappointed by george bush says that if we make deep cuts in the unitedstates budget it is going to create a problem because right know the only money that is going into the unitedstates economy into the gdp into the economic activity is coming from the united states federal government and if you begin to cut back drastically it cannot help but raise the unemployment numbers and if we fool around and fail to raise the debt ceiling or just walk to the cliff walk to the edge walk to the precipice the bond rating agencies who have already warned usand these are not democratic bond rating agencies these are not congressional black caucus bond rating agencies these are not republican bond rating agencies they are the bond rating agencies of the united states of americaand they tell us when were in trouble and they tell us when were in good stead and they have said to us if you walk to the precipice we are going to end up getting in trouble because theyre going to downgrade our bond rating what does that mean well it means that the interest rates are going to rise china is our number one creditor external most people think that we owe more money to foreign governments than we owe anyplace else which is not true the majority of the debt is held by citizens of the united states china is number one outside the country and then japan well china has no other place to make investments so thats to our advantage japan has nowhere else to make investments thats to our advantage but they are going to say to us look you guys are not paying your bills and if youre not going to pay your bills it is a greater risk to us and what happens when theres a greater risk were going to raise your interest rates so if the interest rates are raised on the united states theyre going to be raised in all of the banks and anyplace else where we seek credit that is going to create a problem i dont understand how and why we have allowed all of this false information to go out about how this will not matter and nothing is going to happen it has nothing to do with the facts it has to do with the partisanship it has to do with partisanship and in this town in this place we allow ideology to trump everything everything falls second to ideology i dont understand how anybody could come to this place and say i come here so that i wont have to compromise you have to compromise theres not a person in the world who has been married for any length of time who doesnt understand the word compromise if they dont understand word compromise then they understand the word divorce and so what weve got to understand here is that were going to divorce this nationone side red one side blue one side left one side rightand we cant get anything accomplished as a consolidated nation let me just say a couple of other things and im through and that is if i can go back to the jobs issue just for a moment we know that only 18 000 jobs were created in the united states last month we need probably 233 000 jobs each month to be created in the united states why because thats about the number of new employees or people seeking work who come into the work market so weve got to constantly create jobs people who were laid off work 3 or 4 years and havent found work if the economy broke tomorrow and we were allowed to begin to see hiring in the major corporations the 10 employees who were laid off 3 or 4 years ago would now be three or four employees called back to work why because technology is constantly growing and advancing and where we needed 10 line workers 3 or 4 years ago we only need two or three workers today which means that weve got to educate the workforce what does that mean to the country well if we dont educate the workforce in the united states it means that the imbalance of trade with other countries is going to rise because other nations are going to be able to provide what we cant provide and theyre going to do it at a lower cost weve got to have a workforce that can compete with china and india and japan and indonesia and vietnam because if we dont american corporations are going to continue to try to do business abroad we cannot ignore the fact that a lot of those jobs positions were held by african americans and they need to be retrained we need to retool the unitedstates workforce let me tell you why we have some numbers that are disproportionate with african americans because i dont want people doing what has been done in this country for the last 400 years some people assume well you know the african american numbers are high because african americans dont want to work weve heard all of that unfortunately over the years the only reason we know what the numbers are is because those are the individuals who are out seeking work who have gone to the unemployment agencies in their states and thats how we know that the unemployment numbers are what they are but keep in mind and nobody probably thinks about this every time you read about a state laying off workers a municipality laying off firefighters or police officers or if you find any government agency laying off it means that the number of african americans who are unemployed will rise and the reason for that is that african americans disproportionately seek work in the government weve done it historically because it was always believed that if you could work for the government the chances are less likely for you to be discriminated against so we have a large number of african americans who work for the government you see all of these state layoffs all over the country and i want people to realize when you see those numbers please understand that a disproportionate number of them are african american now while we are here fiddling instead of trying to deal with some real problems in this country there are people with real problems people who dont have a job they have a problem im willing to compromise ive talked about others who wont i will im willing to compromise ive already compromised my father turned 89 years old last friday thank god glory hallelujah im happy hes in great condition probably better physical condition than medoctor im going to do betterand my uncle who is 87 im thrilled and fortunate and blessed that they have this kind of longevity in the cleaver line but im not ever ever going to compromise on one aspect and that is social security my father has worked since he was a kid his brother has worked since he was a kid for me to ever support reducing the benefits for somebody who paid into social securitythis is not some kind of giveaway program everybody in this country who paid the payroll tax paid into social security and in their sunset years they deserve the opportunity to live as decently and in as healthy an environment as possible and so im not going to compromise on social security at least on the benefits i will compromise if we raise the age at which people can qualify 10 years down the road i will compromise on lifting the cap on 106 000 right now if you earn above 106 000 you will pay social security taxes only on the amount under 106 000 so you can make 6 gajillion dollars and never pay social security taxes on but about 105 000 which i think is actually silly those of us who have been blessed to earn more than 106 000 should understand how fortunate we are and so we should pay above the cap its wrong its not right for people who earn a meager salary to have to struggle when there are people making 106 000 and not even paying social security tax i am representing missouris fifth congressional district and i want to focus some attention before i close on a tragedy occurring in missouri and the entire midwest region for that matter currently farmland and homes are underwater along the missouri river from montana to my home state of missouri record snowmelt runoff this spring along with unexpected record rainfall in the upper river basin filled up the reservoirs in eastern montana and the dakotas and word is the army corps of engineers plans to release large amounts of water from the reservoirs to keep them from overflowing that excess water has flowed downstream creating a path of destruction in its wake levees have been breached in iowa nebraska and in my home state in northwest missouri causing flooding of farmland road closures including interstate 29 and evacuations more than 500 000 acres of land have been flooded in the seven states along the river the high waters have moved eastward and further downstream in missouri causing high water and flooding in ray saline and carroll counties i have gone to those areas i have seen the flooding i have looked at the fields that farmers would normally have corn growing in underwater if we are here in washington twiddling our thumbs and the farmers in missouri and other states for that matter are struggling just to make itand with rivers still running above flood stage and soil saturated forecasters have predicted this summer flooding season could rival the worst in unitedstates history that means what was called the great flood of 1993 during my term as mayor cost about 25 billion in damagethis would exceed 25 billion the excessive high temperatures sweeping across the nation this week cannot erase concerns about river flooding these high river levels are not going away any time soon and neither is the risk of flooding there will be sustained high water along the missouri river through august as the reservoirs continue releasing high volumes of water due to this high water and saturated soil just a small amount of rain could trigger more flooding in areas that have already seen record flooding in 2011 obviously we cannot plan for every natural disaster however we have the responsibility to take preventive measures whenever possible the original purpose of these upper missouri basin dams was flood protection over the years other priorities may have slipped in however i believe now is the time to reevaluate the corps of engineers management plans and once again place the safety and livelihood of people who live and work along the river first reservoir levels need to be lowered between october and april so fewer releases are needed during the spring rain season a goal of targeted releases should be that they not exceed any given flood stage downstream and if releases above flood stage levels are required then a maximum flow of no more than 5 feet over given flood stages for no longer than 15 consecutive days could be set followed by 5 consecutive days below given flood states this cycle could be repeated as necessary and would reduce downstream damages this or other contingency planning is needed to prevent flooding events such as this years from happening again we are here dealing with politicali think shenanigans is a word that would fit people out in the country the real people are struggling whether it is from flooding or unemployment they are struggling and the congress of the united states needs to act you know one of the reasons we cant get anything done with jobs as i mentioned earlier or the flooding problem is this bickering based on political affiliation here is one thing i learned i am always watching animal channel and the discovery channel my family always makes fun of me but i learned something a few years ago watching the discovery channel bees cannot sting and make honey at the same time they either have to become stingers or honey makers what has happened here is we have

security secretary janet napolitano recently ordered immigration and customs enforcement officials to not deport certain classes of aliens who are in the country illegally instead these illegal aliens will be given 2year work permits that can be renewed indefinitely the reason secretary napolitano and president obama have given the american people for this de facto amnesty program is prosecutorial discretion the secretary and the president claim that the department of homeland security personnel can use their discretion to decide what individuals they can and cannot deport but in federal immigration law this discretion does not exist congress took it away from the executive branch in 1996 when it passed the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act the law requires and i will repeat that this law requires immigration officials to address illegal aliens when they become aware that they are in the country illegally it clearly spells out the actions that must be taken by federal officials in fact according to one of the nations leading experts on immigration congress frustrated at the time because the clinton administration was using it to let thousands of illegal aliens remain in the united states wrote the law to remove that discretion in other words the discretion that president obama and secretary napolitano claim they use no longer exists because congress deliberately eliminated it in 1996 by stating they still have it president obama and secretary napolitano are actually ordering federal immigration officials to break the law since the executive branch is citing a privilege that no longer exists in ordering federal immigration officials to break the 1996 immigration act which was passed by congress and signed into law today im calling on the judiciary and homeland security committees to hold hearings to investigate the legality of this decision to use socalled prosecutorial discretion just this week we heard from the united states supreme court that because the federal government writes immigration laws state laws must work in harmony with the federal government in striking down part of arizonas s b 1070 the high courts majority said that federal law shall be the supreme law of the land when laws do not work in harmony with the federal scheme or when federal law is explicit well in this case the law is very clear there is no prosecutorial discretion now my district in pennsylvania has one of the highest unemployment rates in the state and our country is still reeling from one of the worst recessions we have ever faced the department of homeland securitys unlawful action could have grave consequences on our labor force and on our economy both at the local and national levels additionally allowing individuals with forged documents to remain in this country could pose a serious threat to our homeland security let me also state that i am troubled by the expansion of the authority of the president that he believes he has in the past president obama clearly stated he had to follow existing immigration laws during a town hall meeting with univision in march 2011 he said america is a nation of laws which means i as the president am obligated to enforce the law i dont have a choice about that during that same town hall meeting president obama also said there are enough laws on the books by congress that are very clear in terms of how we have to enforce our immigration system that for me to simply through executive order ignore those congressional mandates would not conform with my appropriate role as president so what changed in the last 15 months did congress grant the president new powers i dont remember doing that fifteen months ago president obama said he cant ignore congressional mandates but suddenly 2 weeks ago he can again i ask what changed im concerned president obama overstepped his constitutional authority in this case just as he did in claiming executive privilege in operation fast and furious thats why these two committees must hold formal hearings and investigate this claim of discretion and the unilateral rewriting of federal immigration policy"],

me his mom was sitting in the room and he said congressman why are we still in afghanistan and i told the young lance corporal i dont know i cannot answer it i dont understand why we are not pushing the president to bring our troops home before 2014 and that leads me to a quote by ronald reagan from his book entitled an american life the autobiography based on reagans life and it dealt with lebanon and he was the president at the time perhaps we didnt appreciate fully enough the depth of the hatred and the complexity of the problems that made the middle east such a jungle perhaps the idea of a suicide car bomber committing mass murder to gain instant entry to paradise was so foreign to our values and consciousness that it did not create in us the concern for the marines safety that it should have in the weeks immediately after the bombing i believed the last thing that we should do was turn tail and leave yet the irrationality of middle east politics forced us to rethink our policy there if there would be some rethinking of policy before our men die we would be a lot better off if that policy had changed towards more of a neutral position and neutrality those 241 marines would be alive today i thank mr reagan for his service to our nation and i thank him for those words i wish both parties would listen to leaders like ronald reagan who understood that youre

intimidate and harass a tea party group in my district is typical of the reports that we are now hearing across this country this group submitted articles of incorporation as a nonprofit to the state of california and they received approval within a month but then they tried to register as a nonprofit with the irs despite repeated and numerous inquiries the irs stonewalled this group for a year and a half at which time it demanded thousands of pages of documentation and gave the group less than 3 weeks to produce it the irs demanded the names of every participant at every meeting held over the last 2 years transcripts of every speech given at those meetings what positions they had taken on issues the names of their volunteers and donors and copies of communications they had with elected officials and on and on perhaps most chilling of all the organizer of this particular group soon found herself the object of a personal income tax audit by the irs these are groups of volunteers who pass the hat at meetings to pay for renting the hall they give of their own time to research issues and pay out of their own pockets for printing flyers the donations made to them arent tax deductible so there is no legitimate purpose in asking for the names of their donors let alone of their volunteers unlessand this is the fine point of itunless the purpose is to harass and intimidate ironically the same tactics we now see used by the united states against tea parties were once used by the most abusive of the southern states in the 1950s to intimidate civil rights groups like the naacp no such tactics have been reported by similar civic groups on the political left so the conclusion is inescapablethat this administration is very clearly very pointedly and very deliberately attempting to intimidate harass and threaten civicminded groups with which they disagree using one of the most feared and powerful agencies of the united states government to do so these facts speak for themselves they need no embellishment or interpretation they should alarm every american of goodwill regardless of political philosophy for if this precedent is allowed to stand no ones freedom is safe i bring these facts to the attention of the house today and ask that they be rigorously investigated and if found accurate that those officials responsible be exposed disgraced dismissed and debarred from any further position of trust or power within our government"], [0.000478893518447876, 0.4995211064815521, 0, "a failure of leadership his own words thank you congressman it has been a
