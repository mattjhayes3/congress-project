new president who brought a vigorous new approach to the solutions of the problems confronting this nation and the world by their votes the people of this nation indicated they wanted a change in direction and this president offered a change he promised to try and reduce federal spending he promised to try to cut the destructive high inflation rate he promised to reduce the unwarranted and unnecessary federal interference in our daily lives with the help in some cases reluctant help of the 535 members of congress this president has made a new beginning he was not able to reduce federal spending but he did cut my more than half the request for increased federal spending he was not able to eliminate all the unnecessary redtape but he was able to reduce the number of pages of regulations printed in the federal register from 73 000 to 51 000 he was not able to end inflation but he did cut the rate which had been in double digit figures for most of the previous administration down to an annualized rate in the month of march of less than 4 percent for the past 5 or 6 months we have been provided with a consistent diet of bad news the morning newspaper headlines and the evening television news emphasize what they perceive to be wrong with the presidents program and ignore what many common folk perceive to be right with the presidents program nowhere has this consistent criticism of the reagan administration been more pernicious than it has been in the reports of central and latin america and particularly the reports from el salvador now i call your attention to some good news and to underscore the importance of this good news permit me to review in some detail what has been going on in el salvador mr speaker in land area this nation is about the size of your own state of massachusetts it is bordered by guatemala on the north honduras on the east and nicaragua on the southeast with about 135 miles of frontage on the pacific ocean about 5 million people live in el salvador el salvador became independent of spain in 1821 and of the central american federation in 1841 about 10 percent of the population is indian about 89 percent is of mixed spanish and indian blood and about 1 percent caucasian since achieving independence the salvadorans have in company with all of their neighbors struggled with a succession of authoritarian rulers and again like most of its neighbors there is both great wedlth and great poverty the political rulersclasping hands with the military or sometimes vise versahave attempted to maintain the status quo by preserving the privileges of the wealthy and preventing any upward mobility on the part of the poor but the thirst for freedom was not to be denied and in january 1931 in what most observers believe was a free election arturo araujo was elected president araujo had campaigned on a platform of better education better transportation and jobs for ordinary salvadorans and industrialization for the nation as a whole the new president had been educated at oxford he had seen the way in which class fluidity and mass prosperity had appeared in england after the industrial revolution he wanted to bring the benefits of an industrialized economy to his people the privileged class accustomed to using military power to protect their material possessions staged a coup led by the vice president gen maximiliano hernandez martinez the followers of hernandez sincerely believed the only way they could retain their riches was by keeping the majority of the people poor this quite naturally led to a belief on the part of the poor that the only way they could gain a better economic condition was to take the wealth from the rich neither side understood at all what arturo araujo had attempted to ac complish and quite naturally as they have in every other disturbed corner of the world the communists became active in el salvador their present leader is a man named shafik handal of palestinian ancestry in 1972 jose napoleon duarte was elected president defeating the candidate of the pcn partido de concilaclon nacional the political arm of el salvadors military this party had been ruling el salvador for about 40 years and they were not about to let a mere election change the course of events duarte was beaten and forced to flee the country in 1979 a group of young army officers ended the 45year rule of the pcn group deposed the present carlos humberto romero and duarteback from exilewas made president the government under duartes direction began to move toward land reform toward better economic and educational opportunities and toward a full democracy but of course their progress was not fast enough to please the marxists they wanted to rebuild salvadoran society on soviet and cuban models this then is the background of the struggle in el salvador john kurtwill a contributing editor of the national catholic register and editor of policy digest accuses the american press of romanticizing the guerilla forces and refusing to grant any credibility to the reforms attempted by president duarte it is estimated there are only about 5 000 leftist guerillas operating in el salvador guerillas who are receiving their arms from russia through cuba and nicaragua on the extreme right there are about 5 000 followers of the old regime this far right group would wipe out the land educational and economic programs of the duarte regime and return to the rigid military control of the past the far left wants to expropriate all the land nationalize all businesses and create a soviet state to accomplish this end they have waged relentless guerrilla warfare on the innocent people of el salvador one writer reviewing the salvadoran situation said the goal of terrorism all along has been to make the people cry out basta yaenough bring us peace no matter what you have to do would the establishment of a soviet model government in el salvador bring peace and dignity and opportunity to the salvadoran people what they aroidemanding is expropriation without right to indemnification of all properties in the hands of the oligarchy subsequent redistribution as collective communal or state properties management of the national economy on the basis of a system of national planning does this modus operandi of the soviet communists sound familiar we should keep in mind that such demands voiced by guerrillas in other lands have never brought peace justice or opportunity and if this is questioned we should solicit an answer from the poles from the afghans from the cubans and most recently from the nicaraguans now let us relate the good news the guerrillas called for and attempted to produce a nationwide strike this was to demonstrate to the leaders of el salvador that the guerrillas enjoyed the popular support of the people but the people refused to strikeeven though the guerrillas committed hideous acts such as murdering a businessman by mutilation who counseled his employees against striking the guerrillas are attempting to destroy what little economic strength remains in el salvador they wantonly destroy buses they blow up powerplants they dynamite roads is this to show their concern for the plight of the average salvadoran no it is not it is to intimidate the people but the good news is the people refused to be intimidated they did go to the polls they did vote they said we want a chance to determine our own destiny in a peaceful manner the elections in el salvador completely vindicated the policy of this administration we do not say the government in el salvador is perfect or not without fault but we do say and they helped to prove that the people of el salvador prefer ballots to bullets now let me direct your attention to those cassandras who have been pretending to see in el salvador a second vietnamridiculous consider the logistical differences vietnam was half the world away transport can reach el salvador by air in a few hours in vietnam the regulars of the north were a powerful disciplined military force easily supplied by the soviets through china the guerrillas in el salvador are small in number poorly trained and their supply routes could be easily interdicted i bring this up not to suggest that the united states should send troops to el salvador but to emphasize how ridiculous the claim that if we support the legitimate government in el salvadorthe only legitimate governmentit will lend to a prolonged 10year military involvement recently a resolution was offered it was suggested that the house of representatives urge the established government in el salvador to invite the guerrillas to join the government and to commerce negotiations for a political settlement this is essentially the same proposition being urged by mexico and france i voted against that proposal for the legitimate government of el salvadorparticularly now that it has been chosen in an open free electionto invite the leaders of the left to participate would be to legitimize the terrorists activity let those guerrillas who truly long for a betterment of conditions in el salvadoras individualsput down their arms and their bombs and go to work to improve the economy and to make democracy a reality i promised good news and there is good news in the american economy the reduction of the inflation rate is a remarkable accomplishment the presidents new and different attitude toward the role of the federal government in our everyday lives is a remarkable change we spent billions to create the great society and are we better off for all that public money spent the crime rate in evcry category is up we spent billions of public money in the war on poverty there is still great misery and poverty in this country the reagan administration understands that you cannot give somebody something without ultimately destroying the recipient of your gift the reagan administration is determined to get the government out of the way and to encourage the individuals to be responsible for their own destiny with an assist for all those who are genuinely incapable of caring for themselves as i go about the 4th district in arizona i find the people expressing new confidence and new hope sure things are difficult right now they say but it is going to be better when i visit the young people i find them sober and serious and determined to make progress on their own just this spring an amazing thing has occurred organized labor has

would like to say that the one place that we have real superiority in the field of nuclear war is of course the trident submarine the other methods in the triad are more conjectural or more doubtful but the trident submarine is in fact a very good weapon in the field of strategic deterrence it is a deterrent it is not going to win a war it is just going to deter things from happening nuclear war and we ought to bear that in mind the great problem this country is facing today is really not so much in nuclear deterrence or nuclear war but it is in having adequate conventional weapons available but the gentleman incidentally in his conversations said he would like to get 30 trident submarines i would say to the gentleman that i am the chairman of the seapower subcommittee and i assure you that i would not favor 30 trident submarines it is nice for the gentleman to come up here and off the cuff advise the country that he would like to pick a different type of weapon for the trident submarine and he would like to pick a different type of axe facility something that has never been studied in the committee never been brought out of the committee and that he would like to do differently in these things but the bottom line is we are dealing here with the most reliable part of the triad and we are not trying to buy 30 submarines we are trying to buy something much less than that in numbers i certainly would not approve of that number because i do not think we should put that kind of money in strategic weapons i think we should put that kind of money in conventional weapons"], [0.5002019107341766, 0.49979808926582336, 1, "you are using the word we we have done a better job than that we have done a good job they had their reasons in the other body and i do not

is good useful and so forth but i would like to point out one big hole in the bottom of our financial bucket which if we could plug it up would help and in fact we could balance this years budget if we could plug this hole i am talking about delinquent debts owed to the unitedstates qovernmdnt for some time now i have been concerned about the failure of the federal government to energetically pursue and collect the moneys owed to it as a result of delinquent loans unpaid taxes and various other legal claims i understand that the office of management and budget recently estimated that unitedstates citizens owed 175 billion to the federal government on september 30 1979 and some 25 3 billion of that was delique~it that is enough to balance the budget when we are trying to balance a budget reduce expenditures and continue to provide aid to those in need we cannot tolerate this kind of drain upon the unitedstates treasury we must plug this hole before it swallows us to give you an idea of the magnitude of the problem 13 billion in taxes remain unpaid 1 3 billion in delinquent amounts isowed to the department of agriculture 1 billion to housing and urban development 1 9 03 this symbol represests the time of day during the house proceedings e g 0 1407 is 2 07 billion to health and human services and 2 2 billion to the department of education to name but a few of the departments and agencies of the federal government with unpaid debts and claims waiting to be collected as of september 1980 the department of justice had 63 000 veterans administration debts worth 69 billion for collection and in fiscal year 1980 an additional 31 000 va debts worth 36 million were turned over for collection in the past 3 years the department of education has turned over some 26 000 guaranteed student loans worth 43 million for collection however before that time very little was done to actively pursue and collect those debts i have been putting pressure on the va and the department of justice to better coordinate their efforts and procedures so as to be more effective in the collection of delinquent va debts substantial progress has been made in addition to delinquent loans i am certain that tens of millions of dollars of recoverable claims for health care provided by the unitedstates goverrnent but which is covered by medical and hospitalization insurance go uncollected each year at the expense of the unitedstates taxpayer these arise out of the fact that the hospitals and clinics of the several military services and the va provide medical and hospital care to persons whose health problems are covered by workers compensation insurance or by private health insurance carried by the patient in recent correspondence with the department of the air force i sought information on the number of such claims which they had pursued and the amounts collected the air force responded that in fiscal 1980 they had collected 502 workers compensation claims for 331 121 but they were unable to give any estimates for the number of cases in which medical care was provided in private facilities paid for by champus and never reported for collection yet i have learned that in northern california a private company has been matching claims paid by a single large private health care provider with workmans compensation claims and in the space of 2 years that effort has increased that single health care providers recoveries from 45 000 per year to 1 6 million last year if that can be accomplished by one company in one area of one state prudence and cornmonsense require that similar techniques should be applied to similar claims collection efforts throughout the military services the veterans administration and other government health facilities it seems to me that the internal revenue service has acquired more skill at collecting moneys owed than any other agency of the government and it might be a good idea for other agencies to consult with the irs and the general accounting office to determine if there are techniques that could be employed in their debt collection efforts so that people will begin to realize that the federal glovernment has not forgotten them and their loan unfortunately under present procedures it appears that the federal agencies do in fact simply forget about the loan once it is made and let it go uncollected and it is the american taxpayer who picks up that load on top of all the others we need effective techniques to make it clear from the beginning that the government will not forget the loans it makes and that it will vigorously follow up on its collection efforts in this vein i was pleased to note on pages 22353 and 22354 of the april 17 1981 federal register that the attorney general and the general accounting office have advised federal agencies to consider contracting with private sources for collection services to supplement federal collection programs this is a first step and a good one but more can and should be done to stop this drain of billions of dollars from the unitedstates treasury we owe this much to the unitedstates taxpayer"]], "top_unsure":

subcommittee chairmen and the ranking members did to develop our reconciliation recommendations what was being done was not pleasant but it was done in response to the directive of our colleagues i took a great deal of pride in the fact that there was a cooperative atmosphere in our work let me focus first on the major provisions of title xv of h r 3964 which contains the budget reconciliation recommendations of the committee on ways and means and illustrate how these recommendations compared with the administration proposals are more fair and equitable this title provides spending reductions of approximately 9 3 billion in fiscal year 1982 and another 35 1 billion from fiscal year 1983 to 1986 with respect to programs within the jurisdiction of the ways and means committee before i go into detail on the specific provisions in our tihe i would like to emphasize that these recommendations are the results of several months of hearings and detailed consideration by the subcommittees in fact the committee began hearings on possible reductions in the programs within its jurisdiction in march to insure that we could comply with both the instructions and the difficult timetable imposed by reconciliation therefore i believe that the committees recommendations represent responsive reductions in our programs which will result in genuine savings subtitle a consists of three parts amending the trade adjustment assistance programs for workers and firms the amendments reflect administration proposals in nearly all respects the worker trade adjustment assistance program was changed substantially the major amendments are first that the causal link between increased imports and worker layoffs is strengthened from the present contributed importantly standard to the substantial cause standard used for industrywide import relief and second basic benefits are reduced to state unemployment compensation levels for a maximum duration of 52 weeks of unemployment compensation and trade adjustment combined payable only after unemployment benefits are exhausted the program would focus on increased training and job search and relocation subtitle b contains the changes made to the social security program the administration you might remember proposed that student benefits be phased out immediately high school seniors who have just graduated would be denied benefits this fall despite the commitments we made to them as surviving student beneficiaries by the time this legislation would be finalized they would have less than 1 month to make other arrangements to finance their education in addition the administration proposal required that existing beneficiaries take a 25percent reduction in benefits each year in contrast this bill protects the high school seniors that have just graduated and the high school seniors of next year however it provides that no benefits be paid during the summer except when a student is enrolled full time in a summer program and that after the 1981 july costofliving increase there will be no additional increases for college students thus compared with the administrations proposals the committee bill protects 1 4 million high school juniors and seniors plus the 2 million current student beneficiaries would not suffer reductions in their monthly benefit levels while attending school full time the administration proposed that the social security minimum benefit be eliminated entirelyboth for beneficiaries currently on the rolls and for new beneficiaries for example this would have meant that someone age 80 receiving a small pension but with income slightly above the poverty line could lose 1 000 or more per year in social security benefits this amount would not have been made up by any increases in supplemental security income ssi or other governmental assistance programs it is unfair and poor social policy to make such reductions in income for individuals who have no ability to compensate for this loss the committee bill on the other hand eliminates social security minimum benefits only for those individuals reaching age 62 after january 1982 this provision in contrast to the administrations proposal would not affect the 3 million beneficiaries currently relying on the minimum benefit to make up for these losses in savings the committee recomt ends that the july 1982 costofliving ii rease be halved and that the remaind r plus additional months of inflation 1je given in october the start of the fiscal year this same increase applie to ssi veterans and railroad retirmnent benefits the administration has recommended in their social security financing package that the entire july 1982 costofliving increase be postponed until october thus the committee recommendation is a modified version of the administrations proposal the committee also recommended that the retirement test exempt age remain at 72 throughout 1982 that there be a modification of the month of initial entitlement for 62yearold workers and their dependents and that administration proposals regarding a curtailment of the lumpsum death benefit be enacted subtitle c contains the changes in the unemployment compensation programs aid to families with dependent children afdc ssi lowincome energy and social services the unemployment changes basically include administration proposals the committee bill eliminates the national trigger so that extended benefits will be payable only in states where state unemployment rates reach specified levels the committee bill excludes extended benefit claimants from statetriggered calculations in addition the unemployment compensation requirements for exmilitary personnel are tightened considerably the committee bill makes major modifications in the afdc program most important the bill reduces the amount of earnings a family can have and still qualify for some amount of afdc benefits while these changes in the earnings disregards will reduce by 2 000 to 4 000 the amount of yearly earnings a family can have and still receive afdc they are not as drastic or severe as the changes proposed by the administration the committee was concerned that the administrations proposals would eliminate any financial incentive for single parents with children to remain in the workforce for example under the administrations bill a california afdc family of three after the mother had been on the job for 4 months would have disposable monthly income of 434 whereas a mother with the same number of children but who didnt work would have 578 thus the first family is penalized 144 per month for working plus the family loses medicaid the congressional budget office has calculated that roughly onethird of afdc mothers who currently work would no longer work if the administrations proposals were put in place the committee bill mandates that states assume that the income of stepparents is available to an afdc child it requires retrospective accounting and monthly reporting in those cases where the state judges them to be cost effective in addition the committee bill allows states to require certain afdc recipients to participate in job search and work experience assignments in other words states will be allowed to operate workfare programs so long as they contain certain specified safeguards several amendments will improve state child support enforcement programs for example child support agencies are authorized to collect alimony in addition to child support and to obtain child support payments through a reduction in unemployment benefits the committee also makes minor changes in the ssi program in the lowincome energy assistance program the committee recommends a funding level of 1 4 billion in 1982 and 1 6 billion in 1983 under this reauthorization of lowincome energy assistance greater flexibility is provided to the states so each state can design and operate a program that meets it particular energyrelated problems the formula for allocating funds among the states would not be changed subtitle d contains the medicare changes the bill achieves 1 6 billion in health savings by change in medicare reimbursement benefits deductibles and coinsurance amounts and through more efficient program administration medicare reimbursement limits on inpatient hospital and homehealth services would be tightened an incentive reimbursement system for renal dialysis service would be established interest earnings on funded depreciation accounts of providers would be offset against interest expenses in determining reimbursement rules regarding reduced payment for longterm care in hospitals would be tightened and a provision of existing law postponing reimbursement to certain hospitals at the end of fiscal year 1981 be repealed deductible and coinsurance amounts under medicare part ahospital insurancewould be changed to more nearly reflect current hospital costs and a coinsurance amount of 1 per day would be established for the 1st through 60th day of inpatient hospital care the annual deductible for medlcare part b would be increased from 60 to 70 and indexed in future years to reflect costofliving increases the secretary of health and human services would be authorized to impose civil money penalties on persons who file fraudulent medicare or medicaid claims and utilization guidelines would be established for coverage of homehealth care authority would also be given to the secretary of health and human services to terminate the least effective professional standards review organizations during the fiscal year 1982 and the entire psro program would be repealed at the end of fiscal year medicare part b would become the secondary payor to the federal employees health benefits fehb program for people age 65 and over who have coverage under both programs medicare part a would become secondary payor to the federal employees program with respect to people reaching age 65 on or after january 1 1982 this briefly concludes the recommendations from the committee the reconciliation process particularly when done in connection with the first resolution is a most difficult process the committee on ways and means began work on its legislative recommendations long before the budget committee developed its reconciliation instructions we felt that this was the only responsible way of achieving reductions in an evenhanded manner in the complex programs under the jurisdiction of the committee in working on these proposals the committee functioned in a very bipartisan manner with few exceptions there was general agreement on the committees recommendations by members of both parties i regret that the administration continues to find it necessary to only approach legislation in a very partisan and divisive manner the committees and the house itself function best when we all work together to develop a reasoned and wellthoughtout legislative proposal i am proud to say that the ways and means committee has worked together in the developing of this legislation and i only regret that my republican colleagues have yielded to outside pressure to reject the product of their very own work while we in the committee used a scalpel in making our program cuts here on the floor of the house of representatives"], [0.00020131468772888184, 0.4997986853122711, 1, "i thank the gentleman for yielding i rise in support of the house budget resolution and in opposition to grammlatta i believe that the house budget committee resolution is a more honest a more fair and a more economically sound budget package than the grammlatta package on the merits the grammlatta substitute should be defeated moreover because of the procedure dictated by the rule we have adopted we must first reject grammlatta in order to have a vote on the budget committees resolution if we adopt grammlatta we will never have the opportunity to vote on the budget committee resolution in rejecting grammlatta we must reject president reagans appeal to support it as we all know he favors grammlatta personally i regret that we must oppose president reagan on this issue he is not only very popular at the moment but we all share his desire to improve our economy we also share his general goals of slowing the growth of federal spending of providing the american people with some tax relief and of promoting savings and investment all of which are important in getting our economy back on track unfortunately these commonly shared goals will not be advanced by the grammlatta substitute i say that first because grammlatta proposes an excessively large budget deficit of 38 billion the presidents original budget proposal had an even larger deficit of 45 billion in both cases unrealistic economic assumptions are being used which means that the deficit will be much larger than those proposals project for example the presidents budget assumes an inflation rate of 7 2 percent for fiscal year 1982 is there anyone in this house who really be lieves the inflation rate will be that low next year much as i would like to believe it i do not and neither do virtually all objective observers the presidents budget further assumes that in fiscal year 1982 the cost of government borrowing will average 8 9 percent is there anyone in this house who really believes that the interest rates will be that low next year much as i would like to believe it i do not and neither do virtually all objective observers the unpleasant truth is that these assumptions have no relationship to economic realities we know that inflation and interest rates will be higher than that next year and that therefore the deficit projected by the president is unrealistically low the american people did not vote in 1980 for this large a deficit they wanted more progress toward a balanced budget and the house budget committee resolution which projects a deficit of 25 billion would provide us with that progress moreover the budget committee resolution uses realistic economic assumptions in projecting a smaller defict it assumes an inflation rate of 9 9 percent next year and an interest rate of 12 percent these are honest projections and accordingly we can have greater confidence in the deficit which the resolution projects as a candidate for president mr reagan argued forcefully that federal deficits substantially contribute to inflation the american people believed him and most of us pledged to reduce if not eliminate such deficits how then can he and we support a budget such as grammlatta which projects so large a defict beyond imposing so large a deficit the grammlatta substitute is fatally deficient for other reasons the spending cuts it proposes are unfair falling especially hard on the most vulnerable in our society moreover in many cases these cuts would simply shift costs to local or state budgets or actually increase costs to society by eliminating essential investments consider these examples elemerktary and secondary education programs would be cut by 25 percent a deep reduction which would have to be picked up by state and local taxpayers or result in a loss of essential help for the handicapped and disadvantaged eligibility and support for college loans and grants would be sharply reduced making it impossible for large numbers of lower and middleincome students to attend school vital job training programs would be eliminated resulting in greater welfare costs many health programs would be cut by 25 percent affecting medical care for the elderly and veterans among others economic development programs of great importance to job development in the northeast and other distressed areas would be eliminated support for rail service would be eliminated and there would be substantial cuts in other mass transit programs these are just a few examples but they serve to illustrate the inequity and shortsightedness of the presidents approach other deep cuts would affect items like child nutrition legal services for the poor energy assistance housing and many other programs which seek to address real needs we knowv that budget restraint will require cuts in many programs including ones which help our constituents and region but these proposals lack balance and vision there is no safety net despite the administrations claim to the contrary with such deep cuts one might well ask why the presidents budget deficit is so large the answer is that there are substantial increases projected for defense spending and there is a significant loss of revenucs projected because of his tax cut let me say at this point that i support some increases in defense spending as well as some reductions in the tax burden however i believe that the size and direction of the presidents defense and tax proposals are unfair and economically unsound for fiscal year 1982 there is little or no difference between the defense proposals of the president and the house budget committee but if we consider the presidents projections for military spending in the outyears the increases are truly astounding and pose serious risks for our economy over a period of 4 years the president proposes to increase military spending from its current level of 162 billion to 304 billion this means that military expenditures which now represent 24 percent of our total budget would rise to 33 percent the magnitude of this military buildup becomes clearer when one considers that after adjusting for inflation it would represent a buildup three times as large as the one that took place during the vietnam war one of the chief causes of our current inflation was president johnsons refusal to raise taxes to pay for the costs of that military buildup while i believe that some increases are necessary in our defense budget we can hardly afford to wreck our economy by throwing money at the pentagon it cannot absorb that much money efficiently we must be more selective in identifying our security priorities spending the money where necessary but not wasting it finally the presidents tax proposal is unfair and based on a faulty premise it is unfair because under kemproth the foundation of the presidents tax proposal most of the benefits would go to upperincome americans the president does not dispute this but he argues that upperincome americans will save and invest most of their benefits and this will boost the economy thereby helping all americans and that is the faulty premise while we do need more savings and investment there is no reason to believe such benefits will be saved or invested in fact economic history demonstrates that most of them will be spent and this will be even more true today when the expectation of inflation is still with us if this is true demand will increase pushing prices up still higher instead of assuming people will save and invest the tax bill should reward people including lowand middleincome people who actually do save or invest i would like to support president reagan i share his concern for our economy and his general goals unfortunately the particulars of his program will not achieve the economic goals we all wish to achieve therefore i urge my colleagues to reject the grammlatta substitute and to support the budget committees resolution it features a much lower deficit a tax cut which is more fairly allocated and targeted to promote savings and investment and because that tax cut is more modest it will restore some funds for absolutely vital domestic programs"], [0.00020137429237365723, 0.49979862570762634, 0, "i am deeply concerned about a double oreach of faith the house of representatives may be about to commit against the american people just over 7 months ago the american people forcefully delivered a message to all of us about the state of the economy the tax load on the average american worker and runaway federal spending there is no one in this chamber who failed to understand what the overwhelming majority of americans were saying american taxpayers want changeand relief from the crushing economic burdens they bear and they expect us to do our jobs and give it to them seven years ago this house created the mechanism to do just that in 1974 the congress faced up to the need to gain control of the budgetary process for the first time it revamped its budgeting procedures created a system of setting target ceilings and wrote into being the reconciliation process but for 7 years congress ignored that procedure once it had been enacted business went on as usual and federal spending continued to spiral out of control doubledigit inflation and the crushing tax burden the american people voted so strongly against last fall were the direct result of that program of spend and spend and spend throughout those 7 years the procedure to control that spending was on the books now it is being used as it was intended to be throughout all that period for the first time president reagan with the support of republicans and responsible members of the democratic majority intends to live up to those expectations of the american people it is the height of irony now to hear some of those very same members who wrote the budgetary reforms in the first place and who voted them into law protest that the process is being abusedsimply because it is being used as it was meant to be for the first time we face very real and very growing problems during the next several fiscal years unless we move right now to gain control of the federal spending process that budget control mechanism the congress created 7 years ago with its essential reconciliation component can impose needed fiscal discipline on the congress for the first time we know that the job has to be done this countrys economy is in deep need of major stimulation we are all encouraged in the improvement in the inflation rate during the past 3 months but there is no one in this chamber who does not fully understand the great need for tax reforms and investment incentives to get the economy truly moving once again a major element of any such package must be a cut in federal spending that requirement is underlined by this nations need to enhance its spending on defense for the past several years we have allowed our military to fall behind the crucial demands it faces in an increasingly dangerous world we know that we cannot continue uncontrolled spending on every program ever suggested and meet those most immediate needs as well we have to cut the growth in other federal spending programs if we are going to be able to spend the extra 191 billion president reagan says is needed during the next 5 years to bring the military back from the depths to which the carter administration allowed our defenses to fall we will not be able to accomplish that badly needed task unless we regain control of the federal spending process a number of the house committees have done an admirable job in working toward that goal during the reconciliation process i want to congratulate them today for the work they have done republicans are not attempting to dictate the terms of the reconciliation bill we understand that bringing the budget into balance with the budget authorization ceiling congress enacted in may requires a process of conciliation and compromise but we insist that the house of represertatives live up to the commitments it made to the american people 7 years ago when it adopted that budget reform package and in may when it enacted that budget ceiling to meet those desires the american people expressed so clearly last november it took the congress 25 years to spend this country into the fiscal mess the american worker faces today we know and those american workers know that those problems are not going to be solved overnight or in a single years budget all of us know that spending cuts such as those being proposed today are going to have to be repeated for the next several years to make a dent in the economic problems we face we are going to have to cut the growth of most federal spending programs in fiscal 1982 and fiscal 1983 and fiscal 1984 and probably beyond if we are to slow inflation and halt the everincreasing load of taxes on the backs of those american workers we know as well that the job is not going to be an easy one that job is going to be even more difficult however if we give in to temptation and put off starting the work until next year that will be an election year does anyone here seriously think the congress will be willing to start cutting budgets in the middle of an election campaign at a time when the social security system will be on the verge of collapse unless we have the courage to face the taskthe same sort of courage president reagan showed when he brought that problem to our attention this spring what we are unwilling to start this year will be even more difficult to begin in 1982 and we ought to be honest enough with ourselves our colleagues and the american worker and taxpayer to admit that here today we will not make that needed beginning by caving in to the democratic leadership of the house as several of our committees have done and adopting spending cuts that are false counterproductive and which will actually force spending and inflationary increases we will not make that needed beginning by playing politics as usual as the democratic leadership proposes to do in this budget reconciliation process and by continuing to push those uncontrolled spending programs of the past quarter century that have spent our nation into the economic poorhouse we will accomplish that needed beginning only by following the lead of those responsible committees which have lived up to our commitments to the american taxpayer the american people are watching and waiting and they want responsible action now it is time for all of us to live up to those commitments the house republican policy committee of which i am chairman has addressed these questions and has adopted an official policy statement on this issue the full text of the statement follows republicans welcome the first steps which have been taken to bring the budget reconciliation process into balance with the bipartisan budget ceiling resolution for fiscal 1982 supported by president reagan and adopted by congress last month major work remains to be done however if the growth of federal government spending is to be slowed to ease the runaway inflation and soaring taxes that have so sorely plagued american workers in recent years eight house committees have met the task of acting to cut spending program proposals to bring them into line with the budget ceiling resolution another seven however have fallen far short of that task in many cases they have acted in conjunction with the democratic leadership to continue what president reagan has aptly described as the fiscal joy ride this country has been on for the past several decades it is a breach of faith with those workers to adopt artificial spending cuts that do not bring spending decreasesor which actually add to federal spending unfortunately that is the course chosen by some of the democraticallycontrolled house committees as they continue to play politics as usual with the pocketbooks of american taxpayers rather than making good faith efforts to live up to the budget ceiling resolution adopted by congress the democratic leadership has chosen instead to propose completely unacceptable counterproductive and false spending cuts by some house committees one of the biggest reasons for the tremendous growth in government spending in recent decades has been the explosion in federal entitlement programs and their payments in trimming entitlements alone the spending proposals for fiscal 1982 of the democratic leadership fall 8 5 billion short of what is required under the budget resolution already enacted by the congress for the next three fiscal years those democratic entitlement proposals bust the budget ceilings by 23 billion the american taxpayer deserves far better the house republican policy committee supports the proposed bipartisan budget reconciliation package which will correct many of those spending abuses and which will bring the reconciliation process into line with the budget ceiling we urge all republican members to do the same the bipartisan package authored by reps delbert latta rohio and phil gramm dtexas and supported by the house republican policy committee will boost house committees real savings 5 2 billion in fiscal 1982 in the next three years the package will save american taxpayers more than 19 billion the house republican policy committee supports this approach of compromise and conciliation it rejects the idea that congress must capitulate to continued spending abuses in the fnce of the economic crisis facing all americans the bipartisan proposal supported by the iouse republican policy committee does not rewrite the entire budgetary work of house committees it simply improves on the initial work of the committees and spurns the fiscal games being played by the democratic leadership through its control of the house budget committee in addition the bipartisan package takes crucial steps toward cutting waste and inefficiencies in these federal programs it moves toward making these spending reductions permanent for the benefit of american taxpayers it accomplishes both these goals through the creation of needed block grant programs in the fields of health social services rehabilitation services energy assistance education and community development such block grant programs will vastly increase program flexibility at the state and local level while reducing overhead costs and inefficiencies in washington at the same time there is a strong need in this country to return control of such programs to those levels of government closest to the problems unfortunately the budget reconciliation package advanced by the democratic leadership shows no recognition of those needs this approach would be a major first step toward cutting the bureaucratic waste that has built up in more than 40 years of uncontrolled federal spending programs while at the same time protecting those americans in need from the loss of services the house republican policy committee endorses the bipartisan package containing both the additional cuts in spending propos als and block grant programs"], [0.00020137429237365723, 0.49979862570762634, 0, "i rise in support of house resolution 421 a measure which addresses a mkia er of prime importance to the american people namely our children youth and family children represent onethird of our countrys population but this special constituency many times lacks adequate attention in our legislative process this can be attributed to the fragmented congressional committee system and complex budget process which work to prevent the needs of children and families from being adequately heard in congress additionally there are only a few organizations which advocate the needs of the american family and children with a bipartisan group of members of congress i have joined with my colleague mr miller to a resolution h res 421 to create a select committee on children youth and families the object of this committee would he to concentrate on the needs status and the quality of life of children and family in our country while many of us serving in the congress have families and often consider ourselves to be familiar with the problems of children from firsthand experience we just arent aware of all of the problems of children from the many various segments of our society yet we are being asked to legislate governmental policies directly affecting children and families as you know i serve on the house ways and means committeethe taxwriting committee on congress yet when drafting tax legislationlegislation that affects each and every american citizen including many children and families and corporationthe members and staff assistants on my committee look to the joint committee on taxation for their expert advice it is this oversight committee a nonlegislative committee which provides the foundation for our committee bills the ways and means committee also handles certain issues affecting our children youth and families the committee must rely on its own committee hearings and testimony to receive the information upon which to base its legislation while other committees have jurisdication over complementary programs there is often a lack of coordination a loss of interest and a delay in the hearing process an example of this is seen in the afdc aid to families with dependent children and medicaid programs let me talk about one bill i am most familiar with h r 3434 now public law 96272 the adoption assistance and child welfare act is very good law it took a lot of time by the committee members on the ways and means committee to work on this legislation it provides a major legislative reform in an area of federal involvement experience has shown that this act works last year an effort was made to block grant this legislation i worked successfully with my colleagues in the house to defeat this effort however this beneficial law is still under attack by the bureaucracy in washingtcn and by the continuing attempt to block grant it as a member of the subcommittee on public assistance and unemployment compensation i am working to oppose these attempts to weaken this important law providing protection for more than 500 000 children in foster care and this is my point while the full ways and means committee must consider tax legislation unemployment problems social security reform issues medicare measures trade barriers and tariffs as well as various business trust funds such as the airport and airways development trust fund or the highway trust fund and many other miscellaneous revenue mattersquite frankly our time is limited i would hate to see the hard work of every member on our committeego down the drain simply because this issue was edgedout of importance in balance with the other restraints on our committee and this is not only true with the house ways and means committee presently children and family matters are divided among various committees and subcommittees such as education nutrition health care juvenile justice and employment by establishing one oversight committee the concerns of children and family will be given a more comprehensive and focussed review while many of the governmental policies established by the congress directly affect children and families often their concerns are not given a fair hearing for this reason thi establishment of this select committee is long overdue among the organizations endorsing the resolution are the american academy of child psychiatry american academy of pediatrics childrens defense fund child welfare league council of jewish federations family service association march of dimes national black child development institute national committee for the prevention of child abuse national council of negro women national easter seal society national pta unitedstates catholic conference and the lutheran council i am sure there are many others that i have not listed many of us here today feel that this is important legislation legislation which should be addressed before this congress adjourns this oversight committee will provide congress a tool to assure accountability and reduce overlap aniong current programs and policies affecting children and their families the committee willhave no legislative jurisdiction but will provide continuing review of the status needs and success of this special constituency the select committee on children youth and families will offer an essential forum during this congress and the next for consid eration of public and private sector policies affecting generations to come i urge that my colleagues join me in voting for this legislation it is important to discuss funding for this committee but i wish to talk about funding in two steps first why budgetary restraints now dictate a need for this select committee and second why this committee would not unduly strain the operating budget first i am sure all of you here know i have long been a proponent of restrained federal spending deficit spending has only hurt our nation and brought us the economic ills from which we are suffering today but during the cutback process at all levels of government federal state and local it is essential that the welfare of our young be protected and supported we have legislative committees fighting reduced spending in many areasagriculture labor the courts defense education health community services public jobs water projects transportation energy national parks and veterans if we have one whole legislative committee looking after the special needs of our veterans and one whole legislative committee looking after the special needs of the residents of the districtof columbia does it not seem logical that we should have an oversight committee specializing on the needs of our childrenthe future of america let us look at the costs of longterm human damage versus the small costs of preventive service services it is important for one committee to look at these differences and look for the methods that are most costeffective changes in national trends and policies can affect families directly while i have never advocated nor do i now support further federal intervention in areas that are the responsibility of the familyit would be helpful in drafting legislation to understand the growing trends to see what is occurring in our nation today in relation to children and families perhaps we will find that too much government interference has caused family disruptions statistics show us that today many of our families are headed by a single parent many married couples are both working in an effort to meet their monthly bills more and more youth are becoming latchkey children and are often left unsupervised or on the streets many of our chidren are missingeither through crime or another increasing phenomenon parental kidnaping legislation has already been passed by the housethe missing childrens actwhich asks for very little federal money but which would allow states the use of fbi computers to locate missing children this situation must be looked at in greater depth gang crime is increasing children are not only the primary victims but often the criminals as well child pornography is increasing child abuse is increasing in fact the reagan administration has recently substantiated the fact that child abuse has increased 17 percent we are suddenly aware of the problems of the american children of our servicemen in 1980 some alarming statistics regarding our nations children showed that half a million children were in foster care homes of these almost half had been there for 2 years roughly 100 000 had spent more than 6 years in foster homes and 25 percent were waiting to be adopted with no homes to be found with the implementation of the adoption assistance and child welfare act these statistics are improving but they are far from satisfactory so let us go back to talking dollars the second point i wish to make today is that this committee would not unduly strain the operating budget the select committee on children youth and families which we propose will be limited to two congresses it will not be openended legislation not openfunded it is anticipated that we can organize a lean staff and run a committee a competent committee for less than we appropriated for the select committee on narcotics which is the select committee with the lowest budget here in the house of representatives the dollars we may be able to save in the long term are well worth an investment now by this congress in a committee whose sole responsibility is the assessment of the needs and interests of the children and families of this country i am not an advocate of the school of thought that one should throw more federal dollars at a problem just to solve it history shows that this simply does not work i am in full agreement with the need to reform our bureaucracy and streamline federal spending this is why i support this 2year oversight committee by having this select committee we will be streamlining federal spending i believe that we will save more federal dollars ease more federal regulations and assist a greater number of american families and children by concentrating on their special needs and exposing these needs to the public and private segments of our society further we will cease unnecessary rules and regulations and terminate senseless duplication therefore i urge that the members here today give serious consideration to the need for this legislation it is incumbent upon the legislators of this age to draw new legislation to continue the rights and privileges envisioned in an earlier simpler age when our constitution was drafted it is my holie that the new oversight committee on children youth and families will meet the challenge of protecting our families in an age when the foundation of our society the family can be so easily destroyed i will certainly cast my vote in favor of final passage of this measure and i look forward to working with this select committee on children youth and families during the 98th congress in the house of representatives i urge you to join with me in casting a yea vote"],

again today on the floor of this house i want more than a peoples bill i want a peoples bill that is going to become lawv that is right i want a peoples law today the gentlemans bill is 33 million greater than the continuing resolution that we slaved over 24 hours a day for 3 days with the senate 33 million greater than the vetoed continuing resolution it cannot become law it wvill not get through the senate and it will not get signed into law i wish it could but the practical reality is that it can only become the peoples bill not the peoples law i do not think that is wvhat we are seeking the chairman wants a committee bill i know a lot about that committee bill i am the ranking member of the subcommittee i have been a member of that subcommittee for 24 years let me tell you something i fought for a lot of funding in that bill and i am sure that bill natcher remembers he told us about the lowincome fuel assistance i was right there fighting for increases over the presidents budget look at a couple of the increases wve got over the presidents budget there is an additional 44 million for maternal and child health care there is 41 million for community health centers there is 36 million for family planning there is 1 million for the national health service corps there is 117 million over the presidents budget in alcohol drug abuse and mental health there is 116 million over the budget for the aging programs there is 290 million over the budget for handicapped education there is 150 million over the budget for vo ational education there is 340 million for pell grants over the budget there is 90 million for vocational rehabilitation over wie budget there is 500 million for title i of elementary education over the budget i am proudi am proud that i fought for those increases in the regular bill and i am proud that we won them but that is still ony a bill and we need a law if we are going to achieve any of these goals we want if we are going to help the needy people of this country now the chairman has also suggested that my proposal does not improve upon any of the program levels established by the committee bill that is not so in addition to the fact that niy resolution does achieve enough savings to become the peoples law it also improves on the committee bill in several areas it adds 24 million for trade adjustment assistance and training activities it adds 16 million for maternal and child health care block grants it adds 24 million to community health service program support it adds 9 million to primary care family medicine it adds a total of 5 million to the health resources administration it adds 1 4 million over the committee bill for special health initiative my resolution adds 6 million to refugee assistance there is a 75 million addition for foster care there is 16 2 million additional for handicapped education and 8 8 million for vocational rehabilitation i could go on and mention that my resolution adds 4 8 million for the veterans cost of instruction program which was closed out under the house bill we need this veterans aid program and i am proposing to keep it going finally i might add that my resolution provides an additional 29 million over the regular house bill for the railroad retirement benefits the fact remains and i made a pledgei do not recall who asked that questioni made a pledge to the railroad union that we will have a supplemental up here for the balance of that come february of this year the fact remains that we can do all the comparing that we want we can argue about certain specifics of each proposal but the reality remains that my resolution can be signed into law and the chairmans resolution cannot my resolution can become the peoples law and all those programs

the assumption of certain cftc registration functions by the national futures association i believe this amendment is in the best interest of the futures industry and the commodity futures trading commission i urge my colleagues to support this amendment h r 5447 contains two new sections of the commodity exchange act that are intended to facilitate the tr sfer of the cftcs registration program to the industrywide registered futures associationthe national futures association nfa the first provision is specifically targeted toward futures associations new section 17 o would authorize the cftc to require any registered futures association to perform any poi tion or all of the cftcs registration functions under the act the futures association would be required to perform this registration function for each member of the association and each associated person of such member the second provision is more general under new section 8a 10 the commission would be empowered to authorize any person to perform any portion of the commissions registration functions under the act the nfa is eager to begin as soon as possible to assume at least a portion of the cftcs registration functions according to nfas most recent schedule it plans to be able to begin on or about january 15 1983 to conduct registration proceedings for all classes of cfc registrants nfas intention to assume cftc registration duties at such an early time bodes well for a complete assumption by nfa of that function since every registered commodity professional except floor brokers must be a member of nfa in order to fulfill the 1978 congressional grant of authority to the cftc to make membership in a registered futures association compulsory nevertheless despite the best intentions of the cftc and nfa problems could arise that might delay nfas assumption of the registration function unless we take great care at this time to spell out with some degree of specificity the authority in this area of the cftc and nfa the amendment i am proposing would accomplish this goal without hampering in any meaningful way the broad discretion and authority vested in the cftc under new sections 8a 10 and 17 o of the act as contained in h r 5447 in fact under h r 5447s provision for new section 8a 10 as well as the provisions contained in this amendment the commission would be empowered to authorize a registered futures association to perform any portion of the cftc registration program even if the commission were to require a futures association to register persons who are not members of the association in order to perfect these provisions the amendment would make four basic changes or additions to new sections 8a 10 and 17 o first both section 8a 10 and section 17 o would be amended to clarify that the exclusive procedures governing registration proceedings conducted by a registered futures association or any other person authorized by the commission would be set forth in rules of the registered futures association or other authorized person submitted to the commission for its approval h r 5447s provisions in new sections 8a 10 and 17 o refer to performing the registration function merely in accordance with rules approved by the commission it is not absolutely clear under this language which rules govern these registration proceedings the amendment contemplates that futures association rules submitted and approved by the commission will be the exclusive procedures followed in conducting an1 aspect of the registration function thus the amendment will clarify that a registration proceeding conducted by a registered futures association or any other person authorized by the cftc in accordance with the pr dural rules submitted to the cftc may not be subject to legal challenge on the ground that procedures contained in the administrative procedure act or any other statute or regulation were not followed the second aspect of the amendment expressly provides for cftc review of final registration decisions rendered by a futures association the amendment would also make explicit that a futures association may take the full range of registration actions available to the commission under the act and commission regulations this is consistent with the provisions in both new section 8a 10 and new section 17 o of h r 5447 which state that any registered futures association or other authorized person may perform a cftc registration function subject to the provisions of this act applicable to registrations granted by the commission in addition the amendment provides a standard for cftc review of futures association registration decisions that mirrors the standard for appellate review of cftc registration decisions under the existing scheme this will avoid petitions being filed with the commission requesting that it conduct a laborious costly aad duplicative de novo or other form of factfinding review of a futures association registration proceeding the third aspect of the amendment covers cftc oversight of registration granted by a futures association under this provision registration of an individual would be conditional until 15 days after notification of the cftc by the registering futures association unless the cftc directs the association to revoke or reconsider the application during that 15day period the fourth and final aspect of the amendment would comport with basic notions of due process of law by providing any person against whom a futures association has issued a final registration decision and the commission has declined to review the merits of such decision to petition an appropriate unitedstates court of appeals for appellate review of the decision under the procedures in section 6 b of the act that govern appellate review of cftc registration decisions this aspect of the amendment will therefore merely make explicit in the statute that the right to judicial review from registration decisions will not be affected by authorizing a futures association to perform these functions it should be noted that the last three aspects of the amendment i have explained would apply only to a registered futures association and therefore only to the national fu tures association at this time this is because the context in which new section 17 o appears in h r 5447 warrants that these perfecting amendments apply to registered futures associations authorized or required by the commission to perform any portion or all of the cftcs registration functions the amendment will resolve any potential uncertainty concerning the appropriate interpretation of the relationship between new sections 8a 10 and 17 o of the act in the event a registered futures association like nfa is called upon to assume the cftcs registration function i believe this antendment is needed in order to allow the national futures association to get its functions into operation this amendment is supported by the futures industry and the cftc also is in agreement i urge my colleagues to support its passage"], [0.00020137429237365723, 0.49979862570762634, 1, "before beginning my remarks i want to say that i do not think any subcommittee chairman from the appropriations committee has ever had any ranking member be any more cooperative thn the gentleman from ohio has been to me today i want to express my profound appreciation to him along with my appreciation to all members df our subcommittee because we have worked together i think as a bipartisan team and we bring today to the floor an excellent bill the military construction subcommittee held extensive hearings that have led to the bill that is before the house today the amended request for military construction and family housing totaled 8 billion the committee has deferred consideration of 522 3 million for mx funding of that request the total amount recommended includes 6 9 billion which is the largest military construction appropriation to ever reach the floor of the house of representatives the committees recommended fiscal year 1982 funding represents a 592 million reduction from the amount considered but a 1 6 billion increase over the amount approved in fiscal year 1981 the recommendation by the committee is 96 million below the outlay request of the executive branch and also 40 million below the section 302 budget allocation the committees recommendations reflect the current fiscal and economic conditions of the country and weigh the highest priority military requirements against the need for fiscal restraint i feel the recommended bill achieves this balance the committee this year focused on some of the most important issues facing the country today the basing of the mx missile indian ocean persian gulf program nato programs in construction the pacif~e and the overall need to improve the quality of life in the military i will now highlight a number of major jecommendations that are explained in more detail in the committee report the committee has deferred without prejudice the consideration of 522 3 million requested in fiscal year 1982 for design construetion land acquisition and headquarters facilities for the landbased system to support the mx missile the committee had hoped to have the opportunity to hold hearings and to examine the administrations mx proposal prior to completing action on the fiscal year 1982 appropriations bill for military construction however no decision from the administration on the mx systemn has been made the longterm significance of the mx program is such that the committee feels that action should be deferred until hearings and a full review of the program can be conducted in order to assure timely approval of the other items in the fiscal year 1982 rcquest the committee feels that action must proceed at this time the committee will work with the administration in the upcoming months to find the most beneficial method to review and act on additional military funding for the mx or other systems that might require construction funding the committee continues to support the policy of developing capabilities in the persian gulf area to assure the continuation of the flow of oil from the region while respecting the sovereignty of foreign states the committee recommends 335 million to continue our efforts to provide additional facilities in the middle east construction projects at ras banas egypt and lajes portugal are not recommended because of questions concerning the design need and countrytocountry agreements over the past years not enough attention has been paid to fulfilling our need to provide modern facilities for our personnel stationed in nato countries the committee feels that planning has been based on the assumption that the united states would stay in europe for a short period that short period has turned into more than 30 years facilities are now worn and inadequate and no longer meet the requirements of a modern military force the needs have growni to the point that the department estimates a requirement of more than 10 billion in construction to solve the current construction deficiency the committees recommendation of 1 billion in nato funding is the largest ever the committee feels it is time to get on with improving facilities for our people who serve there recent news reports have indicated that the republic of germany is reluctant to proceed with the development of the masterrestationing plan in germany however it is my understanding that the government is interested in continuing discussions on the impleinentation of the restationing proposal it is essential that talks be initiated rapidly in order to accelerate the implementation of the master restationing plan we are at a critical juncture with our facilities in germany it is time to improve our installations as well as locate them in the most strategic locations the relocation of facilities from crowded urban areas will allow for more productive use of property by germany and for siting unitedstates facilities at more advantageous locations the funding for the program by the germans wiu be recouped from moneys obtained through the release of urban property and thereby to offset the planned increase defense expenditures the committee has recommended 18 million for projects associated with the master restationing plan the unitedstates contribution is proposed in order to show our commitment to the prograin and to obtain a like response to the government if germany i am disappointed that the initial response from the republic of germany is one of only continuing to discuss this plan i hope that in the next several months the discussions will turn to positive action by the german government in regard to another nato construction matter the groundlaunched cruise missile facilities have been recommended in order to show our support for the program but we require that the department seek nato infrastructure funding for essentially all glcm construction the committee held extensive hearings this year to examine the issues relating to improving the quality of life for the men and women who serve in the unitedstates military in a special hearing on the subject this year the committee invited and heard testimony from the top ranking enlisted person in each service and the exectutive secretary of the defense advisory committee on women in the service the committee has added a new section to the report on quality of life to show the need to accelerate unaccompanied personnel housing to improve family housing overseas and to fund child care centers with military construction funds design funds in the amount of 20 million have been added to the request to accelerate the design of 20 000 substandard barrack spaces the committee again this year has focused on the need for the department of defense to increase the host nations support provided to unitedstates armed forces defending foreign nations the committee feels that as the united states significantly increases its spending on defense other countries should develop host nation programs to reduce the unitedstates costs associated with the maintenance of large numbers of unitedstates troops and dependents stationed abroad energy the committee held extensive hearings this year on dods energy program it is essential that the department as the single largest user of energy in the united states embark on an aggressive program for both energy conservation and new technology improvements the committee approved all requested projects for energy conservation except those requested for temporary buildings scheduled for replacement the committee is confident that the department will reach its goal of a 12percent reduction in energy use by the committee included language in the bill clarifying the life cycle cost criteria to be used when determining the feasibility of solar energy applications to construction projects the committee also made reductions to the utility account in family housing as a direct incentive to reduce consumption"],

legislation before the recess i want to say that the reason we can take up this conference report today only a week after the house passed its bill is because of the skill of chairman zablocki in conducting the conference and the hard work of the committee staff in getting the conference materials together literally overnight i hope this cooperative attitude on the part of our committee will be reciprocated by the administration in the form of faithful implementation of the provisions of this act as chairman of the subcommittee on interamerican affairs i want to comment on some of the major provisions pertaining to latin america on el salvador we succeeded in retaining language in the bill which will insure that our military aid to el salvador is used only to support human rights economic and political reforms and a political solution to the conflict in el salvador under the compromise bill the president will be able to continue to provide military aid to el salvador only if 30 days after the enactment of this act the prepident is able to certify the following first that the government of el salvador is making a concerced and significant effort to comply with internationally recognized human rights second that the government of el salvador is achieving substantial control over alland i emphasize the word all elements of its own armed forces so as to bring to an end the indiscriminate torture and murder of salvadoran citizens by these forces this condition will strengthen the hand of president duarte in curbing abuses by his military and security forces that just drive people into the hands of the left i would call attention to the language of the foreign affairs committee report on this condition which is governing since the conferees adopted the house provision the committee wants to make its intent clear it expects that the president will certify that this condition has been fulfilled only if the salvadoran government has actually made bubstantial progressin inng control over all elements of its are focs neither vague commitments to enact reforms at some point in the future nor public statements by government leaders to the effect that they were trying to achieve such control would be a sufficient bases for a presidential certification that this condition had been satisfied what the committee is looking for is real rather than rhetorical progress third that the government of el salvador is making continued progress in implementing essential economic and political reforms including the land reform program although we lost the specific reference to the private sector contained in the house bill i believe it would be in accord with the will of the congress for the administration to include in its certification information on the governments support for the private sector fourth that the government of el salvador i~s committed to the holding of free elections at an early date and to that end has demonstrated its good faith efforts to begin discussions with all major political factions in el salvador which have declared their willingness to find and implement an equitable political solution to the conflict with such solution to involve a commitment to a a renouncement of further military or paramilitary activity and b the electoral process with internationally recognized observers this is perhaps the most important condition in that it reverses the fundamentally mistaken aspect of the administrations policy which precludes a political settlement of the conflict by opposing talks unless the left gives up and lays down its arms under this language the government of el salvador could receive no further military assistance from the united states if it refused to enter into discussions with the left so long as the left declared that it was willing to seek a political solution and that the political solution would involve an end to violence and elections this langauge does not require negotiations about power sharing nor does it prejudge what topics the discussioffs would cover each party would be free to propose its own agenda all the language requires is a willingness to talk no one loses anything by talking fifth that the government of el salvador has made good faith efforts to investigate the murders of the six united states citizens in el salvador in december 1980 and january 1981 and to bring to justice those responsible for those murders all conditions except the fifth would have to be recertified every 6 months for the aid to continue it is clear that the president could not make these certifications at this time the intent of the language is to give the administration leverage with the salvadoran military in order to induce it to cooperate with president duarte in improving the human rights situation furthering reforms and achieving a political solution to the conflict without these conditions the military has no incentiv e to cooperate and a favorable solution to the conflict is impossible be ember 16 1981 december 16 1 981 co i want to close by talking briefly about the provisions relating to argentina and chile the cinferees adopted provisions repealing prohibitions on security assistance to argentina and chile these sanctions were imposed as a response to massivea human rights violations by the governments of those two countries and in the case of chile to the murders of orlando letelier and ronni moffitt i believe the repeal of these prohibitions represents a recognition on the part of the members that these sanctions have served their purpose and it is time to begin to try to improve relations with these two countries that is debatable but it is the will of the congress and the president and i am prepared to support it no sanction can last forever sooner or later the time comes when sanctions must be removed it is the judgment of the congress that for argentina and chile that time is now but it is very important in removing these sanctions not to send the wrong signal it is important that this action be construed not as an abandonment of our human rights policy but as a new stage in the implementation of that policy it must be clear that we are taking this action because of improvements in human rights in those countries and in expectation of further improvements i have opposed removing the sanctions not because i do not believe in removing them but because of the administrations refusal to make this clear i am gratified that the conferees have agreed to make clear in the ian guage the continuing commitment of the congress to human rights in argentina and chile and our intent that the development of a military relationship with those countries should go hand in hand with human rights improvements specifically under the language before he can provide security assistance to argentina the president must certify that argentina has made significant progress in complying with internationally recognized human rights in making that certification he must consider efforts by the government of argentina to provide information on the disappeared and to release or bring to justice the pen prisbners to provide security assistance for chile the presi~dent must make the same certification with respect to human rights and must also certify that chile is not aiding or abetting international terrorism and has taken appropriate steps to bring to justice those indicted in connection with the leteliermoffitt murders in addition the managers state that in determining whether chile has made the requisite progress in human rights the president must consider whether the government of chile is ending the practices of internal exile and forced expulsion and is allowing those citizens who desire to return home to do so and whether the government of chile is permitting internationally recogized human ri ghts commissions to investigate human rights abuses i believe the house did well in the conference with respect to those provisions of the bill affecting latin america and with respect to the other provisions a3 well and i urge the adoption of the conference

agriculture research and environment it has been my privilege to work closely on this bill i especially want to thank the chairman of the full committee mr fuqua for his support and efforts in bringing this legislation to the floor i also want to express my respect and appreciation for the contributions made by the ranking minority member of the subcommittee the gentleman from new york mr bill carney the administrations commitment to protecting the environment and safeguarding the health of our citizens is in serious question nowhere is this neglect more evident than in the administrations proposed funding for environmental research at the environmental protection agency a mere 215 9 million was requested for epa research in fiscal 1983 this request measured in real dollars represented a 50percent cut in environmental research since president reagan took office these cuts were accompanied by promises of streamlining and increased efficiency coupled with the claim that more will be produced with less resources while i wholeheartedly support this sentiment i believe the budget request goes far beyond what can be offset by management improvements and cuts into the very heart of epas research function nor can we expect the states and the private sector to take over environmental research eliminated in this proposal available resources and sufficient incentives simply do not exist this situation is especially evident in the development of pollution control technology where high interest rates combined with regulatory uncertainty have made such ventures too risky to justify private sector invescment thus it is essential that epa conducts research in control technology otherwise these technologies will not be developed recognizing these facts the committee moved to recommend an epa research budget that would preserve a basis for issuing sound environmental regulations for developing ways to meet regulations and for making rational environmental policies to do otherwise would undermine epas ability to fulfill its mission sound standards would not be promulgated in a timely fashion and once issued they would be subject to increasing court challenges the net result would be more pollution and consequently a deterioration in environmental quality and public health clearly the american public does not favor such an outcome the committee responded to this concern by reporting h r 6323 which is now before the house as noted by the chairman of the full committee the gentleman from florida we have increased the presidents requested funding level for epa research and related activities from 215 9 million in fiscal year 1983 to 296 8 million in fiscal year 1983 and 310 9 million in fiscal year 1984 this recommendation provides fiscal year 1983 funding equal to thecurrent fiscal year 1982 appropriation plus 6 percent for inflation the fiscal year 1984 authorization essentially maintains the same support and direction with a 6percent acrosstheboard increase over fiscal year 1983 the major budget actions were made in the air water quality interdisciplinary and energy research programs in the air research program the committee recommended an overall increase of 10 5 million this addition is primarily for air pollution monitoring activities and for research supporting the development of national ambient air quality standards as required by the clean air act and control strategies to achieve these standards the increases in the water quality research program amounted to 16 5 million the administrations proposal to reduce this program by almost half 48 million in 1982 to 27 7 million in 1983 is unwise public policy in the committees view the funds restored to this program would support water quality monitoring and research needed to develop and evaluate water quality standards and appropriate control technologies an area of particular concern to the committee was longterm environmental research which is essential for an effective epa the committee felt that attention to this type of research was inadequate in the administrations proposal and therefore recommended an additional 15 million in the interdisciplinary research program this money would fund longterm research in all environmentl problem areas and would greatly enhance the credibility and usefulness of the entire epa research program finally i would like to address the committees budget actions in the energy program expanding development and utilization of domestic energy resources especially coal appears inevitable thus a high priority was placed on insuring that these ac tivities proceed in an acceptable manner which does not degrade either our environment or our health responding to this concern the committee rejected the administrations proposal to eliminate twothirds of the energy program and recommended a restoration of 24 million part of this increase 4 million would support a research effort on indoor air pollution the remaining 20 million is for control technology development health and ecological research and monitoring activities related to energy pouution although reprograming between research programs authorized in this bill would be permitted such reprograming in excess of 5 percent of appropriated funds must be proceeded by congressional notification this requirement is intended to prevent program terminations and maintain program continuity funds may also be spent for reductionsinforce under this bill but only if congressional notification is given prior to such action this requirement is intended to insure that authorized programs are not jeopardized by personnel actions h r 6323 also directs research toward establishing a national environmental monitoring network the committee recommended this action in response to deficiencies in environmental data which have impaired efforts to detect trends in environmental quality and evaluate the performance of our environmental laws and the programs established to implement them the bill further provides for a 2year study on the management and organization of federal environmental research programs is authorized the study is intended to enhance cooperation and coordination between environmental research programs the committee believes this examination is necessary to improve the effectiveness of these programs in the face of reduced budgets finally the bill makes several changes in the independent scientific advisory board which advises epa and the congress on epa programs needs and scientific goals the bill requires that members of the board be appointed from a list of nominees recommended by a nominating committee composed of representatives from national science and health organizations the legislation also stipulates that the board be selected in a manner to insure a balance of ideologies and backgrounds that represent states industry labor academia and the general public the bill provides that no more than onethird of the board members terms end in the same year and that members serve out full terms the epa is directed to promulgate conflictofinterest regulations concerning board members within 120 days of the bills passage these changes are itnded to insure the objectivity r id effeltiveness of epa science advisory board in closing i would like to say that the nation is confronted with serious environmental as well as economic problems that demand viable and effective solutions part of the answer to these problems lie in a strong environmental research program and this realization should be recognized by all this bill will provide such strength and i urge its adoption"], [0.00020137429237365723, 0.49979862570762634, 1, "i thank the very distinguished chairman of the full committee on banking i also wish to emphasize the importance of his message that he eloquently has given us there should be no reason for any member to be ignorant as to the exact thrust and nature of what is being foisted in the house but in general terms the chairman has done this i would like to be given the privilege to get into some matters of special importance the committee on banking had the biggest cuts to make of all the committees in the house of all the subcommittees in the house the subcommittee on housing had the biggest amount of the outlays and authority to cut the current service estimate for programs within the subcommittee on housing and urban affairs jurisdiction is 40 8 billion in authority we were told and mandated by the budget resolution to take the standard omb cut of 25 percent now for reasons beyond the reach of rational minds to understand the stockman formula says that domestic programs must be cut by 25 percent it matters not whether the program is for education housing or sidewalks if it is a program for people it goes down by 25 percent needless to say this arbitrary kind of target leads to the necessity of making equally arbitrary decisions nevertheless the subcommittee with the great help and leadership of the overall chairman of the full committee struggled with the numbers juggled the programs and produced budget authority cuts of 10 5 billion we made those cuts in as rational and humane a way as possible with the steady constant and undiluted opposition of the minority but there is no denying the reality that there will not be enough money in this budget to provide anything like the level of community development assistance that our cities require and neither will there be anything like the commitment needed to provide decent and affordable housing for those millions of h 3506 co citizens who are living in substandard and high cost housing we started with a current services level that was already inadequate and then faced the command to cut those services by onefourth thus we began with an assisted housing production level that meets about onethird of a reasonable goal and we ended up with an assisted housing production level that will meet perhaps a fourth of the goal in short beginning with inadequate program levels we were forced to go to absurd and inhumane levels there is no way to accomplish that kind of task without pain the results of this vast budget cut will be with us for years to come in the form of overcrowded overpriced housing in the form of growing numbers of substandard homes and in less visible but equally damaging forms of inadequate community services and underdeveloped local economies if the administration gambles luckily and we do not have more immediate social eruptions and disturbances as are being registered in less fortunate countries such as belgium france and even west germany under very similar conditions in housing that is the commitment that this administration has demanded and which the majority here has accepted we have done our duty to produce the required cuts to protect the existing housing stock we acted to provide 1 64 billion in operating subsidies for public housing this covers operating and maintenance requirements and will enable housing authorities to begin restoring operating reserves that have been depleted through extraordinary utility costs the operating subsidy goes largely to utility costs40 percent of it in fact budgets for 1980 and 1981 assumed that utility costs would increase by only 11 4 and 12 percent respectively when in actual fact utility costs went up by twice those amounts the utility cost shortfall for 1981 alone was 250 million housing authorities were forced to deplete their reserves in order to pay their bills the administration also has failed to provide 100 million to make adjustments in cases where the performance funding system formula does not accurately reflect the real needs of housing authorities which often happens in the case of larger housing authorities altogether the administration budget request was 440 million short of what is required to make the housing authorities whole this bill provides a sufficient amount to cover that shortfall failure to do so will only mean that housing authorities will be forced to cut further back on maintenance and other services which in turn would lead to loss of housing that we cannot afford to lose the public housing stock is valued at 60 billion and it is imperative that this housing be preserved which this bill provides for second this bill alms to protect the poor the budget resolution assumes that housing subsidies will be cut by 60 million through imposition of rent increases we reject that because the evidence is that the rent increases could well result in either no increase in revenue or an actual decline in revenue information we gathered shows that in san antonio for example public housing rents could go up by 5 to 36 a month the trouble is that the people who occupy this housing are so hard pressed that they do not have that kind of money to spare witnesses told us that they would have to move out of public housing into substandard housing rather than pay the increased rent the reality is that these are people who would have to choose between shoes for children and rent increases or choose between food and higher rent the administrations rent increase proposals would hit hardest at working poor families who already pay most of the rent received by housing authorities these are the families that would move out in order to be able to buy ordinary necessities even at the cost of moving into substandard shacks who would replace them in all likelihood even lower income tenants who would pay far less in rent i do not believe that the administrations rent increase proposal would produce the revenues claimed and i know that it would only create greater hardship among people who already have as much as anyone can bear therefore in rejecting the rent increase proposal we believe that we are not just protecting the poor but acting to protect the housing authorities from losing the very families that now provide the greatest rents and the greatest stability aside from turning back the counterproductive rent proposal we acted to provide at least a minimal level of modernization funds too many of the nations public housing units are in a state of disrepair it is imperative that we keep those units in operation it will be far less expensive to do that than to pay the cost of replacing them again we acted to protect the interests of the poor people who live in public housing so that the units they occupy will be safe and decent and at the same time we acted to keep the housing stock from declining third this bill provides as much new housing production as possible a realistic national housing goal requires that 600 000 assisted housing units be produced but in 1981 we expect only a third that many to be started from that already inadequate base the budget resolution called for a vast reduction there is in fact no way to keep up existing production levels and still meet the requirements of the budget resolution however we have provided funds for 1 billion in annual contribution commitments for a total of 20 billion over the life of the resulting contracts this will produce 176 000 assisted housing units55 percent of them in the form of existing homes and 45 percent of them in the form of either new or substantially rehabilitated homes the minority substitute offered a level of 158 000 units which is 17 000 below what the president proposed what we have provided in this bill is far from enough to meet any reasonable goal but is the most that can be done within the budget targets it would be a genuine tragedy to see any further cuts in housing production at a time when we know that the supply of the decent and lowcost housing is actually falling in relation to the need for it there is no disputing the fact that in this decade the nation needs to produce more housing than at any other time in history unless that need is met we will see continued demand pull on housing prices and we will see the continuation and worsening of the pressures that have already priced housing out of the reach of all but the most fortunate of our citizens for that reason we rejected the administration plan to stop ginny mae tandem plan operations and provided 1 1 billion in tandem commitments which should enable the purchase of mortgages with an aggregate value of 1 9 billion during 1982 this is essential in light of the continued high interest rates that make housing unaffordable without some form of relief and assistance we do not believe that the administrations plans to kill fha are realistic and this bill extends fha authority and adjusts insurance limits to reflect existing market trends we also provided an extension of the 202 program for elderly housing at a level of 850 million in fiscal 1982 those are the highlights of the housing portion of this bill i want now to turn to the community development issues for the community development block grant program this bill provides 3 64 billion in fiscal 1982 which is a slightin todays termsreduction from current levels the reduction is 220 million the bill also provides for continuation of the udag program at a 425 million program levela reduction of 250 million the administration proposed vast changes in the community development programs taken as a whole these cuts would have killed off the provisions that assure that community development funds are targeted and used in ways that put the funds into the areas with the greatest needs in short what the administrations changes in cdbg would have done would be to make this into another form of general revenue sharing in addition the administration proposed to put small city cdbg money under control of the states a move that even secretary pierce says the states are not prepared to cope with it is also a move that no city asked for and that an overwhelming number of small cities are opposed to we believe that community development block grants ought to be kept in their present form the program was developed after years of effort and in a bipartisan effort it has been subjected to thorough review by the committee most recently in 1980 we concluded that there is nothing to be gained and much to be lost by the radical changes put forward at the last moment by the administration likewise we rejected the notion of putting the urban development action grant program into a block grant in point of fact the arrangement proposed would have destroyed the merit of udag which is that it has a specific purpose for specific areas it is a highimpact program and its impact and effect would simply be frittered away if it were placed into a general revenue sharing type of program at a time when aid to cities for community development is going down taken as a whole the proposals for community development asked for by the office of management and budget and putatively supported by hud would merely create revenue sharing unders new name both parties have agreed for a decade that the cities need flexibility but they also need funds that are targeted and directed toward their areas of greatest need that is what community development block grants and udag does and that is the concept this bill preserves the housing and community development provisions of this bill are intended to keep essential programs alive some programs have been killed701 planning and others on the whole however our aid is to provide the greatest assistance to the areas and people of greatest need and in the most sensible way possible we have avoided any radical action we have been judicious and prudent we have met the requirements of the budget resolution this is a bill that has been painful to draw and ispainful for me to have to support but in the circumstances it is the best that can be done the housing and community development title is realistic and it merits your support i yield back to the distinguished chairman of the banking committee and in so doing want to take this opportunity to commend him and my colleagues for a splendid job under the most distressing and painful circumstances imaginable i yield back to the distinguished gentleman"]]}
