republicrn on that subcommittee mr mcc 1y of oklahoma chairman of the s bcommlttee on transportation aviation and materials and mr lewxs of florida ranking republican on that subcommittee i would also like to recognize the efforts and fine cooperation we have received from senator hollmos of south carolina chairman of the committee on commerce science and transportation senator danforth of missouri ranking republican of that committee senator rimlm of michigan chairman of the subcommittee on science technology and space and senator przssler of south dakota ranking republican on that subcommittee on june 2 the house overwhelmingly approved h r 4561 the multiyear nasa authorization bill on august 9 the other body passed its version of the nasa authorization bill s 2209 over the intervening period we have worked with our counterpart committee in the other body to resolve the differences between these two bills the amendment which i am offering today to s 2209 represents the results of these discussions like hr 4561 this bill contains full multiyear funding for the unitedstates international space station it also retains many of the other principal policy features of the house passed bill this bill will be crucial to regaining momentum for our civilian space effort on september 29 the space shuttle discoveryj launched america back into space initiating a new beginning for us all this bill s 2209 will provide a much needed longrange focus for our nations space and aeronautics program it retains the basic findings that the shuttle the space station and our expendable launch vehicles constitute a core space program that must be fully developed if we are to maintain our lead in space this bill establishes goals and guidelines for the development of a 5year capital development program that will strengthen our space and aeronautics infrastructure this bill also maintains a vigorous space science program with full funding for our major science start the advanced xray astrophysics facility it also retains funding for the advanced communications technology satellite which has been an important congressional initiative that will help the united states retain its technological edge in the future communications market finally the amendment will maintain the overall growth the space program needs to establish a balanced and progressive space effort over the next 5 years we have set general budgetary goals that i believe will accomplish the desired objectives we have also retained a longrange 10year strategic plan that will guide nasa over the next decade i am confident that with this bill the next decade in space and aeronautics will build upon our investments over the past 30 years and will represent a period in which we begin to reap the benefits of these investments in the aggregate this bill authorizes 11 213 billion for fiscal year 1989 and represents a compromise between the original housepassed figure of 11 488 billion and the senate figures of 11 1 billion this represents a reasonable balance between the priorities of the house and senatepassed bills i have attached a chart to my written statement detailing the specific funding changes that have been made in the bill i would now like to outline some of the major langauge differences that are contained in this amendment as compared to the housepassed bill we have deleted specific program authorizations for fiscal year 1990 and 1991 except for the space station in lieu of these specific authorizations we have added a section expressing the sense of the house that the nasa budget will need to increase by at least 15 percent per year in order to undertake aggressive initiatives such as lunar colonies or missions to mars also we have request budget authority for 2 years plus a budget estimate for a 3d year this also meets with the concurrence of our senate counterpart committee our objective is to begin planning our space budget on a multiyear basis our intent is that the 2d and 3d year submissions contained ongoing program budgets plus funding requests for new programs that are to begin in those years we have included funding for the space grant college in the amount of 8 million as recommended by the senate we have provided ample authority for nasa to reprogram money from any other budgetary line items to fund this requirement we expect however that the specific budgetary transfers will be submitted to congress for approval in the form of a budget operation plan we have included a senate recommendation that provides special authority to nasa to solicit bids for privately financed facilities for the advanced solid rocket motor production although the senate has also recommended that we provide nasa the authority to pay for counterpart liability in the event that the government cancels the contract for its own convenience we have not accepted this provision we may consider it at some later time we have retained the substance of the buy american provision that was included in the house passed bill we intend that nasa will report to the committee on specific contracts affected by this provision and we will address this as part of our oversight function we have combined several sections of the house passed bill dealing with international space docking and rescue with complementary sections recommended by the senate we expect that any international standards for docking interfaces will explicitly consider metric measurements although other existing legislation provides exemptions for aerospace products from metrification docking standards and other international hardware programs represent unique cases where metrification may make sense we have included a senate recommendation renaming the national space technology laboratories in mississippi the stennis space center we have also included a senate recommendation allowing nasa to purchase nuclear fuel from the department of energy at direct costs for planetary deep space missions we have increased funding for the department of transportations office of commercial space transportation from 3 5 million to 3 827 million we have included a recommendation by the senate providing for an ohio aerospace institute that will be located at lewis research center this will provide a facility where academic industry and government researchers can work together to address critical technology needs this will be of great value in regaining our technological competitiveness we have included a recommendation from the senate prohibiting nuclear weapons as weapons of mass destruction on the space station this has been included in three of the past authorization bills we have included authorizing legislation for the national oceanic and atmospheric administration as recom mended by the senate h 10394 co we have included a provision recommended by the senate which conditions the approval of an office of commercial space programs within the department of

is important and as far as i know is without controversy i urge adoption of this legislation by the house i rise in support of s 1989 the south pacific tuna act of 1988 for over 2 years the unitedstates tuna industry and the department of state have boon working towards establishing a regional licensing regime in the western pacific ocoan on october 20 1986 negotiators from the united states and 16 pacific island nations reached an agreement on a regional fisheries treaty on april 2nd of 1987 year the signing ceremony took place in port moresby papua new guinea and on june 19 the president transmitted the treaty to the senate after hearings on the treaty the senate voted 89 to 0 to consent to ratification on november 6 1987 the treaty will enter into force after ratification by the united states and 10 island nations the agreement requires that papua new guinea kiribati and the federated states of micronesia be among the states ratifying in order to bring the agreement into force over 14 nations have already signed the agreement and when the united states completes action on the treaty and the implementing legislation the treaty will go into effect the treaty combined with its annexes and related agreements contains three major initiatives first the treaty secures for unitedstates tuna vessels access to over 10 million acres of rich tuna fishing grounds within the exclusive economic zones and the high seas areas enclosed by those zones in the south pacific region to fish in these waters unitedstates tunaboat owners must purchase a regional license for the first year up to 40 licenses would be available at a base price of 50 000 each and the industry has guaranteed a minimum total payment of 1 75 million after 10 licenses have been issued 10 additional licenses would be sold at a price of 60 000 each in subsequent years the license fee would be indexed to the price of tuna but would not fair below the base price of 50 000 in addition the tuna industry has agreed to provide 250 000 annually in fisheries related technical assistance to the island nations through the south pacific forum fisheries agency after administrative costs are deducted revenues from the fees would be distributed to the island nations in proportion to the amount of tuna ta en from their waters the treaty also defines the procedures for regulating fishing activities and enforcing its provisions vessels fishing for tuna in the treaty area would be required to be licensed to carry observers and to abide by both the provisions of the treaty and applicable local law pacific island nations would retain the right to enforce regulations and prosecute violations while the united states would be expected to assist in the investigation of claims against unitedstates flag tuna vessels the united states would also ensure that violators submit to the jurisdiction of an involved pacific nation or leave the treaty area until penalties satisfactory to that nation are assessed and collected lastly associated with the treaty is an agreement between the unitedstates government and the south pacific forum fisheries agency guaranteeing 50 million in economic assistance to the south pacific nations over the 5year term of the treaty out of the 10 million in aid per year 9 million will be in the form of cash payments from the department of states economic support fund and 1 million in development projects proposed by the pacific island nations and approved by the agency for international development the bill at the desk is the senate companion to the house bill h r 3767 the subcommittee on fisheries and wildlife conservation and the environment and the merchant marine and fisheries committee gave its approval to the house bill on december 15 1988 the committee filed its report on h r 3767 last week because of the need to move quickly on this issue so that our tuna vessels may purchase licenses the committee is recommending favorable action on s 1989 so that the bill caf be on the presidents desk before the memorial day break s 1989 contains those provisions necessary to implement the licensing and regulatory provisions of the treaty and it does not contain any language or reference to the other development assistance package these matters are squarely within the jurisdiction of thre foreign affairs committee on which i serve and i expect that in due course that committee will provide appropriate scrutiny of the economic assistance agreement s 1989 assigns the responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the treaty to tihe secretaries of commerce and state other key provisions of the implementing legislation include authorizing the appropriation of such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of the treaty and the legislation including annual amounts of up to 350 000 for the department of commerce and 50 000 for the department of state making violations of the treaty violations of unitedstates domestic law consistent with those penalties of the fishery conservation and management act authorizing the secretary of commerce to issue regulations including those necessary to develop licensing procedures defining those violations of the treaty for which civil and criminal penalties may be assessed describing procedures for receiving complaints conducting investigations and hearings and making findings concerning those criminal and civil violations of the treaty describing the requirements tuna vessels owners must follow when operating in the treaty area including carrying observers filing catch reports gear stowage and other operating procedures and directing the unitedstates tuna industry to provide 250 000 annually in technical assistance as coordinated by the secretary of state 1o the pacific island nations s 1989 is strongly supported by the president and our multimilliondollar tuna industry when implemented the treaty will provide economic benefits to our friends in the south

the majority have exercised our leadership during this congress in particular i am deeply disappointedand frankly perplexedby republican charges that too many commemorative resolutions are considered by the house as chairman of the subcommittee on census and population which has jurisdiction over resolutions designating commemorative periods it has always been my impression that the commemorative process represents one of the most bipartisan efforts we undertake in congress it is no secret that both democrats and republicans sponsor and cosponsor these resolutions and members from both parties eagerly request a few minutes on the floor to express their support of a commemorative in which they have a personal interest in fact the very nature of the commemorative process is bipartisan since the resolutions are brought up under unanimous consent obviously this is not an arbitrary exercise of the power of the majority in fact under unanimous consent it is the minority member who controls the floor time when commemoratives are considered if there is no objection on the floor to the resolutionand there is very opportunity to objectthen presumably every member of the house republican and democrat agree to passage of the bill and during my tenure as chairman in the 100th congress i have yet to have any member approach me to say they object to bringing commemoratives to the floor it seems to me that the republican leadership was so intent on finding fault with the majority leadership in the house that it decided to complain even about a legislative process which is clearly and unarguably bipartisan in both its approach and result the subcommittees distinguished ranking minority member mrs morelia and i have gone out of our way to accommodate both republican and democratic members who have sponsored these resolutions and to simplify the process as much as possible so that the maximum benefit is gained without placing an undue burden on any sponsors or cosponsors there may be faults with our current procedures for bringing commemorative resolutions to the floor but the democrats and republicans must take equal responsibility for any problems which exist it is simply ludicrous to suggest that democrats alone are to blame for the number of commemoratives considered by the house when members from both parties sponsor cosponsor and support these resolutions i should point out that proposals have been made to reform the commemorative process and i have not ignored them very recently the gentlelady from rhode island wrote to me regarding her legislation to establish a federal commission to consider commemorative designations i promptly wrote back on her legislation clearly democrats are not abusing any power they have as majority members to control the commemorative process to the detriment of minority members let me depart from my prepared text and cite another example the gentleman from pennsylvania a republican has introduced a piece of legislation to change the way in which the census bureau does its business the census bureau is opposed to the legislation tiie distinguished chairman of the subcommittee on constitutional rights the gentleman from california is opposed to the legislation the mexicanamerican legal defense and education fund is opposed to the legislation i am opposed to the legislation yet the gentleman from pennsylvania has been given not one hearing but he is going to get two hearings one in washington dc conducted by me and another one conducted by the chairman of the full committee on post office and civil service in the field the gentleman from pennsylvania will have ample opportunity despite the fact that we have serious constitutional problems about his bill to air his grievance let me also take a moment to address another point which i believe to be implicit in the criticism of commemorative resolutions the idea that the periods we choose to designate are not worthwhile columnist david s broder in his commentary on the republican challenge referred to commemorative resolutions as junk legislation and trivia but a closer look at the commemorative bills we have considered in the house during the 100th congress will reveal that the vast majority of these bills deal with topics of great concern to many of the people we are elected to represent and every resolution we consider is of interest to someone back home i for one have no qualms about spending a few minutes of my time each week as an elected official to honor former prisoners of war and women veterans visiting nurses and unitedstates inventors public employees and income tax assistance volunteers i see nothing wrong with recognizing the vast array of cultures which together make up the diverse society of which we are so proud the heritage of the jewish people greeks lithuanians germans polish americans and african americans i do not consider it a waste of my time to call more public attention to problems faced by the victims of crime to the importance of child care programs to the need for better health care in rural areas to the sad reality of child and elderly abuse to the environmental benefits of recycling and to the saving grace of hospice care for the terminally ill and no mr broder i certainly see nothing trivial in educating the public about diseases and serious health problems which often cannot be prope~ly dealt with due to a lack of public awareness a lack of adequate research funds or a general misconception about the nature of the illness not too long ago we knew little about the dangers of reyes syndrome lupus and high cholestorol levels the crippling nature of osteoporosis and tuberous sclerosis the availability of treatment for persons with eating disorders digestive diseases and tratuarelated symptoms it may be a little selfserving but i like to think that this nation has made great strides in medical care and promoting better health because of the many dedicated individuals including public officials who often volunteer their time to educate their communities about illnesses which may be rare but treatable or common but too often ignored no mr broder it is not a waste of my time to pass a simple resolution which calls attention to the alarmingly high and disproportionate rates of cancer among blacks hispanics and other minorities and to give some small measure of recognition to the tireless dedicated physicians who or ganized the first national symposium last year on minorities and cancer in an effort to reduce the incidence of cancer in minority communities that resolution which i sponsored prompted many local governments to pass similar resolutions and organize community sponsored events to pro mote improved awareness among nit norifles of the availability and nee lty of early treat miuint for cancer but equally tniaortent fromr my point of view lu that this resolimtviti passed by democrats and republicans in congress and signed by the presi dent said to a dedicated team of doctors that we are not ignoring their critical work and that we appreciate their efforts and sacrifices on behalf of their fellow human beings for the minimal amount of time it took for my colleagues to add their names as cosponsors of the resolution and the small amount of time it took for me to bring the resolution before the house it was the least we could do and hopefully only the beginning which leads me to my final point i get the impression that my repub lican colleagues believe the congress spends too much time on commemorative resolutions frankly i fail to see the problem here as subcommittee chairman it takes me no more than 10 to 15 minutes once a week if at all to bring the resolutilons up under unanimous consent after the business

in pursuing this matter which is very significant very important and i am hopeful that the whole body today will see the wisdom of extending this legislation which serves such a very useful purpose in our system of justice h r 2939 the independent counsel amendments act of 1987 provides for the permanent authorization of the independent counsel statute this bill is one of the most important pieces of legislation that congress will consider this year the authorization of the independent counsel statute is critical for several reasons first this statute will expire in january 1988 if congress does not act to reauthorize it second there are at least four independent counsel invesigations currently being conducted these investigatios will be jeopardized by failure to reauthorize the statute under which they operate third the statute maintains public confidence in the fairness of our legal system and the integrity of our government a democratic government is only as strong as the trust and confidence of the people in its public officials i believe itis important that there be no cloud over the dispensation of justice there have always been and no doubt will continue to be instances in which the public will be more confident in the result of an investigation no matter what the outcome if a completely impartial independent person conducts the investigation the purpose of the independent counsel statute is to ensure that criminal investigations of highlevel government officials are carried out impartially and without favoritism the attorney general is the chief law enforcement official of the united states he is also a presidential appointee who is a key member of the presidents cabinet and in most instances a close personal friend of the president public confidence in our system of government requires that the attorney general not be responsible for investigating and prosecuting highlevel executive branch officials with whom he serves the president this statute was designed to achieve certain goals to ensure that an aggressive unbiased and thorough investigation is conducted into all criminal allegations against senior government officials to ensure continuing public confidence in our democratic system and to protect the executive branch from unwarranted suspicion to insulate the investigation of senior officials from personal or political influence and therefore to ensure that its conclusion will have the fullest credibility and to afford protection to the reputation of any innocent official subject to investigation it is precisely because the independent counsels investigation is independent that its results are deserving of trust as reported by the judiciary committee h r 2939 is substantially the same as current law in most respects for example the covered persons under h r 2939 are the same as current law as are the standards to be applied by the attorney general in deciding whether to conduct a preliminary investigation under the statute most of the changes to the current statute that are contained in h r 2939 are clarifying amendments which were drafted to address specific problems encountered with the current law or to make legislative intent clear in statutory language the two major substantive changes from current law contained in this bill are first a permanent authorization of the independent counsel statute and second specific ethics requirements for independent counsel their staffs and their law firms the independent counsel statute has been in existence for 9 years now it has served its purpose well and should be permanently authorized one wonders why the current department of justice is doing everything possible to sabotage the statute the department representing the administration has attacked the statute on constitutional and policy grounds it has gone into court to attempt to invalidate it this statute and the constitutional questions involved have been thoroughly considered by the house and senate during many congresses two presidents signed it neither of whom expressed any concern about its constitutionality in 1982 congress reconsidered the special prosecutor statute tightened the triggering mechanism for the preliminary investigation and changed the name to independent counsel president reagan signed the reauthorization public law 97409 of this statute in january 1983 and did so without expressing any concern or reservation about its constitutionality since this administration came into office in 1980 there have been six public independent counsel investigations and reportedly two nonpublic independent counsel investigations these independent counsel investigations involve former highlevel officials of the current administration and the attorney general himself and of course the irancontra affair is a current independent counsel investigation of which the entire country is awarewhich was requested by the president as the judiciary committee noted in its report when this statute was first enacted in 1978 few people disagree that there are occasions when it is necessary to have a special prosecutor who is independent of the attorney general investigation of possible wrongdoing by highlevel executive branch officials poses special problems for the federal criminal justice system the attorney general in at the same time the chief federal law enforcement official and a presidential appointee who is a key member of the presidents cabinet cases involving possible wrongdoing by highlevel executive branch officials therefore present a fundamental institutional conflict of interest in addition to the public concern about the vigor and thoroughness of the investigation however the conflict of interest situation has another dimension the proper exercise of discretion may require no prosecution or plea bargain public acceptance of such a decision is more likely to occur if someone without a conflict of interestsuch as an independent prosecutormakes the decision thus an independent special prosecutor by being able to make hard decisions free of a conflict of interest serves to help protect the good name and reputation of innocent persons wrongly accused of crime h rpt no 951307 95th congress 2nd session special prosecutor act of 1978 1978 this statute carefully limits its coverage to those individuals and relationships which create the greatest p0tential for a serious conflict of interest if the individual were to be investigated by the department of justice it is critical that this statute be reauthorized we simply cannot afford to return to the prewatergate era where the attorney general may appoint an independent counsel but can fire him just because the administration doesnt like the direction the investigation is taking i believe that our experience with this statute including the number of times it has been necessary to utilize it demonstrates that this mechanism must become a permanent part of our law ours is a system where no individual or public official is above the law the passage by the house today of this important legislation reaffirms this fundamental principle the independent counsel statute maintains public confidence in the fairness of our legal system and the integrity of our government i strongly urge my colleagues to support h r 2939 as

truly a landmark for the first time in many years important provisions of law regarding veterans employment training counseling and state approving agencies are being revised and improved these amendments are very effective blending of three measures h r 1504 amended which passed the house on june 30 1987 and was amended and passed by the senate on august 4 1987 hr 3460 amended which passed the house on october 27 1987 and s 999 which was passed by the senate on december 4 1987 there was a great deal of give and take between the house and senate veterans affairs committees regarding this measure but i believe the amendments we are considering include the best provisions of all three bills the joint explanatory statement which will cover the agreedupon compromise in detail will be included in the record following my remarks there are a few provisions however which i would like to briefly discuss section 2 of the proposed house amendments to s 999 would clarify the role of the assistant secretary of labor for veterans employment and training as the official in the department of labor with primary responsibility for veterans employment and training programs it would further establish the responsibility of the assistant secretary to ensure that veterans are fully served under all dol employment and training programs the assistant secretary must be an integral part of all decisionmaking processes within the department of labor that affect employment and training opportunities for veterai including decisions regarding the deveopment administration and implementation of future programs section 2 of the proposed amendments also contains a provision which requires the secretary of labor to assign to each region for which the secretary operates a regional office a representative of the veterans employment and training service to serve as a regional administrator for veterans employment and training a similar provision wr s contained in h r 3460 when it fist passed the house and in s 999 is passed by the senate as pointed out in house report 100387 which accompanied ii r 3460 this position is necessary to strengthen the managerial operational activities and responsibilities of vets section 3 of the proposed house amendments would require that necessary funds be made available for use in each state to support the required number of disabled veterans outreach program specialists and to support 1 600 local veterans employment representatives nationwide lver funding in recent years has been plagued by arbitrary budget reduction proposals resulting in reduced services to veterans congressional intent that these positions be fully staffed will be accomplished with the enactment of this provision although the original housepassed bill would have used a formula to establish the required number of lvers the senate provision in s 999 which we accepted effectively accomplishes our goal of stabilizing lver staffing levels section 4 would require each state employment agency to develop and apply standards for the performance of dvops and lvers which are consistent with the statutory duties and functions of dvops and lvers it is our expectation that development and implementation of performance standards will standardize the provision of veterans employment services thus eliminating the differences in dvop and lver functions which now exist from state to state section 7 of the proposed house amendments would expand the responsibilities of directors for veterans employment and training most importantly this section would clearly establish the responsibility of directors to functionally supervise the provision of services to eligible veterans and eligible persons by the employment service system and es staff i want to stress that the purposu of this provision is to clarify and strengthen the mutually supportive relationship which should exist between federal and state officials responsible for the delivery of employment services to veterans section 8 would establish the national veterans employment and training services institute this provision would codify this very effective training program which was established administratively in 1986 by the assistant secretary of labor for veterans employment and training the honorable donald e shasteen the purpose of nvetsi is to provide training to dvops lvers and other personnel involved in the provision of employment job training counseling placement or related services to veterans as of april 23 1988 nearly 2 000 state agency personnel who provide employment services to veterans had been trained at the institute this training program is an example of the joint federal state responsibility for provision of veterans employment services functioning at its best and veterans seeking employment assistance will reap the benefits of this strengthened relationship i am particularly pleased that the house amendmentssection 11contain provisions which would extend the deadline by which a veteran must apply to participate in an onthejob training program approved under the veterans job training act to september 30 1989 and extend the deadline by which a veteran participant in vjta must be enrolled in a job training program to march 31 1990 additionally this section authorizes 60 million for the program for fiscal year 1988 and an additional 60 million for fiscal year 1989 vjta has been a uniquely successful program assisting over 60 000 longterm unemployed veterans in their efforts to find permanent employment the program is further

of adequate funding based on their reasonable and necessary expenses the reduced level of funding under which the saas have been operating has seriously threatened the ability of these state agencies

the lewis and clark trailthe path for the journey of william clark and meriweather lewis to explore the newly acquired louisiana purchase their journey began in may 1804 and concluded in september 1806 i have spent a number of hours reading the journals of these two explorers during their journey through nebraska from july 11 1804 to september 8 1804 lewis and clark followed the missouri river on the eastern edge of our state and then made the return trip beginning on august 31 1806 their diaries provide the earliest glimpse of what later became the state of nebraska and other states of the great plains it is a story that should be shared with all americans who care to know about our past that is why in 1979 i began the effort to provide more recognition to the lewis and clark trail as a member of the house interior and insular affairs committee i successfully amended the national trails act to authorize the secretaryinterior or agricultureto provide for trail interpretation sites which shall be located at historic sites along the route of any national scenic or national historic trail in order to present information to the public about the trail at the lowest possible cost with emphasis on the portion of the trail passing through the state in which the site is located my idea is to put in place a system of historical interpretation signs and a limited number of sites along nationally designated trails my colleagues on the interior appropriations subcommittee have now generously prepared at my request to begin that effort with a small demonstration project to get underway in nebraska included in the pending measure h r 2712 is an appropriation of 30 000 to be used for lewis and clark trail markings this amount is an earmark of available funds to the national park service and does not represent additional moneys this is not an elaborate or complicated proposal my hope is to see a system of historical markers placed along the route of the lewis and clark trail that passes through key campsites in nebraska on each of these signs my intent is to inscribe all or portions of the actual lewis and clark journals that document events and sightings that occurred at the location of the campsite marked by the historical marker all campsites signs and locations when eventually established would be owned and operated by the state of nebraska and the

issue with substantial impact on our national defense despite a series of congressional actions to the contrary over the past several years despite an adverse court order and despite the damage to the federal budget the last time it was tried the department has again published a rule permitting permanent repayment of construction differential subsidy or cds as it is called this time theyve put out the rule even as conferees on the fiscal year 1987 supplemental appropriations bill are in the middle of considering the houses position opposing such a rule this rule is an outrage its timing is an insult finally it exposes some obvious political pressure that has been brought on the navy to coverup its longstanding opposition to cds payback for those who arent too familiar with cds let me provide a bit of background unitedstates flag vessels used in the foreign trades compete with subsidized vessels from many foreign nations to help them compete the government has in the past assisted in paying ship construction costs through the cds program unitedstates flag vessels used in the domestic trades do not compete with foreign vessels and so have not received any cds when shipments of alaska oil boomed the domestic fleet for a time could not accommodate the demand for tankers based on that tanker shortage the maritime administration permitted two tankers to repay their cds and enter the domestic trade again when domestic vessel shortages could be documented marad also allowed several other foreigntrades tankers to enter the alaska oil trade for temporary periods of up to 6 months in return for repaying a pro rata portion of their cds the department of transportation in 1982 initiated the idea of permitting foreigntrades vessels to permanently repay cds without the need for determining whether there was a need for their capacity in the domestic trades congress wouldnt accept that proposal congress correctly concluded that foreigntrades vessels shouldnt be allowed to repay cds if their switch to the domestic fleet would merely drive unsubsidized domestic vessels out of business the navy also objected pointing to the damage that would be done to the nations emergency preparedness if militarily useful domestic tankers were driven out of business congress blocked a cds payback rule in three separate appropriations bills during 1983 and 1984 in may 1985 however the barrier expired and the secretary of transportation quickly passed a rule permitting cds payback three vessels repaid cds and enterd the alaska oil trade but the court of appeals found the rule was arbitrarily and capriciously issued and vacated it last january the court said the three vessels would have to leave the domestic trade by midjuly even before the court decision the rule had proven to be a budgetary catastrophe although dot told congress to take a 200 million budget credit for the rule in the fiscal year 1986 budget resolution the rule wound up costing the budget 76 million thanks to fewer revenues and more related loan defaults that dot had projected despite this sorry experience with the rule on april 15 dot again proposed to issue the cds payback rule the house committee on appropriations already had voted on march 27 in favor of barring such a rule and the full house later adopted that position as part of the fiscal year 1987 supplemental appropriations bill that legislation is pending in conference right now but did the department pause for direction from congress on this issue no it did not on monday marad published a final cds payback rule effectively thumbing its nose at congress and at congress longtime opposition to cds payback it is very difficult to understand why dot and the administration are so much in favor of this rule its bad for the budget its bad for national defense its bad for jobs and it is of no benefit to consumers perhaps most puzzling of all has been the role of the navy in this proceeding without objection i would like to enter into the record five letters documenting the navys peculiar evolution on this issue first is a letter from assistant secretary of the navy sawyer to the secretary of transportation dated march 29 1983 this letter opposed cds payback for a number of national defense and other reasons second is a letter from assistant secretary of the navy pyatt to the maritime administration dated april 28 1987 this letter again opposed cds payback for reasons similar to those stated in 1983 third is a letter from marad to the navy dated may 6 1987 confirming the navys mysterious withdrawal of assistant secretary pyatts letter of 8 days earlier fourth is a letter from secretary of the navy webb to a private tanker operator in which he makes the following statement the cds payback rule was debated extensively within the administration during 1983 and 1984 the decision was taken to implement the rule in 1985 the reissue of the rule on 15 april 1987 was simply to correct the procedural problems found by the unitedstates court of appeals no new evidence has been presented which would warrant reopening debate within the administration on the issue fifth is a letter from assistant secretary pyatt to marad sent june 10 1987 nearly a month after the close of the comment period on the payback rule in this letter he retracts his letter of april 28 and says those comments were based upon a misunderstanding of the proposed rulemaking in that this is a technical correction to a prior rulemaking on this matter the navy supports the position of the administration as stated by the department of transportation i find these last three letters to be absolutely incredible how can the navy say there has been no evidence to warrant reopening the issue the original decision was made before a cds payback rule was ever tried then the rule was tried and turned out to be a budgetary disaster with all dot projections far off the mark isnt that new evidence if the navy took this approach to procurement it would approve the plans for a new kind of aircraft carrier watch the first carrier sink due to faulty design and then refuse to review the plans before building a second carrier to term the cds rule a technical correction of a prior rulemaking is an insult to the court of appeals the court of appeals didnt just find some technical element that needed fixingit found that the secretary essentially ignored the merchant marine act of 1936 and the statutory criteria it establishes for such regulations among other things the court said the secretarys response to concerns about the rules effects on the fleet as a naval auxiliary to take another example is similarly unsatisfying the court went on to point out some of the navys arguments and how she failed to properly respond to them for the navy to now forego its own excellent arguments and meekly call this major rulemaking a technical correction is ludicrous who i wonder forced assistant secretary pyattt to repudiate his position was it someone in the navy or someone higher in the department of defense or the administration white house officials have joined in misrepresenting the courts position one senior official told a member of congress that the administration had no choice but to issue the rule because the court had directed it to do so the court did no such thing after vacating the 1985 rule the court in an effort to avoid disruption in the fleet provided a 6month period in which the secretary could try again to issue a cds payback rule if she wished there was no requirement to issue such a rule and indeed the court said it took no position on whether it was even possible to square dots cds payback policy with the requirements of the merchant marine act in all this is a sorry record of rulemaking and an obvious slap in the face of congress by officials bent on pursuing a policy thats already been found to be wrong we need some

their right to participate in the nations political process for far too long federal employees have suffered under the yoke of the hatch act which was written for a different time and for far far different circumstances no longer should those who serve their federal government be denied basic rights enjoyed by other americans as lawmakers it is our duty to ensure that federal laws fit the times clearly we have an obligation to federal employees in this regard it is important to understand here that h r 3400 is a bipartisan compromise and is the product of extensive negotiations between democrats and republicans it is supported by every single member of the committee on post office and civil service which i have the honor of chairing it is as well supported by every major federal employee organization including organizations of managers at the outset let me tell you that this legislation continues to forbid partisan political activity while on duty it will not as critics have suggested turn the federal work place into a political arena quite the contrary the language is crystal clear federal employees may not engage in any political activity at work federal employees will however be restored to full citizenship away from a job in short the bill simply says full citizenship off the job and no political activity on the job this i might point out is a system that works well for many states and many foreign governments the bill contains strong clear prohibitions for misuse of official influence it provides that employees can be fined fired or suspended for misusing their authority as federal employees to coerce others for political ends i think it would be beneficial for all of us to recall the words of president reagan when he spoke to commemorate the bicentennial of the unitedstates constitution last september on the steps of this very capitol active and informed citizens are vital to the effective functioning of our constitutional system he said all of us have an obligation to study the constitution and participate actively in the system of selfgovernment that it establishes this is an obligation that we owe not only to ourselvds but to our children and their children what the president seemed to be saying is that it is vital in a democracy to have citizen participation and that should include all citizens not all citizens except those who work for the federal establishment american democracy does not force any group to participate neither should it exclude any particular group since it was passed in 1939 the cost of the hatch act to our democracy has been great for nearly five decades we have denied ourselves the benefit of some of our best informed citizens in the governmental process and we have paid dearly we must remember that the hatch act was passed during a period of rapid expansion of the federal government especially during that long and painful decade of the great depression when we learned the importance of the federal governments role in shortening the peaks and filling in the valleys of business cycles during this period there was deep and justifiable fear that federal workers could be manipulated by those to whom they felt they owed their jobs in a very real sense the hatch act was created to protect federal workers from the political system and to protect the system from federal workers there are striking differences today from the time the hatch act was enacted into law for one thing we have a firmly established merit system that protects both the employees and the public from political abuse as a result of employment and on top of this we have a sophisticated system of organizations today that protect employees and their rights there were far fewer organizations and with much less influence when the hatch act became law at that time less than 32 percent of the federal work force was under the merit system compared to 78 6 percent today it is patently obvious that the differences today are enormous and clearly the law that may have been necessary nearly 50 years ago is no longer appropriate today to understand this we need only examine how different the civil service is today from that time nearly half a century ago the arguments presented in this chamber then for passage of the act simply are not valid today to believe otherwise we would have to believe that the spoils system under which the winner won the right to name most of the work force still exists the fact is that when the guard changes at the white house today the incoming president has precious little opportunity to place his supporters and cronies in federal jobs the hatch act as it exists today in truth protects almost no one while working a terrible burden on those it was designed to protect by excluding them from the political process h r 3400 has as its primary premise the belief that federal employees should be free to engage in any political activity on their own

to our chairman the gentleman from iowa and the other members of the subcommittee these are trite words but indeed there have been long long hours of debate and work and hearings and finally the careful crafting and pinching of pennies in order to come up with this appropriations bill as the chairman has said none of us are happy with it it is woefully inadequate in many respects if i had my personal choice in putting together the particular parts of the bill i would do it somewhat differently but of course we have a committee that has individuals who have different viewpoints let me point out at the outset that the bill appropriates a total of 14 2 billion for these three agenciescommerce state justiceand also the federal judiciary and the 21 related agencies that is 542 9 million less than the president requested in his budget request but it is 693 million more than the 1987 appropriation including the supplemental let me point this out as well in budget authority we are 601 million below the supposed 302 b allocation in terms of outlays we are slightly under the 302 b supposed allocation it is an increase as i have said over the 1987 appropriation by 693 million but it is 542 9 million less than the president requested some of the highlights of the bill are as follows in the department of commerce this bill is 17 3 percent over the 1987 appropriation it is 18 9 percent over the presidents request but turn to the department of justice we are 6 5 percent over 1987 but we are 1 4 percent under the presidents request that is one agency where i think we need to spend some time discussing these issues particularly today as we get to these amendments that perhaps will come along talking about cutting even more we are talking about in that instance cutting from a funding for the fbi for example which already is inadequate and under the presidents request the same is true for the dea and the immigration and naturalization service and the usia and the others for the department of state we are 3 4 percent under the current services the 1987 appropriation and we are 211 2 percent under the presidents request for the state department for the judiciary we are about 9 percent over this years appropriation but we are 5v2 percent under what the president would like us to have in the related agencies we are both under last years spending by almost 1 percent and 3 percent under what the president would have us spend overall for this bill we are 5 1 percent over the 1987 appropriation but we are 3 7 percent under what the president would like us to spend the big cuts i would point out again and the big inadequacies i would like to share with the folks on my side of the aisle especially the big inadequacies in the bill there is not enought money in there now for the fbi the dea the ins the usia and then for those members who feel that the state department does good work it is woefully underfunded in the bill as it is fl 1055 overall we tried our best to balance the needs of the members who came to us with their requests we tried to balance the needs of the agencies above all of course in the functions of the government bearing in mind that we are trying to implement a new omnibus crime bill in the justice department for example and also fund the new immigration reform program that is now ongoing in the ins we are trying to house more prisoners every day and we are way over capacity in the federal prisons yet that agency is underfunded in this bill the problem we faced was not enough allocation of spending from the committee on the budget to do what we really have to do so i think the bill on balance is good considering the difficulties that we have had in trying to come up with a bill to satisfy the needs of the nation and the

sdi budget above 3 1 billion dollars any such action represents a direct challenge to the abm treaty the premise of the abm treaty is that efforts to develop technological defenses against nuclear attack are destabilizing and cannot succeed the premise of star wars is that we can develop an infallible missile defense system and make the world safe for nuclear weapons supporters of sdi concede that a comprehensive missile defense system cannot be built overnight on that they agree with the american physical society this countrys leading professional society of physicists but aps departs from the starryeyed view of sdis proponents on the longterm prospects for the system in its 400page report aps concludes that it will take at least 10 years of intensive research before we can determine whether or not such a a system can ever be developed sdi supporters remain undeterred however apparently they believe they can legislate away any technological filibusters but star wars is built on fond and foolish wishes that technology can rid the world of the threat of nuclear war the proponents of sdi are captivated even enchanted by the wonder of playing laser tag in the heavens they challenge us with this question gee wouldnt it be neat if we could put up a giant bubble that would keep out nuclear warheads perhaps but before we answer that question i would ask several others first do we know how much this programwhich may or may not be possible to completewill cost no we dont we do know though that nearterm deployment of the proposed spacebased kinetic kill vehicles will cost at least 68 billion dollars second do we know how effective this programwhich may or may not be feasible and which costs an unknown sum of moneywill be no we dont know that either but we do know that the spacebased kinetic kill vehiclesthe system most likely to be deployed in the early to mid1990swill have the capacity to stop about 16 percent of a soviet ballistic missile attack on the united states so we are asked to commit ourselves to a program which may work someday which will definitely cost a lot but were not sure how much and which for now will be effective onesixth of the time third do we know the likely consequences of nearterm deployment of an sdi system finally a question for which we have answers i believe the sdi effort has been worthwhile the soviets are terrified that we might be serious about building it that gives us a powerful lever to achieve a meaningful arms control agreement but the value of sdi ends there if we go ahead and deploy it we leave the soviets no choice but to respond and we can be certain that deploying a ballistic missile defense will prompt a soviet response to believe the sdi will end the arms race is to ignore the entire course of human history sdi will not end the arms race it will not make the world safer sdi escalates the arms race and it will force the soviets to respond in kind soviets could quickly develop the technology to render any nearterm system obsolete if we press ahead with more elaborate variations of star wars the soviets will be forced to develop more elaborate counter measures continuing the research effort at or slightly below the current year level keeps the pressure on the soviets to bargain in good faith going beyond that as the administration would to testing and deployment risks repeating the error or reykjavik where the president faced with choosing between sdi and arms control chose sdi this house should not repeat that mistake this issue comes down to a choice between abm and star wars a choice between arms control and the arms race fifteen years ago the senate in ratifying the abm treaty recognized that there is no end point in the progression of new and more destructive weapons last week this house voted against an attempt to weaken abm we can do something that makes sense on sdi we can vote to continue the research effort thus preserving the momentum for an arms control agreement we can do that for 2 5 billion or about 1 billion less than the current years spending i am disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to vote for 2 5 billion the closest we can come to that total under the procedures governing this debate is the 3 1 billion total proposed by the bennett amendment i support that amendment funding for research will permit us to

conference report to h r 5 the augustus hawkins and robert t stafford elementary and secondary education amendments of 1988 this bill makes a number of changes which will improve the basic educational services that are provided to needy students throughout the country there are three programs in this bill that i would like to focus upon the stateoperated program for handicapped children the bilingual education program and the national assessment of educational progress the stateoperated program for handicapped children commonly known as the 89313 program is the predecessor to public law 9414 the education for all handicapped children act in 1965 when the 89313 program was created most students with severe handicaps were educated in segregated facilities with little or no opportunity to interact with their nonhandicapped peers with the enactment of public law 94142 which requires a free and appropriate education for all handicapped children segregation of severely handicapped children has been greatly reduced however there are many states which continue to segregate severely handicapped students under the 89313 prograin this conference report will allow the congress to learn more about the 89313 program in terms of where the program is now and where it ought to go in the future since 1965 when the 89313 program was created information on who participate in the program has been very limited h r 5 will require the state educational agency as part of its grant application to report annually to the secretary of education on the number of children served in the 89313 program according to age type of disability and the location of their educational placement this information will tell us exactly who participates in the program and how they are being educated in addition this conference report authorizes the gao to conduct a study on the stateoperated program for handicapped children this study will include a description of state and local agencies that participate in the program the children the agencies serve and the program for which the agencies use funds gao will look at how the program is administered by the state and the what the policies and procedures are for determining when the child is eligible to be counted under the 89313 program most importantly the study will look at the policies and procedures governing the placement of handicapped children ineluding where these children reside where they receive their education and the policies and procedures for transferring children from stateoperated facilities into leas in particular i am concerned that all severely handicapped students are not being served in an appropriate integrated educational environment while the majority of school systems around the country integrate their severely handicapped children with nonhandicapped students there are too many children who are segregated for no valid educational reason this conference report particularly the gao study will give the congress the information it needs to make the necessary changes so that severely handicapped children have the opportunity to be educated with their nonhandicapped peers in the bilingual education program h r 5 modernizes and strenghthens the provisions which enable students to achieve full competence in english and to meet school grade promotion and graduation requirements h r 5 provides that the secretary of education may reserve up to 25 percent of the funds appropriated under part a for grants for special alternative instructional programs the 75 percent setaside for part a funds is not changed this reflects the support by the conferees and myself of both teaching methods the transitional bilingual method and special alternative methods the need to improve and expand bilingual education programs is particularly critical at this time due to the increasing number of nonenglishspeaking students entering our educational system i believe these changes protect the current programs under part a april 1 9 1 988 i111826 while providing the secretary greater flexibility in funding alternative methods of instruction i support these changes and believe it will allow local school distrl hts the flexibility they need to teach their limited english proficient students finally h r 5 makes significant improvements in the national assessment for educational improvement which measures the academic performance of our students this conference report expands the subject areas to be assessed and provides for two trial state assessments in math and science in 1990 and 1992 the conference report eliminates the controversial statebystate comparison of state and local school systems the subject areas in naep are expanded to include science history and geography currently only mathematics reading and writing are the learning areas which are assessed in addition h r 5 establishes an indendent national assessment board which will set the policy for the national assessment develop objectives for assessing learning areas and determine how to report the results fairly and accurately these improvements in the national assessment will provide more reliable and accurate data on student academic performance so that policymakers at the national state and local levels as well as educators and the public can better monitor the effectiveness of american education i commend the chairman mr hawkins and my colleagues congressman jefords and congressman goodling for their hard work on this comprehensive education and their dedication to maintaining excellence in our public schools h r 5 reflects their commitment to provide the best education possible to all of our young people i support this conference report and believe it will have

took over the labor day weekend to participate in a meeting in santiago that was a very important and impressive meeting and one i think that our colleagues and our constituents should know about we were invited as delegates to the second annual assembly of parliamentarians in support of a return to democracy in chile the first meeting occurred in may of 1986 and because of delays and uncertainties in planning of that meeting no members of the unitedstates congress had attended in fact the only parliamentarians present had been from latin america but with more advanced planning and a better notification of people from around the world the second annual meeting convened in santiago with parliamentarians from many countries around the world and in fact over 100 members of various parliamentary bodies all freely and democratically elected assembled in santiago together with over 100 members former members of the chilean congress the congress that had met continuously for well over 100 years at the time of the coup detat which brought general pinochet to power in since 1973 the chilean people have suffered under the yoke of a military dictatorship and that military dictatorship has imposed on the people of chile brutal violations of their human rights now those violations of human rights have been greater and less at various times over the 14 years of the pinochet dictatorship but throughout that period there has been a gross violation of respected standards of human rights in chile the purpose of the international assembly was to give a show of strength and solidarity to those in chile who are fighting for a return of democratic government and it was indeed a dramatic and moving experience to be a part of that event for several years here in the congress members of the committee on banking finance and urban affairs in particular have focused on united states policy with respect to chile the banking committee has jurisdiction through its subcommittee on international development institutions and finance of the voting behavior of representatives of the united states in the multilateral development banks the multilateral development banks provide development lending to countries such as chile and chile is eligible for and receives loans from both the world bank and from the interamerican development bank under the harkin amendment which was passed by the congress and signed by the president in 1977 it is the law of the united states that our representatives to such banks are instructed to oppose by voice and vote the granting of loans by such development banks to countries which engage in gross violations of internationally recognized human rights during the carter administration it was the consistent policy of our representatives to vote against lending to chile and except for the area of loans directed to basic human needs which are exempted from the harkin amendment the carter administration regularly and routinely opposed these loans on the ground that the chilean government was engaging in systematic violations of the human rights of the chilean people during this period this policy had relatively little effect on chile these were boom times for many developing countries a lot of banks commercial banks were happy to make loans and large amounts of debt were run up by the chilean government from commercial banks and the opposition both political and otherwise to development lending from the multilateral international institutions did not significantly effect what went on in chile however this period of ability to borrow easily from commercial banks ended in 1982 with the worldwide recession and since that time chile as much as any other country has become dependent on lending from the world bank and the interamerican development bank to sustain its economy but another change occurred with the election of the reagan administration in addition to the change in the economic circumstances in chile and that change was that the reagan administration ceased the previous opposition of the united states government to world bank and interamerican bank lending to chile and the administration began to vote consistently in favor of such loans in 1986 we experienced some specific human rights violations that once again put before the american people and the american congress the severity of the abuses of human rights by the chilean government a pair of young teenagers one a resident of the united states and the other a chilean were severely burned in an attack by chilean military officers the american resident was killed and his chilean friend was severely burned hospitalized for long periods of time and has been undergoing a difficult and painful recovery the fact that this kind of brutal attack could occur heightened the tension here in the united states to the continuing abuses of the chilean government and led to a reexamination of united states voting policy with respect to development loans more recently in the fall of 1986 the united states did in fact oppose a major structural adjustment loan being considered in the world bank and although the loan was approved the united states joined with 47 percent of the voting shares in the world bank in either opposing or abstaining from the granting of the loan this was an important step in the right direction in unitedstates policy and it had been urged on the administration by the development bank subcommittee of the banking committee in hearings and consultations prior to that vote in our travels to chile for the assembly in september we had hoped to accomplish two purposes one is to review the continued importance of united states actions with respect to the granting of economic benefits to chile and second to present before the chilean people clear demonstration that we from the united states joined with other freely elected parliamentarians from around the world in urging a return to democracy promptly and by truly free and open elections in chile now it is important to note that chile is not a country that has routinely lived under military rule in fact prior to the coup in 1973 chile had enjoyed 168 years of virtually uninterrupted democratic rule with two relatively minor exceptions that entire period of chiles history had involved regular elections and regular democratic succession both in the legislative and the executive branch and chile was held out before the world as a major example of success of democracy in latin america during that 168 years of democratic rule in chile there developed an extremely strong democratic tradition and strong and active democratic parties chile in fact had many parties and a very robust political debate underlying its democratic government all of that changed with the coup in 1973 which was accompanied with executions of political leaders and also the exile of many others who were not in fact executed and a great pall was cast over both the tradition and the practice of democracy in chile but in fact the flame of democratic participation and the desire for democratic government while injured and brutally attacked throughout the last 14 years is still very much alive in chile and the life that it has was very much demonstrated by the participation of former chilean congressmen in the sessions of the assembly which we attended the problem which isfaced by those in the opposition in chile is of constitutional proportions in 1980 the chilean junta proposed and had adopted a constitution for chile but unfortunately this new constitution did not provide for true democratic elections nor the true return of democracy to that country the constitution which was adopted is in fact a blueprint for the continued control of chile by a single strong military leader or one whose actions can be severely circumscribed by the military it has been clear for some time that the current military dictator general pinochet is desirous of continuing in his position and using the procedures of the 1980 constitution to install himself for another term of 8 years when elections are scheduled in 1989 the procedure of those elections as set forth in the constitution would permit the ruling junta of four military leaders to nominate a sole candidate to be voted upon by the chilean people in a plebiscite and the winner of that plebiscite receiving a majority of yes votes would then serve for an 8year term these are not the kinds of elections that would provide for a return to democracy consequently the focus of the meeting which was held and the focus of the discussions we had in chile were on this question how can we move this situation so that the wellformed and historic opposition parties in chile would have a true open opportunity to participate in free elections so that in 1989 or 1988 when the elections are convened they can be truly democratic elections and the people of chile will

have watched with interest the political posturing of the democratic leadership por almost 2 months we were consumed in a prolonged attack on the president and the presidents budget including several committee meetings around the country where the focus was on attacking line by line what the president has proposed in his budget now he met the constitutional requirements in that budget the budget was submitted on time i do not agree with everything that is in the presidents budget but nevertheless he fulfilled his responsibility as a leader last week after more than a week of apparently unsuccessful efforts to draft a democratic budget plan we budget republicans were asked to join them in a bipartisan effort rather than taking the expedient route and refusing to cooperate we republicans asked for an opportunity to discuss this strategy with our leadership yesterday at the same time we were meeting with our leadership to consider the challenge of joining together to produce a bipartisam budget the democrat leadership and the chairman of the budget committee announced to the press plans for a new strategy to discredit president reagans budget that plan as the gentleman from ohio said yesterday is a clear admission that the democrats have been unable to come up with a budget that they are proud to present to the american people embarrassed by their inability to produce a responsible document that cuts the deficit it appears now the idea is to try to spread the embarrassment to the budget republicans the deadline for the budget resolution is upon us and yet the house democrat leadership remains paralyzed in facing up to their responsibilities to produce a budget document as the gentleman from kentucky said earlier when will the party that says they are governing begin to govern because of this institutional paralysis in this chamber tomorrow we are going to be faced with a democrat proposal that would deny between 36 million and 37 million social security recipients their costofliving raise in fact an outlay freeze would actually reduce the social security benefits of many beneficiaries because of the lack of political will the democrat leadership is abandoning the tradition of working from a chairmans mark in open session because of a case of political butterflies we are going to be working from a document that the chairman himself says clearly is unacceptable in its implications so the exercise in political posturing only delays the inevitable sooner or later the majority leadership of this house must realize that its responsibilities in devising a budget extend further than merely throwing rhetorical bombs at the administration did it have to come to this no i do not think it did because last week we were asked to be bipartisan and join the process today we read in the papers how the markup tomorrow is designed to embarrass the president and house republicans"], [0.0259397029876709, 0.4740602970123291, 1, "i

facilitate the closing of military bases which ought to be closed should have been closed over the last 10 years the question before us is procedurally do we make it harder or easier to accomplish the task of closing those bases the simple fact of the matter is as all of us know who have been in this body very long that it is more likely that congress will uphold the base closing if it can be done without a vote and it is less likely that congress will uphold the base closing if an affirmative vote is required the previous speaker from wisconsin mentioned thr t maybe we ought to have the same procedure on tax legislation maybe we should not have tax legislation unless with or without a vote i would mention to you that on the markup for the tax reform act of 1986 there was a chairmans mark and at first in the committee the rule was for one day that no part of the chairmans mark could continue to be in the bill unless after discussion it was an affirmative vote to keep it in the mark very quickly in 24 hours we saw there would never be a tax reform bill never be a tax reform bill if that procedure were followed so we changed it the next day o a procedure that said that the chairmans mark would stay in any item would stay in the chairmans mark unless there were a vote to take it back out same thing on the congressional pay raises an effort was made several years ago to make sure that when the recommendation of the presidents commission came to congress it would go into effect unless there was a vote of the congress to reject it i think there is little doubt but what there would not be a congressional pay raise would not have been one last year if there had been an affirmative require ment that there must be a positive vote by the congress on a pay rise we all know that we are going to have difficult times fiscally in the next few years the pentagon is going to be chronically short of money they will be lucky to get funds for zero growth over the next several years it is critically important for those who believe in a strong defense and paying for the weapons systems we have already put into effect that as much money as possible be available to those if that is going to be the case we are going to have to close some of these bases if we ant real plant closing a real oppoi u jity to get the plants closed we are more likely to get it with the kasich amendment attached to this bill so that when the recommendations come through if we think in general it is a good recommendation that the president submits to us we need not have vote now let us not kid ourselves we can talk all we want about congressional prerogatives but the truth of the matter is it is easier to accomplish what we want do do in a difficult area politically if congress does not have to vote on it for it to go into effect so i think the gentleman from ohio my colleague has offered an excellent amendment and i hope very much that the house will support his
