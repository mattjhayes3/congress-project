independent analyses of new major weapons systems into pentagon plans for weapons procurement current department of defense procedures leave open the possibility that scarce taxpayers dollars be obligated for the procurement of poorly conceived and expensive weapons systems before the complete examination of critical factors is undertaken in fiscal year 1982 the department of defense has been authorized to spend over 36 billion for the procurement of military hardware or 9 billion more than during the last fiscal year yet at the same time that unprecedented increases in defense spending are being enacted into law the impact of the procurement of many weapons systems on inflation on local communities on the environment and on the strategic balance have yet to be determnined take the mx missile for example after years of congressionally approved spending on research development and initial procurement no decision has been reached on the appropriate basing mode and now doubts are being cast over the strategic implications of deploying such a system had our military planners been more attentive to the problems that we now know are associated with the 1= it is conceivable that the pentagon could have considered other options and the expected cost overruns on the mx could have been avoided the department of defense does not however need just another study if our nations defense planners and the american people are to truly benefit from a coherent defense strategy then input ought to be obtained from the broadcast possible sources is it not conceivable that academics environmental groups business roundtables economic analysts and even the mechanics who must repair and maintain military equipmentas well as pentagon officials and traditional defense contractorscould be consulted about major weapons systems under consideration by the department of defense at a time of increased defense spending and fiscal restraint the american people must be doubly careful about waste weapons systems like other government expenditures must be developed along the most costeffective lines no stone must be left unturned in the search for the least wasteful least damaging to the environment safest surest alternatives to maintaining an adequate defense for the nation our adversaries will not change their perceptions about american military resolve if the united states adopts a policy of throwing money at the pentagon careful thoughtful and comprehensive planning for the future is a far more credible deterrent to a soviet military threat than haphazard military spending the fact of the matter is that the department of defense has tradition ally relied for its defense planping on those members of the defense community who have the most to gain from the acquisition of the

authorization for the state department as well as ica the board for international broadcasting and the interamerican foundation after agreeing to 13 amoendments the house failed to pass the bill but h r 4814 which is now before us for consideration is identical to h r 3518 except that it differs from the original bill in the monetary levels which have been adjusted to reflect the administrations september revision of the budget so we have the administrations request in this bill for fiscal years 1982 and 1983 the administration now fully supports this bill that is basically where we are now with this motion agreed to we would be able to go to conference with the senate bill which is now before us i might add that the senate bill does not have the current figures that is the september figures they have the previous figures of the administration request i so we will go to conference in that posture now there are many who have raised some questions with respect to funds for education and cultural programs including my distinguished colleague and ranking minority member on the subcommittee in a motion to commit with instructions that he plans to offer let me point out to my colleagues that the cuts that were made in those programs or proposed or agreed uponi am not sure which yetare internal allocations by 0mb these are not cuts which are proposed in this bill as a matter of fact i am violently opposed to the internal allocations of the cuts as suggested by 0imb and the director of ica i think it would be a disaster to allow those cuts to remain many of us have signed letters to the president and to the director of ica and to 0mb asking them to reconsider these cuts because what they are about to do if they insist on those al locations internally is effectively to wipe out our cultural exchange programs around the world now most of us if not all of us are agreed upon the importance of those programs and they should be continued i want to point out also that even if the house were to increase the amount of authorization even to the extent suggested by my colleague the gentleman from illinois it would still not guarantee that the internal allocations would not still hold what has to be done rather than vote for the motion to commit with instructions is to make sure that the administration internally does not carry out the allocations of the cuts in the manner in which they propose there are a lot of other things they could do they could for example prorate the cuts across the board they could take it out of other moneys that are available to them they could take it out of the radio construction account where funds are not immediately needed there are a lot of things that could be done but let me assure my colleagues who are concerned about this and some of whom will speak on this issue that we as a committee are aware of this problem we are opposed to the allocations which unfairly target these programs for such large cuts we will do everything we can to keep those programs alive as of right now the appropriations bill affecting this accountand i want my colleagues to pay particular attention to thiswhen the house passed the appropriations bill this matter was not before us we did not have this problem but the senate appropriations bill was still being acted on in the other body and just yesterday the appropriations subcommittee in the other body dealing with this account increased the amount of money available to the ica account i want to repeat for emphasis to all of the members who are interested either in the motion to commit with instructions or who are concerned about these programsthe appropriations committee in the other body has earmarked 101 million for education and cultural affairs and i would propose to my colleagues in the conference when we go to conference on this the authorization bill that we would write language in the statement of managers making it absolutely clear that we are totally opposed to this irrational allocation of the cuts within the budget figures i think that should handle the problem while i am in sympathy with what my distinguished friend the gentleman from illinois wants to do i would urge my colleagues to vote against the motion to commit stay with the authorization figures we have now got for 1982 and 1983 allow us to go to conference and work out the best possible bill we can with the guarantees on these programs i include the following har 351811 1 4635 house hat 4814 amiloistrations ifference ae flou leesspteer

21 1981 many of my colleagues are paying tribute to the late roy wilkins former executive director of the national association for the advancement of colored people in the coming days his death hit all members of society as we remember him as a lifelong fighter for equal rights for blacks although he is gone his legacy will never die i submit this article from newsweek magazine that captures the essence of the man roy wilkins 190181 his grandfather was a slave and his father tended a brick kiln he worked at turns as a redcap a dishwasher a pullmancar waiter and a cleanup man in a st paul slaughterhouse but since 1931 when roy wilkins joined the staff of the national association for the advancement of colored people his name has been synonymous with the nations oldest and lzrgest civilrights organization his tenure from 1955 to 1977 as the naacps chief executive embraced the era of greatest progress for blazk americans though he lacked the magnetism of martin luther king jr or the fire of stokely carmichael he quietly made an enduring contribution to the cause of equal rights embodying the will of the majority of black citizens to work within the system when he died last week in new york city of kidney failure just after his 80th birthday he left behind a landscape of broken barriers and a lifetime in the fight for integrationagainst the recalcitrant south and later against the forces of separatism within his owvn race wamotrmrbl wilkins wsmsreakbefor his longevity in the civilrights movement when the black revolution reached ferer pitch in the 1960s he had already spent four decades battling to make the unitedstates legal system work for blacks born in 1901 in st louis and raised by an aunt and uncle in a poor integrated section of st paul he knew little racial hatred in his early life but at the university of minnesota he was deeply affected by a lynching in duluth and after graduation as managing editor of a black weekly the kansas city call he experienced jim crow firsthand his efforts on the call in the 1920s to halt police brutality against blacks and to defeat segregationist politicians attracted the attention of naacp director walter white who persuaded wilkins to come to new york as his assistant in 1931 crusade for the naacp the 1930s were the heyday of the antilynching campaign the scottsboro case and battles against allwhite primaries wilkins ran the daytoday operations and spearheaded some of the naacps frimed exposes dressed as a day laborer he infiltrated armyrun construction projects in 1932 and his revelations that blacks were working twelve hour days for as little as 10 cents an hour forced a congressional review as editor of the naacp magazine the crisis wilkins also crusaded against poll taxes and~ segregation in the armed forces public accommodations and schools looking back on his career he jse 116259 viewed the 1954 supreme court decision in brown v board of education which overturned the separate but equal doctrine as the naacps greatest victory when the civilrights battle shifted to the streets in the 1960s the naacp and wilkinsby then its directorlost the limelight to groups like kings southern christian leadership conference and the congress of racial equality the naacp did participate in the sitins boycotts and marches that wrenched the south into compliance with the law wilkins liked to point out but usually its roie was to provide bail and legal assistance to other demonstrators the sclc and core furnish the noise wilkins said in 1963 while the naacp phys the bills wilkins personally spent much of the early 1960s working with john f kennedy and lyndon johnson on the civilrights acts of 1964 and 1965 and increasingly he differed with more visible black leaders who to wilkins some times seemed more interested in protest than progress jim crow the rifts in the civilrights leadership grew deeper when bpeks in northern urban ghettos rioted in the mild1960s wilkins understood the anger and as a member of johnsons national advisory commission on civil disorders he was instrumental in drafting the tough language in the panels 1968 report that warned of the emergence of two societies one black one white but wilkins steadfastly condemned the violence and he advocated the use of federal troops when necessary to contain it he also opposed the growing black separatist movement the clamor for allblack dorms sand autonomous blackstudies departments on some campuses hie declared were simply another version of jim crow militant black leaders in turn branded wilkins an uncle tom activists picketed his home and a band of revolutionaries was arrested for plotting to assassinate him within the naacp itself a group known as the young turks battled bitterly to steer the organization toward a more militant posture but wilkins resisted he had lived through the backtoafrica movement and the communist appeal to blacks in the early 1900s and he still believed that the best hopes of blacks lay in working with whites toward a shared equality wilkinss voice grew quieter in the 1970s though he continued to press for better op~portunities for blacks and assailed richard nixon gerald ford and suddenly timid liberals for slowing the pace of desegregation particularly in school busing his final years with the naacp were clouded in a dispute with the groups directors who suggested that he had stayed too long but when at 75 he finally surrendered the helm to former federal communications comnmission head benjamin hooks in 1977 hie was met with an outpouring of appreciation for his 46 years of service increasingly feeblehe needed a pacemaker and a wvheelchair and had developed a speech impedimentwilkins spent his last years living quietly with his wife minnile a former social worker accepting awards and working on his autobiography to be published next year it should tell a remarkable story of faith optimism and endurance through an era of

unitedstates capitol building at the cost of not more than 25 000 i first introduced this resolution in the 92d congress with 61 cosponsors before introducing it again in the 93d congress i consulted the congressional black caucus after extensive consideration the caucus agreed that dr king was the most appropriate black american so to honor i again introduced this resolution in the 94th congress with 161 cosponsors it passed in the house and a similar version passed in the senate however congress recessed before the minor differences could be resolved in conference i introduced this resolution once more in the 95th congress with 160 cosponsors it too passed the house but ran into difficulty in the senate committee on rules in the last congress this resolution passed the house by a vote of 408 to 11 while it was not considered by the full senate the senate committee on rules did report it favorably today i am introducing this resolution with 144 cosponsors including again the support of the entire black caucus it is altogether fitting that we so honor dr king he was a man who might have lived out a worthwhile but obscure life as a minister instead he was beckoned by the challenge to win equality for all the people of this country on december 1 1955 mm rosa parks a seamstress with tired feet was arrested in montgomery ala for refusing to give up her seat on a local bus to a white man her arrest triggered the first great civil rights test of power and launched dr kings quest for equality dr king then an unknown minister in alabama led the montgomery black community that year mrs parks arrest ended 382 days later with the capitulation of the montgomery busline to the doctrine of racial equality dr king had begun his march in the years that followed dr kings influence grew he set out to correct specific injustices but also to educate our country and win the hearts and minds of our people his marches awakened our country and aroused our sympathy who shall never forget that horrible spectacle in 1963 when dr king and his marchers dressed in their sunday clothes met fire hoses truncheons and police dogs in birmingham a few months later in his famous i have a dream speech dr king addressed thousands of people gathered at the lincoln memorial and said when we let freedom ring we ill speed the day when all gods children black and white men jews and gentiles protestants and catholics will be able to joi hands and sing the words of the old negro spiritual free at last free at last thank god almighty were free at last in 1964 dr king became the 14th american and the youngest person ever to win the nobel peace prize a firm believer in christian ideals and gandhis principle of peaceful nonviolent protest dr king set out to fulfill a dream to give life to this countrys highest ideals he spoke for the present and the future of getting to the mountaintop and reaching the promised land he was indeed one of the truly great figures of our american history but there are other reasons why this memorial should be authorized for placement in the unitedstates capitol building do you know that of all the black americans who have contributed to our countrys greatness not one is featured among the 6131 works of art in the halls of the capitol is it any wonder that in the absence of any such recognition so few black families are to be seen among the millions of tourists who flock to our capitol building each year is it not distressing that a nation striving to set right the wrongs of the past has blotted out here at the very seat of government any recognition of the role of black people in building this great country this memorial to dr king would present a perfect opportunity to begin to correct this injustice this civil rights leader deserves to receive this official recognition and appreciation although dr kings violent death is a tragic blot on our recent history his life was a shining example for us all he had the courage of his convictions and for over a decade his hopes and his dreams guided the nation in the truggle for equal justice equal opportunity and basic rights he carried that struggle as far as any man or woman in this century a permanent memorial to dr king in the unitedstates capitol building would remind america and the rest of the world over the years to come of the inspiring leadership of this great man i want to stress that this bill is in no way a substitute for h r 800 introduced by the gentleman from michigan which would designate january 15 the birthday of dr king as a national holiday i strongly support mr conyers bill and i urge my colleagues to do so certainly the accomplishments and contributions of dr king are worthy of commemoration by the passage of both pieces of

congress the republicans and democrats have worked together to carry out a common purpose we are here today to discuss the mechanics by which we implement the policy that we have set here the bill before the house h r 2540 provides an authorization of appropriations for fiscal year 1982 for three international trade agencies under the jurisdiction of the ways and means committee the authorization levels provided in this bill are fully consistent with and fully support president reagans budget we adopted the numbers requested by the president for the customs service and the office of the trade representative thus achieving a 30 258 000 reduction over the original budget requests of january for customs we are providing an authorization of 480 001 000 this is a reduction from the january budget estimates for fiscal year 1981 of 495 6 million in other words customs is taking an absolute cut its budget numbers will be lower in fiscal year 1982 than in fiscal year 1981despite inflation and a growing customs workload customs manpower will be reduced from 13 280 in fiscal year 1980 to 12 703 in fiscal year 1982 for the office of the trade representative we are providing 10 million this figure is 633 000 above the fiscal year 1981 estimated budgetan increase of 6 percent for the international trade commission we adopted the figure requested by that agency 18 501 000 the itc which is a quasijudicial independent agency designed to provide special services to the congress submits its budget directly to the congress and does not clear its budget through omb therefore over the years the ways and means trade subcommittee has been careful to provide especially severe oversight of the commissions operations the commissions budget is only 790 000 or 4 4 percent more than its total fiscal year 1981 budget assuming the enactment of the pay increase supplemental there will be no increase in the commissions staff therefore we believe that the itcs budget is a very tight one and should be supported as submitted there are several items of particular interest in title iii of the bill relating to the customs service because of the cut in the customs budget the continued inflation and customs growing workload we desperately need to find ways to make the operations of customs iaore efficient to eliminate unnecessary tasks and low priority programs therefore we have proposed several changes in the laws affecting customs operations which we estimate may save about 14 million per year beginning in fiscal year 1983 and thereafter several of these proposals have evoked questions in one case the bill requires that by the end of fiscal year 1983 customs be operated out of no more than 6 regional offices and 35 district offices this is a reduction of at least 3 regions and 11 districts we have not spelled out in the bill which offices are to be closed and i have no idea which offices customs management and analysts may eventually select fot closing but let me say that over the past 17 years there have been 12 studies on customs field organization and all of those studies have found a need for fewer offices closing some of these headquarters offices will result in cost savings reduced overhead and increased efficiency it is a time to end the studying and to act by mandating the closings we intend to give customs the political backbone to make the hard choices of which offices to close there are some who are questioning this provision we can no longer play pork barrel politics with the budget the present customs field structure is a product of 200 years of gross pork barreling and the nations taxpayers demand an end to it some may argue that this proposal and the 7plus million it will save are not in the presidents budget that is a strange argument of course the congress can make additional savings and efficiencies above and beyond the presidents budget this is what our oversight function is for second because of the extraordinary budget tightness facing customs we must fin new more efficient ways to inspect arriving passengers and cargo this is particularly important because at some of our nations airports it already takes up to 2 hours or more to clear customsand this is before the planned budget cuts the general accounting office has recommended severai new ways of processing passengers primarily these new methods center on onestop inspection and the preliminary interviewing of passengers before they receive their luggage or pit baggage from the aircraft gao believes that these new methods variations of which are used in many foreign nations can be tried without impairing law enforcement therefore the committees bill provides for 6 month tests at at least two major international airports of new ways of processing passengers we have taken great care to work with usda to insure that such tests are jointly developed and administered and evaluated by customs agriculture and the immigration and naturalization service so that the concerns of each of these agencies are addressed in particular we are concerned that the current syrtems of protecting the country against the importation of infected or diseased animals and plants be continued without change we believe that the committees amendment providing for joint agency development of testswhich will noti repeat notbe the socalled red door green door type of systemsatisfies the concerns of the american agricultural community about the dangers of the entry of exotic plant and animal diseases finally i would just like to say that i wish we could provide a larger budget for customs it is a wellrun agency of dedicated public servants it is a revenue raising agency i hope that in fiscal year 1983 the administration will support a significant growth in its budget this year however the demands for less government spending require this budget reduction it will mean some hardships and some delays in the processing of goods and merchandise we hope that with the creative management which has been demonstrated by customs in recent years that they will use this budgetary crisis to find new and better ways of doing the really essential tasks i have covered the main points of the bill and the principal controversial sections i urge the members to support this bill as one which meets the nations

rise in opposition to this years foreign aid bill i do so only after much thought for i am well aware of the seemingly reasonable arguments in support of foreign aid it is said that december 1981 the united states has a moral commitment to help those in the world suffering from the ravages of famine or drought that the united states acts in its own security interests by aidingeconomically or militarilycertain countries that the united states promotes international economic stability by providing economic assistance to developing countries these are al laudable goals unfortunately these omnibus foreign aid bills rarely implement them and often hinder them a vote against the foreign aid bill is not a vote against mercy i do not think there is one person here who is against the alleviation of innocent human suffering in september 1979 shortly after the caribbean was hit by a terrific hurricane i joined a majority of my colleagues in voting to send 25 million in disaster relief to those countries affected several weeks later i again joined the majority of this house in passing a bill to provide over 200 million that year for the feeding and care of indochinese refugees that bill also provided 30 million to help feed those victimized by the twin evils of famine and vicious totalitarian rule in cambodia the u s congress does not turn its back on starving babies unfortunately the foreign aid bill does not always feed starving babies i submit for the record a column by jack anderson while i do not always agree with this columnist i think that this article provides an excellent example of the faulty approach implicit in foreign aid in bangladesh unitedstates food goas to the wealthy in the 10 years since bangladesh became a nation its hungry people have received more than 1 5 billion in american aid theres just one problem the unitedstates aid money is enriching the wealthy while the poor continue to starve life has always been harsh on that pathetic piece of earth called bangladesh it is a flat almost marshy plain bedeviled by op pressive humidity monsoon rains and cyclones the rains that enrich the fields also support an ideal environment for cholera smallpox tuberculosis and malaria if the death rate is appallingly high the human birth rate is even more astonishing young and old work in the fields to bring forth more life but the people who grow the food are themselves malnourished the american cargo ships brimming with abundance have not relieved the misery of the masses a discouraging 80 percent of the populace still doesnt have enough to eat i sent my associate peter grant to bangladesh to find out why it didnt take him long to discover the main problem he noticed it as he was crossing the border in fact the bangladesh customs office looked like the twodollar window at a racetrack there was so much money changing hands grant reported unfortunately the customs office is not the most corrupt government agency that dubious honor goes to the food ministry which handles all the donated grain from overseas like the topsyturvy government agencies of george orwells 1984 the food ministry prevents food from reaching the nations neediest it does this through mismanagement and favortherich policies good weather and western shipments have combined to fill the granaries of bangladesh but its unlikely the oppressed poor will be eating much of that grain heres why most foreign grain donations go into the governments rationing system which grossly favors the welltodo members of society top priority is given to the armed services government employos police bank employes and other privileged categories next come the city dwellers at the bottom of the heap is the rural population who live in the most abject poverty the peasants are fed only if theres anything left over corruption is so widespread and accepted that the government automatically allows for it with a 5 percent loss factor figured into all grain transactions needless to say no transaction is made with less than the permitted 5 percent loss many government warehouse operators have grown fat on kickbacks drought is currently threatening bangladeshs most important rice harvest which means the food in warehouses is the only hedge against disaster yet western experts say that as much as 20 percent of the 1 4 million tons of stored grain may be damaged and 10 percent unusable grain is stored outside under plastic sheets though nearby warehouses have plenty of space to get rid of spoiling wheat the ministry recently sold it off at bargain pricesan open invitation to corruption sure enough the food controller of rajshahi was caught by a city mob with some 4 000 in his pocketkickbacks for selling good grain at the bargain price he was rescued from the angry mob by police bangladesh is just one example of a much too common problem there are others several days ago i saw a fascinating photograph from india

with my distinguished colleague fiom texas to spur the agricultural production of a number of essential strategic and industrial materials the legfislation seeks to create the ~arid lands renewable agricultural resources corporation an entity identical to the synthetic fuels corporation but directed to replacing nonfuel end uses of petroleum and in a manner better suited to the arid parts of the western united states this legislation is nearly identical to s 1462 introduced by senator deconcini on july 10 1981 a full text of that bill can be found in the congressional rxcorn of that date beginning on page the corporation would use price guarantees loan guarantees direct loans and joint ventures in that order of declining priority to encourage the production of critical materials fromt plants native to the southwestern united states most of the bill details the function and organization of the corporation which is identical to the one that congress approved for the synthetic fuels corporation the remaining parts of the bill detail the purpose and needs of this corporation there are sections of this bill pertaining to produ btion goals expenses and so forth which have been purposely left open to be made final after congressional deliberations the cost of this legislation dependent upon the production goals is likewise to be determined later some of my colleagues will undoubtedly ask why we need such a corporation let me provide some background the plants mentioned in this legisla tion are all native to the southwestern united states and are drought resistant more tolerant to salinity than other commercial crops and all produce products in demand by industry and the armed services they have been the subject of much research by universities and industry and are at the threshold of commercial production one of the plants guayule is a semiarid perennial shrub which produces natural rubber and a number of commercially attractive resins it has been used by industry in the past and during world war 11 was the subject of massive development as a part of our war effort this country currently imports 100 percent of its natural rubber800 000 metric tonsat a cost of nearly a billion dollars per year the department of defense is currently examining its natural rubber needs with an eye toward encouraging guayule production our strategic stockpile goal for natural rubber of 850 000 long tons is not close to being met with only 120 000 long tons in storage sin a classic example of the difficulties associated with the commercialization of a new idea or product guayule has not been developed to meet the existing demand for natural rubber industry will not incorporate guayule rubber in its products until there is an assured volume of plant material farmers will not enter into commercial production until a market can be guaranteed the federal government has been unwilling to finance the development of this crop without significant industry funding industry has been reluctant to make large development investments on this longterm payback undertaking without some financial assurances from the federal government in the meantime natural rubber shortages predicted to start in the mid1980s creep closer ianother of the plants mentioned in this bill is jojoba again a native southwestern plant which produces a nut that yields a high quality lubricant this lubricant has many times the life of petroleum products and is beginning to be marketed for use in the transportation industry the oil technically a liquid wax is also of use as a feedstock for making plastic and fertilizers and has use in dermatological applications those of you who have seen advertisements for jojoba shampoo know of other commercial uses jojoba oil can replace petroleum and petrochemicals in many of these applications euphorbia tlathyris also known as gopherweed produces a hydrocarbon latex with a number or critical uses this hydrocarbon can be used as a chemical feedstock as well and has in addition produced a highoctane gasoline in laboratory tests much research is underway but again commercial development of this petroleumreplacing plant is not proceeding at a pace commensurate with the national need circubita commonly called buffalo gourd is another arid land plant with considerable economic and industrial importance circubita seeds are a source of oil with many of the same applications as peanut and sunflower oil the yields per acre are in the range of commercial production of soybeans and peanuts but require much less water but given the potential for these crops to reduce our dependence upon imported oil for a number of nonenergy uses and the production of materials essential for our defense why the need for this corporation first i consider these plant resources to be just as critical as the oil shale and sand or the plant sources of alcohol fuels which are the focus of the synthetic fuels corporation yet the synfuels corporation is not set up to deal with the rionfuel petroleum demand addressed primarily in this bill second private industry cannot be expected to make the necessary development investments on its own as with the synthetic fuels corporation projects the payback for investments made in these agricultural sources of materials is not within a length of time likely to be considered by a corporation as justification for the investment the efforts authorized in this bil are of critical importance to the strategy and defense of the united states and are a legitimate federal concern this legislation has many advantages over the projects planned for the western united states under the authority of the synfuels corporation those projects seek to save one limited resourceroilbut at the expense of another llmii ed resourcewater the synfuels effc cts planned for the west are entirely antithetical to our regions resource conservation needs water is already scarce in the arid west and many of the synfuels projects will only make that situtation worse also the synfuels projects are extremely disruptive causing rural areas to swell in numbers with armies of outsiders coming to construct and run these facilities this bill will use the existing farming structure and will increase the cropping options for southwestern farmers in summary this legislation is designed to speed the production of essential strategic materials from domestic agricultural sources it will leverage private investment and create an ongoing industry capable of providing these materials on a continuing basis and the legislation accomplishes this in a manner that uses arid lands resources in an appropriate manner with minimal disruption to the environmental and social aspects of the west that we all cherish i want to encourage my colleagues to join with me in this effort and not just my southwestern colleagues for this effort benefits all of the united states a dependable domestic source of natural rubber benefits the rubber industry of the industrial midwest dependable domestic sources of lubricants oils and chemical feedstocks benefit other industries workers and consumers

building and put out the flames for years now our farmers have come to us telling us that theyll be ruined by the high interest rates and the soaring costs of production between the soaring costs of operation and interest rates and the low commodity prices they are being squeezed nearly out of existence its no longer enough to throw federal dollars at the problem or to fill the halls of the congress with sympathetic rhetoric the need of the hour is to haul them out of the drowning waves of outrageous interest and inflation rates and its for these reasons that i applaud the administration for having tle courage to tackle these problems they will not lend themselves to easy overnight solutions but they are the only way we can stabilize our nations economy so farmers can again make the sound business decisions they need to make in order to run their farms and were already beginning to see strong positive results first and foremost the administration is coming to grips with inflation just a little over a year ago inflation peaked at 16 5 percent but through its hardnosed policy this administration has pulled inflation down to below 5 percent this has increased the buying power of every single farmer so that when they go to the store they will be able to buy more seed or more fertilizer with each dollar they have worked so hard to earn and this means lower costs of operation overall farm production expenses are expected to rise by only 35 percent during 1982 this would be the smallest increase in farm expenses since 1968 and energy costs are coming into line as a matter of fact fuel prices have actually declined during the first quarter of 1982 and this means more dollars in the wallets of farmers who have to feed and clothe their families and the administration is making great strides in combating the interest may 3 198 2 rates now do not get me wrong interest rates are still unacceptably high but this administrations budget cutting policies are beginning to work and the prime rate has fallen from 20 5 percent to 16 5 percent there is still a long way to go i have seen the grim forecasts for farm income and good farmers in my own district have told me that they are wondering whether they will be able to stay in operation for another year but the fact remains that their main problems are economic and until we resolve these economic problems these problems that are the result of years of reckless government spending our farmers will never have the economic stability which they need so badly and the administrations policies are already succeeding in stabilizing our nations economy there are some people who are fooled by rhetoric and shortterm flashy solutions but the man who is drowning knows when he has been left to fend for himself in the ocean the man who is caught in a burning building knows when the flames get too hot and the farmers who are being utterly destroyed by the old economic and reckless spending policies will know if we desert them and fail to strangle the soaring inflation and interest rates which threaten them so badly our country cannot get by without the family farm our countrys entire economy was built on the foundation of prosperous family farms which have proven strong enough to feed our entire nation we cannot risk eroding this sound foundation we cannot risk a continued policy of reckless goveriiment spending with the devastating interest and inflation rates it causes this administration has had the courage to make the difficult decisions to reduce federal spending this is the only way we can reduce the deficit and clamp down on interest and inflation rates i applaud the administration for their courage and i urge my colleagues in the house to stand with the administration in building on their policy of fiscal responsibility this is the only hope our farmers have for the economic stability they need so badly e"], [0.964528676122427, 0.03547132387757301, 1, "why am i here

bill i am hopeful that the senate will agree to the house language i think that we all agree that there is a profound need for us to pass social security disability legislation in this session of congress to date about 200 000 people have been terminated from the disability insurance rolls since the continuing disability review process was begun in march 1981 of the 50 percent who have appealed their terminations 67 percent have been returned to the program through the appeals process every month that we delay another 53 000 cases are reviewed by state agencies and about 22 000 beneficiaries terminated based on current data we can expect about 7 500 of these beneficiaries to be erroneously terminated next month what this means is people with acute chronic and often terminal illness will be taken off the disability rolls with at most 2 months notice many of these people have no income other than money that they receive from the social security administration what happens to these individuals and their families is tragic there are documented cases of people committing suicide after receiving their notices of termination there are cases of people dying during or directly after the medical examinations imposed on them by the continuing disability reviews often this is because they are sent to doctors who are not their own treating physician and have no previous knowledge of their health conditions and the threat these tests may pose to the persons life and then there is the growing body of evidence uncovering people who have died from conditions that the social security administration said they did not have or that were not serious enough to keep them from working i have never been one who believes that we should pass federal legislation based on anecdotal information but the stories that we are hearing conic from every state in the nation and many of these have been clearly substantiated i feel compelled to read you four examples

implemented a limited slow down within the confines of the existing law we are seeking to extend the benefits to persons who chose to appeal their torininations throuth the adinis tratlive law judge process we do this for three reasons first 67 percent of the appealed terminations have been wrong second there is clearly established legal principle that legitimately awarded benefits should not be taken away without due process and third people who have been erroneously terminated have faced additional devastating hardships such as the loss of their homes the loss of their cars and bankruptcy it is not taking about 11 months from the time one is terminated to the time one actually receives a check after a reversal at the administrative law judge level even for those persons who are reinstated and receive retroactive benefits it is often too late to save their homes for the mortgages have already been foreclosed many will never have another opportunity to own a home again

about 2v years agoand to do so not through the authorization process but through the appropriations process now my good friend the distinguished gentleman from new york mentioned that these two amendments would constitute a violation of the rules of the house and the gentleman is absolutely correct they would that is why we need to have a rule which would make them in order but by the same

world as 35 nations including the united states and the soviet union sign ed an agreement in helsinki calling for a new era of cooperation between them included in that agreement were pledges to initiate disarmament discussions freer flow of trade and a recognition of basic human rights for all the peoples of the world it was the human rights declaration that raised the hopes of millions of people in eastern europe who fell under the soviet communist yoke in the period following the first and second world wars for decades the soviet ruling elite maintained strict political control over the ukraine estonia and latvia the freedom of speech and movement that we take for granted in our great country became the forbidden fruit of captive eastern europe those who dared to taste of that fruit faced some of the most heinous punishments known to modern man thousands of ukrainians were taken from their homes and transferred to the waste lands of labor camps of siberia and other desolate locations never to be heard from again it is no wonder then that the helsinki accords of 1975 set free the passionate desire for freedom in the ukrainian people that had been stifled but never annihilated by the soviet aggressors on november 9 1976 a group of 10 brave ukrainians founded the ukrainian public group to promote the implementation of the helsinki accords openly challenging the soviets to live up to the helsinki accords they had signed a year earlier in our own history they can be compared to the american patriots who declared their desire to be free from british rule the

myroslav marynovych oksana meshko mykola rudenko nino strokata and okeksiy tykhy the russian response to the formation of the group was quick and brutal within 3 months rudenko and several others were arrested the russians have once again sent a loud and clear message to the world that freedom of thought expression and other basic human rights would not be tolerated for any nation under their domination but in spite of the systematic imprisonment of the membdrs of the group the ukrainian people reaffirmed their desire to push for the goals outlined in the historic helsinki agreement in 1977 the group enlarged to 37 members and sent a series of petitions to the soviet authorities asking that the helsinki accords be followed in full especially in regard to the human rights declarations the soviet response was the same more members of the group were arrested at the present time all members of the ukrainian helsinki monitoring group are either in jail committed to

the legislation is the authorization of the expenditure of 563 806 000 nearly 95 million in excess of what we have appropriated what this amendment does is simply bring the authorization into line with our approp~riation to enact the authorization contained in h r 3518 as is would be to authorize an appropriation that is a 24 5percent increase above the fiscal year 1981 appropriationan increase of 97 5 million 1 for one find it exceptionally difficult to ask the citizens of the united states to make sacrifices while we vote to substantially increase the authorization for international organizations for that reason i have introduted this amendment which wvill reduce the authorization for fiscal 1982 from 563 806 000 to 469 472 350 the amount which we have already appropriated in addition in view of the proposed budget cuts for next year this amendment will also hold the authorization for fiscal 1983 at the same level as fiscal 1982 i caution my colleagues not to be misled by the figures proposed in this bill despite the fact that the proposed authorization for fiscal 1983 reflects a slight decrease from the authorization for fiscal 1982 the fiscal 1983 authorization in its present form reflects an increase of 18 percent nearly 85 million above the fiscal 1982 appropriation which we approved last week of the funds that we appropriated last week over 400 million is earmarked as membership assessments to international organizations some of those organizations include the international organization for legal metrology 64 000 the ir~tci american institut 3 of agricultural sciences 7 672 000 the pan american railway congress association 22 000 the world tourism organization 204 000 the pan american institute of geography and history 396 000 the interamerican indian institute 154 000 the international bureau of weights and measures 379 000 the international bureau of the publication of customs tariffs 53 000 the international office for epizootics 64 000 just to name a few there are a host of others in addition to the membership assessments the united states spends millions of dollarstaxpayers dollarsin the form of additional voluntary contributions to international organizations during this year alone despite the economic hard times the united states will give the united nations an estimated 550 millionover onehalf billion dollarsin voluntary contributions in addition to the 340 million that we paid as a membership assessment prior to the august recess we concluded work on the budget and tax bills with the reductions in the federal budget contained in those bills we have given notice to the american people that leaner appropriations will become a fact of life with those leaner appropriations our citizens must become less dependent on the federal government and sacrifices must be made we therefore must ask ourselves are we prepared to ask our constituents to make these sacrifices and to expect less in the way of domestic programs and assistance while we vote to increase the number of their tax dollars that we authorize for international organizations i think not andt for that reason i urge my colleagues to support this amendment to bring the fiscal 1982 authorization into line with the appropriation that we passed last wek and that we hold the fiscal 1983 level to the fiscal 1982 level"], [0.044612765312194824, 0.4553872346878052, 1, "the gentleman is very knowledgeable on this subject and i may appear to be argumentative i do not know anything about the bill at all except what little i have read i have been expending my time on some of these other matters that have come one after another in this lameduck session my concern is assuming that we legalize all of the illegal aliens that are now in the country at the present time what are we going to do to prevent what i understand to be a constant steady flow coming over from mexico day after day i am told that it is some 1 000 2 000 3 000 the gentleman from illinois says we are gong to hire some extra border patrolmen but in the 24 years that i have been in this body we have talked about hiring them but somehow they never seem to get hired my understanding is that they have about two patrolmen for every mile which obviously is not going to be very effective without a fence or without the kind of thing that they have over between the borderrs of west germany and east germany what does this bill propose to do i would ask the gentleman to deal with that problem or does the gentleman feel that it does not effectively deal with it"], [0.046447932720184326, 0.5464479327201843, 1, "i have listened carefully to the gentlemans statement and i think it may have been the most powerful one that has been made during this debate but i would like to observe that going to the southern borders of our country and watching people wade through the water or visiting an ins office does not constitute any meaningful experience it takes the writing of this legislation out of the vacuum that some people talk about last night there were members of this committee who were very anxiously supporting this bill who said i went to the border and i looked and i saw and i came back and now i know what i am doing they ignored the testimony of some of the hispanic leaders here as if they had not even spoken i could not believe it they were asserting that by serving on a committee and taking a couple of trips maybe a lot of trips somehow going to that mexican border gave them some insight to write this legislation i happen to be one of the members who believe that that does not give them one ounce of insight more than anybody else i thank the gentleman for yielding"]]}
