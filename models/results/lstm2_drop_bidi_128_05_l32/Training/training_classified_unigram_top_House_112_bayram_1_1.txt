than raising taxes which is already going to happen on january 1 from this massive new tax increase that was in the health care bill why dont we find a way to understand and have the economy take that

think on job creation we understand that if the presidents bill passes we will lose 700 000 jobs that means 700 000 americans and their families would then qualify i presume for unemployment and it would mean that we begin the new year once again on a negative pathway thats why we are here today talking and trying to have our leaders of this great nation make sure that we avoid this this country

developed by members who are speaking here today sitting down and talking to one anothernot by lobbyists we hammered this plan out over a period of months having worked off of previous efforts in legislation that was introduced in previous congresses this is whats needed in washington and unfortunately too often it doesnt happenthe art of the political compromise these arent republican or democratic ideas these are simply good commonsense ideas that put americas energy future first time and time again i see too many members rising on the house floor focusing on their talking points giving the stump speeches thats nice but it doesnt comport with the reality of the challenges we face today in many instances this legislation however does sound bites like drill baby drill or use it or lose it may sound good to certain constituencies but i do not believe they constitute an energy policy this legislation h r 1861 constitutes a real energy policy over the next 20 years let me talk about what this measure would do to enhance our path first it would expand domestic energy production on the outer continental shelf secondly it would advance alternative energy including wind solar biomass wave geothermal and other clean alternatives third it would rebuild our nations roads bridges dams water and sewer systemsthat as congressman murphy indicated today is estimated to have a pricetag of over 900 billion fourth it would develop clean coal energy technology which we have an abundance of supply in fifth it would develop ways in which we can finance nuclear energy technologies sixth it would expand the use of energyefficiency products and alternative fuel vehicles seventh it would restore and protect our nations wildlife refuges national parks lakes and waterways and how would it do all this it would help also to assist in paying off our national debt why because the funds that we receive for energy on fossil fuels both onshore and offshore on federal lands is the secondlargest single source of revenue that comes to the united states treasury outside of the taxes we pay its the revenue that we would derive by expanding energy sources onshore and offshore that would go to pay for these efforts as a nation we have to work towards a realistic energy policy our economy needs it we can no longer afford to take any energy sources off the table and while we tackle these problems we have to rebuild our aging infrastructure h r 1861 does that by dedicating these funds to that effort without raising taxes as many of you know im a firm believer in using all the energy tools in our energy toolbox conventional energy together with renewable resources a strategy for energy conservation while upgrading our transmission lines will best serve our longterm energy needs in closing id like to continue to work with my colleagues on this collaboration as was noted since our first energy crisis in 1973 we have had a host of energy plans by previous congresses and previous administrations whats different between this and those efforts ill tell you whats different we have not had the ability to get together in a bipartisan fashion to agree on one energy policy stick with it and implement it over the next 20 years h r 1861 allows us the path to do that i look forward to working with my colleagues in a bipartisan effort to ensure that once and for all we put america first put our politics behind us and introducenot only this introduction but to do everything we can to enact h r 1861 both in the house and in the senate and get this to the presidents desk"], [0.9839004259556532, 0.01609957404434681, 1, "i thank the ranking member of the committee on natural resources mr ed markey for the opportunity to speak on this important issue i also like to thank chairman doc hastings for his leadership every year thousands of federal rules or regulations governing almost every aspect of society are conceived through the federal rulemaking process consequently federal agencies perform quasilegislative functions and in many ways serve as an extension of congress this notion of an unelected entity having such tremendous impact on society rests uneasily with democratic theory for this reason a critical feature in our democracy is to control excessive bureaucratic discretion and to ensure that rules and regulations promulgated by federal agencies are consistent with the intent of congress as expressed in the law the administrative procedure act apa of 1946 exists for this purposeto constrain excessive bureaucratic discretion through procedural requirements for agency decision making including setting goals and standards for regulations and ensuring public participation through notice and comment other statutory rulemaking requirements applicable to a wide range of agencies include the regulatory flexibility act the paperwork reduction act the unfunded mandates reform act and the information quality act these statutory requirements established a clear process for agency rulemaking and standard by which the quality of regulations should be measured i appreciate the concerns of my republican friends that there are problems with many federal regulations over the years we have seen evidence of excessive bureaucratic discretion that result in federal regulations being too burdensome costly counterproductive and even prohibitive critics argue that mundane requirements have led to the ossification of the rulemaking process which at times could mean years before the final regulations are put in place meanwhile federal regulations are derived from the laws that are enacted by congress these laws are put in place to safeguard public interest without federal regulations though we could have situations such as the recent deepwater oil spill in the gulf of mexico the lack of regulatory oversight contributed to one of the biggest oil spills in the country in which the deepwater well released about 200 million gallons or 4 9 million barrels of crude oil into the gulf of mexico over a period of 84 days to prevent such environmental disaster in the future we need stronger federal regulations to ensure that appropriate standards are in place i support a more common sense approach to federal regulations federal agencies should strive to protect the public interest and to ensure that proposed regulations do not stifle economic growth and job creation for this reason i am pleased that president obama has ordered a government wide review of federal regulations to root out those regulations that stifle job creation and make our economy less competitive as the lawmaking institution in our system of government we also have a responsibility to

that resulted in a 1 000 comments which were thoroughly reviewed in fact the policy has been amended in response to those specific local concerns the justification for this policy is not only to prevent trespassing though this is one reason it is necessary the forest has a checkerboard pattern of nonfederal lands mixed in with federal lands dog deer hunting results in deer running over long distances and hunters pursuing them and at times discharging firearms on the run in an area with private homes the forest service determined that this was simply too dangerous the forest service has collected input from local residents and not hunters who fear for their safety during dog deer hunting season to be clear while the decision was ultimately approved by the region in atlanta the policy was developed by the local forest service staff who work on the forest lastly this amendment is redundant and wasteful because a rule already in place meets the requirements of the proposed amendment the current rule already covers the smallest portion of forest possible because with the checkerboard lands the rule must cover the entire forest to be effective while public safety is the primary justification for this rule preventing trespass is another reason for the rule and why it was put in place the fleming amendment would throw out the current rule and then require a new rule that meets the exact same requirements this is redundant a waste of time and money finally according to the forest service the state of louisiana already prohibits dog deer hunting on state lands so this is

members have come to the floor today to document the considerable ecological and public health threats posed by the development of the transcanada keystone xl pipeline in addition to producing 40 percent more life cycle greenhouse gas emissions than conventional oil the recent exxon pipeline spill in montanas yellowstone river serves as a stark reminder of the very real risks posed by these kinds of pipeline projects however in discounting these facts the proponents of keystone xl assert that without the new pipeline canadas dirty tar sands oil will be shipped to china and to other overseas markets this simply isnt true without access to a major new shipping terminal and refining hub on the gulf coast canadas tar sands will remain stranded on the north american continent indeed keystone xl is essential to the economic expansion of canadian tar sands because it opens up new trade routes to the east current pipeline infrastructure carries tar sands oil to the midwest but no further by 2015 existing markets will no longer be sufficient to absorb this increased tar sands production so the keystone xl pipeline will provide that new market to china for this oil indeed earlier this year the ceo of valero energy one of the companies that has signed up to ship oil through keystone xl said this that the future of refining in the united states is in exports so america is increasingly now the global middleman in world oil exports our oil exports have doubled in the last 5 years the question is this shouldnt we have some say in where our oil goes with the construction of this new pipeline we are going to be shouldering all of the increased environmental risks that come with its construction to help meet the growing overseas oil demand of our economic competitors how does that further the energy independence of the united states so the amendment we are offering today with mr cohen and mr welch will merely make it clear that a decision to permit

minority leaders decision to invoke the longstanding senate tradition known as the leahythurmond rule pursuant to this tradition and precedent the senate will cease confirming nominees to the federal courts of appeals until after the presidential election in november many of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle have previously affirmed the propriety of this rule and enforced its standard for example in the last year of the bush administration the majority leader noted that in a presidential election year it is always very tough for judges that is the way it has been for a long time and that is why we have the thurmond rule the chairman of the judiciary committee who has cited the thurmond rule more frequently than any other senator has likewise stated that in a presidential election year after spring no judges go through except by the consent of the republican and democratic leaders statements from several of my democratic colleagues likewise confirm that it is proper to invoke the leahythurmond rule at this point in a presidential election year in 2008 for example one of my colleagues on the judiciary committee argued that for federal appeals court nominees once it comes to june generally everything stops in an election year indeed on june 12 of that same year another judiciary committee colleague stated that the senate was already way past the time of the thurmond rule history further confirms the propriety of invoking the leahythurmond rule at this time it is extremely rare for the senate to confirm an appeals court nominee after june of a presidential election year in fact it has happened only once in almost two decades when in 2000 the republicancontrolled senate confirmed one of president clintons nominees it is simply not true as comments from some of my colleagues have implied that in recent presidential election years we have confirmed appellate court nominees in july august or september moreover this year we have already confirmed five of president obamas federal appeals court nominees this incidentally is the same number of appeals court nominees the senate confirmed in 2008 the most recent presidential election year on record in 2004 the senate confirmed only four such nominees indeed dating back over 100 years from president william howard taft to president obama the senate has confirmed an average of just four appeals court nominees during presidential election years this year we have already exceeded the historical average and confirmed five of president obamas appeals court nominees there is no reason to depart further from the historical norm and confirm additional nominees the suggestion by some that application of the leahythurmond rule somehow affects court vacancies deemed judicial emergencies is false and recklessly so of the four judicial emergencies on the federal court of appeals president obama has nominated only one individual and because that nomination was so recent even absent the leahythurmond rule that nominee would not be scheduled for a vote anytime soon i also remind my colleagues that democrats enforced the leahythurmond rule in june 2008 during a time when there were twice as many judicial emergencies in the circuit courts as there are right now likewise the overall vacancy rate on our circuit courts was much higher in june 2004 when president bush was in the final year of his term yet democrats did not hesitate to block several qualified appellate court nominees in the months leading up to the 2004 presidential election enforcement of the leahythurmond rule does not currently apply to district court nominees this year the senate has already confirmed 23 of president obamas district court nomineesmany more than were confirmed during comparable years during the president bush and clinton presidencies and we will continue to confirm more qualified nominees application of the leahythurmond rule beginning now will thus not implicate any district court judicial emergencies the urgency for such vacancies lies not in the senate which to this day has acted responsibly on nominees but with president obama who to this day has failed to nominate individuals for many of these seats there are i add other good reasons in addition to tradition and historical precedent to enforce the leahythurmond rule now rather than waiting longer to do so doing so now prevents a particular president from packing the courts at the end of his term by appointing influential lifetenured appellate court judges whose service will span numerous other presidential administrations the leahythurmond rule also ensures that presidential politics during an election season will not overshadow or interfere with the senates advice and consent role on such judicial nominees the last point bears special emphasis the constitution assigns to the senate the right and the duty to advise and consent to the presidents judicial and executive branch nominees it is essential for the constitutions separation of powers that the senate protect its necessary and legitimate role in the nominations process against encroachment by the executive branch of government earlier this year we witnessed a troubling demonstration of what can happen when the president violates the constitutions separation of powers and tramples on the senates rightful prerogatives in the advise and consent process on january 4 2012 at a time when the senate was conducting brief sessions approximately every 72 hours president obama nonetheless bypassed the senate and unilaterally appointed four significant executive branch nominees by asserting the power to make recess appointments even when the senateaccording to its own ruleswas not in recess the president simply ignored the senates legitimate constitutional right to advise and consent to nominees made by the president president obamas unconstitutional appointments cut to the very heart of our constitutions separation of powers and the institutional prerogatives that rightfully belong right here in this body accordingly since the time of those appointments i have sought to protect the senates interests by opposing president obamas judicial nominees i have made clear i would do the same were a republican president to make similarly unconstitutional appointments under the recess appointments clause as the chairman of the senate judiciary committee noted at a recent judiciary committee hearing i have stated my concern with president obamas unconstitutional recess appointments very clearly but i have also been in his words extremely responsible in my opposition and have not hindered the work of the senate in light of president obamas unconstitutional appointments it is all the more proper we invoke the leahythurmond rule now i agree with the ranking member of the senate judiciary committee that we should have invoked that rule back in january at the time of the unconstitutional appointments by enforcing the leahythurmond rule now we will demonstrate for the historical record the senate did not acquiesce in president obamas unconstitutional recess appointments and instead took action to protect the senates institutional prerogatives when we have done so i will again be in a position to vote in favor of qualified consensus district court nominees but i will always remain vigilant in seeking to protect the senate against unconstitutional encroachment by the executive branch as members of this body we have an institutional responsibility to safeguard the senates
