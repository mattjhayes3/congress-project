raid the social security surplus to pay for its tax cuts it is time for the republicans to stop trying to cut taxes on the backs of americas seniors working families and children it is also time for the republicans to stop claiming that we cant afford to spend more on important programs like education and health when they are pouring more and more money into defense we have 11 million children who are not covered by health insurance we have a head start program so chronically underfunded that only 2 out of every 5 eligible children can get in and we have 26 000 schoolsserving 14 million

students setting up classrooms in trailers hallways and closets the unitedstates department of education estimates that 6 000 new schools must be built by 2006 at a cost of billions of dollars to handle this overflow yet the republicans have chosen to cut nondefense discretionary spending like education furthermore 46 percent of todays schools lack adequate electrical wiring to support the fullscale use of technology and our schools are still suffering from a digital divide schools with 90 percent or more of minority students have less access to computers17 students per computer compared with only 10 students per computer in schools with less than 25 percent minority students yet instead of focusing on these important issues the republicans are increasing defense spending by 17 4 billion the biggest percentage increase in the dod budget 11 percent is not for what is really needed like pay raises or operations and maintenance countless numbers of our soldiers are on food stamps but the republican budget focuses more on building new weapons than helping to retain our soldiers and to improve their quality of life our longterm national security depends not just on how many bombs and missiles we build but how well we can retain our soldiers and how we can prepare our children for the highlycompetitive global economy they will face the democratic alternative focuses on these important issues it focuses on the needs of americans by extending the solvency of both social security and medicare and protecting 100 percent of the social security surplus providing a voluntary prescription drug benefit for all schools through medicare and issuing reconciliation instructions to the ways and means committee to make it real providing more debt reduction than the

eliminated by 2013 under the democratic alternative maintaining funding for nondefense discretionary programs at the level needed to adjust for inflation providing targeted tax cuts to average families of 78 billion over five years and 263 billion over ten years and offsetting this cost by closing corporate loopholes and shutting down corporate tax shelters and by including initiatives to

cruelty at the subcommittee markup we added a provision which exempted possession and distribution of such materials for scientific political historical educational artistic religious or journalistic purposes although this narrows the application of the bill considerably i am not convinced that the bill meets the provisions of the first amendment to the united states constitution which prohibits reinstructions on speech including speech that most find disgusting or unpopular in unitedstates v eichman a 1990 case the supreme court said and i quote if there is a bedrock principle underlying the first amendment it is that the government may not prohibit expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable it is without question that the conduct at issue today is offensive and disagreeable and it is also clear that we can constitutionally prohibit cruelty to animals however it is clear that we cannot prohibit the communications regarding such acts including the film communications done for purely commercial gains all states already have some form of animal protection laws which would likely prohibit the crushing of animals in a manner depicted in the socalled crush video films and prohibiting the crushing of animals in the manner suggested in the bill raises no constitutional issues but the communication through film is speech which is protected by the first amendment of the united states constitution films of animals being crushed are communications about the acts depicted not doing the acts in fact the content in these films is no different than the content of a closedcircuit film of actual robberies or other crimes which are used on the cops on the beat tv shows in order to compete for rates and advertising revenues that they bring in in those videos human beings are intentionally killed or pistol whipped by criminals and those videos would not be affected by this bill the supreme court has consistently refused to carve out new exceptions to the first amendment although one cannot endanger the public by yelling fire in a crowded theater and one cannot traffic in child pornography speech has been restricted in precious few examples obscene speech is one type of speech which has been restricted first to be obscene it has to appeal to prurient or sexually unhealthy and degrading interest second it has to violate contemporary community standards which are judged on a statebystate indeed communitybycommunity basis not a national basis and third when taken as a whole it must be entirely lacking in redeeming literary artistic political or scientific merit while h r 1887 would apply to some obscene material many videos covered by the bill are clearly not obscene we have other supreme court cases which indicate that speech can also be restricted when there is a compelling state interest to do so however such restrictions must meet the strict scrutiny test which requires that it is necessary to serve a compelling governmental interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that end although it is clear that the governmental interests in protecting human rights may be sufficiently compelling to justify restrictions on rights otherwise protected by the constitution the question posed by this bill is vhether protecting animals rights counterbalances citizens fundamental constitutional rights it would seem from the case in 1993 city of hialeah that the answer to that question is no in that case the city of hialeah enacted various ordinances to prevent cruelty to animals by prohibiting animal sacrifices which were part of the santerian religion one of the asserted bases for the ordinance was protection of animals although the district court found a compelling governmental interest in protecting animals the supreme court invalidated those ordinances as an infringement on the first amendments free exercise of religion clause although the supreme court recognized the governmental interest in protecting animals from cruelty that interest did not justify violating the rights of citizens to freely exercise their religion therefore on balance animal rights do not supersede fundamental human constitutional rights so while the government can and does protect animals from acts of cruelty making of the films of such acts are unlikely to constitute compelling state interest sufficient to justify rights which are otherwise protected by the constitution now one argument to justify this as a compelling state interest is the suggestion of the correlation between serial killers and the indication that they often begin by torturing animals yet the suggestion is that the serial killers actually torture the animals themselves not just watch videos and certainly there is no indication that a store clerk selling videos is a danger to society therefore it does not appear that there is a compelling state interest to violate the freedom of speech constitutional right but even if there were a compelling state interest it fails the strict scrutiny test because it is not narrowly tailored although the bill is tailored to avoid some of the more obvious first amendment issues it leaves so much of what it is purportedly aimed at is in fact uncovered that it falls into the problem encountered by the hialeah case there the ordinances prohibited the practices of the santerians in a way of protecting public health but it did not prohibit practices generally or pursue less offensive ways to accomplish the goals such as requiring the same sanitation activities throughout the city here the bill prohibits the commercial use of videos in a way to prohibit the cruelty to animals but does not prohibit personal creation or use of the videos the bill also exempts serious political scientific educational historical religious artistical or journalistic uses of such films as legitimate purposes for disseminating them it is also apparent the bill does not prohibit maiming mutilating wounding or killing animals in connection with food preparation or for clothing preparation such as bashing heads of baby seals and skinning them sometimes alive and those kinds of videos for hunting and fishing or for pest control on the other hand the bill makes illegal depictions of activities that are not illegal when or where made and if those activities are illegal in the state where the depictions are possessed for example bullfighting may be illegal in virginia so possessing for sale of a film in virginia depicting a bullfight in spain would violate the act thus as in the hialeah case the bill purports to prevent animal cruelty by stopping the creation and distribution of films but only when it is used for commercial purposes a more narrowly tailored way to get at such cruelty would be to prosecute those who are actually engaged in the activities considered cruel so although i commend the author of the bill the gentleman from california"],

could talk about an issue that is important not only to schools so many times when we talk about them we talk about as if it is important only to schools and to children and to teachers and to parents but my colleague has properly framed it it is important really to this country and our competitiveness we have seen in the 1990s as an example where business has absolutely used technology to increase productivity at a level that we have not seen since the dawning of the industrial revolution in this country literally and it has increased our productivity and given us one of the best economies really that we have had in our lifetimes if we can just sustain it for a few more months it may be the longest sustained economic period of growth in the history of this country and a lot of that goes to the technology that is driving our economy that being said your point of acknowledging that the challenges we face at the public school level and the digital divide that is there already that is why the business roundtable as come forward on education and put their shoulder to the wheel as some would say the titans of industry but they are not industry as we expect they are industry that understands that a welleducated citizenry as thomas jefferson said is really our key not only to a democracy but to a thriving economy the unitedstates chamber of commerce and almost every chamber of commerce now across this country and i had the privilege when i was state superintendent in north carolina of working not only with our what is called the citizens of business and industry which is really our state chamber of commerce each chamber of commerce now has an education component now there is a reason to have an education component and a support unit there for public schools because

who are going to be moving into the workforce need to have computer skills and i would challenge him i think it is 100 percent the truth is everyone is going to have to have some knowledge of computers but we are going to have to have a much higher competency on a large segment of our population in the 21st century because most jobs are going to be driven in one way or another by technology the thing that i see in our public schools and the issues my colleague has talked about in the bills and i want to commend my colleague for the bills that he has in committee that he is

our offices where we have computers i went in a classroom just this past monday and visited where they are trying to get just five computers in each classroom a very modern school in a very progressive county in my district but guess what happened they could not afford to have them and have them tied to the internet so now they have computer labs computer labs are not all that bad the problem is children get to use them only when they go how would we like to have all the automobiles that we have placed in a garage and we could only use them once a week that is really what we are doing with computers as important as computers are to a child in learning we are saying you can get to them once a week and by the way you can only use them about an hour and we will teach you how to

finding it harder and harder to take their prescription drugs because they simply cannot afford to take the medication that their doctors tell them they must take they are not following doctors orders simply because they cannot afford their medication we have looked at this issue over the past year the democrats have looked at this issue and are ready to go again ready to do some work to relieve the problems that seniors and others are facing all around this country we need to do two things first we need to stop price discrimination against seniors second we need to provide a universal prescription drug benefit under medicare let us start with what is going on in the real world in the real world many seniors are not filling their prescriptions or when they do they are taking one pill out of three however all across this country they are finding they simply cannot afford to take the drugs that their doctors tell them they have to take starting in my district of maine the first district of maine and extending all across this country the democratic staff of the committee on government reform has done a series of studies the first of those studies which i released in july of 1998 show this on average seniors pay twice as much for their medication as the drug companys best customers well who are the best customers they are hmos big hospitals and the federal government itself buying prescription drugs for medicaid recipients or for the veterans administration twice as much seniors pay twice as much as the drug companys best customers second a study first done in october of 1998 and now replicated around the country revealed that citizens in maine and across the country pay 72 percent more than canadians and 102 percent more than mexicans for the same drugs in the same quantities by the same manufacturer a third study that i released in november of 1999 showed that when drugs are manufactured for human use and sold to pharmacists the charges are on average 151 percent more than when the same drug is sold to veterinarians for animal use any way we look at it there is rampant price discrimination in this country against seniors and all of those other americans who do not have coverage for their prescription drugs the industry has engaged in this widespread price discrimination because frankly what they are trying to do is to charge whatever the market will bear so seniors who have no insurance for their pre scription drugs pay the highest prices in the land because they have no bargaining power as i said we have to do two things we have to stop price discrimination and we have to provide a universal prescription drug benefit under medicare as one can see from this chart to my right seniors are 12 percent of the population but they buy 33 percent of all prescription drugs 37 percent of all seniors have absolutely no coverage at all for prescription medications another 25 to 30 percent have very inadequate coverage for their medications so 60 percent or more are really struggling simply to take the medications that their doctors tell them they have to take now let us contrast the situation with the pharmaceutical industry the pharmaceutical industry is the most profitable industry in the country every year the fortune magazine shows which industries are the most profitable and every year by every measure it is the pharmaceutical industry just to give my colleagues one example in terms of return on revenues the pharmaceutical industry brings in 18 5 percent on average that is an average for those 10 or 12 pharmaceutical companies the next most profitable industry comes in at 13 2 percent a 40 percent plus difference in short it comes down to this the most profitable industry in the country is charging the highest prices in the world to those least able to afford it primarily our seniors who do not have prescription drug coverage under medicare we aim to change that in two ways the democrats tomorrow will begin a discharge petition to bring to this floor two bills h r 664 the prescription drug fairness for seniors act and h r 1495 which would provide a medicare prescription drug benefit here is what the prescription drug fairness for seniors act does this bill is very simple it would allow pharmacists to buy drugs for medicare beneficiaries at the best price given to the federal government remember we were talking about that price discrimination and this is the way to end price discrimination it would give senior citizens the benefit of the same discount received by hospitals big hmos and the federal government it does not involve any significant increase in government spending it creates no new bureaucracy i can tell my colleagues that the pharmaceutical industry does not want this to happen just as the pharmaceutical industry does not want a prescription drug benefit under medicare they will run tv ads saying they do but they have helped to fund a group called the citizens for better medicare which says seniors need a benefit but i can tell my colleagues the pharmaceutical industry is blocking every effort to improve medicare to strengthen medicare to make sure that our seniors get what they need which is coverage under medicare and a prescription drug benefit i found that in my district many seniors are confused when they get these citizens for better medicare mailings they think this is a group trying to improve our health care system trying to extend coverage but it is not the fact is it is a group that is funded by the pharmaceutical industry they ran all of those ads featuring f lo last year and now in some areas flo is back but over and over again the industry is the obstacle we really can support one of two groups one can line up with the pharmaceutical industry or one can line up with our seniors for h r 664 we have over 140 cosponsors in the house unfortunately not one republican has stepped forward not one republican will support this legislation to give a discount to seniors who are already in a federal health care plan called medicare which does not provide prescription drug coverage and all we are saying is give

figures showing that nearly one million additional americans were added to the ranks to the uninsured last year we must take steps to ensure that these americans have greater access to affordable health insurance there is no doubt that the managed care reform legislation that we are considering today will result in higher insurance premiums for americans there is significant difference of opinion about how much those premiums will go up will it be one percent three percent or ten percent study after study has indicated that with every one percent increase in insurance premiums 300 000 additional americans lose their insurance that is why i believe it is so critical that these issues be considered together h r 2990 will expand insurance options for uninsured americans i am particularly pleased that the bill provides a 100 percent deduction for health insurance premiums and longterm care premiums if the taxpayer pays more than 50 percent of the premiums this is long overdue for too long americans who pay for their health insurance out of their own pockets have not had the same opportunity to deduct these expenses as do large corporations this bill fixes that problem i am also pleased that the bill provides families with an additional exemption 2 750 if they care for an elderly family member in their home this is important in helping families who have made a decision to care for an elderly family member in their own home rather than placing them in an expensive longterm care facility association health plans ahps which are encouraged in this bill will play a critical role in helping those who work for small businesses have access to affordable insurance this is the largest segment of uninsured americans ahps enable small employers to pool together

services and patient control of health care expenditures it 1 allows both employers and employees to make contributions to msas 2 makes msas a permanent health care choice under the law 3 eliminates the cap on the number of taxpayers currently 750 000 that may benefit annually from msa contributions 4 reduces the minimum deducitble to 1 000 for individual coverage and 2 000 for families and 5 allows msa contributions equal to 100 percent of the deductible the bill also allows for the creation of healthmarts which are private voluntary and competitive health insurance supermarkets that transfer choice within the current employerbased health insurance market from small employers to their employees and dependents healthmarts are similar to the federal employee health benefits plan fehbp which gives federal employees greater choice among a host of different plans they will be established and run by private sector partnerships consisting of providers consumers small employers and insurers finally the bill permits community health organizations chos to offer health insurance coverage in a state in which they are not licensed under certain conditions this change is designed to

is a group of physicians who do not join a labor union but are concerned about hmo practices who want to get together and tell that hmo you know the contract that you are giving those employees for that company where it says medical necessity means the shortest least expensive or least intense level of care is just not right and together as a group we will not sign onto a health plan where you are treating one of your subscribers in that way or for instance when you have provisions in your contract that says first we have to phone you before we can even tell a patient about their treatment options i mean this affects reallife people and the ability of a physician to be an advocate for your patient this is a lady who was profiled in time magazine she had received a recommendation for treatment she lived in california the home state of my colleague she had received a recommendation for treatment from her hmo the hmo referred her to a medical center which i will not name and then put undue pressure on that medical center to deny her the treatment and not tell her all of her treatment options she died because of that practice this little girl and that little boy and her husband now no longer have a mother or a wife because of that but we have a situation now where if a group of physicians or nurses or pharmacists or other health care providers professionals wanted to get together to try to effect changes and to negotiate with an hmo to stop those kinds of practices unless they were salaried then they could be brought to court for an antitrust violation i just find that that is terribly terribly wrong and i know that this happens i know from practice that physicians are very very careful about sharing information of misadventures of other hmos for exactly this reason because if they get together and start talking about it sort of as a group even if it is done on an individual basis they decide i am not going to renew that contract then they could get hit with a big antitrust but the fact of the matter is that now they are not even given that choice in many examples anymore because of the concentration in the industry it may very well mean that they

for scheduled maintenance the usns kiluea is one of several unitedstates flagged navy vessels that transport ammunition to our surface fleet and recently the usns was stationed with unitedstates forces operating in and around the peacekeeping mission in east timor several weeks ago the navy and the military sealift command issued a far east request for proposal seeking bids for ship repair work on the usns kiluea to the surprise of no one the bid that won was a foreign shipyard because it can dramatically underbid unitedstates shipyards and so once again the unitedstates navy and msc is spending unitedstates tax dollars to repair american naval vessels with foreign workers in a foreign land incredibly it seems that the unitedstates military is bent on spending precious tax dollars in japan korea or singapore to keep their shipyards operating and their workers employed but will not lift a hand for unitedstates workers that is the outrageous facts many of these vessels are entitled unitedstates navy ships indeed at the rate that the navy is sending these jobs overseas if congress is not too careful and does not pay attention to this process these navy ships are going to have to be redesignated as republic of korea navy ships check this out the military sealift command in violation of an amendment to title 10 which i introduced requires that unitedstates naval vessels homeported in the united states must do their repair work their normal repair work not emergency work in unitedstates shipyards my amendment included guam under this and guam is part of the united states and the workers are unitedstates citizens and what my amendment asked was that the navy put those ships that are under their control and are homeported and many of these ships operate right out of guam they steam right by a unitedstates shipyard operated by americans staffed by americans and they bid out the work and these very ships go right past those workers up to a shipyard in south korea this is more than about dollars and cents this is about jobs the fact is that foreign shipyards can always beat unitedstates shipyards in terms of price for several reasons first foreign shipyards are in most cases subsidized second foreign shipyards do not pay their workers decent wages third foreign shipyards do not have to comply with health and safety work laws and environments finally some shipyards are in foreign countries that have had their currencies devalued compared to the dollar for all these reasons foreign shipyards arc cheaper than american but they are certainly not any better what we are up against is the navys insistence that through a series of ways of redefining where these ships are homeported they have been able to escape the full application and the spirit and intent of title 10 which is to take ships that are homeported in american ports make sure that their work is done in american shipyards their regular work what the navy has done through the

contrary that i myself will close them down because i will not include funding in my bill if indeed they are but they are not those are the real facts the only thing that we hear year after year is the atrocities that were committed decades ago by graduates of that school the unibomber went to harvard do we say we ought to close harvard down because the unibomber committed all the atrocities no we only say this each and every year about the school of americas the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and the secretary of defense has contacted us as late as today pleading with us telling us that this is indeed crucial to our own national security because tlhis is the only school where we can bring these new military leaders and military people to the united states and talk to them in spanish a language they can comprehend a language that they will be able to then go back and to express their concerns for human rights so this issue is decades old there is no change in the debate each year the congress has rejected this amendment to close down the school and i would urge the members of congress to take heed to what the secretary of defense tells us that what every chairman of every area of our military has communicated with us please do not take away this instrument of peace that we have in establishing an ability to bring these people to the united states and to teach them about democracy to teach them about human rights this bill only includes 2 million a very small amount of money for the amount of debate that has taken place on this for the last several years i would urge my colleagues to listen to the military experts to the professionals who have to run our military who will have to send our military to central america or to south america in the event of any uprising and we need this cooperative working relation ship with these people and we need indeed to instruct them in human rights and as well as the military and that was that we instruct them i
