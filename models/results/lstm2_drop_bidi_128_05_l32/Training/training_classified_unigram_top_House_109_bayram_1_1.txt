health care providers and lowincome working families 20 billion for health care services they vitally need while closing loopholes and fighting waste fraud and abuse is important there is no way it is going to save near that amount as our colleague from south dakota has forcefully stated a clear majority of the congress opposes these cuts and for good reason medicaid provides health care to 52 million lowincome children pregnant women parents and the elderly it is a critical source of acute and longterm care for 13 million elderly and disabled these are the people who would be affected by cutting billions out of medicaid since the president took office the number of uninsured has increased by 5 2 million medicaid enrollment grew by 6 million over the same period covering many people who would other wise have been uninsured even so medicaid costs have grown about half as fast as private health care insurance premiums between 2000 and 2003 medicaid per capita spending went up by 6 9 percent while private insurance premiums went up almost twice that amount 12 6 percent and the growth in costs we have seen as a result of the skyrocketing health costs this president has allowed not medicaid itself if these cuts in medicaid are made the ranks of the uninsured are surely going to increase even more weakening our economy and health care would be more expensive because of fewer regular checkups and preventative measures and a rise of emergency room procedures that is why the national governors association opposes these cuts it is why faithbased organizations across the board oppose these cuts organizations like the march of dimes the national association of childrens hospitals the americanacademy of pediatrics and the aarp all oppose these cuts that is why a majority of

oh it is just market forces supply and demand well you know there is no free market in oil from the production by the opec countries with the cooperation of mexico and russia where they conspire to restridt supply to the oil companies themselves who have dreated a black market that is a market where 75 percent of the oil is traded and retraded and retraded driving up the price for no good reason just to facilitate profits and then it is delivered to the refineries we see now that we have a refinery shortage well why do we have a refinery shortage actually that is pretty interesting ten years ago the american petroleum institute sent a memo to its members saying hey you are not making much money with refineries if you would facilitate the closing of refineries and squeeze down the availability of refinery capacity you could increase profits and then the r did in fact in the last decade through mergers and by action of individual corporations they have closed 55 refinbries in america now they want to blame the environmentalists and say there isnt enough refinery capacity those darn environmentalists guess what not one of the 55 refineries was closed because of environmental issues they were closed to increase profits the industry has become wildly profitable back in 2004 the refiners got 27 cents on each gallon of gas we bought last year they got 99 cents on each gallon of gas we bought four times higher that has nothing to do with supply and demand that is extortion of the american consumer the valero company now the biggest refiner in america their chief operating officer was asked about building more refineries apd said why would we want to do that we are doing very well the way thingsare the president claimed it was environmental restrictions still does and then the offered to allow any oil company to build a refinery on a closed military base with no environmental restrictions he had no takers it is working exactly the way the american petroleum institute predicted when they recommended the closing of refineries a decade ago now this administration says they are not going to go with the windfall profits tax despite the fact that exxonmobil last year had the largest profit of any corporation in history 36 billion in one year 10 million a day they were so awash in cash giving it back buying stock back giving out dividends and 400 million to their ceo who wasnt there very long it averaged out to a 135 000 pension a day for the time he worked at that company but there is no price gouging or profiteering going on here so the administration says no windfall profits tax they are going to look at gouging but they are not going to look into the corporate boardrooms they are going to go out and look at the corner gas stations that are getting record low margins as they are squeezed by this noncompetitive industry it is past time for congress to take definitive action first congress should subject the trading of oil to the same regulations as any other commodity wipe out the black market in oil where they are jacking up the price experts say that one simple step saying oil will be traded like every other commodity it will be regulated and overseen by the commodity futures trading commission something the bush administration doesnt want to do would drive down the price immediately by 25 cents by squeezing out the speculction impose a windfall profits tax on exxonmobil and others unless and except they use some of their obscene profits to build new refining capacity that could be exempt from the windfall profits tax give them a strong incentive to undo this little game they are playing on the american consumers make price gouging a fedetal crime right now you have to prove two companies colluded not just one set out to price gouge change the law and then opec remember the president told us he was goingto take on opec he was going to jump on opec he was going to do something about their

private accounts from the surplus of the social security trust fund this is the same trust fund that president bush said was nonexistent just a few months ago the president traveled with great fanfare to west virginia where he said there is no social security trust fund just a bunch of ious stacked in an old filing cabinet let me tell the members something that old filing cabinet was a new filing cabinet before it got 639 billion taken out of it and before the year is up it will be 800 billion that was taken out of the social security surplus used for anything but social security that is the problem and now it seems that the republicans in congress have come to a stalemate the president wants to privatize social security and cut benefits for the middle class the congressional republican leadership would rather avoid benefit cuts but they too want to privatize social security while the white house and congressional republicans struggle to decide which privatization plan they want to be for i suggest a totally different approach to social security save social security first the surplus should have been for social security it should always be for social security and my suggestion is on the 800 billion they already took out of it before they do anything else with some grand plan to cut benefits or privatize it pay back the 800 billion they took i worked in an administration where we cut taxes for the middle class balanced the budget and extended the life of the trust fund by 10 years why because we had an economic plan that worked it grew the economy it grew middleclass incomes it helped homeownership it reduced the poverty rate and we added 10 years to the life of the social security trust fund and we cut taxes for the middle class and we balanced the budget unlike the 2 trillion of additional debt we have added on to the books and on to the shoulders of our children but it requires leadership and priorities which is in short supply around here before we create any private accounts or do anything else to fundamentally alter the character and nature of social security jour task here is to strengthen social security for the future and guarantee its future and none of the plans none of the various privatization plans none of the ideas of benefit cuts or raising the age none of that adds to the solvency and the task here is to strengthen social security the american people have rejected the presidents plan they have rejected the congressional plan they have rejected anything to do with privatization because they know it is the wrong way i am going to tell the members something as a person who represents a lot of employees from united airlines folks like the security that comes with social security they have had it up to here with risk and all they are providing with privatization is more risk on top of more risk they have it in their health care they have it in their jobs they have it in their own retirement savings they do not need more risk and they like the foundation of security that comes with social security ask any steel worker any person who works for united airlines or the airlines industry who lost their pensions or the 14 000 people at hewlettpackard and they will say that privatization of social security is a nonstarter middleclass families are struggling they have flat wages a 55 percent increase in energy costs 10 percent increase in health care costs 11 percent increase in college costs and what are we suggesting putting more risk in their retirement plans public servants such as teachers police officers fire fighters are being pressed out of the housing market american families face more risk today not less and they do not want the risk they are selling with a savings rate at a historic low falling to just 1 percent last year we can pass the right legislation now to help people save for their retirement privatization stands in the way privatization of social security has become the poison pill to progress the truth is both republicans and democrats have good ideas on retirement sayings and we could take several steps right now to help americans save for their retirement outside of social security first congress should appoint a commission like in 1983 that said no to privatization and we developed a plan that saved social security for 75 years and in the meantime developed a bipartisan consensus on how to help americans save for their retirement i have a couple ideas on what to do first i have introduced legislation on the automatic enrollment into 401 k s so people are automatically enrolled in 401 k s my employees at rr donnelley did that a fortune 500 company and their participation of savings went from 62 to 92 percent of employees participating the wall street journal reported today that 21 percent of all companies have implemented automatic enrollment up from 14 percent last year this is good news but we can do more second at tax time when people are filling out their taxes allow direct deposit of tax refunds into the savings account once a year about 215 billion gets moved it should not be moved to consumption but to savings and if people pick 10 percent 50 percent 100 percent of their tax returns to go to savings we would add not only who saves but the amount of money that is saved in this country a report by the retirement security project of the brookings institute found that for every year 100 million people receive a federal income tax on average of 2 000 we can havetha t directly deposited into their savings accounts like companies do today and more and more americans will not only save for their retirement but more dollars will be added to savings third the retirement savings for working americans act of 2005 makes the savers credit so people who are earning 60 000 or less the first 2 000 that they save would be matched by 1 000 by the federal government it would help 50 million families with new incentives to saving fourth we should consolidate the confusing alphabet soup of 16 different savings plans into one portable pension the vast majority of americans have rejected the idea of privatization of social security by taking these steps we cdff boost savings outside of social security and provide americans with a real savings plan"], [0.9472310543060303, 0.9472310543060303, 0, "there ally believe

the military been much better equipped and supplied but also the republicancontrolled congress has been increasing veterans benefits in fact since republicans took control of congress there has been a 58 percent increase in veterans funding just as the vast cuts during the carter administration depleted and drained the strength of the unitedstates military during the 1990s the white house bragged of vast cuts in government when in fact the only true cuts were in military personnel as a result of those cuts during the 1990s george w bushs administration found itself just as president reagan had battling to rebuild military strength we in this republicancontrolled congress have done that and continue to do that along with some other friends if yesterdays speeches were heartfelt and there

has been in the making for years will finally be complete in june 2004 at my first dtv hearing since becoming chairman of the energy and commerce committee i announced that expediting the div transition would be a top priority i also noted that the 85percent loophole in current law is delaying the consumer benefits of digital television and preventing the clearing of broadcast spectrum for critical public safety and wireless broadband uses the dv legislation brings needed certainty to allow consumers broadcasters cable and satellite operatos manufacturers retailers and government to prepare for the end of the transition it includes a strong consumer education measure and it helps ensure that all consumers have continued access to broadcast programming regardless of whether they use analog or digital televisions or whether they watch television signals broadcast by a local station or subscribe to paytv were also here today to consider medicaid reforms medicaid is a victim of its own succeis the program has grown so expansive that it is unsustainable in its current form the nations governors understand the grim future of medicaid without reform they tell us that medicaid will begin to bankrupt the states unless some reasonable reforms are enacted they were democrats and they were republicans they came to us and told us what they needed done and we did it our proposal contains commonserse reforms and will help fix some of the flaws in the current medicaid program to ensure that it can continue to be the safety net that protects our nations most vulnerable citizens the reforms in this legislation include allowing states to charge basic copays to higher income beneficiaries reducing medicaid overpayment for drugs and providing states with the flexibility to tailor their benefit package to meet the specific health care needs of beneficiaries well also make it difficult for lawyers to hide assets so wealthy clients can pretend to be poor enough to qualify for medicaid coverage of nursing home services we were tasked in the budget resolution to reduce the growth of federal spending however these changes are the right thing to do regardless of the budget implications i recognize that some critics will argue that even the mostmodest reforms will hurt the poor i would submit to you that medicaid in its current form is already hurting the poor between 2002 and 2005 38 states reduced eligibility and 34 states reduced benefits this year hundreds of thousands of beneficiaries are losing medicaid eligibility or facing reduced benefits because of state action this committee will not stand by and do nothing while medicaid slowly collapses the reforms we are offering today will help to save the program while at the same time protecting the poorest of our society in fact most provisions in the legislation include additional protections forthe most vulnerable recipients such as children pregnant women the disabled the mentally ill and those in hospice care it is perplexing to me that so many who say they care the most want to do the least if you want medicaid patients to lose health care the best thing to do is nothing i want fairness and

24 25 freshmen on our side of the aisle and over the past 13 months we have grown a little weary with what we see as the amount of misinformation and disinformation that we so oftentimes see brought by the other side so we have developed what we call the official truth squad and so i am here to bring you some messages with some of my colleagues from the official truth squad which is an effort to try to embrace thd american dream to embrace the american vision and to present to the american people and our colleagues the story that congress is working in a positive manner that we are optimistic about the nations future in spite of some things that you hear from some of our friends on the other side of the aisle when i go home and i talk to constituents i oftentimes hear them say what is going on up there why all the negativity why all the pessimism why all the misinformation that we appear to hear all the time and i commiserate with them so this official truth squad is an attempt to try to bring some light to truth to some of the information that we believe the american people ought to have in contrast to some of the things that you have heard even here tonight i am pleased to hear the blue dogs present a proposal or two they talk about being fiscally conservative they talk about being fiscal hawks but my recollection is a little bit to the contrary of that there is a wonderful quote that i like from daniel patrick moynihan a former united states senator from new york democrat and he was such a cogent individual he was one of those individuals who worked for the truth regardless of where it led and he had this wonderful quote he said everyone is entitled to their own opinion but not their own facts everyone is entitled to their own opinion but not their own facts and i really think that that kind of crystallizes what we have heard in this chamber over the past few minites you have heard the other side talk about deficit spending and how we ought not be spending into the deficit and they are right they are right but when they had an opportunity to decrease spending by nearly 40 billion just a few short weeks ago not a single one of them not one of them voted for it a 39 8 billion decrease in spending and not a single one voted in favor of it you heard them talk about the alternative minimum tax and how it is an unjust tax and it needs to go away and they are right they are right a colleague of mine congressman english has a bill h r 1186 that would repeal the alternative minimum tax not a single democrat on that bill not a single cosponsor from that side of the aisle you hear them talk about the need to balance the budget and not spend so much money and they are right they are absolutely right but when the proposals are put on the table to do away with programs that are wasteful or do away with programs that have significant abuse where are they nowhere to be found so you are entitled to your own opinions but you are not entitled to your own facts and to crystallize that a little more because the disinformation that we heard over and over about budgetary cuts really does a disservice to the debate does a disservice to the discussion does a disservice to the american people because when you look at the numbers when you look at the truth that is not what is going on and this evening you have heard the other side talk

that was going to the military or decreased the amount of money going to veterans is that not what you would think that is what i would think if i heard that but here we have the defense department appropriation budgetary authority from congress from the year 2000 projected through 2007 in 2000 it was 287 billion in 2001 it was 303 billion that does not sound like a cut to me in 2002 328 billion that is real money that does not sound like a cut to me in 2003 365 billion remember down here in 2000 we were at 287 billion so these are the actual numbers fiscal year 2006 411 billion of budgetary authority for the department of de fense that is not a cut that is responsible spending on the part of the united states congress and i am proud of the support that we have given to our military and i am proud of the support that we continue to give to veterans you have heard this evening that veterans budgets were cut here are the numbers the actual numbers from 1984 through 2005 and i want to draw your attention to what has happened in the last 10 years in 1994 discretionary spending for veterans 17 2 billion 1995 17 6 billion 2005 30 7 billion i do not know what arithmetic they are using i do not know where they went to school but i do know that that is not a cut in anybodys book so when we get this kind of misinformation this kind of disinformation it does not contribute to the public debate it is not honest it is not truthful so the official truth squad is here to try to bring some truth to the situation this is veterans medical care and you heard it talked about this evening how we have these incredible cuts in medical care for veterans here are the numbers 1994 15 6 billibn 2005 29 9 billion that is not a cut it is anappropriate responsible move by congress to take care of those who are protecting our freedoms so remember what mr moynihan said you are welcome to your own opinions but you are not welcome to your own facts so i would like to highlight this evening what is called the politics of division that seems to be practiced by so many here in washington and it is disheartening and it does a disservice to all of us we are going to talk tonight in a positive way about america we are going to talk in a positive way about our future we are going to talk in a positive way about our founding fathers and about our history and about our heritage and jdst to identify the destruction of the politics of division that is so often practiced here i have got a quote from abraham lincoln that i would like to share with you and it is kind of his philosophy on the social fabric he said you cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift you cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong you cannot help the wage earner by pulling down the wage payer you cannot encourage the brotherhood of man by encouraging class hatred you cannot help the poor by destroying the rich you cannot keep out of trouble by spending more than you earn you cannot build character and courage by taking away mans initiative and independence you cannot help men permanently by doing for them what they could do for themselves the politics of division has no place in the public arena it does a disservice to our nation it does a disservice to the debate frankly it is an embarrassment for the individuals that practice it so i encourage all members of congress republican democrat all of my colleagues to go about our debates and the discussions that we have and the challenges that we face in this nation in a positive and honest and truthful manner then we can get to the right solutions as i mentioned the official truth squad comes almost every evening since we began the first of the year and talks about some positive aspects of america talks about the importance of honesty and truthfulness in the debate and tonight we are going to concentrate on our heritage our american heritage our wonderful american her itage e 2245 i have been joined by a number of colleagues tonight and they are going to share a story or two about maybe the founding fathers some heritage that we have i hope that what that will do is inspire some of our colleagues to remember the principles that brought our nation about and re member remember the ideals that we are bound to uphold with that i am honored to yield to my good friend louie gohmert from the great state of texas he is a judge by profession and is a member of the freshman class as well and has just a wealth of knowledge about american history and our heritage congressman gohmert please share a few words with us"], [0.34306327998638153, 0.15693672001361847, 0, "congress is once again using abusive litigation at the state level as a justification nationalizing tort law in this case the personal responsibility in food consumption act usurps state jurisdiction over lawsuits related to obesity against food manufacturers of course i share the outrage at the obesity lawsuits the idea that a fast food restaurant should be held legally liable because some of its customers over indulged in the restaurants products and thus are suffering from obesityrelated health problems is the latest blow to the ethos of personal responsibility that is fundamental in a free society after all mcdonaids does not force anyone to eat at its restaurants whether to make big macs or salads the staple of ones diet is totally up to the individual furthermore it is common knowledge that a diet centering on supersized cheeseburgers french fries and sugarfilled colas is not healthy therefore there is no rational basis for these suits some proponents of lawsuits claim that the fast food industry is preying on children but isnt making sure that children limit their consumption of fast foods the responsibility of parents not trial lawyers will trial lawyers next try to blame the manufacturers of cars that go above 65 miles per hour for speeding tickets congress bears some responsibility for the decline of personal responsibility that led to the obesity lawsuitg after all congress created the welfare state that popularized the notion that people should not bear the costs of their mistakes thanks to the welfare state too many americans believe they are entitled to pass the costs of their mistakes on to a third partysuch as the taxpayers or a corporation with deep pockets while i oppose the idea of holding food manufacturers responsible for their customers misuse of their products i cannot support addressing this problem by nationalizing tort law it is long past time for congress to recognize that not every problem requires a federal so lution this countrys founders recognized the genius of separating power among federal state and local governments as a means to maximize individual liberty and make go emmenf most responsive to those persons who might most responsibly influence it this separation of powers strictly limits the role of the federal government in dealing with civil liability matters and reserves jurisdiction over matters of civil tort such as food related negligence suits to the state legislatures finally i would remind the food industry that using unconstitutional federal powers to restrict state lawsuits makes it more likely those same powers will be used to impose additional federal control over the food industry despite these lawsuits the number one tbreat to business remains a federal government freed of its constitutional restraints after all the federal govemment imposes numerous taxes and regulations on the food industry often using the same phony proconsumer justifications used by the trial lawyers furthermore while small business such as fastfood franchises can move to another state to escape flawed state tax regulatory or legal policies they cannot as easily escape destructive federal regulations unconstitutional expansions of federal power no matter how just the cause may seem are not in the interests of the food industry or of lovers of liberty in conclusion while share the concern over the lawsuits against the food industry that inspired h r 554 this bill continues the disturbing trend of federalizing tort law enhancing the power of the federal government is in no way in the longterm interests of defenders of the free market and constitutional liberties therefore i must oppose this bill"]]}
