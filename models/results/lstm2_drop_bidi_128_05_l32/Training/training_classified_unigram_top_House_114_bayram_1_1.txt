puerto ricos debt crisis and how there must be a sense of urgency because without action bondholders will be paid but teachers cops and nurses wont i want to continue today and make two points number one lets not let bondholders bleed puerto rico at a discount number two lets work together on what unites us not what divides us because the only way we will make any progress is if the people of puerto rico come together to make a plan and demand that the congress of the united states work with puerto rico on puerto ricos plan without consistent and persistent pressure from puerto rico washington will do nothing as both the administration and the congress are content to let the bondholders on wall street call the tune we all know washington should start with h r 870 the bankruptcy bill it is simply a bill that will allow puerto rico to declare bankruptcy and restructure its debt within the unitedstates legal system this would allow an orderly and fair restructuring of the debt in a court of law it is an important step but will not solve all of puerto ricos problems what puerto rico should do right now is demand to know what wall street vulture capitalists are paying for the bonds we hear a report that the bonds are selling for 15 and 20 cents on the dollar yet the bond owners want a full dollars worth of interest i say puerto rico should pay interest based on the price the billionaires actually paid and that they should disclose this amount just as a congressman does in this congress every time we make an investment then puerto rico can service its debt based on what was paid to buy the debt i came here to protect people not the profits of billionaires on wall street secondly and most importantly for the time being we must set aside politics and get away from the smokescreen of the status issue in puerto rico whether puerto rico should be a state an independent nation or remain a commonwealth cannot be the priority right now before this congress if everyone leaves puerto ricoand they are leaving by 5 000 a monthit will not matter what kind of government is left behind nobody should use the current debt crisis as an opportunity to score political points for their party at a time when the people of puerto rico must be clear precise and unified the status issue divides puerto ricans i read in the new york times the argument of the resident commissioner of the statehood party that the only solution to puerto ricos problems is to make it a state really that is going to solve the debt crisis the power crisis the public employees pension gap crisis the medicare advantage budget crisis we should be working together to figure out how puerto rico is going to pay teachers and honor their pensions how we will make sure health care is delivered to all and bridges do not collapse a statehood bill is not going to provide housing create a job or heal a sick child when members of congress ask me about puerto rico they ask me which is it is it statehood do you want a bankruptcy bill do you want more medicaid we have to prioritize we have to be clear and put aside the status issue please we need to work together i would like to use my remaining minute to restate my call to action in spanish english translation of the statement made in spanish is as follows politics and divisions could destroy the chances of forcing washington to help resolve puerto ricos debt crisis puerto rico must have a common plan that has support across all of the parties and most importantly across the island the governor must find a way to work with the resident commissioner and the resident commissioner cannot view this crisis as a campaign tool for higher office puerto rico will only be helped by this congress if and when there is a consistent and persistent call on congress by puerto ricans to act and puerto ricans need to specify what they expect congress to do the bankruptcy bill is only part of it if we still have the jones act and the same economy and economic prospects as we have now we will not advance the people must tell wall street that puerto rico is not some store to be looted and that the puerto rican people will not sit and starve as wall street counts its profits if wall street is buying bonds at a discount they should be paid at a discount but most importantly we have to work together for the betterment of puerto rico and we cannot let political divisions over statehood divide us i commit to putting aside my own passionate feelings about puerto ricos status and working with other puerto ricans in the congress and other leaders in both parties who will help us but we must first come together begin helping ourselves and have a clear plan la politica y las divisiones podrian destruir las posibilidades de obligar a washington a ayudar a resolver la crisis de la deuda de puerto rico puerto rico debe de tener un plan comdin que cuente con el apoyo de todos los partidos y sobre todo a traves de la isla el gobernador debe encontrar una manera de trabajar con el comisionado residente y el comisionado residente no puede ver esta crisis como una herramienta en sus campanias para un puesto mis alto el congreso s6lo ayudari a puerto rico siempre y cuando haya un llamado constante y persistente de los puertorriquehos exigiendo que el congreso cumpla y los puertorriquehlos tienen que indicar lo que esperan de parte del congreso la legislaci6n de bancarrota es s6lo una parte pero si todavia tenemos la ley jones y la misma economia y perspectivas econ6micas que tenemos ahora no avanzaremos el pueblo debe decirle a wall street que puerto rico no es una tienda para ser pirateada y que el pueblo de puerto rico no esperari a morir de hambre mientras wall street cuenta sus ganancias si wall street esti comprando bonos con descuentos deben ser pagados con descuentos pero sobre todo tenemos que trabajar juntos por el bien de puerto rico y no podemos dejar que las divisiones politicas sobre la estadidad nos dividan me comprometo como siempre lo he hecho a poner a un lado mis propios sentimientos sobre el estatus de puerto rico y a trabajar con otros puertorriquefios en el congreso y

years by their pets and even babies kill parents and their siblings with guns too many people feel that more guns and fewer protections is the solution obscuring the fact that the overwhelming majority of the american public agrees that there are things we can do and that it is irresponsible and cynical not to try for more than 24 hours last week my democratic colleagues and i discussed many of these solutions on the floor of the house demanding action on three for instance over 90 percent of the american public and a majority of gun owners agreed that there should be no anonymous secret purchases of weapons there should be a universal background check people who cannot buy firearms at a gun store should not be able to buy guns over the internet or at gun shows anonymously the american public supports us in our efforts to make it harder for people the government has deemed too dangerous to buy a plane ticket to purchase assault weapons and it is past time to eliminate the outrageous prohibition against the centers for disease control to even study the epidemic of gun violence that kills three or four americans every hour these solutions are not really that hard they would be a signal that we are serious about trying to change the gun violence equation that kills about 90 people every day i returned to oregon last week and had encouraging meetings with dozens of

universal background checks like we are seeking at the federal level and the oregon house of representatives even passed legislation last session that would have closed the socalled charleston

chaffetz for his strong statement in support of h r 5233 the clarifying congressional intent in providing for dc home rule act of 2016 as we begin debate on this important bill i would like to first take the opportunity to reiterate that i firmly believe that the local budget autonomy act is indeed unlawful and null and void the home rule act clearly provides that the districts budget shall pass through the federal appropriations process preserving congress role in the passage of that budget however because of the precedent that allowing the district to usurp the congressional authority may set and the potential negative consequences that the district government employees may face for enforcing the local budget autonomy act i have introduced h r 5233 i would further say that my good friend the delegate from the district of columbia ms eleanor holmes norton indeed is a friend and i appreciate her passionate way that she always represents her constituency while we disagree on the debate and the merits of that debate i cant help but acknowledge my friendship with her and truly her passion for the people who she serves h r 5233 will repeal the local budget autonomy act and reinforce congress intended role in the budgetary process as many of you know congress was granted that exclusive legislative authority over the district in article 1 section 8 clause 17 this exclusive authority was explained further in the federalist 43 as being a crucial component in keeping the federal government free from potential influence by any state housing the governments seat there was a distinct worry that placing the seat of the federal government in a territory where congress was not the sole sovereign would indeed impact its integrity therefore the founding fathers saw fit to authorize congress to create the district and act as the sole legislative authority for the district as seen in federalist 43 the founding fathers believed that congress would delegate some of those exclusive authorities to the district specifically the power to deal with solely local matters in 1973 congress made a decision to enact such legislation when they passed the home rule act 1615 in that act congress provided the district with the authority to have the jurisdiction over legislative matters on a limited basis butand this is a critically important pointcongress reserved for itself and prohibited the district from altering the role of congress in the budgetary process there can be little doubt that congress intended to reserve that power for itself the language of the home rule act itself is clear both the former and the current attorney general for the district as well as the former mayor believe the local budget autonomy act to be unlawful and contrary to the home rule act mr irvin nathan the former attorney general testified before the house committee on oversight and government reform that numerous sections of the home rule act prohibit the districts action mr nathan who supports the policy as my good friend acknowledged who actually supports the policy of budget autonomy even stated that he believed the federal district courts opinion invalidating the local budget autonomy act was indeed a correct opinion beyond the clear language the legislative history makes it clear that congress had no intent to delegate to the district the authority for the budgetary process in fact mr jacques depuy who participated in the drafting of the home rule act itself made it clear in testimony before congress that indeed congress did not intend to delegate the appropriations powers to the district the legislative record of the home rule act supports mr depuy one such piece of the record is indeed the diggs letter which the chairman referenced earlier that was issued by chairman charles diggs the letter describes how it was clarifying the intent of congress by making several changes including reserving congress role in the budgetary process the diggs letter highlighted a pivotal aspect of the congressional intent in the home rule act it represents a compromise in response to the senates home rule act which actually included a form of budget autonomy the compromise does not indicate that congress intended to grant the district budget autonomy to the contrary what the diggs compromise represents is that there could be no home rule act absent an express reservation of the role of congress in the districts budget process i believe there can be no stronger statement that congress intended to reserve its appropriation role than the fact that the home rule act would have failed absent that reservation importantly both of these men mr irvin and mr depuy who support budget autonomy further believe that the districts action is illegal and therefore null and void i want to be clear on this we are not here today to make a power grab against the district as some would suggest we are here to uphold the rule of law at the committees hearing even the chairman of the council of the district of columbia was forced to acknowledge that it was clear that the majority of the members of congress who passed the home rule act intended to reserve the complete appropriations for congress again another individual who supports budget autonomy recognizes the intent of congress so in moving ahead with the local budget autonomy act the district government is usurping congressional authority and inaction would undermine not only this institution but all organs of government across this nation to suggest that any city councils action whether it be here in the district or in any other city in the country could unilaterally overturn the intent of congress would set a bad precedent regardless of the precedent however such action by local government is a blatant violation of the supremacy clause and therefore unconstitutional moreover as a result of the unlawful way in which the budget autonomy is purported to have been achieved district government employees are now at risk of the antideficiency act and the sanctions therein under the antideficiency act absent a congressional appropriation the district may not expend or obligate funds doing so will result in potential criminal or administrative penalties for not only the districts elected officials but the line level employees charged with purchasing items for the district the gao testified that they maintain that the local budget autonomy act violates the home rule act and the antideficiency act despite the superior courts decision h r 5233 would repeal the local budget autonomy act and prevent the district government employees from having to worry that the purchases they make on behalf of the district may indeed violate the law h r

californians without favoring any region of the state over another ask the bay area lawmakers who have expressed so much concern over sparking a water war where their water comes from you will find that their water comes from my district my colleagues districts in the valley as well as the sierras this bill advances planning of five surface water storage projects that would yield enough water for 9 6 million people projects that twothirds of californians voted to fund with state money just last year yet my disappointment here is that we have so many california legislators today and in the past that oppose anything we try to do to enhance the water supply and deliverability in the state of california what is more it isnt human water use that is negatively impacting listed species according to the national marine fisheries service and delta stewardship council 90 percent of endangered winterrun salmon are killed and eaten by invasive fish species before they even reach the delta the opposition despite all data to the contrary denies that invasive species are a part of the problem years of lawsuits aimed at reducing water use havent helped at all endangered salmon but this bill takes real steps to aid that population this bill takes action to reduce the populations of invasive species while opponents may claim this bill impacts commercial salmon fishing they wont say that the national marine fisheries service found that commercial ocean fishing reduces the remaining endangered winterrun chinook population by as much as 25 percent so there it is right there 92 5 percent of endangered winterrun chinook are killed by invasive species and commercial fishing outside of whatever happens in the delta 92 5 percent when opponents claim that this bill alters the endangered species act ask them to show you the language where it does so they cant show you that because it doesnt exist believe me if i could i would amend the endangered species act to be more effective actually in helping species as well as human needs in fact this bill enhances implementation of the esa by requiring improved population monitoring and invasive species management components that should be universally supportable lets put a stop to the halftruths and misleading rhetoric such as no hearings being held we had two hearings as well as hearings in the valley on this bill and

because we didnt hold the water when we had a chance to hold the water and keep the water and use it and spread it throughout the state of california in fact it is unfortunate to say because i dont

which would clarify the federal laws that govern the management of the striped bass fishery in the exclusive economic zone or the eez between montauk new york and block island rhode island one of the most pressing issues that is faced by long island fishermen is the urgent need to clarify the federal regulations regarding striped bass fishing in the small area of federally controlled waters between montauk point and block island between new york state waters which end 3 miles off of montauk point and the rhode island boundary which begins 3 miles off of block island there is a small area of federally controlled water that is considered part of the eez the eez which extends up to 200 miles from the coast are waters that are patrolled by the coast guard where the united states has exclusive jurisdiction over fisheries and other natural resources since 1990 striped bass fishing has been banned in the eez even though fishermen can currently fish for striped bass in adjacent state waters fishing is an industry in and around my district it is getting more and more difficult to survive in this industry if you are a businessowner fishermen are desperately pleading for commonsense relief and this is one way congress can help to my colleagues in this chamber i ask you to vote in favor of this bill passing this legislation on behalf of the amazing fishermen on the east end of long island long island striped bass fisherman have lost 60 percent of their traditional fishing grounds due to federal restrictions that my bill intends to reform additionally the geography of our

mean the difference between a nice day on the water and committing a federal offense my bill h r 3070 clarifies the federal laws currently governing the management of the striped bass fishery between montauk and block island permitting striped bass fishing in these waters and allowing for local regulations to manage this important fishery this legislation is a commonsense reform that offers a

drawing board rather than ramming through a partisan measure that will never become law we should go through our normal process of drafting legislation in a bipartisan way with input from both sides rather than advancing something that was put together without a single democrat having any input whatsoever as a result this bill does not have a single democratic cosponsor if we are going to pass legislation like this it only works if we do it in a bipartisan wayas americansnot as democrats or republicans we should come back here with a bipartisan bill that can actually move forward just as we

do act on the challenge of iran like chairman royce i oppose the iran deal but our side lost the debate the deal is in place now we need to make sure that iran is living up to its commitments under that deal that every word of the deal is enforced that we crack down on irans other bad behavior and that we take steps to shore up the security of israel and our other allies in the region that is the kind of bill i want to support and we can do it together this bill doesnt address any of the issues instead this bill would establish an impossible standard for the president the bill says that in order to remove a person or a company from the nuclear sanctions list the president would have to certify that the person or company never at any point engaged in sanctionable behavior including support for irans weapons of mass destruction programs well if they had never engaged in sanctionable behavior why would they be on the sanctions list in the first place it just doesnt make sense now this could be a drafting flaw or it could be just about embarrassing the president but it would make it impossible for the united states to meet its obligations under the jcpoa that worries me because rather than holding irans feet to the fire and strengthening oversight we seem to be going down the same path we have taken with the affordable care act sixtytwo times we voted to repeal it a couple of months ago we had a vote which essentially repeals the jcpoa and now we are doing it a second time will we do it 60 more times it is a waste of all of our time lets put our heads together and come up with a bipartisan bill that really works now 62 times to vote to repeal the affordable care act my opinion is those were symbolic votes because we knew the president would never repeal his own bill

their politics from the right to the left and everywhere in between but it was unanimous because we did it in a bipartisan way and it made sense it came to the floor and it passed by a vote of 4008
