manufacturing businesses in the global market from a statement by the national association of manufacturers it is clear that the btu tax would unilaterally increase the cost of unitedstates produced

administration keep coming to this house for more and more tax increases my phones in my district run off the hook every time the president suggests a new tax the eyes of the people are open they know they are already taxed too much they understand that every new tax adds to the deficit they know that these new taxes will not be used to reduce the deficit instead they will be spent on new wasteful spending programs when will we ever end this vicious cycle of tax and spend tax and spend tax and spend when will this congress actually vote to eliminate government waste and for real spending cuts this btu tax makes a mockery of all the promises this president made during his campaign he promised to stimulate small business he promised never to put a new tax burden on middleincome americans he promised to cut the deficit now we face the reality of the new administration the megadeficit will grow under current policies the american people are being laminated with tax increases social security tax increases income tax increases corporate tax increases excise tax increases value added taxes now the btu tax and we can only speculate on the cost of the coming health plan tax this economy cannot absorb all these new taxes the american taxpayer cannot afford all these new taxes no nation has ever taxed its way into prosperity how many americans know what a btu really is or how many millions of btus are in a gallon of gas this is the biggest energy tax increase in american history he is calling it a btu tax so that average americans are deceived confused into thinking this is a tax on someone else it is not the american consumer senior citizens smallbusiness owners middleclass workers and even the urban poor are the people who will pay the tab for the btu tax every time they fill up their car turn on a light or even cook their dinner those broad promises and pledges that mr clinton made to the middleincome taxpayer during his campaign have been forgotten i urge my

fire the subject of hurting wounding and killing our own allies our own men we had far too many incidents of friendly fire death in desert storm as a matter of fact it was such a high percentage25 percentit was shocking of the 146 killed in action 35 were friendly fire that means 111 were killed by combat operations and 35 by mistake now the reason i took this time tonight is because of a ghastly tragedy that has taken place in the northern nofly zone of iraq where american f15s the worlds greatest fighter i believe a flight of two shot down two united states uh60 blackhawks the worlds best and largest utility helicopter this aircraft serves in many many roles ranging from the coast guard and navy in what they call guard duty to pick up pilots out of the water along with kanan seasprite the seahawk is still being purchased by the navy it is also used as the mh60 by our special operations forces it is just an absolutely superb sikorski helicopter today 2 of them with 6 crewmen and at least 14 passengers including u n observers in the provide comfort zone the kurdish area north of the 36th parallel these 2 uh60 blackhawks were shot down by 2 unitedstates air force f15s the president has just had a press conference and said there were 26 killed i have called over to the pentagon for more information there isnt much available even to a member of congress who is on the intelligence committee and armed services committee the tapes the audio and possibly videotapes of the incident this horrible incident have been impounded for an investigation ordered by the white house the time the incident took place is 0730 zulu all flying time is predicated on that meridian that runs through greenwich england zulu time zulu time would be 3 30 here so this happened in the dead of night in washington at 3 30 eastern daylight time now let us move the daylight the loss of daylight across the world 3 30 here is 7 30 in england 8 30 in paris and rome 9 30 cairo and probably 10 30 out in the gulf so in midmorning over iraq a bright clear sunny day with what i am hearing not yet confirmed frqjm the pentagon the f15s were flyinf out of incirlik turkey assigned down from europe i was in incirlik the day the desert storm land war started and managed to get an observer ride on a texas kc135 that was refueling f15s on the first day of the war 24 february 1991 i was the only member of the senate or house in the gulf area when the war started so i know incirlik very well these f15s out of incirlik did not want to shoot down two of our own helicopters filled with people using the operational name provide comfort to help the besieged kurds in northern iraq this could be prevented some day soon by what is known as millimeter wave technology which is already developed in the longbow as in archery model of the ah64 apache and this is a battle i am having with the executive branch that i would hope you and every congressman on both sides of the aisle will help me in a crusadeto expedite the purchase as fast as we can of offtheshelf technology which will do something about this horror of friendly fire now this hill is already in a turmoil with all the subcommittee meetings on armed forces that i have been going to this month the truth is coming out that the president and the secretary of defense mr perry were not informed of the f16 strikes in bosnia a few days ago two sorties or the marine corps f18 strikes the next day which were delivered in bad weather you can see that on the audio tapes my son mark just called me i havent seen them yet on cnn you can hear the pilot grunting as he pulls gs you can see the dark river that the infrared camera shows up which actually separates the city of gorazde probably the drina river one of the planes went back to a field in italy with a hung bomb and two of the dropped bombs were duds one struck near the tank that they were trying to take out that was firing on u n military observers the unmos that are holed up in a bank in gorazde i found out yesterday they live in the vault in the bank the indignities going on that involve u n forces who are trying to stop this genocidal incestuous civil war that is still tearing apart the balkans are unbelievable sooner or later we are going to have a friendly fire incident there unless we get better command and control i spoke to 40 nato officers up to and including several 3star generals 1 4star general over at the hyatt regency today member of the nato warfare college i had to be the one to bring them the bad tidings of this story as it was first breaking the friendly fire story in iraq the theme of my remarks to them is that we must have a proper known and understood chain ofcommand and itmust be practiced over and over and over and that is why we cannot continue to gut our operations and maintenance money or to be stingy with money that involves identification friend or foe systems and the resistance i am getting from the pentagon because they are receiving such savage meat ax attacks is that they want to wait and delay all new friendly fire electronic technology because they are going to wait until the whole army is wired with stateoftheart turnofthecentury perfect realtime communications and digitization between every abrams tank every bradley fighting vehicle every light armored vehicle every single little bird mh6 gunship every special ops helicopter every fast moving f14 15 16 18 harrier and a10 we want everybody to talk to everyone all at once a billion dollars of new electronic technology and we want to save all of our dollars the pentagon tells me until we can get that done perfectly at the turn of the century that is garbage we have got to spend the money now for offtheshelf technology to save lives even if that system cannot be integrated later with whatever perfect electronic realtime system we come up with to integrate all of our combat systems together and the million and a half

am very pleased to join my colleagues in honoring this day i particularly want to thank the distinguished gentleman from florida mr biurakisi for his efforts in sponsoring the resolution this friday marks the 173d anniversary of the start of the revolution which freed the greek people from the ottoman empire greece remained under control of that empire for almost 400 yearsfrom the fall of constantinople in 1453 until the declaration of greek independence in 1821 for nearly four centuries the greek people were deprived of all civil rights schools and churches were closed down and christian and jewish boys were kidnaped and raised as moslems to serve the sultan contemporary american leaders such as james monroe and daniel webster recognized that the ideals of the american revolution those of individual liberty representative democracy and personal dignity were also the foundation for greeces declaration of independence americans quickly identified with the struggle of those greek patriots because they knew in their hearts that it was their struggle as well the united states and greece are now old friends and trusted allies our two nations and people are bound by interests values and a common political heritage the democracy that both of our nations cherish began in greece 1 000 years ago today greece is the only true democracy in the balkans but for the first time since the 1940 s that greek democracy and indeed perhaps the very greek independence that we are commemorating today is being threatened by a force that is threatening to undermine natons around the world that force is ultranationalism and its source is skopje last month the administration took the misguided step of extending diplomatic recognition to the regime that insists on calling itself the former yugoslav republic of macedonia shortly after that administration decision i introduced a resolution expressing the sense of congress that the president should not have granted such diplomatic recognition and should reconsider that decision most of my colleagues here today have become strong supporters of my resolution the decision to recognize fyrom was an insult to our ally greece and it played into the hands of the ultranationalists in the parliament of skopje these ultranationalists openly advocate a greater macedonia with its capital in skopje since 1945 they have mounted a propaganda campaign against greece claiming all of macedonia for the socalled macedonia people but there is no such separate ethnic group moreover skopje continues to reject greeces justified request to remove from its constitution a reference to a 1944 proclamation calling for the unification of neighboring territories in greece and bulgaria with this false macedonian republic the ultranationalists of skopje have the same objectives as their forefathers territorial access to the aegean sea through the greek port of salonika the united states has not yet formally established full diplomatic relations with skopje we still have the opportunity to utilize the leverage afforded to us by the possible establishment of such relations to dissuade skopje from pursuing policies and maintaining symbols which our close and vital ally greece rightly perceives as threatening i call on all of my colleagues to urge the presi dent to withhold the establishment of full diplomatic

issues facing congress today continued high deficits harm our nations economy we must work to keep the economy growing we must keep inflation under control interest rates low and investor confidence high to create new jobs my concern however is with the direction we are moving under the deficit reduction plan as proposed by president clinton under the best of circumstances this plan over 5 years would reduce the deficit by only one third of the estimated nearly 300 billion deficit today and thars with 275 billion in new taxes proposed in the plan this is even if the promised spending cuts in the future come to pass billions of promised cuts have fallen by the wayside over the past decade while the upfront tax increases are immediately enacted now with this budget we have the novelty of retroactive tax increases taking even more money out of the private sector will only increase the current lag in economic growth in addition contrary to claims that the presidents deficit reduction program will create jobs and grow the economy the plan is void of incentives to save invest or start up new businesses and saddles small businesses which are expected to create 75 percent of new jobs

tlmken co has endured a few strikes in its 90year history and the company has never exercised the option to replace any striking workers despite its rare use the possibility of strike replacements always plays a role at the bargaining table as a counterbalance to the unions threat to strike the result is that the vast majority of negotiations are resolved without a strike if congress enacted a

need a good costeffective intelligence system the question is really whether or not what we are doing today is costeffective there is another question which is put into perspective not only is the world not safe but america is not safe it is not safe to walk the streets in many places in america they could be made safer with more police something the president has promised and something that we have had difficulty reducing in our budget with this classified amount of money that we are cutting out of this budget my rough estimates are from my days as a county commissioner we could put 56 000 deputy sheriffs in patrol cars on the road fully armed and equipped for the same amount of money or urban police would probably be close to that number now of course the russians can take that number and they can quickly go back and check on my county budget and they can interpolate how much money we might be cutting out of the budget here and soon hey will know that we are cutting somewhere near 3 billion and america will be less safe because the russians know that we cut 3 billion out of this budget how much are we spending well i cannot tell you that it is classified what are we doing with the money are we fighting terrorism are we fighting the cold war are we fighting some other adversary well i cannot tell you that but we know that every single dollar in this classified budget is wellspent better spent than any other part of the government this is not like any other government undertaking or agency not a penny is wasted that is what our colleagues would have us believe i do not believe that i am from the government and i am here to protect you that is what we are talking about here today believe us and spend this amount of money do not make them make the tough choices i read one article that said we cannot possibly lay off the people in the intelligence agency that article was such an insult to the people in those agencies that they simply could not lay them off because they are also laden with secrets that one might become disgruntled upon losing his or her job and reveal some of those secrets i do not believe anybody in our intelligence agency would do that if they knew that for the good of those agencies and for the good of america and to cut the deficit they had lost their jobs just like my loggers are losing their jobs just like people who work in military bases are losing their jobs everybody across america has to give and give equally what possible solace could the russians or muammar qadhafi or saddam hussein take from knowing how much money we are spending why not reveal the baseline number what advantage could they gain what they would know is that we are spending more than their gross domestic product on our intelligence agencies i think they would be pretty depressed if they saw how much money we are spending in this budget because they would know they could never possibly match it if they spent every penny available to them to have their own counterintelligence services there is a lot of talk about the exsoviet union or russia the gentleman from vermont made the most telling point of the day i did not vote for a single penny for our exadversary russia or the soviet union and now many of our colleagues have voted to send them billions of dollars in aid are going to tell us we cannot cut a few billions of dollars out of this secret intelligence budget because of the threat presented to us by russia or the exsoviet union why are we sending them money if we still feel so threatened and if they are not so much of a threat why do we still need to spend so much money terrorist acts i think terrorism is the new threat to america and to world stability in many cases particularly with nuclear terrorism what percentage of the budget is spent on that how effectively is it spent there is not being effective oversight of that this is all being done in secret and secrecy does not lie well with a full democratic republic america could do better let us come level with the american people let us tell them how much money we have spent how much money we spent to win the cold war in overtaking the threat of the soviet union let us compare that to how much money we are spending today let us tell them how much money we are spending today let us at least lay out some of the categories of the budget and let people see some gross numbers and let our colleagues here make some decisions on whether or not it is well spent just like we do with every other budget in this body every other budget

consistently and as a result of the commitment i made when i was elected chairman of the unitedstates house of representatives committee on banking finance and urban affairs to report hitherto committees acting within their own parochial ambit seldom unless a bill comes up in general debate in the house from that particular committee seldom shares with others outside of the committee but i think that the issues are so grave and have been and are so ominous of such ominous shape as far as the future financial and economic independence of the american people is concerned that i have spoken today i would like to bring out and enlarge on what i have lately been relating as far as the federal reserve board is concerned there is no question that upon assuming a top deci sionmaking position at this federal reserve which is throughout the world the equivalent of a central bank or a country central bank there is no question when that person reaches that position he is entrusted with decisions that literally involve trillions of dollars each year and the fate or level thereof of such things as standard of living unemployment and franily at this point whether or not after the continental congresses and the confederation following the initial period of nationhood and finally the resolution with the first constitutional congress and resolution by the executive branch and the appointment of alexander hamilton as the secretary of the treasury the true independence and ability to regain fiscal integrity and thereby insure the independence from england or great britain today fate shows that time has turned full scope and our country believe it or not despite the boasts of it being the prime no 1 strongest richest only world power despite that we are confronted with a real crisis as to the worth or integrity of our currency that is our money that is what has been worrying me more than anything else and particularly since 1979 i have spoken on that by way of parentheses and it is all in the record it is not what i am saying now in looking backward but speaking from that record and as i have reviewed it i wish i had been wrong and i wished then that i would be wrong unfortunately that is not the case those decisions that will decide whether or not our currency will be debauched and therefore for the first time in our history obligated to pay a huge overhang of debt in somebody elses currency as i have said in my special orders to my colleagues repeatedly we are the only country in history that has ever been permitted or allowed or has indeed paid its debt in its own currency now that may not sound like much yet it means everything because it means that should our hallmark of value the dollar be replacedin effect it has to a certain extentbut fully replaced as the international currency reserve unit you can say that we have returned to the mercantile system where our country was dependent upon the european powers and great britain as well and never have removed itself from that umbilical cord from the mother country and that fate shows a little over 200 year after the beginning of this form of government the constitution which again by way of parentheses that we have been in trouble in the last three decades in direct proportion as we have strayed from that basic and fundamental law the constitution so we have created this organism organization with powers that at no time has any country given such an organization believe it or not except if we were to go back to the beginning when the constitution was adopted and in a world in which every country was governed either by kings saying that their sovereignty that is their source of power came from god or potentates czars or oligarchs selected and full of people that claim to be above mankind and unless they were chosen why there would be no answer to the problems confronting the countrys end the founding fathers of our country had the temerity in that world in which every country was governed by divine right to say nonsense and in the first preamble the first words of the constitution they spelled it out they said all sovereign power it doesnt come from a king it comes from the people so the first words in our preamble are we the people of the united states not the congress not the president not anybody else but we the people in order to form a more perfect union secure the blessings et cetera et cetera so we must come back to that because lately to say that up until recently why one would have been considered a communist if they said that the source of power came from the people and not from these big big oligarchical powerful plutocrats who know what is best for us so they say so here we are in this select group and these persons are privy to advanced knowledge of the orders to the new york federal reserve bank the trading desk they call it that buys or sells billions of dollars of securities each day more importantly unitedstates treasuries to have knowledge of the extension of billions of dollars in loans and credits also to foreign countries and to supervisors knowledge of the operations of most of the countrys commercial banks and all of the foreign banks operating in the united states is quite some power one could say this inside information becomes extremely valuable to outside individuals who could become instant millionaires if they get the information ahead of the crowd n6w the federal reserve board says it is above question it must be so completely independent that it is independent of the government and the people therefore it must claim infallibility that they would never do anything wrong but as i hive pointed out since 1979 1980 and 1981in fact before that time i have given cases in the record where through leaks indeed special interests two powerful banks in new york made millions of dollars by being able to get those leaks and after 4 years of insisting and being refused any kind of answers to the questions i raised then finally the chairman said well tell you what well do this is the chairman of our committee then why dont you chairman of the federal reserve why dont you answer this once and for all he said all right and they appointed an inhouse committee to investigate one year later i had to insist to find out what had become of the investigation well let me tell my colleagues what happened even though it is repetition because i put this in the record we went and hired a lawyer who also happened to be a lawyer for one of the two banks that profited improperly and finally they came out with a report and said no it wasnt a leak it was an accidental mistake that was made by a clerk and they let it go at that i was incensed i placed all of that including what they call a record in the record any of my colleagues interested in finding out about the infallibility of the federal reserve i welcome them asking where in the record they can find it and read it for themselves so i am sure that today i am not shocked but i think my colleagues would be as i learned that some top federal reserve decisionmakers soon after leaving the central bank and i mean almost immediately after leaving the central bank immediately sold a private client their access to privileged information for big bucks i was appalled at the march 24 1994 wall street journal report that wayne angell who had just left his position as one of the seven federal reserve governors was selling interestrate information at 100 per minute that is interestrate information for those gambling in the futures market on international interest rates and currency rates a wall street stock analyst said she talked to mr angell for 13 minutes and received a bill for 1 300 shortly thereafter on march 28 my staff contacted mr angell he made no secret and offered no apologies for the exorbitant fees he charges he justified the fees saying they are necessary if he is to discourage clients from asking for his insight on federal reserve monetary policies now this is certainly disingenuous and to me most disturbing and i think any reasonable minded person would tend to agree with me the former vice chairman of the federal reserves board of governors david mullins resigned in the middle of his term on february 14 1994 2 years before he would have ended on january 31 1996 to join several former salomon brothers inc executives in a new hedge fund venture now we had hearings on these socalled hedge funds very complicated yes sometimes aeliberately made to seem complicated but to me simply put they are gambling it is just a giarit casino that just happens to be out of las vegas what troubles me is that banks are going into that and i would not care if the banks are not insured but they are they are guaranteed by the taxpayers dollars and i think that it would be not only an act of misfeasance but a criminal action on my part were i not speak out but here we are mr mullins is going to get together with these traders and here are these people who are with the firm salomon brothers that got into that huge scandal in 1991 when it was charged with making 13 5 billion in false bids on what on treasury auctions between august 1989 and may 1991 causing the firm to exceed the 35 percent limitation on bidding salomon paid 290 million in fines but it took the treasury for 13 5 billion what a slap on the wrist and to compound matters the fellow who was supposed to have straightened it out for salomon quit last year and where did he go this is the fellow who was doing the investigation for the sec in this multibilliondollar scam on the treasury it was all done by these great panjandrums of finance security bankers and what happened he quit the sec last year and he went and got a fat highpaying job with whom with salomon brothers the firm that he was supposed to have investigated and gave the report about that led to the 290 million fine after the 13 5 billion robbery these are sad and distressing days we live in today my colleagues may think oh well its not our doing thats the fed i ask my colleagues do you think your citizens and mine believe that we haveno responsibility well sooner or later the day or reckoning will be here for i say to all of you beware of the patient when the patient loses his or her patience now governor mullins quit the fed and he now works with the former vice president of the firm and this one happened to be one of those who was responsible for all the fixed income trading this particular trader that mr mullins has gone in with was charged in the 1991 scandal without admitting or denying the charges of the securities and exchange commission but he also accepted the sec sanctions of paying a fine and he temporarily quit work in the securities industry he quit temporarily mr mullins resignation reduced the board of governors to five members the minimum number needed for crucial votes for direct loans during emergencies under the federal reserve act of 1913 all this makes one wonder if the fed is attracting decisionmakers who just view their position as a way station to lucrative private jobs the public interest is apparently not of paramount concern but should we be surprised at that what is the fed it is not a government agency elected by the people or even elected by the congress which is elected by the people they are a private corporation of which the stockholders are all banks not the government so who do you think bankers sitting as directors are going to be thinking when it comes to a push and shove the people or their pocketbooks and the interests of the banking community well i say if you believe it would be the people then i am sure you believe in the tooth fairy i believe that former employees should be barred from using any inside information that they have or from discussing any confidential informati6n just as other government agencies require of their former employees who possess exploitable or sensitive information the federal reserve has taken some steps to tighten security and to ensure that all americans receive information about monetary policy changesat the same time that is to a certain extent only after pressure and after being pushed and shoved and kicked and shouted at and just resisting every inch of the way finally they said well we will announce as soon as we can when we have made a decision on interest rates but they will not divulge their deliberations they will not say who was for what on that board why what are the reasons if that is not lack ofaccountability i just do not know the definition of the word but even this brief experience with what i call the american glasnost by the federal reserve has provedto be a success even this brief excursion into open fresh air has proven to be a success many people familiar with financial markets including professional traders have said that these announcements have allowed the markets to more rapidly discount new information reduce the volatility and substantially eliminate the leaks that frequently occurred when the federal reserve kept the formal announcements secret for 5 or 6 weeks and that was except when they wanted to leak it to their favorite media and they kept it for 5 or 6 weeks at least i have introduced what is known as h r 28 the federal reserve system accountability act of 1993 i intro duced it last year members might recall the strident rejections at our committees hearing on october 19 last year of my proposal for promptly accouncing monetary policy changes the feds governors and the presidents appeared before the house committee to discuss the provisions of h r 28 this last october chairman greenspan immediately gave us a warning and i am going to quote to my colleagues what he said immediate disclosure of the directive would change the nature of monetary policymaking and it would not be a change for the better clearly he was wrong and it must be admitted today the markets are better served by the new disclosure policy and monetary policy is transmitted more effectively i do not like the policy itself but the prompt announcement makes sense and works but the fed trembles at the thought of it and it did shake and tremble at the thought of this simple reform former chairman and vice president of the board of governors david w mullins jr submitted testimony in which he said the following before i arrived in washington i taught and conducted research in financial economics for over a decade many of my professional writings explored the estimable ability of financial market participants to absorb and interpret information and then reflect that knowledge in market prices from my experience the monetary policy process is open where it counts our actions matter not our deliberations it is our actions that affect interest rates and the economy and those actions are made public immediately changes in reserve conditions are transparent to the market by 11 30 on the day of the change in the open forum of the financial markets the current process works well that is what he said in october yes he could claim his years of academia of study essays and research and the credentials of a fine university at which he taught but when it came to advising congress that in this case the financial markets work best with less information he was not only wrong he was dead wrong former governor wayne angell to whom i referred awhile ago and who is now selling his advice at that enormous price per minute stated on balance the markets and the public are better served by more detail and more openness with delayed publication that is what he said in october naturally the federal opposed and it still does any greater detail or specificity even with the delayed publication of the socalled open market committee mr angell must believe early information has value and importance he certainly must believe that early information is valuable because why is he selling it at such a dear price now governor edward w kelley jr said i believe that the existent procedure for release of fomc decisions are responsible to the publics right to be informed last october he said this he was wrong he was wrong to testify that the publics right to know monetary policy changes can be properly delayed how could delayed information be responsive to anyones needs i could go on and quote and i will other governors who still are there like john p laware he was wrong and they all missed the point i could go on and include governor lawrence b lindsey who isstill there he was wrong in the statement he gave our committee so how could anyone argue then that more information promptly given provides no help to the public or the people all i can say is that george orwell would never have imaginedsuch a fantastic and contradictory world i could go on and mention the other governor susan m phillips she was wrong one of the presidents of the federal reserve bank of philadelphia edward j boehne the same thing he was wrong so therefore as we push on every inch of the way screaming and resisting the federal reserve we must pursue this for the sake of just the elementary wellbeing of the people of this country all i can say is that if we depend on these judgments that i have just placed in the record we are lost as far as this country is concerned and its future independence and freedom and without economic and financial freedom what do you have yes we will be as somebody said either equally all free or equally all slaves as it would be interpreted by some of the philosophy and belief and actions of these reflected in the minds of these powerful people who have been arrogated to a power never before given in any country it is claimed that we in the united states have relative freedom and autonomy for our central bank but in other countries even in the industrialized world no people have tolerated that grant of power over their destiny and wellbeing from germany to great britain to japan so that even through we can say that by speaking out consistently and it has taken several years i introduced h r 28 last year but for the 32 years that i have been on the committee on banking finance and urban affairs since i came here i have introduced and been introducing similar legislation of course it was considered so ridiculous in thebeginning or initial period that it was not until we entered this period here of the late eighties and nineties and began to face the inevitable that questions then bega n to be askedby others questions of a similar nature not with the insistence with which i have conducted it on a sustained basis for these 32 years but being on the committee and having the facts and the statistics and using my own ability to reason and conclude and figure out i felt apprehension even in the seventies and spoke out there was not much awareness of the crisis in 1968 when the socalled bretton woods arrangement was obviously not holding up but the people were not informed any more than they are being informed today as to the extent the nature the depth the gravity of this problem and danger confronting us i have always said that should we wait until a crisis is upon us then we are reacting to crisis and the best thinking is not there i have always subscribed to the belief of anticipatory action and thought anticipating what from deductions and calculations presently made one can conclude that certain things and events will happen therefore as long as the danger is not only there but clear and limpidly so then one must prepare but that is not what has prevailed in our country for the last 35 or 40 years perhaps a little bit longer than that going back to president franklin roosevelt still in my book that does not excuse one speaking forth if charged with knowledge the french philosopher and writer and in fact hero because he died in the first world war in the battle of the marne charles peguy said he who knows the truth and shouts it not from the rooftop is an accomplice with cheats and liars and frauds and i must speak out and say we are in mortal danger of our losing our financial and economic wellbeing faced by the loss of integrity stability and safety and soundness in our financial banking and other institutional life in the country"],

billion in this plan not by cutting benefits you should be fully aware but by extending 20 percent copays to the only two programs in medicare that do not require copayment that is lab tests and home health care we only do that by the way for those above the 150percent level of poverty and by asking highincome beneficiaries over 70 000 a year to pick up a little bit larger share of the subsidized premiums i guarantee you that any serious health care reform package will have copayments in its including the presidents package now let us look a little bit at the presidents package the clinton plan will cut 124 billion out of medicare not 35 billion as in our plan but 20 billion of this are the same cuts that are in the pennykasich plan lab tests and part b premiums both the only thing clinton does not address is home health care all medical care costs wherever they are are fungible that is the savings in one plan can be spent on additional things in another program all up and down the line that is the foundation of the clinton health care reform plan to say that we cannot pull anything out of this is absurd the clinton plan cuts medicare 124 billion medicaid 85 billion raises 90 billion of taxes it increases medicare expenditures by 131 billion medicaid and public health by 170 billion clinton health care plan savings medicare 124 m edicaid 65 tax hikes 90 expansion under

care does not go to the elderly it goes into disability programs the new programs for drug assistance and longterm care require full copayments and state mandates their criticism of pennykasich is disingenuous and hypocritical and if you believe their numbers after all is said and done they have a cushion of 45 billion built into the total 5year plan that claims deficit reduction of 58 billion so pennykasich does not cut away from any other program or other use of savings it simply identifies part of the savings and proposes deficit reduction and moves them slightly forward in time in the end if the clinton plan is adopted we would still have 58 billion in deficit reduction even with pennykasich pennykasich simply fixes some of it now and moves it forward into the current year to the

state of texas that is actually a little stronger than the one we are considering today we heard the same concerns from a lot of members from the other party about how it is going to hurt our voter registration and voter activity well i know that this last november election we had one of the highest turnouts in history in texas and i wish we could claim all of that from motorvoter i think it helped because we had an aggressive effort to register voters we do it at drivers license locations one of the oppositions we heard in texas was that it would slow down the drivers license lines that t not true because frankly we wait in lines already to renew our drivers licenses and we just encouraged people to register to vote for so many years we have been concerned about registration our politics are based on fear fear of what may happen and fear of what may happen but that is not what we need to be concerned about here i can use a good example from my own home state of how motorvoter has worked and it is working like a lot of other states will do and i think i would hope that the whole congress and not just the majority democrats would vote for this bill because our goal is to

office frankly doing some work with the television on tuned to the house floor and saw that this was happening and i just felt compelled to come down here unprepared as i am just for a few brief moments to speak about my friend gene chapple i met gene chappie when i went to the california legislature in 1976 and i can say without fear of contradiction that he was one of the best friends i had there in the legislature i am a democrat he was a republican but those things did not matter that much we sat together on committees as democrats and republicans together and i served on the agriculture committee together with him and we served on the water committee together and we generally shared the same interests i will never forget the man gene chappie there was a lot of talk there tonight about gene chappie being a republican but i remember him primarily as a man and a real man in the strongest sense of the word who believed above all in honesty and in keeping your word and in fact one of my fondest memories of a lesson in the assembly was one timeand i know my colleague congressman lewis who is here was there in those days and shares many of these memories with me as wellbut i will never forget there was a very important vote on the republican side of the aisle on leadership and a freshman republican i guess had voted against the way he had professed he would vote on that matter and a few days later on the floor of the assembly there was a crucial vote in which this republican member had a bill up and geno as we used to call him was up in his office listening to his squawk box he heard the vote was up and it was tied on the house floor he walked down to the floor late that night and they lifted the call and he cast his vote against the republican and i will never forget the republican coming over to geno and he said well why did you do that and gene said my friend and his cigar was in his mouth one thing you got to learn around here is how to keep your word and he taught lessons like that to people on both sides of the aisle at all times again some of my fondest memories of gene were in the social settings that we got together with him in sacramento often on these late night sessions as we invariably had we would find ourselves finding our way to genes office late at night where we would all sit around republicans and democrats together talking about what was going on on the floor and sharing stories and maybe easing some of the pain and also the tensions that we had in those days and gene was a great one at helping people to relieve tension again i do not think he cared so much about where you stood but that you stood for something and that you came from someplace solid inside of you when you made those decisions because he certainly did also i remember every year he used to sponsor a bus trip that we would take up to the auburn dam site and he would get all of the members who wanted to go to ride up there in that bus with him to take a look at that big hole in the ground that was sitting there and we would circumnavigate the dam site and then hear genes perspective on things and then we would go to a nice restaurant up in genes district for the rest of the evening he was dearly loved by everybody in the legislature and i know is as greatly missed out there as he is back here he brought the same type of character to this house the same type of commitment to the people that he represented and the same type of friendship with anyone who would look him in the eye and i am just proud to have spent some time with him and to have known him and to have considered him a dear friend of mine a person who i will miss very much and a person who i can honestly say taught me some things just watching the way that he operated the way he represented his people they way he stood up for his beliefs and the great sense of humor that he used in going about the very serious business of life that always made it much easier for everyone he was a man who loved the earth who loved the outdoors who was as was mentioned earlier someone who really loved to go around in jeeps and other vehicles in the mountains and had a real sensitivity towards the area that he represented and a real relationship on a human level with all of the people he represented democrats and republicans he was a true man of that district and a true californian in the great historical sense of great men in our state i loved him very much and like the rest of the people speaking tonight i am going to miss you gino"],

the needs of park visitors exist outside park boundaries or can feasibly be developed outside such boundaries by private enterprise such facilities should not be developed or expanded within the park there was not in the original bill neither the house bill nor was it in the bill of the gentleman from oklahoma we held no hearings on this particular paragraph let me point out that the words adequate facilities and needs of park visitors and outside of park boundaries how far outside can feasibly developed what is considered feasibly what american families want when they go to our national parks is lodging food camping boating swimming hiking rafting horseback riding the things that we have been gradually improving in our park services to facilitate the visits of american families which is what we now have in place i fear if this clause is left in this bill first we will wind up with a batch of lawsuits against the park service because every time the park service in the future wants to make some development within the park perimeters some group some person will then file an injunction against the park service and say it could feasibly be developed outside the park it could do this it could do that it does not meet the needs of the park visitors we would just wind up with endless lawsuits next we would if we had them immediately outside the park wind up with a junk yard of facilities lining the entrance into our national parks with no quality control any time any facility is built within the park service we have quality control we tell them what may be built what may not be built what may be used what may not be used what trail may be followed what trail may not be followed we would have no such control when we force all of these facilities outside the park we could not control them next what about the facilities people go into a national park comprised of many many square miles what do they have to do when they want to get refreshment or their kids want to take a swim or they want to go camping do they then have to journey clear back outside the park every day go outside and find some facilities where they are now provided in the park service the distances from the park entrance to desired areas i have been to yosemite yellowstone many of the parks the grand canyon where the park entrance is miles and miles from the facilities we go to we would have to therefore traverse all the way back to the park entrance for any facilities whatsoever i am afraid that this amendment is accomplishing what secretary babbitt said he would do i quote on my watch the park service will not build additional lodging facilities within parks on my watch the park service will not be in the road building business and so forth and so on if this amendment passes the park service will no longer be able to provide the american families with what they expect to find when they go to a national park they will force us totally out of the park system we talk about losing money for the park service we are going to make a lot of money for concessionaires on the outside there will not be a dime paid to the park service all the facilities will be built on the outside there will be no money for the federal government i think what this will eventually wind up doing is creating inaccessible wilderness areas for only those people who are physically able who want to endure long hikes and dangerous escapades like climbing mountains and so forth yes they will continue to go in but the american families will not be able to go in because what their kids want will not be within the parks they will be outside the park somewhere some far distance and we know not where i urge my colleagues to seriously consider what this last minute inclusion into the bill did before full committee it was never put in prior to that it was not in the senate bill no hearings have been held this was put in and the only thing i can say it would be totally antifamily we would not be able to take our kids to the national parks the way we have been in the past 40 years"], [0.01798832416534424, 0.5179883241653442, 1, "i would begin by responding that if we cannot be willing soldiers in the presidents effort to cut less important programs to make room for emerging priorities then we are not going to fare very well at any other level whether it is within your committee in dealing with fusion research in trying to reallocate that to a more beneficial purpose or whether it is within the agriculture committee as we attempt to perhaps modify our price support program or our foreign credit programs in deference to a smarter way of investing those dollars in our rural economy perhaps other policies or programs that have more to do with job creation and growth than the expenditures that are now a part of our farm policy i would say that if the president cannot succeed in winning from congress the cuts that he has requested there is precious little hope that we can take this a step forward and approach this issue in the committees of congress on that same basis i share with you enthusiasm for the report of the progressive policy institute in which they have recommended a cutandinvest strategy where they have a long list several hundred programs as well as some tax breaks some questionable tax breaks which they would cancel in favor of an investment strategy some of those savings from program cuts and tax benefit eliminations would go to reduce the deficit but some of that would then be transferred to the investment programs in research and in public infrastructure and in education which will build for a stronger future the president has begun in a very modest way to point us in that direction your committee has the challenge of doing that in the arena of scientific research and energy research my committee has the responsibility to do that for the health of our rural economy all of us have to take this cutandinvest attitude about our spending priorities in the years ahead both for the sake of the deficit and for the sake of the future growth of our nations economy if you do not mind could i touch on another topic as long as we have some time remaining this evening if the gentleman wants to distance himself from these remarks i would certainly understand his sentiments in that regard i want to talk a litte bit about the health care bill which is following an alltoofamiliar course through the hails of congress like so many issues in the past it is being handled in three separate committees each committee having total jurisdiction over the health care menu each committee likely to develop a different proposal it is redundant it is time consuming it is like lobbyist heaven because the interest groups will make a lot of money from their membership as they gin up the fear factor about what one committee or another might do it is going to keep us all terribly busy for the next several months but at the end of the day we are really going to be back to square one because it is likely we will have three separate plans developed by three separate committees none of which can command 218 votes a majority of support here on the house floor so we will have to then trade back and forth make amendments and try to meld at that point in time a middle ground approach to health care reform that garners the necessary support within congress to become the law of the land i have been greatly distressed by the approach that has been taken within this congress on this issue because to date in the committee hearings that have been held there is precious little pretense of bipartisanship at the subcommittee level in the committee on ways and means we have seen any number of close votes on important policy decisions like employer mandates and cigarette taxes you name it assume basically party line votes close votes party line votes i am convinced that we cannot pass health care reform without significant bipartisan support for those that do not talk washingtons language that means democrats and republicans voting for this bill in significant numbers i am a bit distressed that time and again leaders in my party including the white house the president and others in the administration pretend bipartisanship talk bipartisanship and yet they have prepared a very partisan bill a bill which upon introduction garnered support only from democrats no republican cosponsors and now a strategy on the part of the white house and within the congress that seems to be pushing this issue forward on a strictly party line basis that may be possible at the committee level it is not possible here on the house floor i am firmly convinced that we will not pass health care reform without meaningful participation from the republican caucus nor should we pass health care reform in a strictly partisan fashion there are some things that we have to accept going into this debate if we want republican support we probably have to negotiate if not back off entirely from this notion of employer mandates but it is not simply republicans that balk at the idea of a mandate of that sort any number of democrats in this congress fail to be convinced that a mandate is the best way to move toward universal coverage for all americans under a reasonable health care policy price controls when have they ever worked i think it is immensely difficult for us to get republican support for a bill that has government price controls one of their own president nixon attempted price controls not a terribly successful undertaking some 20 years ago it seems we should learn from past experience and not pretend that price controls can work today when they have never worked throughout our nations history deficit reduction can we actually save money with health care reform we all had better hope so because last year we did about as much as this congress is capable of doing in terms of cutting the defense budget we did about as much as the public will stand for in terms of tax increases even though primarily those increases only fell on the wealthy and now that we have a budget freeze on the discretionary programs we are beginning to see that we have to pick and choose within that tighter budget to take care of priorities while cutting lower priority items there is precious little we can do to further reduce the deficit if we do not cut entitlement spending significantly and the biggest chunk of the entitlement agenda is health care spending it is the fastest growing element in the entitlement budget growing at a double digit rate per year projected to increase perhaps 10 11 percent for medicare and medicaid costs in the coming year alone so deficit reduction has to be evident in health care reform or it is really a waste of our time to talk about it because without cost savings in our federal health care programs we will never see the end of government deficit spending yet there is no deficit reduction evident in the presidents health care plan in the first 5 years of their plan the congressional budget office indicates that they are 70 billion to 80 billion over budget and at the very best the rhetoric from the white house would lead us to believe that within the first 5 years they may be able to keep their program deficit neutral which means it will not increase the deficit but neither will it reduce the deficit we have to do better or we will have failed the american people on the critical question of whether we can rein in the costs of health care not only for the private sector but for the government as well because it is the part of our budget that is running away from us at a rapid rate a party vote for health care reform at the end of this legislative session would be a disaster for the country two hundred eighteen votes from democrats alone does not represent to the american public a serious and sincere effort to resolve this issue in the best interests of the country it will represent to them a fiercely partisan effort to do it our way and to reject any and all suggestions from the republicans as if they have nothing of worth to offer in this debate and that is ridiculous on its face to suggest that there is nothing to be offered by the republicans in the context of a health care debate that may be productive and useful and could become part of a meaningful health care reform plan i do not think speaking strictly as a democrat that we as a party want to go down the same path that we traveled oon the budget resolution and the budget reconciliation bill last year in which in the final analysis we passed it with only one vote to spare and the public was outraged because after a decade of deficit spending after voting for change in the white house after voting in numbers approaching 20 million for an independent candidate as a way of sending a message of revulsion to both the democrats and the republicans what they saw in washington last year was a strictly partisan shooting match in which the democrats pushed through their own version of a budget plan one that did buy us some nearterm relief on the deficit but one that does not offer any longterm solution to or deficit problem the public will not be impressed this year with a strictly partisan health care plan just as they were not impressed last year with a strictly partisan budget as yogi berra once said it is deja vu all over again and that is what the american public is going to say if they see this congress and this white house walk down a partisan path on health care reform the way we did on the 1993 budget as i said earlier the public will not trust a partisan health care reform initiative i come from the state of minnesota where we have a major health care reform program in place today it is controversial it has been to some degree disruptive not all of the players in the health care system are entirely satisfied with the impact of this reform on them and their livelihood or their comfort level but it has been generally accepted because it was passed in a bipartisan fashion by the state legislature a legislature controlled by democrats and signed into law by a republican governor in other words the political processreached a consensus and developed a plan that represented the best contributions of both parties and developed a plan that was somewhere within the mainstream of the electorate a plan they could understand and accept not a plan that frightened them and sent them into fits of rage and anger if we want health care reform to work the american public must accept it and their trust level rises only a couple of inches off the floor for either the democratic party or the republican party if we want them to have a higher level of trust for the product of our work we must demonstrate to them that leaders and members in both political parties are working together in the best interests of the country for a bipartisan health plan a bipartisan health plan will be more saleable among the electorate because based on the bipartisanship required to develop the plan the public will accept it as a plan that is not radical a plan that is not designed for partisan purposes a plan that is sensitive to various points of view because bipartisanship suggests to them that all points of view were heard history shows us quite clearly that monumental legislation landmark legislation throughout the years has always been approved with strong bipartisan support let us not break with history just because of some notion in todays washington because one party now controls both houses the house and senate and the white house and therefore one party has all of the answers the most important legislation in our nations history including domestic legislation in the 1930s in the 1950s and in the 1960s always enjoyed broad bipartisan support and we ought to follow that example on health care reform i am amazed after having said all of that that so many leaders in my own party at the national level seem to resist the obvious it is clear that there have been many signals in the past months to confirm that that senator dole is ready to deal on health care reform it is undeniable that senator moynihan the chairman of the finance committee has been publicly advocating a bipartisan approach to health care reform for some time now in the house the only proposal that has broad bipartisan support is the coopergrandy bill and yet that is the only proposal that seems to be on the enemies list as far as many of our democrat leaders and as far as the white house are concerned but we ought to respect the work and embrace the work of this bipartisan group rather than rejecting it as we have to date and there are many republicans like the 92 group i am not even sure they call themselves that any longer they would clearly want to be part of a serious health care reform effort they include members like nancy johnson who serves on one of the pertinent committees and steve gunderson of wisconsin these legislators and others would prefer to be part of a solution because they are serious legislators not partisan game players and i have to believe because i have worked with him now for 12 years i have to believe that minority leader bob michel would like nothing more in his final year in congress as he approaches retirement than to be able to be a part of something really important for the countrys future and that is a resolution of the inequities and the inadequacies of our current health care system so the evidence is obvious that bipartisanship is possible and it amazes me that our party is so resistant to these indications on the part of our republican colleagues that they are ready to come to the table again i would say bipartisanship is not only possible on this issue it is preferable stealing from yogi berra one last time when you come to the fork in the road take it we are at that fork in the road and the right path to follow is the path toward bipartisan health care reform"], [0.03796324133872986, 0.46203675866127014, 0, "this is language in which i have

out whether or not mr brown did take a 700 000 bribe and whether or not mr brown was going to get ultimately millions and maybe tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in royalties and so forth from the government of vietnam for removing the trade barriers or helping remove the trade barriers that have been in place against that government we believe those of us who have been involved in this investigation that even if mr brown does resign that the investigation should go forward because there is a cloud that hangs over the clinton administration because of the allegations now there is a grand jury investigation that has been taking place down in miami fl that will deal with mr brown and the possibility of his illegal actions but we have taken two steps to remove the trade barriers against vietnam even though we have not had an accounting a full accounting of the 2 200 powmias that are missing in that country and in southeast asia because of that that we have taken these twosteps to normalize relations and remove those trade barriers a lot of people have been asking the question did mr brown have undue influence on the administration even the president in getting him to remove these trade barriers or start taking those steps today a letter was sent to the attorney general asking her to appoint a special independent counsel the reason we sent this letter to the attorney general is because she said i believe quoted in the october 1 washington post if i appoint the person or select a person who is going to be the counsel you are still going to question the conflict of interest as long as i am involved in that process again she said for me to appoint somebody you will be asking well that person has a conflict too because you appointed them she said these conflicts might arise because she is a cabinetappointed officer as is mr brown in order to work with the attorney general in overcoming this dilemma a letter was sent today signed by the republican leader of the house the gentleman from illinois the republican whip of the house the gentleman from georgia the chairman of the republican conference the gentleman from texas the gentleman from illinois the chairman of the republican policy committee and myself the chairman of the republican study committee that listed not one not two but eight former attorneys general or members of the

ferguson mark hellerer dan reidy david rothenberg 1nd tony valukas responsible people who could be ap pointed to conduct this investigation and to be the independent counsel in the investigation we think it is absolutely essential regardless of whether or not mr brown resigns that we have a complete investigation in the congress as well as have the independent counsel appointed by the attorney general the reason we feel that way is because this administration will continue to have a cloud hanging over it until all the questions are answered i have sent numerous letters to the justice department letters to the national security council and letters to the president himself as well as mr brown asking for information in addition to that the gentleman from pennsylvania the ranking republican on the committee on government operations has sent a letter to the president asking for additional information on these allegations we believe all of those questions should be answered to the full satisfaction of the congress of the united states and we believe the investigation should be absolutely complete even if mr brown resigns so that the american people will know that they can have full confidence in president clinton and this administration and that there have been no deals cut with the government of vietnam in order to normalize relations if that is done then i think that the president will be able to continue being effective in his job as president of the united states however if this is not done i think this cloud will continue to hang over the administration and
