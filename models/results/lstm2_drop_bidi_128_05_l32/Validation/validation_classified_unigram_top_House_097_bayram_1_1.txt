proposal for massive increases in military spending over the next 5 years threatens the security of the entire world if approved by congress these proposals would destabilize our economy erode our defense alliances and accelerate the arms race the presidents defense budget is founded on the unrealistic assumption that an ever more powerful preemptive military force is the key to p secure defense this policy can only lead us toward war i believe that national security and world peace depend on economic strength nuclear disarmament and conventional arms limitations and cooperative international defense agreements the presidents program would undermine these objectives and thus threaten our real national security our nations armed forces must be fully equipped welltrained and thoroughly prepared and i would support a defense budget which would insure this but the presidents proposal greatly exceeds what is needed to maintain such a force he suggests funding for unreasonably expensive nuclear weapons programs such as the mx missile program for unreliable and unproven equipment such as the xm1 tank and for nuclear weapons that would increase the potential for a nuclear conflict such as the pershing and cruise ii missiles the presidents defense budget wastes badly needed federal revenue on a dangerous policy of military buildup the president hopes to more than double military expenditures from 173 9 billion in 1981 to 374 3 billion in 1986 a jump in defense allotments from 24 7 to 37 6 percent of the total federal budget in fiscal 1982 alone he plans a 15percent increase over 1981 to an estimated total obligational authority of 222 2 billion defense spending will be significantly higher still according to the congressional budget office which found the presidents inflation estimates for the 4 outyears to be low cbo determined that defense will cost 6 4 billion more in fiscal year 1982 that the president projects for 1986 defense spending would shoot up to at least 50 billion above the figure the president projects ceo estimates these unanticipated costs would have to be absorbed by the pentagon forcing cuts in programs the presidents proposals clearly exhibit poor economic planning increased dependence on the military budget will force inflation up rapidly and make it vitually impossible for our civilian economy to recover this impact will couple with the presidents proposed tax cuts to worsen our current economic instability i want to remind my colleagues that a similar policy of steeply increased military outlays together with unwillingness to raise tax rates during the vietnam war is primarily responsible for our current runaway inflation abroad the administration is urging out allies to adopt similar policies of expanded military might the presidents stated intention to embark on massive military stockpiling as well as the state departments growing pressure on allies to undertake simultaneous buildups already is beginning to strain unitedstates relations with several nations this policy is raising the risks involved in all international conflicts which might develop no matter how small the damage to our civilian economy which the presidents proposals would do poses a serious threat to national security by weakening the nations fiscal and economic role in the world under his plan we would be caught in a whirlpool of military spending that would drain our economy of its ability to provide social fiscal and military security if we are to be successful at bringing about an economic recovery we must reprogram some of these increases in defense spending toward human services an other civilian activities in the reagan military budget 75 percent of the planned defense increases above president carters proposals for 1982 are targeted for procurement of new weapons systems this would mean that a total of 68 5 billion will be committed to procurement contracts in fiscal year 1982 but much of that money will not actually be spent until 1984 or later when those contracts take effect this largescale lockup of funds will cause a sudden inflation jump by limiting available funds without producing consumable commodities a strong domestic economy cannot be achieved until the economy is made substantially less reliant on military expenditures military spending is a relatively poor stimulus for creating jobs and adds to inflation rather than helping to control it one billion dollars spent on mass transportation would create approximately 26 000 more jobs than the same amount spent on the mx missile system according to the council on economic priorities about the same advantage exists for money spent to create teaching jobs as compared to using it to generate military production this xegative effect of military outlays is worsened by the fact that many of the jobs generated by milltary spending are shortterm temporary positions that actually interfere with longterm resolution of our current employment problems the demands which largescale milltary spending put on competition for scarce resources such as highly skilled technicians and engineers and its upward impact on inflation will prevent the civilian sector from obtaining the resources it sorely needs for growth an artificial competitive advantage is created for militaryrelated industries in obtaining scarce resources by the dominant role pentagon expenditures play in our economy yet a disproportionately small quantity of commodities returns to our civilian economy military increases come at the cost of vital federal programs that serve basic human needs programs that feed people for example will be cut by almost 5 billion and funds for public service employment would be eliminated to save 4 8 billion the inequity of these budget priorities cannot be overlooked macroeconomic studies support the examnples i have given of how the presidents military budget proposals would undermine efforts to improve the economy the world bank and the unitedstates arms control agency for example compiled data which showed that steppedup military spending tends to weaken national economies the study compared the percent of gnp used for military purposes to the growth in manufacturing productivity in seven industrialized nations for the years 196077 those nations which used relatively large portions of their gnp for defense such as the united states generally had lowgrowth rates japan for example gave the lowest gnp percentage to defense ninetenths of 1 percent and had by far the highest annual growth rate 8 8 percent at the other end of the scale the united states put 7 6 percent of its gnp toward defense and had the second lowest growth rate at only 3 4 percent annually i believe the united states faces continued severe economic stagnation as a result of growing military spending historically the policy of the united states has been to develop cooperative defense strategies with ita allies to insure international and domestic security we currently are involved in some 29 formal agreements the nato alliance most prominent among them the nato alliance provides the democratic world with a significant margin of international security both in number of strategic weapons and in strategic planning capability nato countries outspent warsaw pact nations during the 1970s by 207 billion on military goods and possess 3 200 more strategic nuclear weapons a renewed commitment to natoprovided security by the united states and our european allies would create a cheaper and less dangerous world situation than would a unitedstates initiated worldwide arms buildup arms control measures and disarmanent agreements offer an important longterm approach to mutual security and international peace the salt 11 process brought us close to a reasonable check against further nuclear expansion this agreement should be ratified it is a necessary step toward disarmament although salt ii itself falls far short of real disarmament negotiations for reductions in european theater nuclear forces merit strong unitedstates support west german chancellor helmut schmidt recently proposed a freeze on the deployment of our europeanbased pershing 11 and cruise missiles pending negotiations for mutual reductions among nato and warsaw pact nations these missiles clearly increase the risk of a nuclear attack on europe both soviet and unitedstates officials already have give attention to a comprehensive test ban for nuclear weapons that would open a direct avenue to a nuclear weapons freeze negotiations on such a ban should be continued substantial reductions can be made in the presidents proposals for the military budget in five areas without weakening unitedstates defense funding for programs that increase our nuclear weapons stockpile those which simply generate repetitive weaponry weapons which the administration plans to produce even though testing on them is either incomplete or indicates significant problems the tremendously expensive mx missile system and generally the elimination of widespread waste in defense programs production of the trident submarine americas most expensive nuclear weapon in production at a projected 1982 cost of 1 6 billion is one of the unnecessary weapons in the presidents budget the tomahawk cruise maissile which threatens to undermine future arms control measures could be eliminated at a savings of 391 million for fiscal 1982 as well the european theater nuclear forces which i mentioned earlier are budgeted for 932 million for 1982 these missile systems would create a substantial offensive nuclear threat to the soviet union and further polarize the alreadytense european situation antiballistic missiles which would violate slt 1 could be eliminated and thus save 438 million without reducing unitedstates security there are several cases of repetitive weaponry in the current military budget these include the cx airlift planes which the administration plans to begin development of at~ a cost of 250 million for fiscal year 1982 even though the similar c5 transport is not yet fully operational due to production and operating problems f14 and f15 fighter planes which last year received a higher authorization from congress than the pentagon requested are scheduled to receive an additional 2 4 billion but these planes would provide no significant new cappbilities the extremely costly and controversial xm1 battle tank is prematurely budgeted for production at 2 billion in the reagan 1982 budget the reliability and durability of the xm1 was called into serious question both by a department of defense appointed panel of technical experts and by a gao study both investigations expressed doubt that the tank was ready for production the mx missile system is probably the greatest boondoggle of the military budget estimated for fiscal 1982 at 2 9 billion this controversial weapons system is likely to coast more than 100 billion before it is finished possibly as soon as 1986 military experts many citizens and several members of congress have questioned the feasibility and advisability of the proposed landbasing mode for the mx and no alternatives have yet been seriously explored yet the president is actively pursuing deployment of the mx of equally great concern is the direct threat the mx would create to soviet security forcing escalation of the arms race undermining arms limitation talks and substantially increasing world tensions if the president were truly interested in eliminating waste from the oovernmient no department deserves closer scrutiny than the defense department omb director david stockman recently told a congressional committee that pentagon waste was widespread but the administration has thus far avoidcd making cuts there several investigations documented waste in the pentagon in eight major areas one recent investigation of pentagon waste found that a minimum estimate of the cost of military waste is put at 15 billion a year the sources of waste are in many areas of the military and the problem clearly is pervasive needless purchases of goods already in stock performance of unnecessary operations and poor supervision contribute several billion dollars of waste of materials equipment and fuel one study found a complicated overlapping management system among the four branches of the armed services causes costly repetition of equipment maintenance base supervision and other services generating massive amounts of waste"], [0.01739180088043213, 0.9826081991195679, 1, "the major goal of american health policy since the rnid1960s has been the attainmient of equal access to health care that is access that does not differ because of income race or age differences between individuals however in the 1980s as the new administration begins to tackle the health care financing and delivery issues facing the unitedstates health care system concern will undoubtedly begin to focus on the relationship between federal health budget reductions and potential reduced access to medical care by the poor and elderly this may require the application of civil rights principles to the delivery of health services in the context of an ever changing political and economical environment consequently a new emphasis on civil rights as a mreans to protect health benefits may be needed to continue the public debate over equal access to medical care as a right for all americans even during a time of economic austerity the delivery of medical care in the united states through the use of expensive technology has fostered spiralling health care costs and the development of one of the largest service industries in the nation however access to medical care is limited for many americans with low incomes and who lack adequate health insurance protection during the past 15 years medical care for the poor and elderly has been subsidized primarily under the medicare and medicaid programs these programs help transfer a traditional welfare and charity arrangement of financing medical care into new attempts to mainstream medical care for the indigent populations this emphasis on making the availability of medical care more equitable has increased the purchasing power for the indigent and has helped to close the gap in health services and health status between black and white americans moreover recent attempts to expand the health care purchasing power of the poor along with removing discrimination barriers have been instrumental in assuring equity and accessibility in the delivery of medical care now this trend is being reexamined to reduce federal and state health expenditures and to develop more prudent methods of financing medical care for the poor the two major health care financing laws were created in 1965medicare and medicaid programsto help assure equal access to medical care for the elderly poor and disabled medicare established uniform hospitaland medical benefits which are administered as part of the social security program for all elderly persons regardless of income or place of residence now 16 years later despite the dramatic rise in public spending for health care the aged pay more out of pocket for health care than they did before medicare began the medicaid program was designed to aid and encourage the states to provide minimum health benefits for at least those individuals receiving federal income protection a ssistanceafce and ssi in 1975 many states began to liberalize entitlement and benefits for medicaid to individuals meeting specific categorical and income eligibility requirements the federal and state governments attempted to fulfill national expectations to make health cafe available to all even those unable to purchase private health insurance however runaway health care costs began to exceed public expenditures to meet this goal in 1978 states began to take measures to reduce expenditures under the medicaid program through lower fees to medical providers elimination of optional benefits and reducing the number of persons classified as medically needy for enrollment in the program the result of these policies was to reduced access to medical care for many of the poor as states began to restrict budget allocations for programs such as medicaid this required many indigent patients to rely on charity hospitals and other facilities that were funded by local government to obtain medical care thus many of the poor and elderly have been subjected to segregated facilities based upon inadequate purchasing power this time segregation was not on the basis of race but based upon low incomes and inadequate health insurance protection racial discrimination has been of fered as an explanation for racial differences in the utilization of nursing homes between blacks and whites many have concluded that racial dis crimination plays a major role in nursing home admission procedures this may also account for the low percentages and inadequacies of nursing home care used by blacks and other minor ities contrary to some reports these differences cannot be viewed based simply upon disparities in life expectancy between blacks and whites since recent mortality data identifies few differences between racial groups above the age 6f 70 1urthermore lower rates of nursing home usage among blacks cannot be attributable simply to more superior health status this stance is supported by recent data which suggest that therev is a higher incidence of disabilities amonir black elderly whicht may require institutionalization than among elderly whites for example the black elderly are more likely than elderly whites to reside as a part of an ex tended family living at home because they lack the resouirces tobe supported by nursing homes or other alterna tive living arrangements aside from racial discrimination economic limitations play a major rolein reduced nursing home utilization additionally nursing home beds are in short supply in many urban areas and blacks with limited and lower incomes have relatively fewer chances of obtaining admission consequently the black elderly are more likelyr thani white elderly to be institutionalized in settings other than nursing homes such as mental and chronic disease hospitals moreover reliance oni social security and medicaid for income and health insurance protection reduces their ability to receive quality nursing home and home health services a form of economic discrimination is thus created because many nursing homes are not willing to accept medicaid recipients it is well known that title vi of thel civil rights act prohibits discrimination violations on the basis of race color or national origin in any program or entity such as a hospital home health agency community health center and nursing home facility receiving federal assistance but relatively little is known about the application of this provision on eliminating access barriers to federal health benefit programs for the general population for example the de partment of health and human services office of civil rights ocr was involved in litigations during the l1970s over batterns of racial lsegregation among hospitals in new orleans la arid other urban areas similarly in 1978 ocr be came concerned about potential eases of discrimination against minorities die to reductions relocations l and closures of hospital facilities in urban communities currently we are not certain what position ocr will take under the new administrationto guarantee equal access to medical care for the poor elderly and handicapped citizens of this nation we can only hope that this office will continue its efforts to reduce barriers and practices of discrimination the primary cause of hospital closures facing many urban commnunities is the amount of care they provide to patients who cannot afford to pay for services and who lack adequate health insurance protection recent estimates in dicate that at least 200 hospitils closed during the 2month period between 1975 to 1977 this fact isl often related to the large numbers of individuals who lack medical insurance for example recent data has reported that over 23 million persons have no health insurance coverage in the united states and another 20 million have inadequate coverage many of these individuals are considered the working poor with incomes above state medicaid eligibility levels but are inadequate to purchase private health insurance or to pay directly for the medical care they need many of the poor and working poor would be eligible for medicaid if it were not for limited income eligibility requirements imposed by states these limitations on eligibility and scope of benefits contribute significantly to the gapq in coverage that exist among the medically indigent under the medicaid progran these gaps have become even wider in many states due to limited state expenditures to finance medicaid this requires many charity and public hospitals to provide expensive medical care free to individuals without health insurance in the past it was possible for private and voluntary hospitals to recoup a portion of their losses on services to uncovered patients by passing this lost on to privatepaying patients public general hospitals deficits for providing free care to a sizable number of their patients were usually subsidized by local governments now due to shrinking tax revenues for innercity areas many public general hospitals are in2 great financial distress since many local governments can no longer support them in a number of urban areas public hospitals which are the major sources of primary care and the only source of emergency and trauma services began to close moreover these closures have begun to be seen as a serious threat to reducing access to medical care for urban residents and viewed as a legittmate civil rights issue for example a recent study identified that the percentage of minority residents of the community around the hospital is directly related to the proportion of hospital closing or relocating from the area in neighborhoods 025 percent black in 1970 for example only 14 2 percent of the hospitals hadf closed or relocated between 1937 to 1977 but neighborhoods 70 to 100 percent black in 1970 fully 48 9 percent of hospitalsalmost half had disappeared other consequences of hospital closures include firstdeparture of the few remaining primary care physicians in private practice from the community surrounding the hospitals and second lost of health service employment opportunities for community residents these conditions have further reduced the effectiveness of the urban health care delivery system and to reduce assurance of equal access for many urban residents who have limited medical care purchasing power a number of cases now pending before ocr are designed to determine whether reductions in the availability of medical care due to hospital closures violate title vi since these actibns occur more readily in minority and poor communities many have viewed these closures as an act of racism cases involving homer 0 fhillips hospital in st louis mo and thenew york city health hospitals corp which have either closed or reduced health services in recent years are major litigation disputes for ocr the complaints allege that proposed reductions in medical services by hospital closures in predominantly black communities would reduce access to health care since few alternative health care resources were available contrary to earlier civil rights legal cases which involve hospitals and other health facilities practicing discrimination in the provision of medical care to minorities and handicapped individuals present cases have not gained national attention however as more hospitals and community health centers either close or reduce services due to recent federal health budget reductions we may expect future civil rights debates to be concerned with reduced access to federally funded health programs one major objective of title vi of the civil rights act in regard to the delivery of health services was to prevent minority patients who are seriously ill from being turned away from hospitals and community health centers legal disputes involving patients who were transferred from private to public hospitals or subjected to long delays for medical care are now being considered as a violation against federal civil rights statutes these problems of discrimination appear to be most frequent for blacks mexican americans asian immigrants a number of civil rights regulators have recently examined policies of proprietary hospitals that require patients to pay advance payments prior to receiving treatment and the diagnosis of illness in addition the failure of proprietary hospitals to inform patients of their free care obligations which they must assume in accepting hillburton funds can be considered an attempt to prevent poor patients from receiving equal access to medical care in private health facilities these examples of discrimination practices in the delivery of health care services may have to be rsolved within the context of civil rights protectionism civil rights in the delivery of medical care may gain prominence in the 1980s to assure equal access to medical care for the poor heightened public concerns about the relationship between federal budget cuts greater control by state governments and efforts to reduce access to medical care mpay be a concern of many black elderly yet the entrenched coalitions and ideological commitments to reduce inflation will continue to influence the debate on mainstream medical care for the poor and elderly we can only hope that concerns over whether blacks and other minorities are discriminated against by the private health system may be raised as a major public policy issue in this round of debate as in others that consider equal access to medical care the major issue will undoubtedly relate to an individuals ability to purchase medical care this argument is highly needed based upon recent attempts to reduce medicaid recipients freedom to choose health providers which may encourage the poor to receive substandard care in socalled medicaid mills ironically the governments new emphasis to convert categorical health programs into block grants to reduce medical care inflation has been opposed most vigorously by opponents that this will encourage states to reduce funding to urban health facilities that serve the minority poor conventional public opinion suggests that few solutions other than legal disputes are most likely to emerge during this period of federal budget reductions congressional leaders must understand the importance of federal health funds as a necessary ingredient to assure minorities and the poor equal access to medical care only in the event of strong and coordinated leadership committed to the ideas of civil rights and equal access to medical care can we expect that the poor and elderly will fare better during this decade"], [0.018261492252349854, 0.9817385077476501, 1, "the message today is that agriculture is in a depression not

on this agriculture day the crisis which is already as bad as the farm problems of the 1930s is now getting worse as in the 1930s when farm parity plummeted parity has dropped more than 30 points to 58 percent and is getting worse as in the 1930s when farm income plummeted to 12 billion farm income has declined 39 percent in the last 2 years while an additional 25 percent decline is forecast in 1982 to a nearly identical level while merely 30 years ago farm debt was only 12 billion it is now 180 billion8 times higher than net farm income and as in the 1930s when tens of thousands of farmers

of 24 billion a year to social security recipients a substantial part of the cuts come through a sharp reduction in benefits to those who retire at age 62 this is a particularly cruel cut since most early retirees are forced out of the market by poor health and layoffs in a sagging economy in some cases apparently early retirement has been locked into longterm collective bargaining agreements and

of affinity with him it does but not enough to dhminish by one whit the importance of anerican citizenship as i perceive it and i am not alone in perceiving ani rican citizenship as something not to be treated lightly that feeling has been shared by millions of americans our capitol building of which we are so proud was decorated in large part by a naturalized american citizen an italian immigrant named constantino brumidi those who know and love the capitol know and cherish the memory of brumidi brumidi spent most of his life painting the senate wing of the capitol the capitol dome and some other areas the most cherished thing in his life was his american citizenship one of his paintings is the feature of the members private dining room and is signed c brumidi artist citizen of the unitedstates lbrumidi regarded his american citizenship with the greatest of pride and with him i agree our history is replete with instances of fine people who did a great deal for our country yet to them we have not extended american citizenship the marquis de lafayette helped us achieve our independence 200 years ago in his case as in that of our founding fathers he pledged to america his life his fortune and his sacred honor yet we did not grant him american citizenship and then there was casimir pulaski who was also prominent in the american revolution did we extend him american citizenship how about those who have been awarded the congressional medal of honor the highest tangible award that our country can give which is awarded only for bravery above and heyond the call of duty i have been informed that not all of the more than 3 400 who received this medal were american citizens have we conveyed american citizenship upon them i experienced a feeling of pride that mr wallenberg devised a safe conduct passport to make it possible for those whom he helped to escape from hitlers terror it was a remarkable procedure though not without precedent history remembers that during the years immediately after world war i thirty yearsbefore wallenberg another scandinavian the great fridtjof nansen of norway devised a similar passport known historically as the nansen passport to enable many victims of the turkish genocide of the armenian people to escape from the middle east and emigrate to other areas including the united states where many of them today are american citizens some of the cider refugees from that first holocaust have shown me with pride their nansen passports to america we have not made fridtjof nansen an american citizen in the argument favoring the granting of citizenship in this case it was recalled that the united states once granted honorary american citizenship to winston churchill that in fact was the one and only situation in which an honorary american citizenship has ever been granted the importance and intensity of mr churchills relationship to the united states during the period of world war 11 is common kiiowledge and if anyone ever earned honorary citizenship it would have been churchill also churchilli mother was an american citizen which is a significant added factor and in addition he had consented to receiving the honor despite those facts if i had been here in the congress at that time i would not have voted for his honorary citizenship the history of world war ii and its aftermath is filled with the stories of heroic actions by people guided by humanitarian principles we should commend them we should revere them we should remember them and their deeds and we should try to emulate them but that does not mean that we must give away american citizenship to those people i am sure that mr wallenberg was proud of his swedish citizenship as all of us are proud of our american citizenship and i also believe that mr wallenberg did not have need of an additional honorary citizenship to make himself whole any more than any of us feel the need for an honorary citizenship in some foreign land that is true of patriotic people everywhere i do not take away in any respect from raoul wallenberg for the fine and courageous work be did in enabling many to escape from the death camps of adolph hitler his courage his heroic actions are beyond dispute his career and his qualifications are not the issue here the question is whether american citizenship should be granted in recognition so far as we know mr wallenberg has never been in the united states he has never done anything specifically for the united states he has never asked for american citizenship we do not know whether he would want this honor we do not even know if he is alive i cannot believe that we should convey the highest honor that america can convey upon a person under those circumstances finally i feel that there are some things in life which are beyond giving atway it is my view that there are some things which we in the congress simply have nio right to give away and one of those is american citizenship american citizenship is a status which belongs to american citizens everywhere it is not our property to be given away for reasons of emotional and political gratification it is unique the patrimony of the american people and something for us to hold in trust my conscience tells me that i must not and cannot vote for this bill and for that reason i will not vote for it there are some items of

good your intellectual arguments no 196 billion in 1982 matter how good your bureaucracies under president reagan however no matter how eloquent your statewe dramatically increased from 172 6 ments to armed services committees billion in 1980 to 193 9 billion in 1981 if you cannot win on the battlefield to a proposed 222 2 billion in 1982 to nothing else matters 238 4 1billion in 1983 anid so on it is it was said best by winston churthe largest increase in defense spend chill who warned us in the gather ing in peacetime since the late thirties ing storm quoting from a speech he why did president reaganbelieve had made in 1934 that wars come we need that increase because the quickly that you cannot be certain president and his advisers believe that when they wfi happen that one day the world is dangerous because they suddenly an ambaisador comes he de believe that the soviet military build livers a message and the following day up is a threat your countries are at war the battlefield is more than just this front or that front this division or that division the battlefield is the heart and mind of the nation the strategy the general conditions in which the political leadership makes decisions harry summers in an excellent book on vietnam entitled on strategythe vietnam war in context colonel summers currently an active officer in the army teaching at the carlisle war college begins his book with a quote you know you never defeated us on the battlefield said the american colonel the north vietnamese colonel pondered this remark a moment and said that may be so but it is also irrelevant conversation in hanoi april i1075 the north vietnamese won that war on the battlefield of our minds on the battlefield of our budgets on the battlefield of our foreign policy even if they never won that war on the battlefield around saigon so long as ameri can troops were present currently we face a crisis because we are losing a war on the battlefield of the pentagon just as surely as we are losing a war potentially on the battlefields of europe or the middle east president reagan attempted to shift the quantitative side of defense spending he attempted to increase dramatically our commitment to a sound defense secretary weinberger has done i think an excellent job at the strategic level of forcing the military bureaucracies to think again and again about the mx mobile basing system und ar secretary carlucci has done a superb job of forcing fundamental thinking about procurement policy within the context of the pentagon in some recent votes on authorization bills we have changed some of the laws to allow thepentagon to spend more wisely but on balance the reagan administration has not done the job it needs to and as a consequence we are today at the beginning of our first retreat from what was a brief 6month surge of defense spending 1 there are three reasons we are retreating first the russians have not invaded poland the world seems less dangerous and shooting down twolibyan jets felt good it gave the american people the sense that we showed them second the wave of spending c uts on the civilian side has not been matched by equal toughness in defense spending there is not a sense thatwe are as willing to grill the generalsaswe are to grill the civilian bureaucracies while i praise secretary weinberger and under secretary carlucci for thei r initiatives i have to fault them for their lack of flair their lack of publicity to too great an extent cap the knife is in danger of becoming cap thie advocate and should that happen i fear he will lose his effectiveness in convincing the american people that we will question amilitary bureaucracy as tightly as a civilian bureaucracy the third and deeper reason that the reagan administration is steadily losing ground in the congress and i think ultimately in the news media in the country on the issue of defense spending is because the dry rot of the pentagon bureaucracy remains unchallenged you can take every quote by president reagan about bureaucracy in general every quote about its waste its silliness its lack of direction and you can apply them to the pentagon the reality is that the pentagon is the largest most sophisticated bureaucracy in this city that for last 38 years they have systematically and steadily developed an ability to do less and less while spending more and more with greater and greater complexity here are some recent examples the desert one tragedy in iran led to no firings no resignations no courts of inquiry when the british in the 18th century lost majorca they executed the admiral who failed in this country on all too many occasions in recent years we have promoted the senior of cer who failed on cost overruns to the best of my knowledge there have been no major firings of the military leaders directly involved in spending large chunks of money in effect whatever happens on the battlefield or in the building project the game goes on in many cases the officer who had the overrun ends up working for the company he had the overrun with simply throwing more money at obsolete ideas and absurd structure does not solve anything in the long run it may in fact weaken things both by crippling those of us who favor a strong defense and also by leading some people to believe we are actually beig saved while all we are being is wasteful the challenge i would raise is much deeper than anything we have seen this year if the administration thinks the defense threat the danger of war is important enough to spend this amount of money on then it ought to be willing to fundamentally reform the pentagon bureaucracy we need elihu root not henri maginot as secretary of defense we need a willingness to fundamentally restructure things for those who remain faithful to the vision of military bureaucratic compei tence let me suggest the following facts should at least lead them to question their faith first i have asked this of every officer i have seen recently there is no major war we can win with the soviets period let me repeat that there is no major war we can win against the soviets period second we nowfocus on buying high technology in a narrow formula that prevents us from using the high technology we spend so much money on for example we buy the f15 h 61 19 fighter aircraft a superb aircraft clearly one of the two finest airsuperiority fighters in the world the other being the f14 we buy it with enormously complex and expensive elec tronic gear so it can fight in what is called a forceonforce conflict that is with many aircraft in the air at one time yet in testimony before the senate appropriations committee on the department of defense appropriations for 1981 general russ said about the third level which is force on forcei so i would say that 95 percent of our people are at level 1 maybe 50 are at level 2 and a few are at level 3 what that means is that you are buying extraordinarily expensive aircraft which you are not flying the pilots in long enough to use the aircraft at its current capability so that 50 percent of your pilots are using the plane as though it were a dramatically cheaper oneonone fighter plane another 40 percent or so are using the aircraft as though it is a slightly superior oneontwo or oneonthree airplane and probably 10 percent of your fighter pilots are sufficiently qualified to use the airplane for the purpose you paid for it is like using a cadillac as a dump truck and it is done because the air force is focused on procuring hardware rather than on building a balanced force that has enough money tonfy the airplane to train the pilots to buy the munitions and to maintain the entire system we have to develop a total equation of research and development procurement maintenance training in order to measure full systems against each other third we are buying an allhightechnology force in a way that is historically absurd the reality is that high technology limits size and a 4 lord nelson warne4 us numbers annihilate it is important to remember that when the german army invaded russia in 1941 there were only 24 armored divisions the rest of that army was infantry with horsedrawn logistics the israelis in 1973 were still using world war ii supersherman tanks when necessary we simply cannot buy enough f15s f16s and a10s to equip all of our regular forces and all of our reserves but the professional military bureaucracys answer is to blame the politicians and the people that is candidly a copout wellington had to fight the peninsular war with the army he had not the army he dreamed of midway was won in what walter lord called an incredible victory with the navy available not the navy admiral spruance wanted the current military bureaucracy buys what it wants and shrugs off the gaps in procurement and training as someone elses fault that is simply fundamentally professionally wrong it is like buying a new car and having h 6150 go no money to buy gas to drive it home the syrians in the golan heights in 1973 lost over 100 tanks simply because they ran out of gasoline the japanese suffered extremely high aircraft losses in the mariana turkey shoot of 1944 because they could not train the pilots the first operational jet fighter of germany the me 262 could not achieve its peak effectiveness because of the lack of aviation fuel in germany in 1944 and 1945 the american military bureaucracy is actually planning in the purchasing patterns we see to create the probable fiascos of the future for our own military to spend the money in such a manner that you cannot finish the entire process that fancy weapons systems exist that cannot be used is simply irresponsible example we have a long war structure for the army that is capable not of fighting a short war but fighting only a skirmish literally incapable of fighting even a war the length of yom kippur"],

in to a forreign power and thereby subjugating unitedstates interests to israeli interests i am dismayed by the allegations that israel is acting the prima donna and is opposing the sale because of some sort of vainglorious conceit because these totally erroneous assumptions are being touted daily as absolute verities it might be well for us to pause and consider why one of our staunchest allis is opposed to the sale and why it is not in our national interest to erode the defensibility of a partner upon whom we can rely with almost absolute certainty the tragic events in egypt should forcefully bring home to us the fragility of the situation in the mideast and how very much worse our position would be without israel a rock of dependability and continuity in the midst of a shifting sea of political undercurrents and sudden storms what kind of threat do the awacs combined with the f15 package pose to the state of israel gen george keegan former chief of air force intelligence has characterized it as the most powerful offensive weapons systems ever developed for theater or regional air warfare simply put awacs have an offensive potential because they can be used to detect any possible movement by israeli planes should the arabs try to move enormous numbers of tanks across jordan and through the west bank to cut israel in half general keegan in testimony before the senate armed services committee and the house foreign operations subcommittee cited intelligence reports of meetings among saudi arabia syria and iraq to discuss the options which remained open after the failure of the 1973 war there was agreement that the assaults through the sinai had not worked and i quote there was only one tactical resource or option left that was to move 5 to 15 arab tank divisions through jordan at night in a onenight secret march and insert them through the west bank and then drive them through the smile narrows of israel to the mediterranean what is the military possibility of success again from general keegan any professional military officer who has been in the west bank 0 understands that two armored brigades could cut israel in two in one night and there is no defense against such a measure how could the awacs facilitate such a move the awacs would remain somewhere along the eastern jordanian border and because it is also a jet it can turn away at a range of 100 to 150 miales and evade almost any counterattacking force the israeli defense against a tank attack through the west bank relys heavily on lowflying fighter bombers general keegan summarizes the scenerlo well the significance here of the p15 is that it has a lookdown shootdown radar weapon capability that challenges even that of the awacs the f15s in a matter of 7 minutes from a forward base in saudi arabia can be over the west bank at altitudes of 40 000 to 50 000 feet where their extraordinary radar capability can spot the israeli fighterbombers with ease and from that position of great height advantage proceed to fire the aim 9l missiles to defeat the israeli counterattack to a country that depends ultimately on the superiority of their air force for survival being placed in that sort of jeopardy has to be awesomely frightening it is important to remember that twothird s of the israeli population and more than onehalf of its industry is squeezed into a small corridor that is never more than 8 to 10 miles wide think about it try to imagine what it would be like to live in such a country there is constant pressure fromi the outside world for the israelis to give up the west bank and to return to the 1949 ceasefire lines that would be like sitting in los angeles and having your potential enemy sitting in beverly hills or santa monica and the only place to retreat is the pacific ocean keep in mind that that potential enemy is backed by the massively equipped armies of half a dozen countries and supported by 15 other countries imagine too that you are outnumbered by at least 50 to 1 in population imagine that your revenues come from what youproduce on your farms and what your technicians create and produce and yet a crushing burden of defense

have not had to fight a foreign invasion of our land since 1812 it is no wonder we sometimes have difficulty comprehending the nature of the threat the israelis have to live with every single day of their lives imagine what it would be like to live in a country where every fourth or fifth person is a refugee from hitler where his neighbor is a refugee from stalin or other communist leaders where another neighbor may have fled from persecution in arab lands where violent death is not some distant threat but where it is no exaggeration to say that every single 15erson has been touched by it in some way where almost an entire population has been exposed to the horrors of combat what must it be like to live in a country that had to fight for its very existence when five arab armies invaded

eligible under the expanded interstate 3r4r program the reduction in the interstate completion category corresponds directly with the expanded interstate 3r4r program this newly defined category will fund projects for interstate resurfacing restoring rehabilitation and reconstruction work items no longer eligible for funding under the interstate completion category will be eligible for funding under the interstate 4r1 category the federal share for both interstate construction and interstate 4r1 will be 90 percent the redefinition of interstate cornpletion and the new 4r1 program closely parallel the amendment offered by the distinguished gentleman from pennsylvania during the markup of h r 3210 before the subcommittee on surface transportation last may the ranking minority member of the subcommittee deserves our recognition and commendation for the lead role he exercised in promoting a redefinition of the interstate program this year his efforts are chiefly responsible for transforming a simple 1year authorization bill into a significant piece of legislation the combined funding level for the interstate programs has been increased for fiscal year 1982 from 3 6 billion to 4 025 billion in addition the interstate 411 category has been authorized for a second year at a level of 800 million during the floor debate on h r 3210 this past september several members expressed concern about the proposed elimination of the half percent minimum setaside for smaller states the amendment under consideration retains the provision guaranteeing that every state will receive at least onehalt of 1 percent of the interstate of the interstate construction funds as was pointed out by our colleagues from delaware vermont new hampshire north dakota south dakota maine nebraska and wyoming the elimination of the half per cent minimum would have denied these states more than half of the interstate money they had been receiving and for which they were preferred to be rising in support of a multiyear highway bill a position taken by our senate colleagues i believe a consensus has been reached supportive of at least immediate needs of our nations highway program by reducing costs to complete the interstate system to a more achievable objective and by expanding our interstate restoration efforts to help begin the task of insuring that our nations most costly transportation investment is adequately protected even the staunchest supporters of multiyear legislation agree that it is better to make the changes in the definition of interstate completion and begin the interstate 4r1 program than to allow projects to be obligated during fiscal year 1982 that would be ineligible under the new defi nition this amendment to h r 3210 satisfies those objectives this amendment represents a true compromise witoi regard to the interstate highway system components both this chamber and the senate redefine interstate completion to reduce the costtocomplete estimate by some 15 to 17 billion while both the senate and house versions were similar certain elements of the interstate program would have been eligible under one version but not the other in an effort to resolve these differences the two redefinitions have been merged to insure that any project eligible under one of the redefinitions would still be eligible under the redefinition contained in this amendment this merging has been completed and the result is a cost estimate reduced from more than 53 billion to one in the range of 38 billion the new interstate completion definition would permit up to six lanes per designated interstate highway in rural areas and urban areas up to 400 000 population and up to eight lanes per designated interstate highways in areas of 400 000 population and above those lane limitations would not include high occupancy vehicle lanes the thrust behind the new definition would be to make interstate construction funds available only to construct interstate segments to a minimum level of acceptable service consisting of full access control and a pavement assigned to accommodate traffic anticipated for the next 20 years work no longer fundable under the redefinition planning for fiscal years 1982 and 1983 and these reductions in interstate construction funds would not have been offset by increases and interstate 4r1 funds under our original bill in several instances these states have completed their interstate systems and have major interstate restoration needs the amendment under consideration cures that defect also included in our amendment is a provision which will provide full federal funding for rebuilding the woodrow wilson bridge that carries interstate 95 over the potomac river during the floor debate on h r 3210 our colleagues mrs halt of maryland and mr wolf and mr paris of virginia ably described the exigent circumstances that existed on this federallyowned bridge on the interstate highway system the provision in this amendment would permit federal interstate funds to be expended to rehabilitate the bridge at its current lane capacity by the federal government however to insure that appropriate agreements are reached between the three jurisdictions that most significantly benefit from the woodrow wilson bridge namely the commonwealth of virginia the district of columbia and the state of maryland no moneys may be obligated until the secretary of transportation is assured that the three jurisdictions have executed agreements to insure the bridges continued viability we would strongly urge the secretary to encourage the three jurisdictions to expeditiously reach an agreement for the transfer of ownership away from the federal government i would like to take this opportunity to commend governor dalton from the commonwealth of virginia and governor hughes from the state of maryland for calling this serious problem to the attention of the congress and for their outstanding leadership in the area of transportation in addition to the interstate changes the amendment to h r 3210 contains a few other significant provisions a section has been included which gives the secretary of transportation the needed authority to waive technical compliance with federal requirements in the acquistion of certain real property in connection with the highway project in santa rosa calif under this provision the state of california would be permitted to use a portion of its federalaid apportionment to reimburse the city of santa rosa for costs already incurred by the city in connection with the federalaid project which meets federal standards this provision rights a misunderstanding that has existed for several years and does not involve any additional money to be expended from the federalaid highway system i have had conversations with the distinguished ranking member of the subcommittee on surface transportation the gentleman from pennsylvania mr shusm and agree with him that the interstate redefinition changes and projects of national significance are too important not to resolve immediately and therefore cannot be delayed until we take up multiyear highway legislation during the next session however i want the gentleman from pennsylvania to know that i share his concern that funds may not currently be distributed in a way to direct dollars to where they are most needed or could be most effectively used in maintaining a national highway network i know the gentleman is examining new bases for distributig interstate 411 funds i will be most supportive of considering formula changes next year to achieve a more equitable distribution i am also aware of mr sinisters concerns about unitedstates route 522 in huntingdon county pa this situation sounds to me like the type of project that priority primary funds was intended to address i believe the designation of this project as a priority primary route should be given favorable consideration during our deliberations next session on multiyear highway legislation finally the amcndment to h r 3210 contains a provision of national significance n6t related to the interstatb highway system in the surface transportation act of 1978 we included a provision for the construction of a bypass highway that would reroute traffic around the redwood national park we thought at that time that we had provided both the necessary funds and authority to construct the project i would like to direct my colleagues attention to section 12 of the compromise bill this section deals with a matter which has been and continues to be of major iportance to the congress briefly stated section 12 does two things first subsection a of section 12 provides an additional authorization of 55 million for the redwood bypass highway project bringing the total amount authorized to 105 million and second subsection b of section 12 assures that the redwood bypass highway project will provide the economic stimulus and the infrastructure improvement which congress intended to help offset at least partially the loss of employment and economic activity associated with expansion of the redwood national park as i am sure my colleagues remember in enacting section 152 of the federalaid highway act of 1978 and section 101 a 5 of the redwood national park expansion act of 1978 congress provided for the construction of a bypass highway around the redwood national park in order to divert motor vehicle traffic around the park so as to best serve the needs of the traveling public while preserving the natural beauty of the park the congress regarded this project as unique a fact clearly reflected in the priority treatment accorded the project in the federalaid highway act of 1978 and the redwood national park expansion act of 1978 this priority reflects the need for the project long recognized by the congress in terms of mobility and safety for the traveling public access to the park preservation of its environmental values and both economic stimulus and infrastructure improvement to help offset partially the loss of employment and economic activity associated with expansion of the redwood national park section 12 of the compromise bill before us today addresses two problems which have arisen since the project was authorized in 1978 the first problem deals with the cost of the project the california department of transportation has estimated that the construction costs of the preferred alternative taking into account inflation would be 102 million in 1986 costs since congress authorized only 50 million in the federalaid highway act of 1978 an additional autborization is necessary in order to remedy this situation subsection a of section 12 of the compromise bill authorizes an additional 55 million~ in contract authority for the redwood bypass highway project bringing the total amount authorized to 105 million this amount should be sufficient to cover the federal share of the entire cost of the project"], [0.9831278324127197, 0.9831278324127197, 0, "shall the house recede and concur with the other body on a massive complex thousandpage bill to raise taxes or not

way to raise 98 billion over the next 3 years is to set aside the constitution and the rules of the house and the prerogatives of the ways and means committee and instead defer to the judgment of

and its enacting clause are the only part of this bill to originate in the house of representatives article i section 7 of the unitedstates qonstitution to the contrary notwithstanding none of the provisions relating to revenues not one is a part of any bill reported to the house by the committee on ways and means not one what is more or perhaps i should say what is less the house not only did not originate this tax bill but we have not even reviewed it studied it considered amendments or modified it in any way in the house or in the committee charged with jurisdiction to which dor some reason the senate bill sporting the purloined house number was referred most of the public debate so far has dealt with the broad general issues of public policy and revenue aggregates very little has focused on the specific provisions of the billand for good reason after all how can any news or editorial account deal with more than three or four issues at a time there are over a hundred important changes in the tax code scattered through nearly700 pages of this bill the outlines available until today could not describe all the ramifications of these hundred provisions most members are aware of the issue of withholding on dividends and interest but few know that the same will apply to pension benefits in the rush to rescue the former no care was exercised on behalf of the latter as for failure of some to report such income and pay taxes on it all that was required was to impose stricter reporting requirements with triplicate 1099 forms to be attached to your federal and state tax returns just like your w2 that would have garnered half the revenue of this provision beyond that withholding is another way to take money directly out of the savings pool is that going to strengthen our economy another provision which directly damages the business recovery is the doubling of the unemployment tax levied on employers this is not needed to finance the extra weeks of benefits for that is covered by another tax on unemployment benefits but small businesses and other employers in laborintensive industries like our textiles will be severely damaged by doubling the tax it is another higher fixed cost which must be pai even when you are unprofitable no wonder the national federation of independent business is against this bill 7 to 1 because of this one measure there is another provision though that is even worse for them and their employees that is the package of changes to severely restrict pension funds the senate bill was more modest dealing only with limiting the tax benefits for very highincome individuals and limiting the amount they could borrow from their own pension fund the conference report went much further it will seriously impact 92 percent of all 600 000 pension plans in this country it will terminate an estimated onethird of them that is worse than erisa those that survive will have to file extensive amendments and reports at a cost of 2 5 billion that is probably the worst achievement of the bill then there is the severe erosion of the recently enacted accelerated de predation incentives the biggest change is the cancellation of changes now scheduled for 1986 and 1987 raising 28 billion in those 2 years alone ironically if that is an adequate word this major change will produce dhly 1 billion in the 3 years of the budget resolution to which this tax bill is a response this will levy 20 billion a year in the outyears in order to boost the first 3 years collections by a mere 1 percent no wonder the business community is unhappy with this bill this gives them unappreciated deceleration instead next on my list is the doubled excise tax on cigarettes this was done we are told to avoid levying any similar tax increase on whiskey wine beer or even cigars all these were exempted one product was singled out as the fall guy dont tax you dont tax me go tax the fellow behind that tree yet instead of a 100percent tax increase on cigarettes alone just a 25percent increase spread over the whole group of products would have afforded the same revenue at a lighter burden on any one no wonder those of us in the southeastern tobacco states are opposed to this unfair provision we have been told by house conferees that they did not need our votes for this bill that we were isolated and that we would stay that way another unheralded but damaging provision is that dealing with completed contract accounting the intent is fair to tax the earlyyear profits on a multiyear contract the gentleman from south carolina pointed out that it would be unfair to require such a contractor who had not yet been paid to have to borrow money to pay the tax on earnings not yet received he was right his amendment to correct this was disregarded then there is the unhappy insurance industry lured at first to endorse a tax of 1 billion on their business they helped design a way to do it without disrupting the competitive balance between stock companies and mutual companies this bill overreaches that mark and does disrupt that balance yet they gamely support the bill for fear they will be treated worse if they do not my colleagues these are not trivial little parts of this tax bill these seven provisions make up 38 billion worth or about 40 percent of the 98 billion total there are other features that should have had closer attention the grease payments have already been mentioned the compliance features have some merit but how will you feel if your tax accountant is obligated to flag your return for an audit for aiy deduction that was previously routine and unchallenged by irs but for which there yet is no revenue ruling surely there should have been some hearings on these and other measures

of which may determine whether we continue on our present course or whether we begin to move toward resumption of negotiations on freezing and reducing strategic arms we have heard a lot in recent weeks about the impracticality of a nuclear freeze as one method to minimize the peril of a nuclear exchange critics charge that a freeze will allow the soviets to retain their nuclear advantage and that a freeze is not verifiable they add that agreeing to a freeze provides a disincentive for the soviets to negotiate a true reduction in armaments and they raise doubts about whether or not the soviets would even agree to a freeze each of these arguments are easily refutable quite simply critics of the arms freeze fail to recognize that the soviets do not hold any clear advantage over the united states in nuclear arms and in fact current forces on both sides are in better balance now than at any other time in history they also ignore the fact that the most important aspects of the freeze testing and deployment can be verified and that our intelligence capabilities now permit us to monitor even the production of new soviet weapons it is also important to point out that in 1977 1978 and 1979 soviet officials proposed their own halt to the nuclear arms race along the same lines as the freeze at the very least we can surmise that even if the united states proposed a freeze the soviet union would give it very serious consideration despite these and other arguments for supporting a nuclear freeze it is likely that the rebuttal on its merits will go on for as long as its critics permit the discerners will continue to ascertain as best they can whether the present course of human events carries with it the danger of devastating life in our world they will continue seemingly unemoumbered by the weighty responsibility they hold to point meticuously to every imagined imperfection and flaw and simply by virtue of their concern over how the soviets behave in a real world and over this countrys perceived security needs prolong the status quo and heighten even further the dangers of a nuclear conflict truly the main obstacle to a negotiated freeze will be this kind of skepticism about whether a freeze is worth seeking in the meantime while we build more weapons the soviet union will be doing the same both countries are about to embark on a new generation of nuclear weapons that are so accurate that they will be able to eliminate the weapons of other nations before they are even launched in addition while the adminstration pledges to increase its strategic weapon stockpile at an alarming rate neither the united states nor the soviet union have demonstrated a commitment to open dialog with each other on the issue of armament control in response our citizens grow nervous and even more importantly fearful and with good reason we live unfortunately in a world of threats and counter threats of force and counterforce and as technolbgical advances make new weapons more usable the temptation to use them will be greater than before inevitably there will come the moment of a crisis when one nation will decide to push the button before the other does aggression will be met with aggression retaliation with retaliation and humanity as we know it will fall by the wayside every american knows that this scenario is possible we must begin now therefore to focus attention on the urgent need for more rapid progress toward reductions in nuclear armaments bearing in mind that the freeze is not an end in itself and that it should be followed by major mutual and verifiable reductions so let us begin tonight as we attempt to chart the best course to increased national security to reverse the nuclear arms race by first calling it to a halt

displayed extraordinary heroism in assisting tens of thousands of jews to freedom from nazioccupied hungary late in world war ii i feel it is only fitting and proper to honor this man who sacrificed so much for so many in 1944 wallenberg a swedish diplomat was sent to budapest as a result of requests from the american war refugee board and a representative of the world jewish council his mission was to assist jews to escape from the wholesale slaughter being conducted by adolph hitler his mission and the activities he carried out were both daring and successful the swedish raoul wallenberg association has attributed wallenbergs work to directly saving 20 000 hungarian jews in addition he assisted with the collaboration of others in aiding approximately 100 000 jews to escape unfortunately mr wallenberg would never see the success of his work he would never see the children he helped escape grow to adulthood and he would never receive the thanks of a grateful world unfortunately the yoke of oppression that mr wallenberg helped to lift frcm the hungarian people was only fated to be replaced by another form of oppression mr wallenbergs biography reads like a greek tragedy it is a mixture of triumph and tragedy when soviet forces eventually ended the nazi occupation of hungary in january 1944 one of the first actions they took was to arrest wallenberg for suspicion of spying the charges were unfounded and the act unpardonable instead of being hailed as a hero wallenberg was carted off as a common criminal today a mystery surrounds the fate of raoul wallenberg since his incarceration by the soviets 36 years ago after repeated inquires as to his fate the soviets issued a statement claiming mr wallenberg died of a heart attack in 1974 however former prisoners in the soviet gulag system have claimed to have seen a man resembling mr wallenberg during their confinement in 1975 a russian jew jan kaplan met a swede in the butyrka prison who had been imprisoned for 30 years but still seemed healthy if this man is raoul wallenberg then the soviets are once again heinously guilty of repression and the denial of human rights why will the soviets not reveal the real truth about raoul wallenberg how much longer must we accept the lies and falsehoods offered to us by them hopefully the actions we are taking today as representatives of the people of the united states will help clear up the mystery of raoul wallenberg if he is alive after all these years of unnecessary penal servitude then grant him his freedom so that he can live out the

national association of realtors urges your vote tomorrow for the budget resolution to be offered by representative latta because it reduces the fiscal year 1983 deficit below 100 billion and it contains a binding reconciliation date which will force the process towards a balanced budget in future years we believe that passage of a federal budget reducing the deficit below 100 billion in 1983 is a necessary step oward the real goal of interest rates declining to normal levels without this action government spending will continue to increase faster than peoples income and federal deficit borrowing will consume virtually the entire savings pool of the american people congress must write a budget that will regain control over the deficit and provide impetus necessary to restore the health of the many insensitive segments of the nation which have been devastated by unaffordable interest rates we are hopeful that this action will result in a decline in interest rates sufficient to generate economy recovery we are not happy with the high deficits in the out years forecast for the latta resolution let me interject that i am not either we have cut better than 80 billion out of the 1983 deficit and we are cutting more out of the future year deficits but we will have an opportunity in future years to take further cuts continuing the letter in recent months we have urged on the

who would simply eliminate government participation in this demonstration project first the utilities have not backed down from their 300 million commitment to the project second with much of the

canceled participation in the project now 1 3 billion has already been spent cancellation could cost anywhere from 300 to 500 million furthermore if we remain committed to clinch river we will finish

crises of the past decade are a somber reminder that the unitedstates government in partnership with the private sector must encouragenot discouragedevelopment of all feasible alternative energy

implications of those activities to underscore our mutual understanding of the purpose of this bill i offered an amendment in sub committee which stated that antitrust laws shall apply to conduct having a direct substantial and reasonably foreseeable effect on domestic commerce the bill before us has a different provision rather than applying fully antitrust laws to domestic activities of export trading companies the bill exempts them from treble damages and provides only single damages this means that export trading companies could engage in antitrust activities domestically and the affected domestic competitors would be able to collect only single damages this is inconsistent with the assurances that were given to me only last week by the secretary of commerce i am convinced

those legislative process this is been a momentous week as far as the congress is concerned the continuing resolution the second budget resolution and foreign aid or foreign assistance authorizations and appropriations when we reflect back on all of this i think history will show that it was a week in which the true philosophy behind the socalled deficits and the budget of this administration and the reaganomics or supplyside economics has truly come forwvard we look at the second budget resolution and we see therein a statement that in this year we will have a 37 5 billion deficit and that is all that in 1983 we will have a 19 billion deficit and that is all that in 1984 we will have a billiondollar surplus and there is no one in this house no one in the senate no one in the administration no one in financial t~cles no economist that will beliri e that and yet that second budget resolution passed this house overwhelmingly and will pass the senate yet no one believes it because it is not true everybody agrees that this years deficit will exceed 60 billion and in all probability it will be 100 billion just commenting in passing the bill that we just passed today just a few minutes ago will add to that deficit for the purpose of foreign aid as i said during the debate on that bill it should be added too that was one bill that the president was keeping a scorecard on that the president wanted a 50percent increase in foreign aid at the same time if we reflect in that budget resolution that was passed the first time in the house and in the reconciliation bill billions of dollars were cut back on nutrition programs for our children educational programs for our youth loan and grant programs for college students mninimium social security for our elderly who are 75 and 85 years of ageall in the name of supposedly balancing the budget in august of this year that we passed a tax bill that gave billions of dollars to oil producers racehorse owners other special interest groups leasing provisions tax credits to large conglomerates and companies making big profits and now we are going to continue on down this road without any change this administration says that their plan will work at the same time this nation is facing disaster unemployment is increasing continues to increase inventories are up businesses are down industry is hurting and we are not going to do anything really to help them i think that many of us on this side of the aisle do have alternatives legitimnate alternatives both in the senate and in the house to correct these problems to reduce the deficits to make more money available tit lower interest rates for both business and individuals one is not to increase spending that is not thle answer one is to redo the tax bill that was done earlier this year to take back the money that wvas given to the big oil companies aind to oil producers the billions of dollars in changing the windfall profits tax another is to stop the leasing tax credit provision to repeal that to repeal thle provision in there for race horse owners to reduce the benefits that went to those in the very high income brackets by the tax bill reducing thle uipper limits on the unearned income and to put most of that back in place by doing that we will once again have additional revenues that we so desperately need in order to reduce our deficit without actually impacting anyone making less than 100 000 in this country and that is over 98 percent of the people of this country another is to provide for a delay in the 10 percent by reducing the 10percent tax cut that goes into effect next year to a 5 percent and also to skewer the tax rates to benefit those with incomes of under 50 000 by doing this and by reducing the deficit you automatically will reduce the interest rates because there will be more money available in the private sector for loan purposes by reducing the interest on the trilliondollar debt that this country now has and continues on upward spiraling higher and higher by reducing that interest rate and by doing these other things we can by 1984 have a balanced budget the alternative is to continue down the road of reaganomics and as we continue down that road in the words of the chairman of the budget committee in the other body a member of the presidents partythey predict that as of this year a deficit of 76 to 92 billion next year 96 to 136 billion and in 1984 103 to 165 billion and some even say 200 billion so that is what we look for from reaganomics a total deficit in the next 3 years of over 400 billion it took us 205 years to get to the first trillion under reaganomics if continued on for 8 years we will be passed the 2 trillion mark and this country will hopefully still survive but we will have been through at least 25 to 30 percent interest rates inflation at 15 to 20 percent unemployment at 9 to 10 percent it will be much worse than what we saw in the thirties and it must be turned around neither the president nor this congress has a lot of time to waste and dilly and dally about it it is necessary that the congress and the president take action as i said 119111 before in

minority member of the subcommittee i would also like to thank all of the members of the subcommittee for their efforts to help get the reported bill to the floor today we are considering a bill to provide a costofliving increase in benefits for veterans who were disabled as a result of their milltary service and for the widows and orphans of veterans who died of serviceconnected causes the bill is designed to assist these individuals to make sure that their level of benefits is not eroded by the ravages of inflation the bill would provide an average 7 4 percent increase effective october 1 i wish to assure you and my colleagues that the funding level contained in this bill does not exceed the targets established in the first concurrent budget resolution additionally it is not inflationary in that it simply provides a costofliving increase based on the anticipated rise in the consumer price index between 1982 the legislation is necessary since the serviceconnected program for veterans and widows is not indexed by laws serviceconnected compensation is payable to veterans who suffer from a disease or disability incurred during service the percentage of disability for a specific disability is assigned by the veterans administration that agency has established a schedule for rating disabilities which is the guideline for measuring the degree of disability compensation is paid for disabilities at ratings of 10 percent 20 percent and so forth up to 100 percent the rate of compensation payable for each percentage of disability is established by law additional compensation is payable for the loss of a limb blindness and other severe disabilities an additional dependency allowance is payable to veterans with a rating of 30 percent or more for a spouse minor children or dependent parents historically the congress has increased compensation rates whenever there has been an appreciable increase in the costofliving index since the rates are not indexed to the consumer price index by law this is necessary to insure that inflation does not erode july 297 1 982 the purchasing power of those drawing compensation and dic benefits widows and children of veterans who die of causes determined to be service connected are entitled to monthly payments of dependency and indemnity compensation the purpose of this benefit is to provide partial compensation to the designated survivors for the loss in financial support sustained as the result of the serviceconnected death income and need are not factors in determining a surviving spouses or childs entitlement since the nation assumes in part the legal and moral obligation of the veteran to support the spouse and children payments of dic for surviving spouses are determined on the basis of the veterans service pay grade rnd range from 415 monthly for the surviving spouse of an e1 to 1 061 monthly fbr the surviving spouse of an 010 surviving spouses are entitled to an additional 48 monthly for each child it is well established that the congress has placed the very highest priority on the payment of compensation and dependency and indemnity compensation benefits to eligible veterans and survivors the bill also contains several program changes first it would provide entitlement to va compensation to members of the senior reserve officers training corps if during military training camp a participant suffers a disabling injury my very capable colleague from south dakota the honorable thomas a daschle called to our attention the fact that where an rotc member suffers a fatal injury during summer camp his widow is entitled to dependency and indemnity compenss tion dic but if he is seriously injured and does not die he is not eligible to receive benefits from the veterans administration the individual is only eligible for federal employees compensation under section 8104 of title 5 united states code which is substantially lower than va compensation the bill would correct this inequity the bill would also increase the compensation rate for certain blinded veterans by equalizing benefits for totally blinded veterans without light perception with those who have suffered the enucleation of the eyes or deformity or scarring an increased compensation rate would also be payable to veterans who suffer from serviceconnected blindness in both eyes 5 200 visual acuity or less and who additionally have incurred the serviceconnected loss or loss of use of one hand or one foot this increased compensation is considered to be warranted because the loss of an extremity has a greater impact on a blinded veteran than on an individual who has not lost his or her sight the honorable christopher h suirru of new jersey the honorable albert lee smith of alabama and the honorable joseph f smith of pennsylvania addressed these issues in h r 6154 and h r 6155 the bill wculd reinstate the 300 burial allowance for certain wartime veterans whose remains are unclaimed and whose estates do not contain sufficient resources to defray the cost of the funeral and burial of the deceased under the provisions of public law 9735 the omnibus reconciliation act of 1981 the 300 nonserviceconnected burial allowance was terminated for many veterans exceptions to this discontinuance were veterans who were drawing va pension or compensation benefits at time of death or who died in a va facility following the adoption of the reconcillation act last year the press publicized accounts of many bodies being held in county and city morgues when no funds or next of kin were available to provide a proper burial investigation of this situation revealed that the press reports were greatly exaggerated however committee investigation revealed that some cases did exist and action is warranted to make certain that the unclaimed body of a wartime veteran is not buried in a paupers grave this provision of the bill corrects the oversight which occurred by the enactment of public law 9735 additionally it would authorize payment of the burial allowance in cases where a veteran dies in a va contract nursing home the provisions of section 903 a title 38 united state code authorize payment of the 300 nonserviceconnected burial allowance whenever death occurs in a va facility to which the deceased was properly admitted for almost 20 years the va has followed an interpretation by its general counsel that contract nursing care constituted care in a va facility for purposes of eligibility for burial benefits public law 9735 provided that the benefit would no longer be payable unless the deceased veteran was in receipt of compensation or pension or unless he died in a va facility the congress relying on the long standing interpretation of current law on this issue did not place any limit on deaths in either a vaowned facility or in a contract facility earlier this year the va general counsel issued an opinion reversing an earlier opinion issued almost 20 years ago that death in a contract nursing home did not constitute death in a va facility for purposes of establishing eligibility for burial benefits in his latest opinion he did not consider the issue of congressional ratification of the earlier decision manifested by legislation enacting a number of amendments and restrictions placed on payment of burial benefits therefore there is no alternative but to seek legislative remedy the bill would further authorize the administrator to furnish a flag to the next of kin of certain persons buried in a national cemetery public law 9343 which became effective june 18 1973 extended the privilege of being buried in a national cemetery to nonveterans in certain instances so designated by the administrator this would usually involve an individual who performed outstanding and meritorious service to this nation this provision of the bill would authorize the administrator to provide a burial flag to any distinguished individual so honored by burial in a national cemetery at the request of the department of defense the bill would provide that the position of superintendents of national cemeteries administered by the department of the army need not be restricted to only those who have been disabled in the line of duty prior to 1973 the department of the army administered 84 national cemeteries and required that each superintendent meet the serviceconnected disability requirementa requirement which has been in effect since 1948 when 82 of the cemeteries were transferred to the veterans administration under the provisions of the national cemeteries act of 1973 the act removed the requirement that superintendents for national cemeteries administered by the veterans administration be disabled veterans it continued the disability requirement however for superintendents of army national cemeteries the army anticipates extreme difficulty in filling future vacancies for the superintendent positions at arlington and the soldiers home national cemetery this bill would enable the army to avoid that difficulty the bill further contains a technical amendment with respect to entitlement of dependency and indemnity compensation under current law a surviving spouse or child is eligible for these benefits only if the veteran was at the time of death in receipt of compensation for a disability rated as total for 10 years prior to death or for 5 years and continuously from the date of discharge under this amendment a survivor would be eligible for benefits at dic rates if the veteran was entitled to receive compensation at the total rate during t e requisite period it is intended to create entitlement in survivors when the veteran was not assigned a total disability rating for the requisite duration because of va error at the request of the veterans administration the bill would remove the bar against payment of servicemens group life insurance sgli and veterans group life insurance vgli proceeds in the event a claim is filed more than 4 years after the insureds death the bill also clarifies that such proceeds may not escheat to a state the bill enhances the quality of care for veterans in medical facilities operated by the veterans administration by insuring the provision of such care and necessary related services by federal employees this provision is contained in the bill as a result of an amendment offered by my very distinguished colleague the honorable marvin leath of texas a proposed revision to omb circular a76 mandates ronversion to contract for those services with 25 or less employees without requiring cost comparison studies to ascertain the cost effectiveness of such conversions the bill specifies that va services not be contracted out unless the administrator after giving proper consideration to the recommendation of the chief medical director determine it is not in the best interest of the veterans and the agency to do so high quality health care for veterans continues to be one of the committees highest priorities and this is demonstrated by the fact that h r 6315 which is identical to this provision in the bill was cosponsored by 28 members of the committee the bill also complies with the reconciliation instructions to the committee on veterans affairs contained in the first concurrent budget resolution it contains several program changes which if enacted would realize savings totaling 169 7 million in budget authority and outlays in fiscal year 1983 185 9 million in fiscal year 1984 and 195 million in fiscal year 1985 the congressional budget office has advised us that the savings will be 400 000 more than what is shown in the body of our committee report and this amount is reflected in the above figures the bill contains the following costsavings provisions first rounding down pension and compensation benefit checks to the next lower dollar issuing pension checks in even dollars would realize savings of 10 8 million in fiscal year 1983 10 4 million in fiscal year 1984 and 10 1 million in fiscal year 1985 rounding down compensation and dic benefits to the nearest whole dollar would save 18 3 million in fiscal year 1983 18 5 million in fiscal year 1984 and 18 6 million in fiscal year 1985 second amending the definition of a dependent child for pension purposes to exclude college students over the age of 18 this would be phased in over 4 years to protect current student beneficiaries this would save 13 4 million in fiscal year 1983 18 1 million in fiscal year 1984 and 21 7 million in fiscal year 1985 third delaying payment of compensation and pension benefits until the first full month of entitlement rather than from the effective date of the award by postponing the start of the payment period but not the effective date itself for purposes of other va rights savings in the compensation account would be 9 million in fiscal year 1983 10 million in fiscal year 1984 and 10 4 million in fiscal year 1985 pension savings are estimated at 19 8 million in fiscal year 1983 20 7 million in fiscal year 1984 and 22 million in fiscal year 1985 fourth changing the effective dates of reductions and discontinuances of compensation dic or pension by reason of a veterans change in dependency status from the end of the year to the end of the month in which the event occurred savings for compensation would be 1 4 million in fiscal year 1983 1984 and 1985 savings for pension would be 1 8 millon in fiscal year 1983 2 1 million in fiscal year 1984 and 2 5 million in fiscal year fifth terminating the correspondence training program this would realize savings of 5 6 million in fiscal year 1983 4 9 million in fiscal year 1984 and 4 2 million in fiscal year sixth imposing a 0 5 percent user fee on va loans the average fee would be about 285 with an exemption for serviceconnected veterans drawing compensation benefits under chapter 11 of title 38 united states code savings would be approximately 89 6 million in fiscal year 1983 99 8 million in fiscal year 1984 and 104 1 million in fiscal year 1985 mr speaker the above program changes meet our reconciliation requirements for the next 3 years although the majority of these proposals will have minimal impact upon exitsing benefiti and services i personally have reservations about the imposition of a users fee on va loans i wish to point out however that it is only temporary the authority to collect such fee will expire on september 30 i think it only fair that we do it this way the fee should only be paid during a period of time when we are in a severe economic slump it is my understanding that certain tax provisions considered by the senate last week in their tax bill are also temporary in nature in particular i refer to senator helms amendment that the additional tax on tobacco expire october 1 1985 it is my belief that we should not continue to impose a users fee on veterans many of whom served during wartime applying for va loans once the country reaches a measure of economic recovery again i would like to point out that this bill will have no inflationary impact and is well within the budget authority and outlays as contained in the first congressional budget resolution it has an overall cost of 539 in budget authority and 486 in outlays for fiscal year 1983 this bill is vital to
