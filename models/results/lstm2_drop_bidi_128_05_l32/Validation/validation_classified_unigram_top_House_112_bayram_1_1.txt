they wont have an increase in their taxes so that theyll have the confidence that theyll have that money in their pockets to perhaps purchase that refrigerator that they need or that oven that they need or perhaps a new car or so that they can help their kids go to college why dont we give them that confidence i say to my friends i wish we would do so today we could embrace the agreement that

prior under either party lets talk about exactly what was attempted yesterday in this constitutional amendment that would have essentially passed as part of a resolution its one thing to say that we want to eliminate medicare the house worked its will through the ryan budget phasing out medicare for those who are under 55 years of age the people of this country will have the opportunity to change that we saw an election in upstate new york where i think and most people think that the people of this country soundly rejected the effort to eliminate medicare but regardless thats what elections are about i know that in the last election democrats didnt fare too well a majority of this house was elected that wanted to phase out medicare for people under the age of 55 likewise in the next election if people run on that a majority might arise in this body that supports keeping medicare solvent for the next generation what was attempted yesterday was circumventing the public will by inserting into the united states constitution exact fiscal policy that essentially wouldnt allow medicare to exist in any form similar to what it is today it would actually specify an exact percentage of the gross national product that the public sector can contain in our governing document this is unprecedented who hears of putting numbers 19 7 percent 19 5 percent 20 21 percentwere talking about the percentage of the economy that can be public sector versus private sector who knows what the ideal percentage is thats what elections are about thats what we fight off every day here on the floor of the house some will say we should have it a little bigger others will say we should have it a little smaller the people of the country have their say to somehow take that out of the realm of public discourse and insert that into our governing document is unprecedented it castrates the united states congress it castrates and eliminates our ability to make public policy for better or worse i had an exchange with one of my colleagues on the rules committee as we were bringing this to the floor the other day i said this is such an absurd concept imagine for a minute that there was a democratic majority and we were saying you know what we want to put in our constitution that public expenditures have to be at least 22 percent of gnp orbut it never even crossed our minds there is no democratic proposal like that because it just doesnt make any sense thats what elections are about and yet here the republican majority is trying to insert into our governing documentthe one that they say that

from the voters of this country taking the discussion away from the deliberative bodies of the house and the senate taking it out of the hands of an election for president of the united states

the united states congress to specific policies prescribed in the constitution we remove the ability of present and future voters of the country to have their voices heard regardless of where anyone

budget and 32 joint strike fighter aircraft i would like to have seen more strike fighter aircraft because i believe theyre doing a much better job on this program last year it was in some trouble this year admiral venlet has said repeatedly that theyre in fact ahead of the training schedule so i think this is very good news the bill also adds funding to fill gaps in dod capabilities some examples include the m1a2 system enhancement package 272 million is included to prevent a break in production of tanks and this is something that our committee agreed with on an overwhelming basis that shutting down the tank line in ohio would be a terrible mistake because wed lose the skilled workers and then were going to reopen this tank line in 2 or 3 years and it would just be a waste of money so we bridged that gap hmmwv force protection 50 million is added to develop and test and improve armor and other blast protection technologies on the hmmwv long range strike 100 million is added to reduce technical risk and schedule risks for this program were moving ahead on a replacement for the trident submarine the c17 replacement is included to replace the operational loss of a c17

unitedstates forces from iraq the bill ensures that troops have essential force protection and provides the means for the afghans to provide their own security the bill includes 12 8 billion to train afghanistans national security forces while the bill provides essential support for our troops i remain concerned about our nations direction in pakistan and ongoing operations in afghanistan there is cause to question the reliability of our partnership with both countries in the light of recent events we must reassess the extent of unitedstates military involvement and the objectives of unitedstates foreign policy in that part of the world reexamining whether unitedstates national security requires a continued deployment of over 100 000 unitedstates service personnel i welcome president obamas decision to start the withdrawals and i also urge a ceasefire and a political settlement after a careful review of the security situation i believe it is time to significantly accelerate the withdrawal of unitedstates forces to accomplish this objective responsibly will take some care by necessity a political solution in afghanistan will involve negotiations with taliban representatives it will also demand taking into account the interests of surrounding nations to ensure that those neighbors do not fight with one another along sectarian or tribal divides within afghanistan finally we must guard against creating a vacuum similar to the one that occurred at the end of the soviet occupation in 1989 even with these cautions in mind i believe it is time to begin the process of bringing the level of deployed unitedstates troops in line with a new assessment of our security interests in the region i look forward to hearing from general petraeus and general odierno we worked with them on the surge in iraq which turned out to be very successful the military has done a very good job in helmand and kandahar and has dominated the taliban in recent times which is very positive we still have a problem on the eastern front between afghanistan and pakistan and we need to continue to put pressure on al qaeda though the capture and death of osama bin laden was something that all the troops that have served here since 2001 should take satisfaction in the person who led the effort against the united states in one of the most horrific acts and one of the most economic destabilizing acts that has ever occurred to our country while i have concerns about our nations policies in afghanistan and pakistan i strongly support this bill its a bipartisan bill and it provides the resources needed by our troops i urge your support for the bill i also want to thank the staff i know chairman young will join me in this we have a tremendous staff that works together they worked together when i was chairman theyre working together now that chairman young hashe had been chairman before and has now regained his chairmanship and the staff has done an extraordinary job its a major piece of work to put together a 530 billion bill and know all these programs and i commend them for their good work i reserve the balance of my time"],

gentleman from washington state for focusing america on what the issues are before us in recent weeks i have come to the floor to argue that the republican spending plan does two extremely harmful things it weakens our economy and fails to seriously reduce our debt democrats agree that cutting spending is part of the solution to our difficult problems that confront us but we also believe that cuts should be smart and targeted not reckless rather than cutting investments in growthat the same time our international competitors are ramping up theirsdemocrats support the make it in america agenda a plan to invest in innovation manufacturing jobs and middle class opportunity thats what the president talked about in his state of the union and he was right unfortunately the consensus that the republican spending plan will halt our economic recovery and cost jobs is widespread and nonpartisan fed chairman ben bernanke appointed by president bush tells us that the plan will cost a couple of hundred thousand jobs macroeconomic advisers tell us that the republican plan will wipe out approximately 450 000 jobs moodys analytics chief economist mark zandi who advised senator mccain in his presidential campaign tells us that it will cost up to 700 000 jobs the economic policy institute puts the number at 800 000 jobs whatever the precise number it is a large number of jobs that will be lost if we pass the republicans budget solutions what they want to do as the gentleman from washington state said this is all exempt this is security these are all mandatory expenditures this small slice of the budget about 460 billion the republicans want to cut by 22 percent give or take a percentage point so they are holding harmless almost all of 85 to 86 percent of the money that we spent and say were simply going to cut from education from health care from children from community developmentprojectsthe guts of what makes our communities have a better quality at the same time i have argued the republican spending plan barely puts a dent in our budget deficit its reasonable to ask how can this plan have such severe consequences for our economy yet so little impact on our fiscal predicament this chart helps us answer the question all of the proposed cuts all of the cuts come from this small slice of the budget the category of our budget called nonsecurity discretionary spending but nonsecurity discretionary spending the gentleman from washington state said 12 percent we have here 14 percent its in that neighborhood depending upon exactly what you include as security or nonsecurity when you attempt to find 100 billion in savings and when you insist on getting these savings from 14 percent of the budget you have to cut very deeply into absolutely essential projects and programs for our people you have to cut billions in funding into new medical cures and energy technologies you have to kick 200 000plus children off of head start you even have to cut port and transit security by twothirds hear that again theyre cutting port and transit security by twothirds while theyre holding terrorism hearings the chairman of the house homeland security committee a republican said those cuts were too dangerous as david brooks recently argued congress should never cut without an evaluation process but instead legislatorshe referred to the republican initiatives are simply cutting on the basis of whats politically easy and what vaguely seems expendable it may be possible to portray taking on 14 percent of the budget as fiscally responsible but only because doing so exploits americans misunderstanding of the budget a recent poll shows that 63 percent of americans think we spend more on defense and foreign aid than we do on medicare and social securityall the blue all the green and then the yellow that small sliverwhich by the way includes discretionary foreign policy expenditures i urge our citizens to look at the consequences of these cuts and look at the small sliver that the republicans are focusing themselves on and you and me on we need to see the whole picture if were going to come to grips with the challenge that confronts us when another poll asked americans how much we spend on foreign aid the average estimate was 27 percentwhen the right answer is about 1 percent it is entirely out of step with fiscal reality to attempt to tackle our deficit while ignoring 86 percent of the budget fiscal responsibility is not synonymous with cutting nonsecurity discretionary spending in truth fiscal responsibility is much more difficult than that as former republican congressman joe scarborough put it this week the belief of some on the right that america can balance the budget by cutting education infrastructure the corporation for public broadcasting and home heating assistance to the poor is tantamount to budgetary witchcraft we have to start doing more we have to address the defense spending that takes up more than a quarter of our budget we have to make hard choices that can keep our entitlements strong for generations to come and with tax revenues at a 60year low we have to pass deficitreducing tax reform unless were

forces associated with the afghan governmenta government we support and are told to trust it is hard to believe that in the midst of a presidential campaign so little is being said about the war during the republican national convention nominee mitt romney never once mentioned the war or the troops in his acceptance speechnot even a sentence not a phrase nothing as one who has been to afghanistan twice met with our troops talked to returning veterans and been to visit them in the hospital i find that silence shocking and offensive i also find offensive the fact that this house of representatives has refused to even debate this issue when the department of defense authorization bill came to the floor earlier this year the republican leadership of this house refused to allow a bipartisan amendment that i and walter jones of north carolina offered that amendment called for an accelerated withdrawal of american forces from afghanistan the chairman of the rules committee at the time said there were a lot of other important issues to be debated on the defense bill my question is what in the world is more important than this war the afghan government is one of the most corrupt in the world our troops have already accomplished their mission not only ridding afghanistan of al qaeda but killing osama bin laden by the way they got him in pakistan not afghanistan so why are we still there there is a culture in washington that engulfs both republicans and democrats it is a culture that makes it easy to go to war but impossible to get out there is no question that ending the war in afghanistan will be messy there is no nice neat way to do it there will be no signing of a peace treaty no grand parade the president tells us that we will turn over control of security operations to the afghans by 2014 but it is unclear how many unitedstates forces will remain or what their role will be and mitt romney says nothing there ought to be a major portion of this presidential campaign dedicated to the issue of afghanistan vague deadlines or generalities no longer suffice too many brave american service men and women have paid with their lives and while candidates talk about the debt our government carries no one points out that we borrow the billions to pay for this war we dont even pay for it it goes on the credit card and weve been doing this for over a decade in this congress we cant spend one additional penny to feed hungry children or create a single job or build a single bridge without finding an offset yet when it comes to war there are no offsets no new revenue just another blank check something is terribly wrong with this picture finally i would remind my colleagues here in the house that we are all responsible for this war and we

right now that he would qualify as a new energy source thats how violative of freemarket principles this continued subsidy of this company is knowing that there are other companies that can provide the same resource without the government subsidies even after the department of energys recent announcement of another gift of free uranium to usec standard poors downgraded it to junkbond status who invests in something that has already achieved junkbond status with the exception of the united states congress thats what were voting on here today funding of a company that is now in junkbond status and jpmorgan the companys creditor now directly controls every penny usec spends because it felt the company could not manage its own precarious finances when i asked the treasury department whether government support for the company put taxpayers at risk it said yes and that extreme care should be taken before offering any exposure to the taxpayer but are we following the treasury departments advice no the department of energy has approved hundreds of millions of dollars worth of subsidies for this company and is about to approve another 82 million bailout in the coming days and congress has acceded to pressure to insert even more money in no fewer than three pieces of legislation that are currently pending including the 100 million contained in this bill weve been told this bailout is only about getting the tritium we need for our nuclear weapons but this is just not true the treaty that governs uranium enrichment technology does not prevent other companies from doing this work even if it did there are even additional alternatives when doe examined its tritium options it found that downblending surplus highly enriched uranium that it already has would cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars less than obtaining the services from this company this amendment is supported by a coalition that spans the political horizon that makes it possible for mr burgessa very conservative member from texasto join with a very liberal congressman from massachusetts in agreeing that the pragmatic center here has lost its bearings it has lost touch with the freemarket principles and at least if were going to subsidize something lets see that its not already reached junkbond status and were continuing to pour good money after bad this is something that in my opinion is unacceptable the department of energy has already given 44 million for this program this year and it is about to provide another 82 million as it prepares to buy the centrifuges that have yet to be demonstrated to work properly thats right 126 million that will buy centrifuges from a company whose total value is now less than 90 million as part of the deal the taxpayers also have to assume
