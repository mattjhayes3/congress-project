6 billion through extension of mediciare coverage to state and local government employees that is a tax on state and local employees in addition the presidents budget repeals gasoline and other highway exemptions thus increasing the taxes people would pay and increases contributions to the rail industry pension plan another tax to those individuals and also affects the employer tax on tips it increases the tax on coal production and increases the payroll tax coverage on certain earnings plus a customs fee small tax and fee increases and a whole set of user fees while some might argue that a user fee is not a tax all you have to do is ask the individual paying it out of his pocket whether or not it is a tax clearly the president wants to raise additional revenues through taxes imposed on individuals the point is that if you look at these overall prioritiesdefense domestic as well as revenuesthat it clearly is not balanced when it comes to defense and domestic spending you have literally a transfer from the domestic area to defense it falls far short of the deficit goal putting all of this together because even by their own estimates revealed in the letter last week from mr miller they are falling some 15 billion short of the goals under grammrudman if we look at the estimates by the committee on the budget in the house they are falling in excess of 20 billion short of the goal congress on the other hand in trying to make its effort trying to establish balance we initially established in the house version approximately 9 billion that would be taken out of defense 9 billion out of domestic and then an 18 billion revenue increase there was symmetry there in that both defense and domestic spending would bear the same burden and we would then raise an equivalent amount through revenues the final result in the budget resolution adopted by both the house and the other body basically reflects those priorities in defense 8 1 billion in the domestic area approximately 8 billion with interest savings and revenues of approximately 19 billion the point is that there is balance here there are problems and we understand the disagreements with regards to various points contained in the budget i respect those who disagree with those priorities but the budget adopted by congress reflects a balance between defense and domestic spending and reduces the deficit by 36 8 bllion so that it makes the hard choices on defense and domestic spending as well as revenues in evaluating a budget we look at not just the question of how effectively and fairly does it reduce deficits but also the issue of priorities because budgets are not just a matter of deficits and numbers and assumptions priorities affect the american people on a daytoday basis national security is not just a matter of the weapons and technology we provide for defense it is also a matter of the quality of life that we provide for our people i was interested in comments made by senator dole before the young republicans recently and i want to quote from his speech to the young republicans i would like to see 50 wheelchairs in this audience he said i would like to see 50 black faces 50 hispanics 50 asianamericans we get a rap that we dont care about people who have real problems we turn our back on the disabled we dont like lowincome americans we dont like old people we dont care much for black people or brown people or asianamericans or white people were sort of a hardhearted party the upper crust you dont want to be the upper crust you cant be a republican the bottom line is how you treat others and we have an obligation and a responsibility and above all an opportunity to open up the doors of this party the reason for mr doles comments and the reason that we are concerned about the priorities that have been reflected in the administrations budgets is that the people understand the difference between rhetoric between proclaiming a bill of rights and truly addressing the priorities that have a direct impact on the american people the message that has been sent by the presidents budget is clear and it will be more fully explored by others who follow me in the days ahead let me give you a few examples with regard to the elderly there are 29 million americans who are at least 65 years of age in this country 12 percent of our population there are growing pockets of poverty among the elderly within this country black elderly americans now constitute about 31 5 percent of those below the poverty level in this country elderly women about 15 6 percent add to that the cost of health care which is three times the cost for other families and you begin to understand the challenges the concerns that face elderly americans in our society but lets look at the message to elderly americans contained in the administrations budget 4 7 billion to be cut from the medicare program a premium increase of 500 million and a termination of the 202 housing program for the elderly and the handicapped medicaid was to be cut 1 4 billion and 15 percent of those served by the medicaid program are the aged employment and retirement programs were to be cut by

effluent from the nations production thus converting many of our rivers and streams into sewers and poisoning water that must be used by human beings the clean water act of 1987 is an essential measure in our quest to make americas waters safe for fishing recreation and drinking in some areas of the nation pollution has caused the soil and water to become contaminated by carcinogenic materials leading to noticeably higher rates of death from cancer in those regions this legislation is a major advance toward the goal of providing greater safety for the public through the eventual elimination of pollutants from americas waterways this bill will reauthorize and strengthen the landmark federal water pollution control act of 1972 better known as the clean water act it contains a provision authorizing 18 billion over 8 years for building sewage treatment plants as well as a variety of other constructive measures for battling pollution this bill will provide badly needed federal funding to help municipalities finance their local sewage treatment construction a major innovation of this bill is the establishment of the state revolving loan fund which will be highly beneficial for arkansas and for the municipalities in the first district that i represent the state revolving loan fund will provide lowinterest loans to communities in need of sewage treatment systems the repayments of the loans will later be used to make new loans giving a selfsustaining source of funds for states to finance local water treatment construction there are now about 3 330 treatment plants in america that violate existing clean water act requirements by providing little or no sewage treatment it is futile for congress to require necessary water quality goals if municipalities lack the funds needed to assist them in meeting these standards this bill provides a solution to the problem for the short term the congress will appropriate federal funds to keep water treatment projects on track while establishing the selfsustaining fund that the states will use in the future to meet wastewater standards on their own another positive feature of this bill is its provision for providing 400 million to help states control nonpoint source pollutionsuch as runoff from streets parking lots or fields current law generally controls only pollution that comes from a specific source such as pipes or sewers in thus dealing with nonpoint source pollution the bill is attacking a problem that accounts for up to half of the water pollution in some areas of the country the clean water act also has a series of other amendments designed to strengthen americas effort to clean up the nations surface waters and make them suitable for fishing and swimming it will set new restrictions on discharges into waters where there are already high concentrations of toxic chemicals other amendments will regulate municipal and industrial stormwater discharges into the waterways and will require controls on surface runoff from city streets and agricultural areas i am particularly aware of the significance of the latter provision because of the great importance of agricultural areas in my district i am pleased to note that in addition to its vital effort to protect our people from contaminated water the bill will also be beneficial for economic growth in arkansas and in the first district because the sewage construction projects will provide jobs and stimulate local economies the sewage treatment plants will be one important component in developing the inffastructure of local areas many communities across the country face difficulties in promoting economic growth because they cannot meet the sewage treatment requirements set by the federal government by helping them to meet those standards this legislation will not only protect our water resources but will enhance the nations economic growth throughout the 1980s there has been vigorous public support for clean water for example a public opinion survey by louis harris in 1982 indicated that 94 percent of the american people believed that the clean water act should be kept as it is or made even stricter and more recent polls have reflected similar findings the bill has received enthusiastic support from a broad spectrum of groups including environmentalists industry labor unions and state and local governments the clean water act has widespread bipartisan support having passed house and senate by overwhelming margins in 1986 and again this year my home district in arkansas is blessed with many beautiful streams lakes and rivers this legislation is vital in the campaign to ensure that those waterways and others like them throughout america never become wastelands choked by pollutants it is

major trade legislation the issue of trade has been a subject that has been before the american people in everincreasing awareness for the last several years our trade deficits last year were almost 170 billion this year every indication is that a trade deficit of the united states will be significantly higher than that most of the emphasis of the proposed legislation focuses on the unfair trade practices which have been conducted and are being waged by some of our trading partners against the united states and our businesses i think that we need for a moment before we examine this legislation and get into the debate on the specifics of it to take a broader overview look at the entire question of trade at what some of these terms mean and what we might be doing to ourselves and to our trading partners if we take actions that we may not understand to begin with first of all unfair trade practices trade deficits and competitiveness are terms that are used frequently but they are not wellunderstood and they simply do not necessarily go together and interrelate for example we have had essentially the same or worse unfair trade practices used against us and our products and our services for quite a number of years when we had very large trade surpluses so unfair trade practices in and of themselves do not equate to huge trade deficits in the united states legislation that addresses unfair trade practices alone by no means is going to solve the trade deficit situation in this country i think we need to understand what the primary causes are of trade deficits the trade deficits at least that we have now now there can be other causes in other times but right now there are three primary causes of our trade deficits the first primary cause is the simple fact that the unitedstates economy and the consumer demand of this country over the last several years since 1981 has grown at a significantly greater rate than the growth of the economies and consumer demands of our trading partners the second reason why we have these huge trade deficits is because we have huge domestic budget deficits and we have not been able to do more than contain the growth of those domestic budget deficits we have not been able to reduce the deficits themselves the third primary cause of our trade deficits stems from the ever persistent third world debt and its direct relationship to our ability to trade now let us examine those three primary causes because they need to be understood if we are going to understand the legislation we are about to tackle in the next couple of days what about our growth our economy has grown since 1981 at a pretty rapid rate yes the inflation rates are down still we do not have that high gnp that everybody has been looking for but when you look around the world relative to the economies or the other parts of the world our economy has grown at a significantly more rapid rate than theirs when this occurs several things happen one our consumer demand and our business demand for that matter is up in other words our demand for products and services is greater than theirs and the natural consequence of this demand in a growing economy that is greater than the growth of the other parts of the world is that we are going to import more goods to meet this demand than we export we are going to have to import those goods because our economy has not been producing enough to meet this growth demand so it is only natural that we run a trade deficit in that situation it might not have to be as big as the one we have now but we cannot get around running that kind of a trade deficit until our economy picks up the slack in the system or until the foreign countries that we deal with have their economies pick up we need to have those countries cooperate a little bit with us if we are going to resolve the trade deficits the best way they could cooperate would be to get their own economies growing more rapidly we have encouraged them to do that but so far they have not the most obvious method of doing it particularly among the european allies is to reduce some of their tax burdens so their businesses can expand and their economies flow frankly they have an undue fear of the growth of inflation which is very low now we are almost in deflation in parts of the world we need them to do that but we cannot do it for them we cannot really force them to do that we can cajole them we can urge them we can do all kinds of things but we cannot absolutely get them to do that i suppose they could lower some of their interest rates which are already pretty low a little further they could do a number of things like that but until their demand comes up until they begin to grow at a greater pace than they are now we are going to have a natural pressure that is going to result in our having trade deficits that does not have anything to do with unfair trade practices and does not have anything to do with anything we can legislate about frankly now in the same context of these factors of growth relative growth between our country and our trading partners we have to think about how we finance this growth and how we finance at the same time these huge budget deficits we have with this greater growth relative to the other economies and with these huge deficits on our own side our budget deficits we require relatively higher interest rates than the rest of the world in order to get foreign capital to come over here and finance this for us because we do not have it inherently in our system again that is a natural equation in economics it is very simple it is fairly easily understood by those are involved though the language barriers often get in our way while our interest rates are nowhere near the extraordinarily high interest rates of 7 or 8 years ago when they went right through the ceiling we have had even though we had what we thought were modest rates of april 2 7 1987 congre maybe 7 v2 percent prime and 9 percent for some home mortgages and so on they just a month or so ago those rates are expand still significantly higher than the in not grc terest rates paid around the rest of the our pr world at the present time and have much been for some time that againis re counte quired if we are going to attract they money over here in orde why do we need the money over pay ofi here well we need it in part to fi dresst nance our business expansion because in the we have to have more liquidity here open u than we have generated in this coun kets if try unless we want to really inflate by stagnai literally printing more money with a like to truly extraordinarily loose monetary the ec policy help u we have to have it here in order to momer sell our public debt offerings how we crease

expanc americans many of them are bought sell m by our banks and other institutions and in mary but in order to carry the kind of in cen deficits that we have been carrying do wha mestically our own

communities was on its last leg from years of uncontrolled activities recognizing this tragedy the federal government joined with state and local govemments in an unprecedented effort to clean up the bay initial studies showed that pollution acted as a nutrient that enhanced rapid algae growth in the bay as the algae grew it consumed greater and greater quantities of oxygen from the water of course madne life found it difficult to survive in an environment with a diminished oxygen supply surprisingly we learned that one of the greatest sources for this pollution was in the form of runoff from agricultural pesticide use animal waste from feed lots and poultry operations and everyday use of chemicals and detergents in homes and businesseslocated hundreds of miles away from the bay the problem was much more complex than we had ever imagined this realization led to two important events in december of 1987 the environmental protection agency the states of virginia maryland and

amendment to h r 5210 the omnibus drug initiative act of 1988 this amendment would establish a new limited incentive grant program to encourage states to promote stricter more effective laws to counter drunk driving it would authorize federal seen money to states to help vstablish selfsustaining drunk driving prevention programs if a state agrees to put such a program in place to be eligible for this grant money a state would have to do several things first it would have to adopt laws requiring the prompt suspension or revocation of licenses of those apprehended for drunk driving under administrative revocation procedures when a law enforcement officer has probable cause under state law to believe a driver has committed an alcoholrelated traffic offense and the driver is determined by chemical tests to exceed the legal blood alcohol concentration in that state 0 10 or if the driver refuses to submit to a test the officer will serve the driver with a written notice of suspension or revocation of the license and take the license onthespot this notice must provide information on the administrative procedures under which the state may suspend or revoke a license and will specify the rights of the driver these procedures must be established to ensure due process after notice has been served and the license has been taken the officer must immediately report to the state entity responsible for administering licenses information relevant to the action taken against the driver in the case of a driver who in a 5year periodbeginning after enactmentis determined by a chemical tests to have been driving under the influence or is determined to have refused to submit to a test the state entity responsible for administering licenses upon receiving this report shall first suspend the license for not less than 90 days if the driver is a first offender in that 5year period second suspend the license for not less than 1 year or revoke the license if the driver is a repeat offender and third provide a specific period of time in which the driver can appeal the license suspension or revocation administrative revocation of the licenses of those apprehended for drunk driving is the centerpiece of this amendment twentythree states and the district of columbia now have such administrative systems administrative license suspension acts as a tried and true deterrent to drunk driving furthermore studies have shown that in the 23 states that currently practice administrative license revocation many more drunk driving offenders are receiving a punishmentthe denial of the right to drivethan is the case in states without such laws in addition the highly respected insurance institute for highway safety recently unveiled a study of drunk driving countermeasures across the country and found that night time fatal crashes could be cut by 9 percent if all states adopt administrative revocation we are talking about thousands of lives each year second a state is eligible for a basic grant if it also establishes a selfsustaining enforcement program under which finds or surcharges collected from persons convicted of drunk driving or other nonfederal revenues are returned to communities for enforcement programs states would also be able to secure supplemental funds if they enacted the following measures first states must provide for mandatory blood alcohol testing of drivers whenever a law enforcement officer has probable cause under state law to believe that a driver involved in a fatal or serious crash has committed an alcoholrelated traffic offense the use of bac testing varies widely nationwide for instance in the state of delaware the use of bac testing is 80 percent while in mississippi it is less than 10 percent our knowledge of alcohol as a factor in highway death and injury is impaired by the lack of testing mandatory bac testing will provide a more accurate data base on which to refine our antidrunk driving countermeasures second this amendment provides incentives to the state to vigorously enforce the 21yearold minimum drinking age law passed by the congress in 1984 the results of that law thus far are impressive greater enforcement efforts at the state level such as requiring colorcoded licenses for those below the legal minimum age will enhance the lifesaving benefits of that law third states must enact laws banning open containers of alcoholic beverages in motor vehicles i would like to highlight at this point the open container provision in this amendment which my bill h r 637 contained allowing open containers in automobiles is senseless it may surprise you that in most states in this country you can have open containers of alcohol at your side while you drive in 15 states you can actually drink while driving without violating the law in 23 states passengers can drink in the car as you know 24 000 people are losing their lives to drunk driving each year as the most widely abused drug in america alcohol continues to kill an average of 65 people per day on our streets and highways which is why i feel such an urgency about promoting effective countermeasures to deal with the problem as a result of congressional action in 1984 every state has now made it illegal for young people under 21 to purchase alcohol but if we do nothing about open containers we are saying to the young people in those states that allow open containers you cant drink until you are 21 but once you get there you can drink in the drivers seati this amendment to ban open containers is simply a commonsense extension of our efforts to curb alcoholrelated death and injury on our highways finally this amendment requires the national academy of sciences to conduct studies to determine whether or not the blood alcohol concentration level at which a driver is deemed to be driving under the influence should be reduced below 0 10 percent and if so to what level and to establish standards for determining whether or not a driver is impaired by a controlled substance or any other drug the national academy of sciences is urged to submit not later than 1 year after enactment a report on the results of the study the adoption of this amendment is an opportunity to do something that we know will work about the senseless antisocial practice of drunk driving i would like to add that mothers against drunk driving the insurance institute for highway safety the national safety council state farm insurance the american insurance organization the national association of governors highway safety representatives and the national beer wholesalers association all enthusiastically support this amendment in closing i would like to say that sometimes from great tragedy great wisdom can spring we were all touched by the
