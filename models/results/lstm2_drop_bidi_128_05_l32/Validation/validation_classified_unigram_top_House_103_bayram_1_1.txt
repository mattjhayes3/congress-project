majority in both houses in effect for his program that is why his program started why it got passed he had a net tax cut in the first 4 years of about half a trillion dollars because he had a 750 billion cut in the 1981 act and that means that one defense contractorwho by the way in 3 years with a 20 billion profit paid absolutely nothing in taxes to the unitedstates government most of which he made from the government and he also signed in real dollars the highest tax increase in history including this one in 1993 dollars 308 billion it was 200 billionsome then that is what really occurred the spending was increased 1 trillion in mr reagans first 4 years to be fair with him some of that was social security but essentially the social programs were cut as everybody knows that was the reagan revolution was it not and the increases were in four areas they were in farm subsidies mr reagans farm subsidy which passed was exactly six times the size of mr carters farm program in 1980

make this country a better place to live and i think that is how he is going to be remembered i always got the feeling that to paul the richest life the fullest life is a life that is dedicated to helping others whether through the peace corps as he did in his early career or as a teacher as he did for many years before he came to the legislature in lansing and of course am a legislator here

regulations for all tour helicopters even those that fly short distances the growth of the helicopter tour industry in recent years and the lack of appropriate regulations and enforcement of these flights have resulted in serious safety and noise problems in hawaii mainly in and around the national park units white helicopter tours provide a unique way for visitors and residents to experience and appreciate hawaiis beauty and natural resources the safety and wallbeing of residents and tourists and the protection of our cultural natural and historic resources must not be jeopardized by these flights residents near the hawaii volcanoes national park report helicopters flying as low as 100 feet above the ground and daily overflights which disturb residential activity and the normally peaceful lifestyle in these remote areas flights directly over the national parks disrupt the tranquility sought by park visitors and endanger natural and cultural resources including rare and endangered plant and animal species reckless helicopter maneuvering and flights near acidic volcanic fumes put tourists and flight operators in serious danger helicopter accidents are now a frequent occurrence on the big island of hawaii where the lure of the active volcano has increased the number of helicopter tours into this very area unfortunately it has taken several highprofile accidents in recent months to attract serious attention to this problem my bill h r 1696 seeks to set forth a fair and balanced resolution by establishing flightfree zones in certain areas of the hawaiis national park system and setting a minimum altitude of 2 000 feet for helicopter and fixedwinged flights over all other segments of the park system this mechanism has been used in other parks such as the grand canyon to address similar problems specifically my bill prohibits flights over kaloko honokohau national historical park puu honua o honaunau national historical park puu kohola helau national historic site and kalaupapa national historical park it establishes the crater district klpahulu valley and the adjacent rain forest within the haleakala national park as flightfree zones and requires a 2mile standoff distance from the sliding sands trailhead within the hawaii volcanoes national park the bill designates the certain wildemess areas including mauna loa olas forest east rift and kau desert the summit of kilauea and the coastal area between kaaha and kamoamoa as flightfree zones in addition the bill establishes a 2mile standoff distance from the chain of craters corridor and the kamoamoa village sites within this park in addition the bill seeks to address safety issues that affect all flights not only those over the national parks by requiring shortterm sightseeing flights which begin and end at the same airport and are conducted within a 25mile radius to comply with stricter federal aviation administration flight standards under current faa regulation these types of sightseeing flights are exempt from certain flight operation aircraft and equipment flight crew member and weather requirement regulations that apply to most other commercial operators there is no doubt that the commercial helicopter tour industry is important in our tourist driven economy however regulations must be implemented and enforced to assure that this industry can provide a safe and enjoyable service which is in harmony with the residents and natural resources ofour islands this is an urgent matter that demands immediate attention i urge the congress to take swift action on this

political operation but the fed does not merely lobby congress it feels its influence is so great and congress so in its thrall that it can bend the truth and mislead us if our questions get uncomfortable or the facts may be embarrassing i recently discovered a particularly illuminating conversation between arthur burns and paul volcker which reveals how the former chairman of the federal reserve and the former president of the new york federal reserve bank respectively plotted and conspired to try to mislead the congress they hoped that by releasing only portions of the federal reserve documents requested by the banking committee that the committee would not notice the omission this subterfuge is revealed in the fomc minutes that federal reserve chairman burns left at the gerald r ford presidential library in ann arbor mi does this sound familiar these were the same tactics the fed used just last year to cover up its records this particular deception was openly discussed during the november 16 1976 fomc meeting at that time the banking committee was trying to obtain 3 years worth of minutes from the board of directors meetings with the 12 federal reserve banks to learn about the immense power that the banking industry wields by way of these federal reserve banks the regional federal reserve banks are run by boards of directors twothirds of whom are elected by the very banks they regulate these directors have great power to regulate the industry that elects them they initiate actions related to bank holding companies such as permission for acquisitions of competing banks and the directors approve federal reserve loans through the discount window to banks in their districts this setup provides fertile ground for possible conflicts of interest since the fed can pass out favors and punishments to those it wants to keep in line for decades the fed has orchestrated and executed a fullscale lobbying effort on capitol hill conscripting the very banks it regulates to act as its chorus this lobbying has been going on for decades but the fed has been able to hide this because the minutes of the directors meetings are pitifully incomplete and not publicly available it is also something the fed camouflages whenever it defends its right to continue regulating the banks and bank holding companies instead of turning these duties over to the new autonomous bank regulatory agency currently being proposed by the administration today the fed promises its flock that it will continue to be the friendly regulatorand that is reason enough to oppose reform the fed does not just lobbyit feels free to lie the transcript of the november 16 1976 fomc meeting reveals that president volcker and chairman burns decided to omit the attachments to the minutes that were delivered to the house banking committee fed governor lawrence k roos asked how do we protect ourselves from the reverse of giving meaningful information to him new york federal reserve bank president volcker said well the important thing to protect here is the attachments to the minutes in our case theyre very long minutes and they include a great many sensitive as well as a great many dull things chairman burns replied well you see if a question were raised about attachment later on then these understandings if they hold and i assure you that ill do everything in my power to achieve that objective that would apply to the attachment the counsel to the chairman of the federal reserve thomas j oconnell then warned that it might be necessary to include some attachments because they are referred to in the minutes if you start including some attachments but not others then to the extent that mr reuss staff is less imaginative than i hope they will be you will ignite imagination of one or another of his numerous troublemakers the 1976 pattern of deception is alive and well today in 1992 i asked for and received minutes of the boards of directors meetings of the 12 federal reserve banks from recent years were complete documents sent what can the public and the congress expect from the federal reserve i have to wonder because the record is not encouraging it is long past time to put an end to the secrecy that allows the federal reserve to escape accountability i recently shared the notes of the burnsvolcker discussion with former house banking committee chairman henry reuss he expressed shock at the fact that the fed attempted to mislead him who can blame him the fed similarly tried to deceive me about its fomc records this is why i am urging you my colleagues to support legislation mandating complete disclosure of what is said at the feds eight annual monetary policy meetings to do any less is to give the fed license to pull the wool over the congress eyes something the central bank is appearently willing to try if the facts are embarassing to the fed my bill h r 28 the federal reserve system accountability act of 1993 requires prompt release of fomc monetary policy changes and timely release of a detailed record of fomc meetings the bill also calls for the gao to examine substantial parts of federal reserve operations which are now restricted from inspection anyone who wants to drop a curtain of secrecy over the kind of stealth the fed engages in does not understand how the fed has abused and misused its privileged position accountability is the first duty of responsibility for as lord acton observed those who need not be accountable eventually become corrupt the material referred to follows tjoc may i urge then that to the extent executive committee minutes would be included that the same right and function of withdrawal and exclusion from those be followed cb oh yes absolutely roos how do we protect ourselves from the reverse of giving meaningful information to him if he has too little information he comes back and says one of two things either were highly say in thecase we do nothing or we are so secretive in our activities that we dont dare put down our nefarious activities i mean it seems to me hes got us either way if he wants to play that game and i dont know it cb well i dont know if there is any protection and i would not be at all surprised if a byproduct of this fishing expedition turned out to be a strong recommendation by mr reuss possibly by his entire committee possible a piece of legislation that he would introduce as to the character of minutes i would not be surprised in the future first a condemnation and then laying the basis you see for this request as to the future well gentlemen thats the kind of world we live in and i dont think that this environment in which we function that its going to change very quickly nor am i ready to predict that its going to improve this year any question comment criticism of this procedure i havent sent this letter yet bartee i would consider it very fortunate if you can get it off and get it acceptedvolcker well the important thing to protect here is the attachments to the minutes in our case theyre very long minutes and they include a great many sensitive as well as a great many dull things cb well you see if a question were raised about attachments later on then these understandings if they hold and i assure you that ill do everything in my power to achieve that objective that would apply to the attachments in other words if lets say reuss asks later on for the attachment these categories of exclusion and separate filings it wouldthese attachments would be handled in exactly the same way as the body of the minutes but lets not anticipate too much there is still ive said this 3 4 5 times already theres still a possibility mr reuss will acquire other interests in the course of the year one of the difficulties of course here is you know thats part of the world we live in mr reuss may well acquire other interests he has a very large staff i think theyve put in long hours thinking up ways you see of harassing etc volcker the trouble is hes got a big enough staff so one of them could make this his personal interest cb oh yes tjoc before closing may i touch on a matter that mr volcker has remarked about the attachments again its quite possible that a board of directors minutes will contain a reference to that boards recent action in recommending a discount rate for the board and the boards response thereto attached as exhibit a its quite possible thats the very type of attachment you would want to exhibit to mr reuss consistent with the position youve taken all along with respect to the roll that the bank directors play in this action of monetary policy so that at the very outset we may be including specific attachments as we review these minutes i didnt cb well lets think very carefully about that if you start including some attachments but not others then to the extent that mr reuss staff is less imaginative than i hope they will be you will ignite imagination of one or another of his numerous troublemakers tjoc in a way youve done that when youve included the executive committee minutes cb well executive committee meetings are different as i think that mr volcker explained that better than i did that there are executive committee functions for the board and at times meetings of the executive committee are virtually indistinguishable from fall board meetings tjoc all right sir cb any thing else gentlemen on this weve had two unsavory subjects for discussion and if there is no further question or comment lets drink coffee and that

be encouraged to take aggressive actions against neighbor nations they might be encouraged to test us they will not do it unless they have a reasonably good chance of success for instance let me give

support of h r 2518 amid the many contentious issues contained within this legislation which we will debate today i think it is important to point out the important programs research and funding for which this legislation rovides indeed many of the programs funded under these departments are the daytoday lifeline programs so crucial to millions of americans foremost the lions share of funding contained in h r 2518 is designated spending for medicare and medicaid these are the dollars which support the federal share of the medicaid program and subsidize the medicare health services for our sick elderly while it is in fashion today to decry entitlement spending and slash medicare and medicaid spending for budget purposes we cannot lose sight of the essential purposes served by these programsfor beneficiaries this is often the only link they have to health care and medical services i do not mean to imply that these programs are unflawed nor that their growth need not be controlled but i stand firm in my commitment that health care policy and health care reform must be made on the issues of access and quality of health carenot a costbenefit exercise or balance sheet earlier this year i fiercely and vocally opposed the proposed cuts in medicare programs contained within reconciliation as i have long held we cannot try to tell our aging americans that all we have to do is ratchet down on waste fraud and abuse and cut the fees of those so called rich doctors and expensive hospitals and we will be able to cut costs and maintain quality health care that is just not so already the medicare program is losing its ability to attract and maintain the participation of quality providers furthermore it is painfully clear that shortfalls in medicare payments to hospitals and doctors will be costshifted and passed directly to every other insured american that means that over the next 2 years americans who have managed to hold on to health insurance will pick up 28 billion in medicare shortfalls to hospitals another 20 billion in underpayments to doctors and other providers will be costshifted to paying americans so as long as we as a nation do not turn the sick and injured away from our hospitalsso long as we are not leaving them to die in the streetsthe cost of caring for these patients will not go away only shifted to other insured patients this is exhibit a as to why we need to address the causes of our health care crisis not merely attach the symptoms todays legislatlon demonstrates our commitment to medicare and medicaid and funds more than 100 billion for these health care programs while we are not enacting changes in these statutes it is timely to once more remindmy colleagues that we cannot use these programs as sources for draconian budget cuts without question we need health care reform but not one which balances the budget on our most frail members of societythe sick elderly i am also pleased to see record levels of funding the national institutes of health including 2 1 billion for the national cancer institute these dollars will allow continued prevention research vaccine development treatment study and clinical experimentation toward eradicating this scourge the committee has reemphasized its support of ncis focus on breast cancer and prostate cancer research and rightly so more than 46 000 women die of breast cancer every year and one in eight women will suffer breast cancer in her lifetime this plague has hit especially hard in the northeast region of the united states and my own state of new jersey and i fully support efforts of nci to find the reasons and causesnd ultimately the curefor this terror at the same time more than 35 000 men will die of prostate cancer with more than 165 000 new cases diagnosed in 1993 i commend the recommendation of the committee that nci make prostate cancer another top priority in its research and mission the national institute of mental health also deserves recognition today i am confident nimh will make good use of the 613 million funded in fiscal year 1994 for its research and research training on mental disorders treatments and services and i laud the institutes efforts to educate federal local and state organizations as to the importance of mental health and the destigmatization of mental illness nimhs research continues to show us that mental illness is a real and physical one not some character flaw or personality demon that we cannot work to help or treat but a tangible physical health problem as real as diabetes cancer or a broken leg the work of nimh allows us so move past the dark ages of health care and move past the snake pit treatment of mental illness as congress addresses comprehensive health care reform i will be working to ensure that any reform plan provides equitable treatment for mental illness and party of health care insurance benefits and coverage for persons with mental illness nimhs pioneering research in this field has made clear what so many of us have known all along and sets the stage for future good work finally congress today is taking steps to make good on its promise in the ryan white care act to provide funding aids patients care intervention efforts and most notably emergency assistance to cities the committee has provided 318 million in emergency funding for especially hardhit cities and metropol tan areas and make no mistake my colipagues evry one of those dollars are especially needed the aids epidemic continues to grow and our public hospitals and health care resources are falling under this burden our emergency rooms in inner city hospitals are mash units today and the situation is worsening the lack of health services poverty and social dysfunction compounds this crisis as the cost of each aids patient reaches 100 000 over their lifetime the ryan white dollars cannot alleviate these problems or hope to pay every cost but our neglect can only further speed the collapse of our public health care system today aids is no longer a disease affecting the margins of societythe rate of increase of new cases shows us that every segment of society is touched by aids and every member of society bears those costs my colleagues these are but some of the worthy efforts contained in thi years appropriation i am certain that each line of this bill

on a very important bill in congress there is an amendment that i plan to support and i urge my colleagues to support and that is the one offered by the gentleman from florida his amendment actually has different components to it but i wanted to touch on just a few of them one of them is that it gives states federal funds if they adopt truthinsentencing laws and part of the truthinsentencing requirement is that violent criminals serve at least 85 percent of their sentence what truthinsentencing laws are all about is they are trying to get to this revolving door problem we are having in prisons right now currently the average criminal only serves 37 percent of the time that he or she is sentenced for and under the mccollum amendment states that adopt truthinsentencing laws would have to require that the criminals serve 85 percent of their time if we think in terms of bringing us down to a human element i have a constituent right now who had a daughter who was raped very tragic she was at home she was watching her infant child at the time 10 oclock in the morning and the rapist broke into her house threatened to hurt or possibly kill the baby unless the mama cooperated well she did cooperate fortunately i guess he was caught unfortunately before he was caught he had raped somebody else the average rapist according to some statistics is sentenced for 8 years and serves only 3 that rapist is then back on the streets and will be back on the streets how would my colleagues like to be the mother how would they like to be the father how would they like to be the grandparents or the child this is what we are talking about we are talking about violent criminals going back on the street we are also debating this three strikes and you are out there are no strikes we are talking victims what we are saying is three victims and then you go to jail for a long period of time what i am saying is if we on the very first offense have truth in sentencing the likelihood of these criminals being back out on the street to commit violent crimes has greatly been reduced because we are protected from them because they are isolated from us safely behind bars now another component of the mccollum amendments is to allow the victims or the victims families to make a statement at the time of sentencing i think that is important because what we are talking about what we are becoming is a nation of victims and we need to know what it is like to come home and find out your loved one will never be home because he or she was murdered or what does a rape do to a family situation we had in the neighborhood that i live in several years ago or excuse me a town that i represent a newlywed couple and actually they had not gotten married they were engaged they were picking out furniture and rearranging their new apartment and the woman was at home alone and she thought the moving men were coming in and it turned out a rapist came in a rapist came in and raped her right there 2 weeks before her wedding day would it not be fair to giveher and her family and people like that in those situations an opportunity to make a statement at the time of sentencing can we not bring the element of victims rights into the formula because we in congress often so often debate compassion and i heard one speaker today talk about the moral side of an issue well let us go all the way if we are going to be compassionate if we are going to worry about the moral side let us give the victims an opportunity to make a statement i think because of that the mccollum amendments are certainly proper and they make the crime bill a better bill which is what we want to do i think that it is important that we as a congress work on crime in a bipartisan fashion as i sat here and i listened to the debates over the last 8 hours everybody wants to have a tough crime bill everybody 435 members of both parties of all philosophies of all sections of the country that being the case

population continue at an alarming rate the serb strategy is to make life so unbearable for the 90 percent of the population that is ethnic albanian that they will flee kosova to find a better life

you want someone stationed in your house in my view their answer is the strongest argument in favor of sending peacekeepers to kosova in fact i believe we should go further the united states
