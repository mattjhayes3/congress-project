proposal the democratic alternative is fiscally responsible and uses the surplus in a fiscally responsible manner to strengthen social security and medicare and pay off the entire national debt by 2013 all while ensuring that those truly in need of tax relief receive it the marriage tax penalty occurs when both spouses earn approximately equal incomes the democratic substitute spends less of the budget surplus and provides true marriage penalty relief the marriage penalty relief in the democratic alternative is 89 1 billion over ten years it provides for an increase in the standard deduction for married couples filing jointly to twice the level for single filers and an exemption from the alternative minimum tax amt further it grants couples a 2 000 increase in the beginning and ending income phaseout levels for families claiming the earned income tax credit eitc in 2001 and a permanent 2 500 increase starting in 2002 the marriage penalty occurs in cases where a couple may pay more taxes because they file jointly than they would as two single people because the rate brackets and standard deduction for joint filers are not twice as large as those for single filers some couples find that some of their income is taxed at a higher rate alternatively if a couple has very different incomes or only one spouse works the couple gets a marriage bonus a recent treasury department study estimated that roughly 48 percent of couples pay a marriage penalty and 42 percent get a marriage bonus as drafted h r 6 would give the lions share of its tax cuts to higherincome families including those who currently suffer no marriage tax penalty the average tax cut for families with incomes less than 50 000 would be about 149 per year while families with higher incomes would get an average tax cut of nearly 1000 per year further once fully phased in nearly 70 percent of the benefit will be enjoyed by couples earning more than 70 000 annually even if they suffered no marriage penalty under existing law more importantly under the republican plan nearly half of americas families with two children would receive nothing or less than the tax relief promised this

margin a prescription drug package for seniors this was not an issue that just came into place from 1995 on so i guess a question would be asked why havethe democrats made this such a major issue when they had prior to 1995 an opportunity to solve this issue themselves when they were in the majority in the house and they had the presidency i think it is easy to criticizesomeone elses plan but we offered a plan and it passed the house so let us talk about the difference between the two plans the demorat plan provides less choice because it would provide seniors with a onesizefitsall government plan the republican bill h r 4680 would give beneficiaries a choice between at least two private sector drug plans it would allow beneficiaries to choose plans that best suit their needs our plan is marketbased rather than relying on the government to run the plan now why is this so important because we know that one of the overwhelming components of any plan that we offer is that it should provide individual choice for our seniors choice must be the centerpiece i believe of whatever plan we adopt here in the house now how affordable are these plans let us look at these two plans and see what they actually provide seniors h r 4680 which was passed by the house on june 28 the republican plan uses private insurance companies as the vehicle to begin prescription drug coverage for seniors over 65 this plan provides taxpayer subsidies to encourage insurers to offer policies with premiums estimated as low as 35 a month participation is voluntary that is something else important seniors taking part can choose between at least two plans all plans start with a 250 deductible it would establish the medicare benefits administration a new agency to run this program volume buying that would be generated is expected to even lower the cost the legislation covers 100 percent of drug and premium costs for couples with incomes up to 15 200 and singles with income up to 11 300 for all participants it covers at least half of drug costs up to 2 100 annually and 100 percent of outofpocket costs over 6 000 the bill is projected to cost just under 40 billion over 5 years and the money has already been set aside in our budget just for this purpose in other words my colleagues it is already paid for that is the republican plan now let us look at the democrat plan that the house defeated here currently seniors pay a premium and receive reimbursement for a portion of their doctor and hospital costs through medicare under the democrats plan they would use the new government benefit to reduce the cost of pharmaceutical drugs now what does this mean the democrat plan puts government in charge of seniors prescription drug through the health care financing administration hcfa they run medicare now the government would choose and control a drug purchasing contractor for every region of the country in other words a new government onesizefitsall program this is key because a recent survey of seniors with drug coverage found that by a margin of 2 to 1 they preferred private insurance coverage to government price controls that being said the democrats rmeasure offers premiums that would range from 25 to 35 month but with no deductible medicare would reimburse half of drug costs up to 2 000 annually and all costs above 4 000 per year however the real question my colleagues our seniors are faced with is who do they trust to run their prescription drug program the government or the private sector do they want to make their own choices and control how their money is spent or do they want a governmentrun plan that leaves them without any say about what works best for them i believe the choice is clear we offer a plan here the republicans that is voluntary universal affordable with choice and security for those seniors who are happy with what they have they do not have to participate but those that do can i believe we can and must work

the purchase utility would have incurred if it had generated the electricity itself or had purchased it from a source other than the qf unfortunately this has not proven to be the case because

electric industry by granting special status to some electricity generators but not others purpa encourages the creation of uneconomic projects just to qualify for purpa benefits moreover purpa was premised on utilities continuing to be the exclusive suppliers of electricity to all consumers within their franchise territories in many states today customers have the ability to choose their own electric supplier requiring utilities to purchase new purpa power when they may no longer have retail customers to whom they can resell power makes no sense with 20 years of experience behind us it is clear that purpa has outlived its usefulness my legislation would do three things to reform purpa 1 it would prospectively repeal purpas mandatory purchase obligation on the date of enactment so that there would no longer be any new obligations to purchase this power 2 it would respect the sanctity of existing purpa contracts and 3 it would ensure that purchasing utilities would continue to be permitted to recover the costs of existing purpa contracts as long as these contracts are in effect as i said upon introduction of virtually identical legislation during the last two congresses my only interest in introducing this bill lies in achieving the most efficient and most costeffective means of electric generation for americas consumers while it would prospectively repeal purpa and would ensure that no new purpa contracts would be required it recognizes the legitimate current expectations of qf developers and utility purchasers i believe that it represents a broad based consensus on this important issue and i would urge that this measure be included in whatever electric industry legislation might be considered by this congress"], [0.8367292881011963,

a very important issue one that matters to people in my district in northwestern pennsylvania and to all users of the medicare program throughout the united states whether they are seniors or individuals with disabilities we are talking of course about the bipartisan effort to revise the medicare program and to include prescription drugs my intention tonight along with a couple of my colleagues is to clear away the partisan smoke to clear away the rhetoric and to focus on what is really being proposed and the potential for a true bipartisan approach to extending prescription drugs under the medicare program modern medicine is using drug therapies more and more to prevent and treat chronic health problems this is the 21st century a trip to the pharmacy is far better than a trip to the operating room we no longer practice medicine as our grandfathers or even our fathers once experienced nor should we continue to offer seniors the limited medicare program that our grandfathers and fathers knew we need to revise the program and expand it and rethink it medicare is essentially a standard benefit program from the 1960s and it needs a facelift we started that process in recent years by extending medicare benefits to include a variety of new procedures but we need among other things fundamentally we must modernize this benefit to provide prescription drug coverage now i had the privilege of being appointed by the speaker to serve on his prescription drug task force we generated a blueprint and an outline which we thought could form the basis of a bipartisan prescription drug initiative and indeed it has the house bipartisan prescription drug plan is a billiondollar marketoriented approach targeted at updating medicare and providing prescription drug coverage after all how many of us would give our employers health plan a second look if it did not include coverage for prescription drugs but that is what we have been asking americas seniors to do we must take the steps necessary to ensure that seniors have access to affordable prescription drugs throughout america what we have done is create a plan which invests 40 billion of the nonsocial security surplus to strengthen medicare and offer prescription coverage to every beneficiary this is after all 5 2 billion more than what the president had proposed and it was included in a budget resolution that we passed in this house over fierce resistance from house democrats the bipartisan prescription drug plan that we have created will provide lower drug prices while expanding access to lifesaving drugs for all seniors many of us had carefully examined the presidents proposal and in doing so felt that we could improve on it and do better and provide seniors with a richer benefit and the flexibility to choose a plan that best meets their needs under this bipartisan plan seniors and persons with disabilities will not have to pay the full price for their prescriptions and will have access to the specific drug brand name or generic that their doctor prescribes this plan provides medicare beneficiaries with real bargaining power through group purchasing discount and pharmaceutical rebates meaning that seniors can lower their drug bills up to 39 percent these will be the best prices on the drugs that they need not some government bureaucracy that may not offer the drug that the doctor prescribed studies have shown that a small portion of the senior population consume a majority of prescription drugs making them extremely difficult to insure and driving up costs for everyone under our prescription drug plan the government would share in insuring the sickest seniors creating a stoploss mechanism making the risk more manageable for private insurers by sharing the risk and the cost associated with caring for the sickest beneficiaries premiums would be lowered for every beneficiary we address skyrocketing drug costs by providing medicare beneficiaries with real bargaining power through private health care plans which can purchase drugs at discount rates our plan provides options to all seniors options that allow all seniors to choose affordable coverage that does not compromise their financial security the plan benefits all seniors even though it is not a subsidy for a millionaires mother it provides the prospect of more affordable coverage for every senior seniors will have the right to choose a coverage plan that best suits their needs through a voluntary and universally offered benefit we realize that the left wing of the house democratic caucus is violently opposed to giving seniors that choice but we disagree with them those that are happy with their current coverage will be able to keep that plan without any difficulty others who need to supplement existing benefits or state programs or who are without coverage can also choose from a variety of competing drug plans keeping rural seniors in mind our plan guarantees at least two drug plans that will be available in every area of the country with the government serving as the insurer of last resort clearly we do not depend exclusively on hmos or on private insurance as has been alleged the plan also requires convenient access to pharmacies allowing beneficiaries to use their local pharmacy or have their prescriptions filled by mail this plan protects seniors at 135 percent below the poverty level matching the eligibility contained in the presidents plan that means a single senior making less than 11 272 or a couple making less than 15 187 a year will receive 100 percent federal assistance for lowincome seniors including 100 percent full reimbursement for premiums like the presidents proposal this bipartisan plan also includes reimbursement phaseouts exceeding the poverty line for those between 135 percent and 150 percent of poverty medicare will pay part of their premiums and their copayments would be covered under medicare yet the presidents plan shoehorns seniors many of them who have already private drug coverage which they are happy with into what i would call a onesizefitsfew plan with washington bureaucrats in control of their benefits our plan our bipartisan plan gives all seniors the right to choose an affordable prescription drug benefit that best fits their own health care needs by making it available to everyone we are making sure that no senior citizen or disabled american falls through the cracks the plan also provides coverage and security against outofpocket drug costs for every medicare beneficiary any senior spending 6 000 a year or more will have 100 percent of their drug costs covered by medicare no longer will seniors be forced to drain their savings in order to pay for the prescriptions on which their lives depend the presidents plan does not reflect any coverage for those seniors who pay high drug costs although we now understand that belatedly the president has leaped forward panicked and is now offering a catastrophic benefit as an addon but that was not his original proposal the congressional budget office has estimated that if the president were to add such coverage it will double the cost of the plan and or double the premiums seniors would pay the president leaves those who face the highest drug costs out in the cold in his original plan choosing between paying the bills or buying lifesaving nedicines in addition private employers under our plan would be given the option to buy into the federal program in order to enhance their current plans or to begin offering a drug benefit to their employees states would be allowed to choose to enhance their existing plans with the federal coverage while not jeopardizing the existing coverage that their residents have this includes programs such as the pace program in pennsylvania but in adding a prescription drug benefit we also modernize medicare to ensure its longterm solvency the plan ensures that seniors and disabled americans will continue to have access to lifesaving drug therapies in recent years scientific and medical research has resulted in 400 new medications to treat the top killers of seniors heart disease cancer and stroke a marketoriented approach ensures that the quality of care that beneficiaries receive will continue to be second to none the plan takes vital steps toward improving medicare as a whole it expedites the appeals process by mandating that appeals that used to take an average of 400 days now take less than a quarter of that time after all to some seniors every minute counts but on top of that the plan removes this part of medicare from the washington bureaucracy that has haunted and nearly bankrupted the system the health care financing administration which the last speaker had quoted extensively in his comments will not control the prescription drug benefit under our plan we create a medicare benefit administration within the department of health and human services to manage prescription drug plans autonomously this reform is fundamental to safeguard the new program and to allow it to realize its potential free from interference from the bureaucracy we would also remove medicare choice plans from under hcfa and put under the control of this agency giving it more flexibility and stability president clinton has attacked the bipartisan plan primarily because he knows it offers richer more encompassing benefits and greater flexibility than the plan he has proposed while dealing with the needs of people with diverse circumstances the presidents plan would force as many as 9 million seniors out of their existing programs for drug coverage because the employers would be dropping or limiting their prescription drug coverage instead of allowing the government to take over as babyboomers retire 40 million medicare beneficiaries could lose their current drug coverage under the presidents plan as time goes on the coverage offered by the president dwindles as the cost of the program for seniors skyrockets under his plan seniors see as little as a 12 percent savings on drug costs under his plan seniors would pay more for premiums more fees for services all while the president spends more than was ever budgeted for the program about 69 percent of americas seniors have some prescription drug coverage currently many of them need more help but it is the remaining 31 percent that worry me the most a stronger medicare program with prescription drug coverage is a promise of health security and financial security for older americans and we are working to ensure that promise is kept americas seniors deserve no less house republicans believe that americans should be spending their golden years concerned about what time the grandchildren are coming to visit or is the rain ruining their walk in the park they should not be concerned with how they are going to pay for the medicines that allow them to enjoy life i am joined in this sentiment by a number of members

maybe it is their spouse someone they love relying on their insurance coverage and a sense of security they have drawn from that at a moment of medical stress and they are scared they are terrified that dad is not getting the right care that their baby is not getting the right procedures they have doubts they have concerns they have worries and they are frantic with fear not only does the patient but the patients family deserves to have an answer now from medical professionals now i must know if dad is not getting the right treatment what can we do to change it the gentleman from ohio responds to that he says the patients wellbeing and that peace of mind of the family comes before the doctors comes before the trial lawyers comes before the health care provider comes before everything and that is what he provides an immediate comprehensive compelling review by medical professionals that says we give the right necessary treatment and we give it now how could anybody turn away from that and say instead to that distressed mother or father or husband or daughter no we would rather give you our promise that 6 months from now or maybe a year we will get you on the docket

so that veterans in certain geographical areas and age groups are no longer shortchanged by this funding mechanism quite simply we simply need to put e the big e equity back into vera regrettably vera paints veterans services with a broad brush leaving very little if any room for significant examination waiting costs associated with health care vera is a mathematical formula that essentially calculates how much a va network will receive based on the raw number of veterans and whether their health care needs are basic or complex the formula fails utterly fails to take into account the age and perhaps most importantly the specific type of illnesses faced by the various veterans populations for example in new jersey our veterans are the second oldest group of veterans in the nation if we quantify it by state as we all know with age comes a plethora of health care problems many of them more costly to treat in our network alone 52 percent of veterans are over the age of 65 compared to 44 percent on the average and i heard even earlier that many of these people and they do many of our veterans do move south and end up living in florida they happen to be the healthier ones those who have the means as well as the health to go down to florida often by driving and to have either a second home there or to actually up stakes and move there the sicker ones and the poorer people the more indigent stay in new jersey and new york and they seek to use the services of the va they are the ones who cannot move so it is not just age it is also their costs their situation we have an explosion of things like cancer in our state those folks are not moving to florida they are seeking to get their health care right at their veterans administration and now they are finding the va has to do more with less it is a 1year moratorium we are asking for this has only been in place since 1997 it is not working i happen to be the vice chairman of the committee on veterans affairs we have looked at this i have sat with for hours with va officials both instate as well as down here and i am totally dissatisfied with their answers and i think i find it regrettable that some of my friends from florida are standing up and saying it is okay down here we are losing and poor indigent and very sickly veterans are the ones that are the net losers we are not going to stand by and allow it and

are no longer shortchanged by this funding mechanism quite simply we need to put the e equityback into vera regrettably vera paints veterans services with a broad brush leaving very littleif anyroom

more costly in the new jersey part of our network alone 58 of veterans are over the age of 65 compare this with a nationwide average of 44 however the vera formula makes no allowance for this disproportionate representation of aging veterans a veterans decision to stay in new jersey or the northeast for that matter should not mean that their va health care network is forced to do more with less veterans should not be forced to wait for weeks on end to see a primary care doctor or specialist as has been the case with increasing frequency in my state as a result of vera similarly vera fails to specifically weigh the type of medical treatment required in the varying networks for instance the va has mandated treatment of veterans with hepatitis c in new jersey alone the va is treating 12 to 15 veterans per month who have tested positive for hepatitis c with a treatment cost of 15 000 per patient failing to take into account that we have a high rate of hepatitis c in our network as well as a high rate of aids cases vera punishes new jersey and the larger network that we are in for treating all veterans not just those who use the va for an annual physical or for prescription drugs but those with serious ongoing chronic illnesses our veterans served our country in her time of need we should not forget them now simply because where they chose to spend their golden years does not nicely mesh with the vas own bureaucratic formula while vera is well intentioned the fact of the matter is that it pits veterans against each other merely on the basis of their geography in the 4th congressional district of new jersey which i have the privilege to represent veterans have felt the effects of vera first hand faced with budget cuts due to the vera formula the network administrators who oversee central and northern new jersey first responded with a knee jerk solution elimination of the specialty services at the vas clinic in brick new jersey needless to say this decision immediately mobilized the veterans of ocean and monmouth counties who joined me in fighting these cuts these specialty services whether they be rheumatology or podiatry free our veterans from being forced to spend valuable hours traveling great distances to see a specialist for the care they desperately need through my continued efforts to get the va to think outside the box we have managed to restore specialty services to the brick clinic this is a battle however that we should not have had to wage our veterans deserve their health care it should be reasonably accessible period they should not be held hostage to vera as they are now there is simply no question that the vera formula brought on the brick clinics ongoing financial challenges furthermore we are faced with at least a 36 million cut in our va network in the upcoming fiscal year so it is hard to see how threats to specialty services will not resume over the next several months i ask my colleagues where is the equity in a cut to central and northern new jerseys network when our veteran population is aging rapidly and will need more not less specialty services i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important amendment"], [0.0028104782104492188, 0.5028104782104492, 1, "there has been a lot of partisan talk about the tax bill and i can understand it a bill of 800 billion exploding to 3 trillion in the second 10 years does indeed put our economy at risk a bill that says lock up the social security money for social security but then take every bit of the regular general surplus or virtually all of it and pay that out as tax cuts regardless of whether that surplus actually arises pay it out lock it into the law that could be regarded as fiscally irresponsible by many of us on the democratic side of the aisle and of course there are many partisans who would recognize that if we do not use the opportunity to pay off the debt now while the babyboomers are in their peak earning years that when the babyboomers retire there will not be any capacity to use general fund revenues to help make social security last through its most challenging demographic era and that as a result we will hear the cries at the first economic hiccup for cuts in social se curity or increases to fica taxes yes indeed with all that fiscal irresponsibility and all that risk to the social security system some democrats decry the bill in the most partisan terms but do my colleagues know we should not just decry the bill because as a tax lawyer i was just amazed by it as i read each provision how is it that they could write a tax bill giving 45 percent of the benefit to only one percent of the people in the country we should not decry the bill we should be impressed by its draftsmanship let us talk about some of the amazing provisions of this bill this is a bill that turns to 50 million americans at the base of our economic pyramid and says they get a tax cut of 8 cents per day per family split it up at the breakfast table all 8 cents a day of course a tax cut of over 54 000 a year to each family in the top one percent so how are they able to achieve such a dramatic result one example they take and give to american companies that shift jobs overseas 60 times the benefits that they provide to 50 million americans they do this by changing the interest allocation rules so that those companies that make equity investments abroad that is to say build factories in other countries and while perhaps closing them down in the united states benefit they get huge tax breaks whereas it is 8 cents a day for the working poor and for the lower middle class in the united states but when we get to the details there are some other provisions that are almost as striking for example there is a list of special deals for the oil companies such as allowing a 5year carryback of nols while the rest of the business world only gets a 3year carryback suspending the 65 percent taxable income limitation on the use of percentage depletion allowing geological and geophysical cost to be deducted current while good accounting practice calls for those costs to be capitalized allowing delay rentals to be deducted currently when the proper accounting for them is to be capitalized and modifying the refining threshold in section 613 d 4 so that integrated oil companies can get the benefits previously reserved for independent oil companies and wildcatters and here is a special deal for oil where they get twice the benefit of all of the benefits that we give to 50 million americans goes to just a few american oil companies and that they get a tax credit for the money they pay to saudi arabia and kuwait for taking the oil out of those desert sands they get reimbursed for what they spend for the oil that they then sell to us as 20 years as a cpa and 2 years as a tax judge i know tax fraud when i see it and this republican tax bill indeed is tax fraud it is a giant shift of wealth to the wealthiest one percent of americans we should reject it"], [0.0033159852027893066, 0.5033159852027893, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i rise today to offer an amendment to title t requiring states to have their own statefunded land acquisition budgets in order to receive funding under the stateside land and water conservation fund while the current state conservation grants program provides matching grants to states and through states to local units of government for the acquisition and development of public h2900 outdoor recreation areas in and other projects the states often do not match these funds with direct funding in fact few states actually use state revenues for land acquisition according to a study by the lincoln institute of land policy only 14 states fund these programs in their state budgets by direct appropriation many have special bond funds lottery revenues or even inkind contributions in providing their required match this fact is especially disconcerting when we learn that every state in the nation has a balanced budget and many actually have large budget surpluses including california and alaska with 3 billion each as a surplus the states stand to receive billions of dollars in federal funding under the provisions of this bill for 15 years my amendment simply requires that they match these state land acquisition funds with their own revenues i urge my colleagues to support this amendment basically it makes the state responsible if they are going to receive the federal funds they should have a program to match it with state revenues of course if the purpose of this bill is to protect the resources as we have heard over and over tonight to enhance the states ability to acquire and protect the land resources in each of the respective states they would want to have their own money it seems to me they would want to have a plan i think this is a very reasonable amendment and ensures that there will be good management of the federal dollars that would be available i urge a yes vote for this amendment"], [0.0034279823303222656, 0.5034279823303223, 1, "i rise to support the gejdenson resolution to authorize the nato action in yugoslavia tragically we were unable to prevent serbian forces from brutally killing thousands of people forcing innocent people from their homes and burning and bombarding countless villages now we must do everything in our power to put an end to this tragedy to halt the mass killings and hold accountable those responsible for the unspeakable atrocities that serbian forces are committing against the ethic albanians in kosovo first we must aid the refugees in any way that we can we cannot allow refugee camps to turn into death camps due to poor sanitation the spread of disease and the lack of food and shelter i support a massive humanitarian response to this crisis the unitedstates should do whatever it takes to bring food medicine and shelter to the refugees and i support efforts by the united states and other countries to admit any refugees seeking asylum but i am afraid that is not nearly enough we have a moral obligation to protect the internally displaced ethnic albanians within kosovo those who have not yet been slaughtered must be protected we must not allow them to suffer the same fate as so many other kosovars unfortunately we did not act soon enough to address the murderous actions by serbia and today thousands of people are dead because of international indifference we ought to create safe havens for ethnic albanians inside of kosovoand we ought to do it as soon as we can this would prevent further expulsions and mass killings this will not be easy and will not be without a loss of lives but it must be done we cannot allow the leader of one nation to wipe out an entire ethnic group at the end of world war ii and the holocaust the world made a collective promise to all future people we said never again we ought to mean it however it is unlikely at this point that air strikes alone will bring an end to this conflict we ought to consider other options including the use of ground forces we now have to be prepared to forcefully enter kosovo and occupy the area in order to make the safe return of refugees possible this is not a task that we ought to take lightly but it is one that must be done nato must continue to assess the situation and make adjustments as they see fit this resolution gives the administration the flexibility to respond quickly to any new developments and continue their efforts on all fronts to resolve this conflict i urge support for this resolution"], [0.0036323070526123047, 0.4963676929473877, 1, "i rise today in support of house resolution 244 congratulating the

endowment has done a tremendous amount to help foster the arts in this country when the endowment was created we did not have the great range of the arts we now have we now have performing symphonies and ballets all over this country we have seen a tremendous growth in the arts and i believe that one of the major reasons for that is because of the challenge grants and the other programs that the endowment approved over the years the private sector looking to an entity an arts organization getting a national endowment for the arts grant is almost the good housekeeping seal of approval since the endowments were created we have seen a tremendous growth in the amount of money that the private sector contributes to the arts all over this country a few years ago we were funding the national endowment at about 170 million it was cut back dramatically today we only fund it at 98 million in fact we will have a bipartisan amendment after we take care of the stearns amendment to increase the money for the endowments in a modest way the president has requested for each of the endowments 150 million a few years ago congress had some concerns about the quality of the grants and some of the grants that were approved by the national endowment for the arts we put in very strong language saying since they cannot approve every grant that comes in use quality as a standard for judging and assessing these grants and do not let an entity get a grant and then give it to a sub grantee for some other purpose i believe that under jane alexander and mr ivey mr ferris at the humanities that we have seen managers who have seen the words from the gentleman from ohio and myself that were crafted and have implemented it we now have congressional members who are on the advisory boards of the panels to give congressional input to make sure that the american peoples voice is being heard on these issues so i think this is an amendment that congress has defeated over and over again i am confident that we will again defeat it today because i think the american people believe that the modest investment we make in the arts and i think also in the humanities is tremendously important in communities all over this country we see education education in the arts being an important item in many communities i can remember going with jane alexander to garfield high school in the city of seattle and seeing an afterschool program where the kids were doing very good high quality work in the arts the kids were enthused about it it helped us i think in dealing with crime and also furthered their education it gave them something to believe in i think that educational programs are good dale chihuly one of the worlds renowned glass artists from my district in tacoma washington has an afterschool program to teach kids how to create blown glass and create glass art these kids some of which have been juvenile delinquents swear that this has transformed their lives one they have something to do after school and two they are working in the arts in a very creative way i had a chance to go up and visit them to see their work to actually try to create glass art myself i was not as good as the kids but it really made an impression on me and showed that programs like this that are sponsored by the national endowment for the arts are truly very important to our country so i urge today that we will resist this amendment"]]}
