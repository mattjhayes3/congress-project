force protection history will not treat kindly those who embarked on a war of choice without making sure that our troops were properly equipped not enough body armor not enough jammers for protection against explosive devices not enough armored vehicles not enough overhead cover systems the list goes on and on once again congress must deal with the consequences of the bush administrations bad planning we have had to do it before in the appropriations bills and we are doing it here today with the gentleman from wisconsins motion to instruct congress has a responsibility to find out why so many things about iraq have gone so terribly wrong this republican coverup congress has never lived up to the oversight responsibility to ask the questions one of the essential elements of the force protection for example is good intelligence our nation spends billions of dollars each year on intelligence programs and activities and when they do not produce timely and reliable intelligence we make the american people less safe and congress has a duty to find out why the intelligence used as the justification for the administrations decision to go into war in iraq was wrong that iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction that was wrong i said at the time that the intelligence did not support the threat that the administration was describing but nonetheless the intelligence that they were iusing was wrong given the enormous consequences of that decision more than 2 000 american soldiers have been killed more than 15 000 wounded many of them permanently more than a quarter of a trillion dollars spent and enormous damage done to the reputation of the united states in the eyes of the world the cost of lives and limbs and taxpayer dollars and reputation is enormous congress has an obligation to identify and correct the problems that led to the production of false intelligence our troops are at risk until that is done and yet as we address other force protection issues there is no sense of urgency to undertake a thorough review of what went wrong with the intelligence neither the issue of the quality of the intelligence nor the equally important issue of whether intelligence was politicized have been investigated by this congress that is why shortly i will offer the house a chance to do more for force protection than provide the 50 million in this motion to instruct as important as that money is democrats have continually asked for investigation of prewar intelligence and those requests have been repeatedly denied the same is true for requests to investigate the other matters related to the war in iraq the prison abuse scandals the nobid halliburton reconstruction contracts the misuse of classified information to discredit administration critics each of these matters has national security implications that need to be examined particularly on the issue of going to war and the conduct of war congress has an obligation to make sure that decisions were made properly and that these decisions are based on truth and trust until the congress examines fully issues like whether intelligence was politicized we have failed in a fundamental

pioneers have included the scientists or teams that discovered many of the fundamental particles of matter and decoded the genetics of viruses but many do not know that another essential element in nsfs mission is support for science and engineering education from prek through graduate school and beyond the research that the nsf funds is thoroughly integrated with education to help ensure that there will always be plenty of skilled people available to work in new and emerging scientific engineering and technological fields and plenty of capable teachers to educate the next generation since the nsf has been a leader in stem education for more than 50 years and has established excellent evaluations for all of its programs the acc should give very strong recognition to the role nsf and its education programs play in promoting our economic competitiveness and national security and they should build upon the strengths of the nsf the treasure trove of knowledge the foundation represents should not be overlooked but in fact should be used as a base for the acc recommendations specifically i am concerned that the gostem resolution calls for minimal duplication among stem programs without defining what this means hnd also goes further than the established goals for the acc that are set out in the deficit reduction act for years i have been promoting the math and science partnership programs at the department of educationedand the national science foundation unfortunately because both agencys programs have the same name some have mistakenly thought of these programs as equivalent even though they are in name only and duplicative even though they most definitely are not i am working on legislation to change the name of the nsf program to help avoid future confusion among other differences the nsf program is designed to provide rigorous scientifically based research on what works in stem teacher professional development whereas eds program is designed to implement these ideas on the state level a wide array of teachers scientists and education researchers agree that there is much research needed in the areas addressed by the nsf math and science

better coordinate federal stem education efforts 4s needed and is very admirable however i do not want to put the cart before the horse and prefer that congress carefully consider whatever recommendations the acc puts forth before adopting them additionally the gostem resolution calls for consistent standards of evaluation while this is a laudable goal apples cannot be compared to oranges in particular i am concerned that new programs could receive failing grades since they have not had time to demonstrate results will the new smart grants a tremendous tool for bolstering the stem education pipeline receive a results not demonstrated designation as other new programs do in part reviews furthermore we should expect very different outcomes from programs that focus on student

awhile with this disease a persons ability to breathe becomes increasingly restricted and it is painful and eventually of course it results in death as we review the legislation today and as we think about what we are actually asking to be done i want us to remember there are 83 000 americans today right now that are facing this painful reality of ipf and they all cannot get a lung i was blessed to have one but not everybody can unfortunately an unknown number above and beyond those 83 000 americans succumb to its fatal outbome without even knowing they have had ipf there is little awareness of ipf and it is often missed or underdiagnosed in this nation as the gentleman from georgia pointed out it is true in fact a recent study found that ipf may be five to ten times more prevalent than we previously thought it is unknown whether this increase is due to an actual spike in the occurrence of the disease or simply a previous lack of definite guidelines for diagnosing ipf even those who are properly and quickly diagnosed as i was fortunate enough to be must face the facts that the medium survival rate for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients is 2 to 3 years i would say to the gentleman from ohio do not count on that i have a new lung i am going to be around a lot longer than that about twothirds of the ipf patients die within 5 years of developing the disease i am not going to do that i was blessed to have a new lung furthermore knowledge of this disease is hindered by very low public awareness awareness that is alarmingly low when compared to other less prevalent diseases a recent poll indicates only 29 percent of americans know the first thing about ipf half of which are familiar only with its name this resolution is a start it is an effort to make ipf

the voiceless and the vulnerable in an instant a wrong turn a sudden fall a missed step someone indeed anyone can find himself or herself in a crisis and in need of emergency medical care in california alone nearly 10 million people require emergency room care every year and of those 1 5 million arrive in critical condition in fact nationwide nearly 1 million people arrive in emergencr rooms each year unconscious or physically unable to give informed consent to their care what happens or what fails to happen in the critical precious and immediate moments after the single split second of an emergency can be the difference between healing and heartbreak between calamity and recovery between life and death consider the story of elaine sullivan a very active 71yearold woman elaine fell at home while getting into her bathtub when paramedics arrived they realized that injuries to her mouth and head had made her unable to communicate or as the hospital later discovered to give informed consent for her own care although stable for the first few days she began to slip into critical condition despite having her ddughters contact information clearly indicated on her chart the hospital failed to notify her family for 6 days tragically just hours later elaine sullivan died alone in the hospital in the aftermath of this tragedy elaine sullivans daughter jan and granddaughter laura turned their personal pain to public action jan and laura greenwald went to work to make sure that what happened to their loved one would not happen to others from their research the greenwalds learned about other incidents like their own in which families of hospitalized patients were not notified at all or notified after lengthy delay although uncommon these stories were alarming but alas they were avoidable let me be clear most hospitals notify the next of kin of unconscious emergency room arrivals relatively quickly however emergency rooms are extremely high pressure intense and sometimes chaotic environments according to statistics compiled by the american college of emergency physicians more than 88 percent of emergency room doctors surveyed reported moderate to severe overcrowding in their department in the hustle and bustle of the er despite the professionalism and dedication of staff there are real risks that a simple phone call may not be able to be made in a timely fashion in the case of elaine sullivan the phone call was not made in her memory and honor i have introduced this bill so that in the future phone calls to loved ones will always be made the bill the elaine sullivan act is sensible it requires hospitals that receive medicare funding to make reasonable efforts to contact a family member specified health care agent or surrogate decisionmaker of incapacitated patients within 24 hours of arrival at the emergency department the bill is realistic modeled after state laws in illinois and california the bill recognizes that such notifications would be difficult and even impractical in certain instances and under certain circumstances therefore the 24hour notification requirement does not apply when hospitals implement a disaster or mass casualty program or during a declared state of emergency or other local mass casualty situation the bill is constructive the legislation makes federal grants available for the next 5 years to qualified notforprofit organizations to establish and operate a national next of kin registry as a highspeed electronic free search service the voluntary registry would help hospitals and government agencies to locate family members of the injured missing and the deceased how would the registry work consider for a moment just one distressing but relevant scenario your loved one say your spouse is on a business trip she is out of state and on her own on the way she is involved in a serious headon collision unconscious and unable to communicate she is rushed to the nearest hospital unbeknownst to you your wife lay comatose fighting for her life miles from home doctors and nurses work feverishly to provide emergency medical care to a patient who is only a name on the license but to you she is the love of your life if the two of you had signed up for the next of kin registry the hospital staff would be able to quickly notify you about your wifes critical condition you could rush to be by her side share critical medical history and information that could help save her life hence the bill is necessary it is not intended to frustrate the mission of hospitals but rather to facilitate it it is about notifying the right people at the right time in order to share the right information during an emergency using this crucial medical information while caring for a critically ill patient reduces the hospitals own liability so such notification is vital not only is it important to have a family member present to comfort the patient but also to make informed decisions that the patient cant make for him or herself and to provide the medical history that could very well be the difference between life and death so i hope that my colleagues will join

to create a class of aliens who will are not be detained with the rest of the alien population however the mandatory detention provision of h r 4377 preserves the already existing parole authority under section 212 d 5 a of the immigration and nationality act that waives mandatory detention and releases aliens for urgent humanitarian reasons or for significant public benefit in other words the secretary already is empowered and has discretion to release juveniles and aliens who have serious medical conditions in which continued detention would not be appropriate and women who have been medically certified as pregnant the very classes that the gentlewoman seeks too release also this amendment creates a whole new bureaucracy that is not necessary it takes away power from the department and those who are really experienced with these issues and concerns involving the detention of aliens and empowers independent groups ngos and academic experts from the immigration and the criminal justice field with the authority to design this program separate and apart from the department of homeland security this amendment also requires the secretary of homeland security to enter into contracts with groups including the ngos and individuals to implement the program simply put this amendment applies only to illegal aliens who are in expedited removal which is typically 30 to 90 days such individuals will be removed quickly from the united states allowing them to be released outside of what the statute already prescribes would only create more incentive for them to enter into and remain in this country in addition this amendment seeks to protect aliens with valid claims of asylum who are already protected under this bill h r 4377 does not change current law regarding those with valid claims of asylum they currently have and if this bill passes will still have that right detention of such aliens is still discretionary once placed into asylum proceedings and finally this amendment seeks to shift the authority for unaccompanied alien children to the department of health and human services we have a serious and significant youth alien gang problem in the united states ms13 for instance whose members are primarily from el salvador and enter illegally into the united states across our land borders some of these gangs are dangerous criminals and such members of alien

senate and with the administration i know some of you have some concerns that didnt get worked out and i can understand that and i can relate to the gentleman but with regard to a process here the supreme court struck down the tribunals said the congress needs to act on this to come up with a process and when i examined this we took some of the best not only of our own legal system but we took some of the best out of the ucmj and we took some of the best out of the world court to create the military commissions so now when you look at title 18 the first chapter will be the federal criminal code that will apply to united states citizens the second chapter then is the ucmj and the third chapter will now be the code of military commissions in my judgment the code of military commissions is in fact a process that will reflect americas values and it will be balanced against the protection of our national security and it has indispensable judicial guarantees that are recognized by the world the supreme court yes they will examine our commissions no differently than how they examine the tribunals but i am left in an area of good comfort and that is my counsel that i now give to my country of 26 years experience not only as a military jag officer but also the 14 years here helping lead our country i am comfortable with regard to this process not only if i were the military prosecutor but even if i were the military defense counsel about the protections that we are affording not only this unlawful enemy combatant but making sure that we have a balance of interests yesterday on the floor a couple of our colleagues had raised some issues as to whether american citizens could be subject to the code of military commissions and whether or not if an american citizen was even classified as an enemy combatant could they then be subject to a military tribunal the answer is no american citizens cannot mr hun ter has made it very clear in this language so even a strict constructionist when they read this language in the supreme court it is very clear section 948 says this does not apply to american citizens that it only applies to aliens but lets go with an example lets say an american citizen has been arrested for aiding and abetting a terrorist maybe even participating in a conspiracy or maybe participating in an action that harmed or killed american citizens that american citizen cannot be tried in the military commission his coconspirators could be tried in a military commission if they were an alien but if that other coconspirator is an american citizen they will be prosecuted under title 18 of the first chapter of a federal crime or even we could assimilate the state laws under the assimilated crimes act i am trying to go into details and i want to share with the american people here beyond the rhetoric that sometimes you hear on the floor that with regard to the process itself i am very comfortable with the fact that american citizens cannot be tried in this the reason i am spending a little time on it is that there was an editorial that went out there by a law professor published in the los angeles times let me tell you as a lawyer myself just because a law professor says it i am going to tell you what not necessarily true i read his editorial and i also then looked at the law let me now speak unto the law professor read the bill just like what you would do to your law students you would tell them to read the bill and when you read the bill and when you open it up you would find that the words you wrote so that the readers in southern california would somehow take what action or give you credit or credence to your words your words are false and that is completely unfortunate so hopefully people will begin to understand that this whole issue about these military commissions applying to american people is not true at all in the end let me thank mr hunter on a good work product i do wish that in the

abortion procedure alone this amendment would sever the essential parentchild relationship grandparents and undefined clergy are not parents it is that simple it is instructive that the supreme court has always held that the important duty to ensure and provide for the care and nurture of minor children lies only with the parents a conclusion which arises from the traditional legal recognition that the natural bounds of affection lead parents to act in the best interest of their children that was parham v jr 1979 of the supreme court and as justices oconnor kennedy and souter observed in planned parenthood v casey parental consent and notification laws related to abortions are based on the quite reasonable assumption that minors will benefit from consultation with their parents and that children will often not realize that their parents have their best interests at heart significantly for ciana the supreme court recently struck down a washington state visitation law under which grandparents were granted visitation of their grandchildren over the objection of the childrens mother that state visitation law was struck down precisely because it failed to provide special protection for the fundamental right of parents to control with whom their children associate the amendment also excludes from the bill any clergy and the amendment leaves the word clergy undefined just last year one state court ominously described the dangers of using the term clergy in the law without providing any clear definition that court stated almost anyone in a religious organization willing to offer what purports to be spiritual advice would qualify for clergy status that is waters v oconnor 2004 the court of appeals of arizona that means that under this amendment an impressionable and vulnerable minor could be sexually exploited by a cultist and the cultist could escape liability and prosecution under this legislation because the cultist claims clergy status in fact when the federal rules of evidence were being debated in congress congress specifically rejected using the word clergy in those rules doing so would have invited courts just as this amendment would to allow all matter of cult figures to fall under the term parents and not anyone else know and can provide their dependent minor childrens complete and accurate med ical histories before children undergo medical procedures parents are required to provide this critical information without that medical history an abortion could be devastating to a childs health as the supreme court has made clear the medical emotional and psychological consequences of an abortion are serious and can be lasting an adequate medical and psychological case history is important to the physician parents can provide medical and psychological data refer the physician to other sources of medical history such as family physicians and authorize family physicians to give relevant data that is h l v matheson 1981 and in addressing the right of parents to direct the medical care of their children the supreme court has stated our jurisprudence historically has reflected western civilization concepts of the family as a unit with broad parental authority over minor children our cases have consistently followed that course our constitutional system has long rejected any notion that a child is a mere creature of the state and on the contrary asserted that parents generally have the right coupled with the high duty to recognize and prepare their children for additional obligations surely this includes the high duty to recognize symptoms of illness and to seek and follow medical advice the laws concept of the family rests on a presumption that parents possess what a child lacks in maturity experience and capacity for judgment required for making lifes difficult decisions parham v j r parents not grandparents or undefined clergy are legally morally and financially responsible

percent and 40 percent so i appreciate the gentlemans concern about the competitive problems that we have with american manufacturers and producers trying to compete with an undervalued chinese currency but this bill comes up very short but i very much appreciate what the gentleman said because we will be come back in a little bit and offer him an opportunity to really do something about the manipulation of chinas currency let me also point out while i am on the floor that legislation filed by the gentleman from new york h r 3306 would take action in this area by requiring the administration to initiate a wto action to address chinas currency manipulation now that would bring action consistent with our obligations under the world trade organization because we would act under the world trade organization that is what we should be doing let me suggest that when you file an action under the wto it is not the end of issues it is the beginning of a process to ask the secretary of the treasury to do another study or come up with another definition all we do is delay for another year any action against china and to suggest that there are minor adjustments that they made is in any way dealing with the underlying problems of currency manipulation is just unreal china announced today that they do not intend to do more so we need to take action against china american jobs are at stake we can compete if it is on a fair level playing field it is not this bill does not deal with the china currency issue i reserve the balance of my time"],

without properly securing our borders we are vulnerable to terrorists and others who may come here seeking to harm americans and nothing is more important than maintaining the safety and security of our citizens i am proud of house republicans for taking the lead in finding solutions to this very serious problem last year my republican colleagues and i passed the border protection antiterrorism and illegal immigration control act republicans also passed the real id act which would establish rigorous proof of identity requirements for drivers licenses and id cards in order to help keep terrorists from having easy access to fraudulent ids like they had on 9 11 now the democrats apparently have a newfound commitment to increasing our border security that is great but the american people sure could have used their support when the house was taking up these border security bills last year 164 democrats voted no to the border security act and 152 voted no to the real id act actions sure do speak louder than words"]]}
