coanchor the distinguished gentleman from new jersey who is right across the hudson river and who so ably serves the communities of newark and beyond this evening we have heard from so many distinguished members of the congressional black caucus most recently from the gentlewoman from texas with whom i serve on the judiciary committee about the importance of the moment in time in which we find ourselves right now related to not just the confederate battle flag but perhaps more importantly what is the legacy that we want to have as americans as members of congress in dealing with the complicated issue of race it is an honor and a privilege to once again have the chance to come to the house floor to have this conversation this is a most distinguished venue from which to speak to the american people an appropriate one i would add given the houses constitutional relationship to the people of america this of course being the only institution that was envisioned by the founding fathers as one in which the people serving in the institution would be directly elected by the people the senates members of course in its original constitutional version were elected by the state legislature then of course the presidency to this day is a vehicle through which the individual is selected by the electoral college so this is the peoples house the institution most intimately connected to the people of america and the place where we should be able to speak truth to power we witnessed that last week as we were forced unfortunately to discuss the issue of the confederate battle flag at a moment when people of all racesdemocrats and republicans blacks whites the extraordinary leadership from the governor of south carolina and the distinguished gentleman from south carolina jim clyburncame together at the moment when the confederate battle flag was coming down in south carolina there were members of this house trying to lift it up it was quite unfortunate that we needed to detour from this moment that we were having in america led in south carolina to address the battle flag issue on this house floor but i am hopeful that as we move forward now in a more productive way we can begin to confront some of the public policy challenges that we face in america that supporters of the confederate battle flag have fought against as others have detailed during the presentation here today the battle flag which met its initial defeat in 1865 at the end of the civil war remained largely dormant in american history until 1954 in the supreme courts decision of brown vs board of education it was decided that this facade of separate and equal was constitutionally suspect and that african americans were being denied the opportunity of being educated in quality public schools in the deep south and in other places in america really it was in the midfifties and then into the early sixties when the confederate battle flag was resurrected as a symbol of the segregationists who were fighting to uphold jim crow it was a symbol of those who were fighting to stop the efforts of courageous individuals like congressman john lewis who in 1965 was the cochair of the student nonviolent coordinating committee it was a symbol of those who were trying to fight efforts by john lewis and others to make sure that the franchisethe right to votewas colorblind in nature and that the 15th amendment could actually be brought to life all throughout america and in the deep south where there were those who were trying to prevent african americans from being able to vote the battle flag was resurrected in the fifties and in the sixties to stop certain things from happening it seems to me that rather than having the discussion about whether it should come down no reasonable person can take the position that it should have a place of honor so it is extraordinary to me that we had to take to the house floor last week and have to come to the house floor today to continue to address this issue hopefully reason will prevail over the next couple of weeks or the next couple of dayseven prior to the august recessand we can move beyond the confederate battle flag issue and address some important substantive issues that many would argue remain as part of the legacy of the confederacy we dont want to see the ghosts of the confederacy invading the united states congress from a policy perspective those nine soulsgodfearing churchgoing african americanswho were killed simply because of the color of their skin died because of someone who charged into that church with the intention of sparking a race war that was inspired in part by the confederate battle flag one of the things that has happened as a result of that tragedy is the battle flag has come down but that is just the beginning of the work that we need to do in response to that tragedy and the conditions that so many people find themselves in all across america as has been mentioned we have got to confront the gun violence issue that we have in the united states how can it be that we have 5 percent of the worlds population but 50 percent of the worlds guns it is estimated that we have more than 285 million guns in circulation nobody can give you an exact estimate because a chokehold has been placed around the federal agencies charged with preventing gun violence and dealing with gun safety in america it is an incredible act of legislative malpractice but it is estimated that we have got over 285 million guns in america isnt it reasonable particularly in the aftermath of this tragedy in charleston south carolina that we come together and figure out a way to prevent those guns consistent with the second amendment from falling into the hands of individuals who would do us harm it seems to me to be a reasonable thing that we can do as americans it also seems important that we would find a way 50 years after the passage of the 1965 voting rights act to stop trying to prevent americans from exercising their sacred franchise and participating in american democracy yet something happened in the aftermath of 2008 a real interesting moment in november of that year that seemed to have shocked a whole lot of people across this country as a result 2 years later when there was a midterm election subsequent to that there was an outbreak with this concern of voter fraud fabricated because no one can point to any evidence of an epidemic of voter fraud not a scintilla of evidence has been presented anywhere in this country that we have got a problem that needs to be addressed but we have had all of these voter suppression laws enacted that are consistent with the ghosts of the confederacy and what those folks stood for who were waving the confederate battle flag in opposition to the changes of the fifties and sixties what shocks me is that even the supreme court has gotten into the act by decimating the section 5 preclearance through claiming that section 4 is outdated and this house refuses to act on fixing the voting rights act i would argue thatagain consistent with our democracy and the spirit of coming togetherthat perhaps that is one of the things we can address so that we can take down on the one hand the divisive symbol of hatredthe confederate battle flagfrom here in this capitol and in whatever form it hangs all across america so that we

breast cancer than ever before this is largely due to the awareness that has been raised on the importance of selfexams and yearly doctor physicals however currently 29 percent of insured women are still not receiving mammograms and for women without health insurance the percentage is even higher with 68 percent not receiving mammograms it is extremely important that we continue to place an emphasis on early detection so that we can catch this disease as early as possible and have the best shot at beating it while there are factors like genetics and age that can make someone more susceptible to the disease breast cancer does not discriminate against education upbringing or wealth from ceos in new york city to a stayathome mom in small town minnesota this disease knows no bounds i expect that just about everyone who walks these halls and too many to count across our country have been impacted by breast cancer in some way i am no exception fifteen years ago i lost my sister bridget to breast cancer bridget was only 38 years old when she left us she left behind two beautiful daughters and a husband who loved her while her life was a lesson on how to get the most out of each second of every minute of every hour and every day there is not a day that goes by when i dont wish there could have been a cure for her for those who have experienced personal loss and pain from breast cancer and for everyone who is fighting this disease we join with you this month not only to raise awareness about breast cancer but to sound a call to action to strengthen our resolve and to eradicate this disease once and for all in congress we can absolutely play a role in this effort to the extent possible within our constitutional authority we can and should encourage further advancement of medical research i am proud to be a cosponsor of the accelerating the end of breast cancer act of 2015 which will establish a commission to work to defeat this disease the commission will consist of experts in cancer research who will work to identify opportunities and ideas to advance our quest to prevent and cure breast cancer for future generations october is a month to raise awareness we have made progress and we are making progress in our fight against this unforgiving disease let us use this month to rededicate ourselves to our shared goal of eradicating breast cancer once and for all"], [0.9618535041809082, 0.9618535041809082, 0, "lastly you said i want to show people that one night of drinking can ruin a life a life one life yours you forgot about mine let

sure have very different views than those who call themselves the boss of my friend from massachusetts but i tell you the three bills that this rule makes in ordernot that this rule declares a foregone conclusion of passage no it just makes in order for debate on the floor of this house these three bills are exactly the kind of thing that this house should be working on and i am proud to bring it today number one i dont serve on the oversight and government reform committee that is where this resolution of disapproval has come from i did last cycle i dont this cycle i have heard colleague after colleague come to the floor and defend the rights of not being fired because your sister or your daughter or your son or your brother used birth control that is outrageous i cant imagine that someone would be fired for what their sister or their brother does in terms of their reproductive health choices i agree i agree and if there is an opportunity to work together to prevent that from happeningthat is apparently happening en masse here in the district of columbiai want to be a part of it but the truth is it is not happening en masse in fact it is not happening at all it is not happening at all i do not mind being lectured by my friends to get back to the business of the people i do not mind in fact i am onboard with it every single day of the week we can start earlier and we can start later and i will be here but do not do not lecture me on getting about the business of the people and come down with story after story after story that is not what this legislation is about that is not a problem that is not something that any of us disagree on we have some legitimate disagreements on this floor and if we pass this rule we will be able to get into the nittygritty of those disagreements but we do not disagree on the freedom of family members to make their own reproductive health choices without it impacting our own employment i will say to my friend sincerely if we can find a case in the district of columbiai dont mean a case this year i dont mean a case last year i mean a case ever of that happeningseek me out as your partner and i will help you because what folks seem to miss here in this conga line of frustration is that if we reject the d c councils resolution we return d c to the law of the land as it exists when today we dont take a single right away from anybody we dont take a single freedom away from anybody we are not interested in doing that whatsoever what we are interested in doing is protecting religious freedom it turns out if you live in washington d c you might work for an institution that lobbies for life you might work for an institution that focuses on faith this is a town of ideas in the rush to pass a piece of legislationthese are not my words these are the words of vincent gray in his letter to the members of the council of the district of columbia in the rush to push this bill through the council did not take the time to protect this cathedral of freedom that we have here did not take the time to make sure that that first and most important of our constitutional freedoms was protected now the constitution is the constitution there is nothing that the district of columbia can do to undermine the constitution but they can cause a lot of problems for folks along the way this is a resolution of disapproval to prevent that from hap pening the second bill that is here h r 1732 the regulatory integrity protection act my friends suggest that we are talking about clean water in this country that this is about republicans undermining clean water i will say again as i said about the resolution of disapproval if we pass this bill we will roll the regulatory environment of clean water so far back it will be just like it is today that is what we are going to do i just want to be clear about those radical ideas that my friends on the left have suggested if we have the will in this body to pass this bill we are going to roll regulations so far back it will be exactly like it is as i am standing here today what this bill is about is preventing the regulatory overreach going forward guess what i live in gwinnett county georgia i challenge you to have a water treatment plant that does a better job than we do we have a water fountain right there where the sewage gets treated you can go ahead and press that water fountain and have yourself a drink that is how clean it is we put it back into the lake cleaner than we take it out of the lake i will not be lectured by my friends in an executive office downtown about how to clean water in the state of georgia i promise you i care more about clean water in georgia than anyone on pennsylvania avenue does we are succeeding today if we have a problem with state regulation of clean water come to me i will be your partner we will work on that together the problem is not that georgia isnt doing a good job the problem is the feds are planning to get in the way of georgia doing a good job this bill will stop it if we pass this rule we will be able to have that debate finally the bill that makes me the proudest is our concurrent budget resolution my friends have lots to say about why it is this budget doesnt balance lets be clear i believe that they are wrong but what is more important in this discussion is that my friends dont want the budget to balance we had a free and open debate on this floor we considered every budget that any member of this chamber wanted to offer every single one an interesting thing happened every republican budget that was introduced balanced within 10 years and didnt raise taxes on hardworking americans every single budget the democrats introduced never balancednot in 10 years not in 20 years not in 100 yearsand every single one raised taxes on hardworking americans by trillions of dollars trillions of dollars in new taxes and it still didnt reach balance my friends i understand we have a fundamental disagreement about how this country ought to be run and i am glad that we have that debate here in this chamber we are a deliberative body i respect the opinions of my friends i do believe there is a common ground that we can come to but this is that common ground today for years the budget wasnt even passed in the united states senate much less try to bring it together so that the house and the senate are working off a single page of music for the first time since 1991 this chamber has done its job in concert with the senate it is no small thing far from being something to be criticized it is something to be celebrated i dont know where the votes are going to be conferencing something with the senate is hard i promise you that my bosses back home in georgia have a much more conservative view of the world than many of the folks do in the united states senate but guess what i dont get everything i want every day but what i get is an opportunity to come together to

but there can be no additional loans the reason that i do so is when i came and offered this amendment last year i had a cutting amendment last year but what was explained to me was that if you cut the program then you wouldnt have money to administer the existing loans that were out there so as a result i have altered this amendment so that it again leaves in place the appropriation which is more than 5 million so that you could continue to administer the existing loans that are in place but there would be no additional loans now why do i think that that is important i think it is important for a couple different reasons i think from a democratic standpoint what we would say is that we all believe in equality and that there shouldnt be subsidized loans for major corporations global corporations here in the united states while your cousins pizza business is struggling or your friends landscaping business is struggling they dont get subsidized loans why should a big business so from a democratic standpoint i think we would hold that belief from a republican standpoint we would say we need to watch out for the taxpayer if you look at the default rate on these loans unfortunately it has been relatively high you would say i dont know if government is in the best spot to be making these kinds of loans to businesses i think that ultimately is the role not of government but of business let them do what they do i think from both vantage points it is something that makes sense i would add just a couple of additional thoughts and then i would yield i would say one there have been only five loans made since 2007 this is not a huge program this is a very limited program two two out of the five loans made since 2007 in fact have defaulted that is a 40 percent default rate i dont think that that is the kind of thing that we would like to see in government there have been no loans made since 2011 and then the gao came in march of 2013 and said the costs outweigh the benefits of this program they followed that up with another gao report in march of 2014 and said we recommend shutting down the program unless the department of energy can show real demand for the loans then they followed that up with a final gao report in march of this year and it said that there hadnt been a sufficient level of demand as a consequence their words were this determining whether funds will be used is important particularly in a constrained fiscal environment this congress should rescind unused appropriations or direct them to other government priorities i think the simple issue with this loan program is that there could be other priorities where you take that 4 billion of loan authority and let other parts of government use it or turn it back to the

good friend across the aisle mr perlmutter of colorado and i have introduced h r 1737 along with 166 of our colleagues both republican and democrat to give the cfpb a chance to fix this faulty guidance this bill was carefully written by republicans and democrats very simply and narrowly to provide clarity fairness and most importantly due process no federal agency can set new policies through guidance however in march of 2013 the cfpb attempted to go outside the formal rulemaking process by blatantly disregarding consumers and small businesses blatantly disregarding their ability and their right to comment on guidance that will directly affect them h r 1737 asks that the cfpb rescind their flawed guidance and reissue it under a more transparent process by consulting other regulators and allowing the public notice and comment i want to be clear this bill does not strip the cfpb of any rulemaking authority it currently has h r 1737 gives the cfpb the golden opportunity to correct and reissue their guidance that would take into account consumers and bring clarity to the market again i want to reiterate that my colleagues and i are merely trying to promote transparency accountability and due process there are a small number of critics that believe this bill is unnecessary because the cfpb already has the tools to correct their auto guidance well the cfpb could have fixed this issue without legislation over 2 years ago but they disregarded 13 bipartisan letters that were sent urging them to correct the fallacies in their guidance i find it ironic that the agency that is supposed to protect the consumer is in fact harming them with this guidance in fact this guidance impacts much more than car buyers it harms auto dealers rv dealers motorcycle dealers international dealers and even manufacturers 1400 congress created the cfpb to protect consumers not hurt them by silencing the voices of thousands of consumers and small businesses on august 31 of this year the wall street journal reported some automakers have responded by overhauling their loan pricing in ways that will likely mean higher costs for some borrowers if the cfpb really cares about developing policies that are truly in the best interest of consumers they should amend their guidance to be more transparent and allow public participation my bill is very simple and narrow and

you have told us so many times we need to improve the infrastructure on the west coast for the efficiency so that we can keep those panamax ships on the west coast the freight issue that you talked about so eloquently here is absolutely on it is the major part of the american transportation economy we look at roads we look at railroads but the notion of combining this into a comprehensive strategy in which we talk about the movement of goods the freight movement your leadership is very very important i thank you so very much for joining us i know that you have a tight schedule for the evening but you broke away to bring us the very very important message i want to continue on here really with the ports the american society of civil engineers does a report card on the american infrastructure we would fail we would have to go back to remedial classes if their report card was somehow the way in which we would judge the work of the united states congress because with regard to ports as we just discussed it is a c even though progress has been made to meet the needs of the ports we are going to have to spend an additional 46 billion over and above what is already programmed we are going to have to spend 748 billion in the future in order to meet the needs of the highways and that just gets us out of the d rating provided by the american society of civil engineers for transit it is also a d as i said earlier some onehalf of american households depend upon transit because they dont have a car and 45 percent of the urban passengers cannot get the services that they need from transit it goes on and on and on bridges a cplus as i said earlier 63 500 bridges are inadequate for the rail system part of what congresswoman hahn was talking about the railroads have invested over 75 billion of their own money improving their systems but the intermodal programs that are so necessary require that those rails connect to the highways to the trucking industry and that hasnt been done so the rails actually receive a cplus ranking we have got work to do here we have got some very very serious problems let me just put this up because there are solutions available to us if we take a look at the problem in this case the global assessment of the united states is 16th for transportation infrastructure the solution invest for every dollar that we invest the economy grows by 3 54 so when you put a dollar in suddenly you get the economy moving people go to work for every billion dollars that we invest in roads and bridges we are going to create 21 671 jobs those are people that are getting good highquality highpaying middleincome jobs guess what they are going to pay taxes so you invest a dollar and you get back 3 54 of economic activity and you get tax growth not new taxes but new people paying taxes that is what we want we want people to go to work we want jobs in america we find that if we invest in infrastructure we have got the opportunity to create jobs to increase the tax base and grow the economy now on the negative side underinvesting in infrastructure costs america over 900 000 jobs including 97 000 jobs in manufacturing these things go together we have fortunately had over the years a buyamerica requirement in the infrastructure financing for highways and bridges and the rest and for transit that your tax dollars my tax dollars all of our tax dollars are required to be used to buy americanmade goods equipment services buses and the like unfortunately it is only 50 percent so a transit agency can take your tax money and spend 50 percent of that tax money on buying a bus or a train from china and the other 50 percent presumably would have to be spent on americanmade services and goods not good enough i think it ought to be

solution make it in america i have talked about that for 5 years here on the floor build the american economy with make it in america laws and regulations use our tax money to buy americanmade goods and equipment here is what it means let me give you a couple of examples of the good news and the bad news here is why make it in america strategies are important the bad news is california my home state where we had to rebuild the san franciscooakland bay bridge spanning from oakland to the peninsula san francisco it fell down during the 89 earthquake and then we decided we had to rebuild it well you know it takes a long time to figure out how to build it and what it is going to look like it took forever however it was a multibilliondollar project and someone decided that it would be cheaper to buy chinese steel than american steel so they contracted with a chinese steel company the result was 3 000 jobs in china a brandnew steel mill to manufacture the most highquality steel and what the chinese sent to america was deficient the welds were insufficient there were problems in the quality of the steel the result was at least part of that problem was some 3 5 billion overrun that is the bad news california really screwed up we say make it in america guess what happened on the other side of the continent new york needed to rebuild a new bridge the new york tappan zee bridge it was made with united states manufactured steel total cost 3 9 billion 7 728 american jobs because they undertook a buy america requirement and they bought it in america on time under budget the tappan zee bridge good the san francisco bay bridge bad make it in america buy american that ought to be our policy i want to move on to where we are this week on october 29 the united states congress will engage in its favorite game kicking the can down the road we will take up a transportation and infrastructure bill in the house of representatives transportation and infrastructure committee this week good for us several months late not in time for next weeks deadline so we will kick the can down the road we will give ourselves another couple of months to ponder how we can address the needs of americas infrastructure i want to suggest to you there is a way we can do it i put this chart up to challenge all of us this chart displays the opportunity as well as the potential for the missed opportunity there are three new infrastructure pieces of legislation that are floating around the united states capitol but before we go to those three i want to call your attention to where we are today highway funding this is todays highway funding we are spending somewhere around 264 billion on highways 64 2 billion on transit the entire amount over a 6year period of timethis is 6 yearsis 319 billion this does not include the rail system so 319 billion is what we are spending today over a 6year period of time i have already said how inadequate that is i wont go back through that again now the administration proposed but frankly never pushed never put any weight behind it and i think copped out on what is in my view a very very good bill a comprehensive bill that included rail transitagain not included here it was a bill that had 449 billion not including the rail over a 6year period compared to the 319 billion that we are spending today that amounts to what 120 billion a year moreactually 130 billion a year more that is good that is what we need i misquoted that it is 130 billion over 6 years that is the kind of money that we need to build the infrastructure highways 317 billion over 6 years compared to where we are today 246 billion significant increase enough to fix the potholes on i5 transit 114 6 billion over 6 years compared to today 64 billion over 6 years the entire sum 449 billion compared to 319 billion over 6 years that is the kind of progress that we can and must make if we want to move from 16th among the worlds economies developed economies to get back up into the top five that is what we need to do now once again this does not include the rail transit if you add the rail transit in these numbers are a little bigger that is the kind of effort the united states senate what did they decide to do in their bill called the senate drive act 276 billion compared to 246 billion over 6 years 74 9 billion for transit compared to 64 billion that is good that is 10 billion better but not enough we actually need over 114 billion or 115 billion the entire sum on the senate side not including rail is 361 billion compared to 319 billion better but not enough not sufficient to build the infrastructure that this economy and this society need to move out of 16th place back into the top tier of five now where is the house of representatives this week we are going to take up a bill that is less than the senate bill and just a little teeny tiny bit better than what we are doing today so if you are happy with what we are doing today you will love the house bill but if you dont want potholes if you want to deal with congestion if you want to deal with ports and freight if you want to move from a d to a b or an a you dont do it with the house bill i understand this is a starting point this is the beginning of negotiations but why in the world would you begin negotiations at the bottom when you need to get to the top it beats me i dont get it we have got to build the american infrastructure it is how we move our economy it is how we move people back to work in good middleclass jobs it is how your tax money should be spent and how can we raise the revenue for this well we dont need to increase the gasoline or the diesel tax keep it the same no increase people can argue that it should or should not be increased but you dont need to this proposal the grow america act the additional 100plus billion dollars over 6 years to build our infrastructure is fully paid for by keeping the gasoline and the diesel tax at the level it is today and going after the hidden profits of the united states corporations that have skipped out on their responsibility to this country they are hiding their profits overseas we need to go after those profits and say you owe it to america bring that money back and pay your just taxes that is how this is paid for fully paid for how much about 120 billion over 6 years enough to get the job done american corporations wont be allowed to run away from their responsibility to their country they will pay their fair share here in america no more tax dodges overseas folks so where are we the question for the congress of the united states is are we going to go with what we have today just a little bit more just keeping up with inflation is that good enough for america to be number one no it is not can we do better without burdening the truckers without burdening the commuters we can if we are willing to step up to the american corporations the big and the powerful and say pay your fair share oh by the way their fair share is 14 percent which is less than onehalf of the corporate tax rate we will see what happens the house of representatives the men and women that you have elected are going to make some decisions we will make a decision about speaker eventually that will get taken care of eventually we will make some decisions about a few other things but the infrastructure issue of this nation is fundamental to economic growth i hope we make the right decision i hope we make the decision to grow this economy to make it in america spend your tax dollars here at home and give you the roads the transit system the ports the freight movement the airports that you need and america needs i yield back the balance of my time"],

years the government accountability office has examined the various department of homeland security programs and concluded that dhs has not followed standard best practices for acquisitions management though dhs has taken steps to improve its performance specific deficiencies in how the department carries out major acquisitions remain when a dhs acquisition program falls short in terms of effectiveness or efficiency it not only risks undermining that program but also risks wasting limited homeland security dollars for example dhs spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the sbinet border security program before it was ultimately canceled no doubt this funding could have been put to far better use along our nations border the border security technology accountability act would require each of the departments major acquisitions for border security technology to have written documentation reflecting a baseline approved by the relevant acquisition decision authority and demonstrate that the program is meeting agreedupon cost schedule and performance thresholds before moving into the next phase of the acquisition cycle the bill also requires the under secretary for management in coordination with the commissioner of customs and border protection to submit to congress a plan for testing and evaluation as well as the use of independent verification and validation

national weather service from 2005 to 2014 thousands of americans lost their lives from the impacts of windstorms along with the loss of life windstorms caused many billions of dollars in property and crop damage during that time when windstorms occur we must work to save lives and reduce the amount of property and crop damage that the windstorm or other natural disaster causes we already are investing significant resources after a windstorm but we should be investing more in preparedness femas predisaster mitigation program has demonstrated that every dollar invested in mitigation activities saves 3 to 4 in recovery costs the national windstorm impact reduction act reauthorization of 2015 is largely a mitigation program the bill reauthorizes the nwirp program that directs nist nsf noaa and fema to support coordinated activities to improve our understanding of windstorms and their impacts and to develop costeffective mitigation measures this program has the potential to lessen the loss of life and economic damage of windstorms by supporting research and helping to translate that research into more effective building codes and mitigation programs but this program needs robust investment to achieve that result unfortunately this bill includes a lower total authorization level than was authorized for this program in fiscal year 2008 we have the responsibility i believe to assist our constituents after a natural disaster occurs but we also have the responsibility to properly support mitigation programs that could reduce the loss of life and property damage

waterbury connecticut home of many veterans every year they have a gold star families breakfast at that breakfast i met a number of families some who lost loved ones 50 years ago and still carry in their hearts every day the pain of that loss one of the people i met was joe nolan joe served proudly in vietnam his son a gifted linguistin 1999 a college graduatesnuck off to a recruiting station in philadelphia and signed up to serve remember this is prior to 9111 he felt that call like his father had he served tragically bravely he lost his life in the battle of fallujah in 2004 defending this country joe came to me and said you know elizabeth we have this wonderful program for gold star mothers but i am a dad and i miss my son every day that is why i joined with colleagues in this chamber and we reintroduced the gold star fathers act which the president signed into law to recognize that fathers and mothers of sons and daughters bleed and cry when their children are lost so today we have an opportunity to recognize some of those families one of them is mary kight mary kight also from waterbury connecticut is the proud head of the gold star mothers organization in connecticut her son michael was a helicopter pilot he flew a huey in vietnam she was devastated when he died and particularly hurt because it was such a difficult time in the war she said she felt like her sons sacrifice meant nothing our nations commitmentwhat we are doing today to recognize her son and give her the opportunity to tell her storyis so important she has come to embrace the gold star families organization it has helped her and others to celebrate the lives of their loved ones actually last year she went up in a huey she went up in a huey much as she does not like to fly but she thought about her son michael and she was quoted as saying i felt closer to him he died while trying to evacuate wounded soldiers on the battlefield in vietnam stephen reich also another proud son of my districtanother helicopter pilotlost his life in 2005 he was attempting to extract a seal team and died in afghanistan these are only three families of the tens of thousands in this country their sacrifice as much or more than anyone else deserves to be recorded in the library of congress to remind us of the price of freedom to remind us that we owe them a debt of gratitude i am sure my friend congressman harper like myself have conducted some of these veterans history project interviews they are really meaningful and they are really important the history of this country is not only about
