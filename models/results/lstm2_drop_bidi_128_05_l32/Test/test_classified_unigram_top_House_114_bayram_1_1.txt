supreme court made that perfectly clear in district of columbia v heller the court ruled that while americans have the right to keep and bear arms there are no constitutional problems with laws prohibiting felons and the dangerously mentally ill from carrying guns as a responsible gun owner myself i will never give up my guns and i will never ask lawabiding individuals without a history of dangerous mental illness to give up theirs and like other responsible gun owners i understand that if gun violence continues unabated then eventually we will see laws that place substantial and overly burdensome restrictions on our right to own guns to reduce gun violence we dont need to stop lawabiding citizens who use guns for hunting sport shooting and personal protection from obtaining those firearms we need to stop terrorists criminals domestic abusers and those with a history of dangerous mental illness from getting guns our first line of defense when it comes to making sure that guns dont fall into dangerous hands is to conduct a background check and we know that when used background checks work every day background checks stop more than 170 felons some 50 domestic abusers and nearly 20 fugitives from buying a gun but sadly a gaping loophole allows those same felons dangerously mentally ill and domestic abusers to bypass a background check in 34 states all they have to do

criminals and those who are severely mentally ill such that possession of a firearm would pose a threat to themselves or others the end purchase of firearms by dangerous individuals act h r 2917 requires that states provide information to the national instant criminal background check system on individuals who are committed to a mental institution or make a threat of violence to a mental health professional that demonstrates that this individual would present a danger to himself or others if armed with a gun the fire sale loophole closing act h r 2916 ends the practice by which federally licensed gun dealers who lose their licenses for misconduct can convert their entire inventory to a personal collection in order to liquidate it without conducting background checks on their customers under the law such dealers could transfer their inventory only to other properly licensed federal gun dealers i also introduced a resolution h con res 59 to support the goals of national ask day which falls on june 21 each year national ask day encourages parents to ask other parents whether their children are playing in a house with an unlocked gun in the united states 1 7 million children are in homes with loaded unlocked guns this initiative is supported by head start the american public health association and the american academy of pediatrics in addition to these measures that i have introduced i have also cosponsored the large capacity ammunition feeding device act to ban the sale of largecapacity magazines and denying firearms and explosives to dangerous terrorists act to prohibit individuals suspected of ties to terrorist organizations from purchasing a gun and h r 2380 and h r 3411 which fix our broken background check system any of these bills would

agencys main contractor projected that the first phases costs had risen 31 percent this information was concealed by the highspeed rail authority and only released 2 years later after pressure from congress while the lack of transparency is unacceptable especially given that taxpayers are ultimately on the hook for this project the fundamental issue here is that the entire project is a rusein literal terms a train wreckin that state officials knew this for some time and that those same officials hid this from the public in 2008 voters were promised an 800mile system that would link sacramento san francisco los angeles and san diego cost about 34 billion and would have less than onethird of the costs paid by the state through its taxpayers the system was promised to travel from san francisco to los angeles in under 2 hours and 40 minutes fast forward to 2011 when the price had shot up from 34 billion to 100 billion the plan was reduced to only l a to san francisco and the state was quick to grab billions ofunknown at the timefederal stimulus that came along later funding that could have been used for critical needs like roads or water infrastructure that california needs so desperately as well as now shifting capandtrade dollars recently created to try and prop up highspeed rail and its deficient budget dollars as a state senator at the time the first bill i introduced was one that would require them to come up with the ultimate full plan of the cost of doing highspeed rail having not succeeded in getting that through a majority that still liked it as it was my next legislation was to say now that we know this is over 100 billion lets put this back on the ballot and in front of the voters since the price has tripled and they were deceived at what it would cost at the time that too met defeat as those in the majority still wished to continue this boondoggle today the governor claims the price has fallen to 68 billion for what would be an illegal system based on what the voters passed under prop 1a however the estimate ignores the costs of tunneling through the tehachapi mountains ignores cost spikes in the initial construction segment and ignores the rising costs of lands acquisition due to people having to fight because they are having their homes their farms and their small businesses paved over by this project the promises made in 2008 ranged from low ticket prices to questionable job figures including the fact that they were claiming there would be a million new jobs from highspeed rail when we pinned them down in committee a little bit later they said well that would mean a million jobyears that number has since been pared down all these have been proven false in fact these claims are so misleading that a state court has forbidden the legislature from writing ballot measure descriptions earlier this week i sent out a survey to residents in my weekly enewsletter to constituents in californias first district my own

best represents our constituents position on the project now of the nearly 1 600 answers we received their views are pretty clear nearly half of them said they thought funding for highspeed rail should be redirected to invest in water storage and water infrastructure to help our state right now in this drought about 20 percent thought the state should subpoena the cost documents and require highspeed rail authority officials to testify why the figures were concealed approximately 18 percent thought californias highspeed rail should undergo federal investigation in response to these allegations given that the project involves the use of federal funds a scant 7 percent thought we should keep going forward with highspeed rail and believed the current price tag is a worthwhile investment of public funds lastly 4 percent supported investing in highspeed rail provided the project stayed within the old constraints the old pricesthe ones they saw on the ballot so at best you see 11 percent that might support highspeed rail and 4 percent that might under the old price which is nowhere near what was projected people dont like this project dont trust those advocating for it and they deserve better than to see their own tax dollars used to lie to them no new federal dollars will come from here to help this project be propped up anymore it is time we start prioritizing

appreciate all of the contributions mr gallego and all the other 62 members of the committee have made into producing this national defense authorization act it has been a bipartisan product in the tradition of this committee you know if you think about it for 53 straight years congresses of both parties have passed and presidents of both parties have signed into law a defense authorization act and that has been true through vietnam and the cold war and 9111 it has been true through watergate and race riots and economic recessions and bitter political feuds and yet through all those things somehow the parties could come together to do what was needed for our troops and for our countrys security i think that that strong tradition of bipartisanship is something that we should not walk away from lightly we have heard some discussioncomplaints reallyon both sides of the aisle about using oco to get up to the presidents level if you look at this chart this is the presidents budget and this is the congressional budget which this bill is compliant with there is a little difference in where the light blue and the dark blue start and stop but the net effect when you add it all together is exactly the same 612 billion that is what the president asked for that is what this bill provides there is no difference between the two i agree that we ought to find a better way to have fiscal discipline without the arbitrary caps and sequestration that are in the budget control act but this bill cant do that this bill is a defense authorization bill it is not a budget bill it is not an immigration bill it is not even a defense appropriation bill so if this bill fails how does that get us closer to fixing our budget problems the truth is we could all find an excuse to vote against every bill every day for what is not in it but that doesnt make a lot of sense what is important is what is in it and what is in it is really important for our troops and for our national security as much as i appreciate congressman gallegos service i find it ironic that he would offer an amendment that tries to make sure our troops get paid even in the event of a government shutdown and yet by voting against this bill the troops dont get paid how does that fit together let me just mention two of the things that are in this bill for our troops one is a new retirement system for people who sign up for the military right now 83 percent of the people who serve come away with no retirement under this bill they can put some money aside the government will match it and they can have a nest egg if you vote against that bill that doesnt happen one of the complaints we have all heard so many times is that the transition from active duty to the va is problematic because you cant stay on the same drugs one of the things this bill does is say that they have got to have a joint formulary so you stay on the same drugs and you can take better care of the people as they transition doesnt that make sense i hope all members had a chance to read the washington post editorial today let me just read the last sentence far better for the president and his partys leadership in congress to help an adequate defense budget keep moving through congress rather than perpetuate a fight all americans whether republican or democrat may later regret i think that is the bottom line this doesnt solve all the problems it doesnt try to solve all the problems i know we have got more debate more discussion to come but this is a step on what has been a very bipartisan bill here is the bottom line we are incredibly privileged to have these jobs to live in this country but those privileges only come because brave men and women are willing to volunteer to serve and sacrifice for our country now we can never match their courage and dedication and sacrifice but surely to goodness we can do better than use them as pawns for some sort of attempt to apply political pressure on issues that have nothing

different look at american energy as many of you know one of my core convictions is the importance of upholding the dignity of human life our task here in washington should be to promote ideas and policies that allow people to live longer healthier and more rewarding lives it is in that spirit that i have joined with my fellow pennsylvanian representative kelly and likeminded colleagues to host tonights special order starting last week world elites gathered in paris to negotiate climate change commitments and promises that if enacted could undo generations of human progress progress that has provided us with the affordable and reliable energy necessary for humans to truly flourish i am here tonight to tell another side of the story one that abandons the dogma of scarcity put forward by elites in paris and climate change zealots in washington i want to shift this debate to focus on the remarkable story of human abundance affordable reliable energy has been responsible for helping to improve and prolong the lives of billions of people around the world energy powers our businesses it keeps the lights on in our homes it allows us to have fresh food and clean water it powers our schools and our hospitals energy is in many respects a life or death matter it is a moral issue and it deserves more careful consideration than it has been given by the president i would like to highlight a little bit just taking a look at some charts in taking a look at what has been happening with the use of energy a lot of the energy we get is carbonbased fossil fuel energy whether it is coal oil natural gas yes it has increased in recent history what also has happened in recent history as c02 emissions have gone up so has the wealth of this world and of this country as the population has gone up so has energy use what is really striking is taking a look at how the increase in life expectancy has coincided with this energy revolution as well as you can see for much of human history our lives were short miserable and lacking in fulfillment consider that until the industrial revolution people lived 27 years on average earned little money and faced limited opportunities again though c02 has increased so has incredible wealth lifting billions of people out of poverty and life expectancy the point now is in the united states the average life expectancy is near 80 years old as people learned to access the bounty of energy available we turned it to our advantage as we got better at it incomes and populations soared this is another interesting chart as we look at the use of world energy just going back over the last 30 years the bottom line is energy use the top line is the world gdp the increase in wealth that we have seen coinciding with this increase in energy you could take a look at some specific countries and see how energy has benefited them in china and india both of which have industrialized and increased energy use over the last generation life expectancy has increased by more than a decade infant mortality has plummeted by 70 and 58 percent respectively in china and india this is all correlated with increased energy use and the availability of affordable energy resources as alex epstein argues in the moral case for fossil fuels hundreds of millions of people have gotten their first light bulb their first refrigerator their first decentpaying job with all of our world problems affordable energy has helped make this the brightest most abundant time in human history some disparage the story as one of unseemly consumption and excess i see it as a tremendous triumph of human ingenuity and a victory for those who put human wellbeing as our top priority we can tell the same story about western pennsylvania where once again we are witnessing increasing prosperity attracted by affordable and reliable energy this entails better opportunities for pennsylvanias youth and a better quality of life that is why i am so troubled by the presidents actions at home and in paris in negotiating a global compact which will likely entail further restrictions on our access to energy the president is unknowingly endangering our future wellbeing by not taking his plans to congress for approval as should be the case with a treaty the president is ignoring the will of the american people this is not a trivial point the american people will be denied the opportunity to weigh in on something that will drastically impact their daily lives remember the president said when he was a candidate in 2008 that electricity rates will necessarily skyrocket under his plan all of this comes in addition to heavy burdens that the american people are already grappling with the socalled clean power plan is an example by forcing more power plant closures and placing stricter requirements on those that remain the presidents plan will raise energy prices by 289 billion through 2030 hurting american families and businesses large and small research suggests that we will see 224 000 fewer american jobs being created each year because of this rule we will also see reduced disposable income and weaker economic growth minority communities will be especially hardhit a study from the national black chamber of commerce found that the clean power plan would increase poverty among african americans by 23 percent and hispanics by 26 percent this is unacceptable and it is immoral real people will be hurt by these actions yet few in washington seem to be caring about these real human costs that is why i have introduced a bill called the fair burdens act this bill would prevent the burden from endangering our prosperity and wellbeing until the epa can verify that a sufficient number of countries have enacted similarly stringent policies in other words the fair burdens act would ensure that americans arent made to needlessly suffer and that our jobs arent forced overseas as the president unilaterally slows the american economy we cant just rely on legislation we need to change the narrative and educate the public affordable reliable energy is a vital ingredient for human prosperity and wellbeing ignoring this fact and taking illconceived policy actions as a result condemns millions of americans and billions around the world to dimmer futures higher energy costs and less prosperity we owe it to our constituents to defend their ability to live fulfilling prosperous lives i want to thank my colleagues who have joined me here tonight to do just that i yield to the gentleman from pennsylvania"],
