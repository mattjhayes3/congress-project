agencies 90 senators 200 house members and the smallbusiness and hightechnology communities this legislation is the small business innovation development act this bill has such universal support because it is needed now the united states faces its most serious economic crisis since the great depression unemployment stands at more than 10 millionthe highest level in over 40 years our basic industries that sustained us for so long are collapsing and have lost their ability to compete and create new jobs productivity has fallen dramatically even the hightechnology sector the one bright spot in our economy finds it difficult to keep ahead of the japanese our main challenger most serious of all we are losing our ability to innovate many scientific technological and economics experts warn that our ingenuity and our ability to capitalize upon scientific findings and create new technologies that lead to new products is faltering we cannot afford to lose our ability to innovate if we lose that we lose our ability to increase unitedstates productivity we lose our ability to maintain unitedstates technological preeminence we lose our ability to create many of the 20 million new jobs essential for a full employment recovery we lose our ability to compete in world markets and we lose our ability to prevent permanent damage to our economy and society we do not have time to waste the japanese realize that the only way to sustain their economic miracle is to move from being master imitators to being master innovators innovation is one of the few areas where we still are a world leader the japanese government has embarked on a major program to stimulate scientific innovation to accomplish that it has set upon a policy of sharp increases in research and development spending it is also consolidating physically some of its research in order to improve efficiency japanese companies too are increasing their r d efforts especially in such industries as electronics we must act and act now if we are to preserve our position as the worlds leading innovator the action we must take is before us todaythe small business innovation development act thi3 bill will tap the innovation and job creation abilities of the tens of thousands of smallscience and hightechnology firms in our nation their record is impressive the national science foundation has found that smallscience and hightechnology firms produce 24 times as many major innovations per r d dollar as large firms and four times as many as mediumsized firms gellman associates reports that small firms are 21l times more innovative per employee than idrge firms and bring innovations into the market sooner yet it finds that large firms are nearly three times as likely to receive assistance from public funds for their innovative efforts than small companies other studies show that small business created many of the millions of new jobs that put a record number of people to work in the last decade moreover new hightechnology firms have an average annual employment growth rate of 30 percent clearly smallscience and hightechnology firms are the most costeffective generators of innovation and the most prolific creators of new jobs in our economy these small companies are an essential element if we are to revitalize our economic and technological base they are a resource that we have no choice but tap at this critical time this is easier said than done for there are many obstacles which make it difficult to fully utilize this resource one obstacle is capital many smallscience and hightechnology firms find it difficult to raise the funds not only to get started but to develop their new ideas and then take them to the marketplace venture capital and tax breaks simply do not help these firms fledgling firms have neither the management team nor a demonstrated capability or feasibility that can be assessed nor do they have profits that can be written off on taxes all they have is an innovative idea the second obstacle is government federal r d agencies have long neglected and ignored smallscienc6 and hightechnology firms a study by the office of management and budgets office of federal procurement policy concluded that only 3 5 percent of total federal r d funds go to small firms despite the fact that they are such costeffective innovators the national science foundation reports that although 85 percent of all unitedstates companies conducting r d are small firms these firms receive only 2 percent of federal r d funds going to industry a recent study by the research and planning institute of cambridge mass on the growth of innovative hightechnology companies reported that small firms are unable to receive basic research support from agencies like the national institutes of health and the national science foundation in fact the report said their ideas are not even given a fair hearing while most people were in favor of government support of basic research there was resentment that in those cases where a profitmaking business could do the work better than another institution at no additional cost it still was denied the opportunity to do so the third obstacle is largeness prof walter adams a distinguished economist and former president of michigan state university recently warned of the dangers of industrial giantism his comments apply to universities too let me quote professor adams industrial giantism whether or not accompanied by monopoly power in specific markets is not benign and therefore cannot be ignored at the very least it breeds ap arrogance of power which ultimately causes those who wield it to lose touch with realityto their own detriment and the detriment of the society they are supposed to serve it also tends to divert entrepreneurship from risktaking investment research and development productivity enhancement and market expansion into efforts tq manipulate the state for protectionist ends it transforms the firm from an economic organism seeking to maximize profits by excelling in the marketplace into a quasipolitical institution seeking the quiet life in orderly markets protected and guaranteed by the state the strength of americas scientific and economic system has been its openness we need this openness even more today if we are to overcome our serious economic problems more important we need a mechanism to insure that the federal government fosters that openness by fully utilizing the unique ability of small businesses to generate innovation the small business innovation development act is that mechanism it mandates that all federal agencies with r d budgets of more than 100 million a year establish small business innovation research programs to develop innovative products and ideas these programs would be funded by earmarking a very small percentage of each agencys r d budget that goes for extramural r d that budget totaled 30 3 billion for fiscal 1982 the earmarking will start with a mere twotenths of 1 percent in the first year rising to 1 percent in the fourth year the defense department will have a 5year phasein that begins with onetenth of 1 percent the program will have three phases under phase i the most technically and economically feasible proposals would be awarded grants of up to 50 000 to perform feasibility studies those projects which demonstrate their technical and economic viability could then qualify for phase ii awards of up to 500 000 commercialization of the results would be left entirely to the private sector in phase iii unlike other government r d programs this one will rely on ideas generated in the private sector rather than on specific projects requested by government agencies the grants will be awarded strictly on a competitive basis and will go only to ideas of scientific and technical merit all of these requirements are spelled out in the act the legislation also would require federal agencies with annual r d budgets of more than 20 million to establish small business r d goals these goals would not be less than the percentage of the total r d funds awarded to small businesses in the preceding year the

the waiting period has consistently ranged from 15 to 30 days with demurrage charges in the area of 15 000 per day per vessel thus it can be seen that limited port facilities not only limit our

is certain about the extent of damage done cleanup at three mile island is expected to continue for another 7 or 8 years and cost more than 1 billion yet in spite of the potential for environmental and social devastation that could result from a nuclear powerplant accident we continue to rely on an antiquated provision the priceanderson act to make compensation available to those who might suffer in the event of such an accident i am today reintroducing legislation to amend the priceanderson act the 1957 law which limits liability for utilities in the possible occurrence of a major nuclear accident my bill would remove the acts 560 million compensation ceiling and would require all atomic plant licensees to arrange a combination of individual private pollcies and an industryfinanced insurance pool to cover the balance of claims resulting from a nuclear accident there are two primary reasons for these changes those people whose businesses homes and lives would be unalterably damaged by a nuclear accident currently could receive a total of no more than the 560 million limit as compensation but the nuclear regulatory commission has estimated that a serious accident could do as much as 14 billion damage the priceanderson act in its current form therefore prevents fair compensation for damages done priceanderson also results in an unjustified competitive economic advantage for nuclear utilities by protecting them from full financial responsibility for operation of their plants under the legislation i am introducing the true costs of atomic energy generation would no longer be artificially deflated through an arbitrary and inequitable cutoff of claim payments the current 560 million figure consists of first the amount of private coverage available t a particular plantabout 160 million second a formula based on the number of plants operating currently 71 which provides 355 million and third 45 million in federal payments the liability limit was set in 1957 and has never subsequently been adjusted for inflation my legislation would amend priceanderson in the following ways stipulate that each licensee must obtain the maximum coverage available from private insurers provide that in the event of an accident at a particular plant insurance on the facility would be the first source of payment state that if the judgment against a given facility exceeds available private insurance coverage the plant would then be liable up to the total of its assets require that if a court determines that the plants assets are insufficient to meet the full judgment the industry pool shall cover the balance of outstanding claims mandate that industry pool participants shall contribute to the cost of the judgment according to a formula based on each licensees generating capacity its degree of risk its total assets and other factors provide that should a court determine that a given utility cannot meet its proprotional share to the pool that plant would then become eligible for longterm federal loans to be secured against the plants assets make explicit that each licensee shall be liable for any incident at its facility resulting in injury to persons and or damage to property and waive the 20year statutory limitation on claims resulting from a nuclear accident unlike the current priceanderson act which mandates a federal subsidy for nuclear powerplant insurance my bill would entail use of federal funds only in the event of a major catastrophe where victims cims exceed a plants private insurance coverage the plants total assets and the proportional contribution toward an industrywide pool even then federal money would be used only to provide interestbearing loans this act was enacted as a means of encouraging private industry to accelerate nuclear power development that was 24 years ago and since then more than 70 nuclear plants have come on line in our country the time is long overdue for nuclear power to stand or fall on its own merits no other energy source enjoys this type of liability limitation and it is congress duty to end this unfair underwriting of the nuclear power industry proponents of nuclear power insist that it is a safe source of energy the nuclear industry certainly should be able to obtain policy coverage far in excess of the current 16q million level on the basis of this argument the industry also should be made to back up its claims by financing a pool to cover the costs of a possible accident which they say never will occur i urge my colleagues to

standards to protect the interests of injured federal workers i stated then and i repeat today we will not eliminate current provi sions which serve to protect disabled workers from interruption in income until we can be sure that there are viable alternatives to take their place we will not change the formulas for determining compensation benefits until we can be sure that the alternatives which are offered are adequate to the needs of disabled workers and may 27 1982 co we will not punish federal employees because they have been injured on the job the subcommittee has examined the administrations proposals and we have found them to be unworkable unadministerable and punitive to federal workers let us look at the administrations proposals and their effect on disabled employees first the administrations stated purpose is to lower peoples benefitsnot only in the future but retroactively as well workers who were injured on the job and have been existing on fixed incomes based on their compensation benefits would under the administrations proposals have their benefits readjusted downward in addition the administratiop proposes to merge the feca workers compensation payments with civil service retirement here again payments to injured workers or their survivors would be lowered again the administration would change the rules in the middle of the game for disabled workers who would be forced to retire from their compensation payments retire to an income that is fixed at a lower level while at the same time being unable to retire from their disability a disability that was earned on the job and does not just disappear at age 65 second the administrations stated purpose is to decrease the paperwork burden of owcp yet virtually every element of the administrations proposals including the elimination of the continuation of pay provisions and their complicated substitution advance compensation program will increase the paperwork and administrative burdens of the beleaguered owcp the additional administrative responsibilities cannot be absorbed by owcp without even greater processing delays and longer interruption of service to disabled workers the average processing time for injury cases is presently 129 days i shudder to think how much worse it will be if the administrations proposals are accepted third in a punitive measure the ad ministrations proposals force the inj ed worker to pay a portion of his or her workrelated injury the worker will be forced to pay directly through the increase in the waiting period from 3 to 7 days directly through the failure of the administration to repay the worker for all of the days directly through the administrations proposals to round down compensation payments to t nearest dollar and directly through reductions in compensation payments as i think back over the 3 days of hearings held by my subcommittee what i am struck by most was the widespread agreement that there are severe claims

southern illinois and i can tell my colleagues from firsthand experience that the departments highhand edness was met with outrage in the 4state area served by the cairo ill weather station it is a decision which remains difficult to understand or to justify for 111 years the cairo weather station has supplied communities up and down the ohio and mississippi rivers with vitally important information about river conditions flood dangers and growing seasons in a town meetinga transcript of which has been sent to several cobgressional offices to the weather service and to the secretary of commerceand in petitions and hundreds of letters the people of illinois missouri kentucky and tennssee have made it clear that the cairo station is an important community fixture that has more significance than omb pollcymakers in washington apparently realize this was my initiation into the hodgepodge process we now use to close a weather station and i was not favorably impressed with what i saw the measure which my colleague from nebraska and i are offering today does not specify which weather stations should or should not be closed we have no parochial interest in this other than the desire to permit our communities the chance to make the strong cases for our weather stations which we know they can make our aim is to remove those decisions as much as possible from the realm of politics the situation closely resembles a similar one 6 years ago when the postal service proposed closure of 10 000 small post offices as a costsaving measure this was done in the face of a provision in the postal services charter requiring the postal service to consider more than just the balance sheet in making decisions to close or consolidate offices our battle at that time led to enactment of a new orderly process for making these decisions it has worked well since that time in protecting the interests of small communities while also permitting adequate management flexibility

qf representatives washington d c dear paul it has come to my attention that unitedstates weather stations have been indiscriminately closed during the past few years to the detriment of persons and communtties relying on their services and that you have introduced h r 6269 in an attempt to establish and formalize objective criteria and procedures for closing and consolidating them these closings parallel the wholesale closings of small post offices during 1976 and 1977 and if the program to close and consolidate post offices had not been checked by legislation many communities would not be served by post offices and the community life in these communities would have suffered greatly in 1977 section 404 b of title 39 was amended to provide that the unitedstates postal service could not rlose or consolidate a post office unless it observed certain procedures in conformance with this law for the closing and consolidation of post offices as a result of this change in law the wholesale closings of post offices was stopped and small communities were protected the procedures in no way prevented the closing of post offices which in many cases is brought about through a change in circumstances justifying that a post office be closed the change in law however did prevent small communities and postal patrons in these communities from having their service cut or diminished without having the chance to have hearings and appeal procedures to protect their interests as i understand it the closing and consolidating of unitedstates weather stations with the resulting impact upon persons and communities relying on their services is similar to that which existed in the matter of closing and consolidating of post offices prior to the enactment of the randolph amendment into law the proylsions of hr 6269 establishes criteria and procedures for the closing and consolidating of unitedstates weather stations similar to those established for the closing of small post offices under section 404 b of title 39 usca it is felt by us as an organization that this change in law worked well in the matter of closing small post offices it has allowed those necessary to be closed but has prevented the wholesale closing of post offices its effect has been to prevent small communities from having their postal services cut or diminished without hearings or appeal rights we feel that in order to protect postal patrons in small communities that it is necessary that such criteria and proc dures as established be in existence without such criteria and procedures postal patrons and communities would have their rights seriously impaired we feel that if such criteria and procedures for the closing and consolidating of unitedstates weather stations were formalized into law such as provided for by hr 6269 that it would have much the same effect in the matter of closing unitedstates weather stations and we support this bill with the thought that it will give an organized approach

states around the world where the united states has previously maintained programs it would virtually terminate american funding for the prestigious fulbright scholars program in all but a handful of states and countries it would terminate all support services for over 300 000 foreign students who need them in this country it would force a number of very excellent and longestablished private

am referring to the african american institute the phelpsstokes foundation operation crossroads africa which may well have to shut down completely and the southern african education program which is

country in zimbabwe which achieved its independence less than 19 months ago 5 of that countrys 15 cabinet members were trained in this country under the very exchange programs which are being eliminated moreover there are some 25 other senior zimbabwean members who have benefited and were no doubt influenced by their ability to spend some time in this country at a very modest cost to unitedstates taxpayers it has paid off with the creation of a moderate prowestern government in zimbabwe in nigeria which returned to civilian rule after 13 years of military government our

explained last fall when i introduced h r 4680 wetlands and other natural areas in the united states are rapidly disappearing as they disappear fish and wildlife populations and outdoor recreational and educational opportunities also diminish or disappear while continued federal acquisition of needed conservation easements is a part of the solution other essentially nonfederal solutions also need to be impleniented h r 4680 was such a proposal it was designed to provide tax relief to those who sell certain lands or easements toqualified agencies and organizations for conservation purposes since its introduction i have received a significant number of very constructive improvement suggestions from a variety of conservation groups and others the discussions followingsenator wallops public lands workshop last summer have also provided additional valuable information accordingly i elected to redraft this legislation somewhat to clarify several definitions and to avoid conflict with existing tax incentives for donations of partial interests in land for conservation purposes the primary purpose and intent of h r 6465 remains the same as h r 4680 that purpose is to exclude from gross income for tax purposes amounts received from certain sales of key natural area lands to qualified organizations including the various states and the united states if the primary use of such land after the sale is for a conservation purpose and that purpose is protected in perpetuity the primary change in this new legislation is to delete the definitions contained in h r 4680 and to adopt the conservation terms previously approved by the congress and enacted into law in the tax treatment extension act of 1980 the tax treatment extension act of 1980 public law 96541 insured the deductibility of the donation of gifts of partial interests in land for conservation purposes at the time that proposal was subject to intensive review the result was a thorough and carefully structured law the tax treatment extension act is only applicable to partial interest donations that are within a carefully defined list of conservation purposes the conservation purposes must be protected in perpetuity and the recipient of the donation must be a qualified notforprofit or governmental organization with the commitment and resources necessary to protect the conservation purpose in essence i have taken the solutions worked out by the congress last session with regard to donations for natural conservation purposes and applied them to sales of conservation areas for a conservation purpose one problem identified with regard to h r 4680 was the negative impact on donations the incentive to donate to a conservation organization for a conservation purpose would be lost if an incentive to sell also applied h r 6465 corrects that situation i have structured this new bill so that it will complement not restrict existing incentives for donations the tax treatment extension act is applicable to the donation of a partial interest that is less than an owners entire interest in a given area h r 6465 covers the opposite situation where an owner wants to sell his entire interest rather than retain limited rigihts or sell a conservation easement for fish and wildlife purposes in this manner an incentive to sell will not generally be applicable to the same interest in land that is covered by the tax treatment extension act an owner has to sell his entire interest or an easement for fish and wildlife conservation purposes to be covered by h r 6465 this could of course overlap with a donation of an owners entire interest but unlike partial interest donations donations of this kind would not insure conservetion protection and therefore geierally serve a different purpose however h r 6465 covers conservation easements sold to qualified organizations for fish and wildlife conservation purposes because of the critical special needs in this area this new legislation also provides federal estate tax relief in certain cases permitting the value of qualified property transferred to a qualified organization to be considered as payment of part or all of the estate taxes due and the postponement of estate taxes due on qualified property being transferred to a qualified organization until the transfer is completed or cancelled in summary h r 6465 excludes gain from the sale or exchange of real property to a qualified organization for conservation purposes the term qualified organization is given the same meaning as provided by the tax treatment extension act similarly the term conservation purpose is defined in reference to that act but limited to three major natural conservation purposes as follows the preservation of land areas for outdoor recreation by or the education of the general public the protection of a relatively natural habitat of fish wildlife or plants or similar ecosystem or the preservation of open space including farmland and forest landwhere such preservation isone for the scenic enjoyment of the general public or two pursuant to a clearly delineated federal state or local governmental conservation policy and will yield a significant public benefit while restrictive these major natural conservation purposes are flexible enough to insure that areas sold to conservation organizations for a conservation purpose can continue to be used and managed as necessary for maintaining the conservation purpose these are not wilderness area categories no lands would be converted to wilderness areas under this legislation traditional conservation management practices and recreation uses such as hunting and fishing would be permitted to be continued however the conservation purpose would have to be protected in perpetuity h r 6465 addresses several other key issues third party transactions would be permitted the sale to a nonqualified organizationsuch as a major corporationwould be covered if the purchaser thereafter contributes such property to a qualified organization within 6 months the legislation would not be applicable to shortterm transactionsthe exclusion would only apply if the gain in question was longterm capital gains rhe legislation would not be applicable to governmental acquisition by actual seizure requisition or condemnation it would be applicable however if the property were merely under the threat of condemnationsuch as if it were within the boundaries of a conservation area or purchased on a willing seller basis this is an important distinction this legislation is primarily designed to encourage private state and local sales to the degree it applies to federal transactions it can only be costeffective if it encourages prompt transactions the cost of this incentive cannot be supported if it is added to the expense of costly condemnation proceedings h r 6465 also has a 10year sunset provision which will insure that sales for a conservation purpose are not delayed the intent is to deal as quickly as possible with present holdings and thus prevent them from being stripped down or subdivided and then sold for a less desirable conservation purpose many years hence this provision is not applicable in cases where the sale is of a taxpayers entire remaining interest which follows the donation of an earlier qualified partial interest

americans today than to demystify the issue of social security minimum benefits the administration and members of the house of representatives and the senate decided to eliminate the minimum benefit in the budget reconciliation process this change was not undertaken without considerable research about its potential effect on older citizens removal of the minimum benefit was recommended precisely because it is an unearned benefita welfare type of income supplement that a recipient is not entitled to from his or her payroll tax contributions maintaining these unearned minimum benefits will cost 7 billionputting unnecessary pressure on the already stresseoi trust funds it is important here to recognize that there are two different kinds of minimum social security beneficiaries one group of beneficiaries has worked for years under social security but at low wages the formula that is used to determine their benefits is purposefully weighted so that they can receive more than they actually should based on their payroll tax contributions these longterm lowwage earners receive benefits that are higher so that they can have a better standard of living after retirement these people who have worked at least 19 years under the system are completely protected as they should be from any benefit changes there is a second group of persons who receive a minimum benefit and who are the subject of current discussion this group has as a rule worked for a short time under social security at high wages based on total lifetime earnings the average individual receiving this minimum benefit could have paid less than 355 in social security payroll taxes over their lifetime and receive a benefit of 2 122 in 1982 this amount would also be increased annually to reflect changes in the cpi in certain instances a couple could receive at least 3 183 in 1982 by paying as little as 3 in payroll taxes over their entire working lifetime it has been found that on the average a husband and wife getting an initial minimum benefit in 1982 would be paid more than 100 000 during their retirement lifetime from the social security trust funds for this average couple that would be about 300 times what they paid into the system these cannot be considered earned benefits now it is important that we are all clear about those that will be affected by the change there are presently 3 million persons receiving the minimum benefit research undertaken byf the general accounting office shows that only 17 percent of the minimum benefit recipients are truly needy and that 74 percent do not depend primarily on social security for retirement income the general accounting office also estimates that 450 000 minimum beneficiaries are already receiving federal pensions averaging 16 000 annually in addition 50 000 have retired spouses who are estimated to receive an average of 18 500 in federal pensions and 300 000 have spouses who are earning an average 21 100 this accounts for 800 000 of the 3 million current minimum benefit recipients another 1 2 million are only technical minimum beneficiaries actually these individuals received more than the minimum benefit because they are entitled to dual benefitstheir total benefit payment is based not only on their own low earnings but on the earnings and social security taxes of their spouse their total benefit would be unaffected by elimination of the minimum benefit also in this group are 200 000 persons who have earned benefits that are equal to the minimum benefit because earned benefits would not be affected these people would not lose any benefits of those receiving the minimum benefit 500 000 are also receiving supplemental security income which is adjusted for receipt of other income therefore those people who would lose the social security minimum benefit would have that same amount replaced under the ssi program an important step was taken to eliminate possible hardships for many of the needy persons receiving social security minimum benefits under the present law one is not eligible for ssi unless he or she is 65 blind or disabled under our new proposal when the minimum benefit is eliminated people who are between the ages of 60 and 64 will be considered eligible for benefits under ssi if they meet other eligibility requirements i think it is particularly important to understand all these facts in light of the charade undertaken by the democrats in the house of representatives today the democrats introduced a resolution that strongly urges that the necessary steps be taken to insure that social security benefits are nor reduced for those currently receiving them they did this knowing that this resolution is not binding and has no force to bring about any change it was used in a partisan effort to improve the popularity of the democratic party statements were continually made that 3 million needy older persons would be hurt by the elimination of the minimum benefit even though this is clearly not the case beside the availability of ssi needy individuals will also be eligible for other federal programs such as food stamps and medicaid benefits the administration and the republican leadership of the house did not want to make this important effort to improve the system an emotional and partisan issue they did not want to be ~placed in a negative role for their attempts to strengthen the system for the wage earners to diffuse this growing bitterness most republicans including myself will vote with the democrats in support of the resolution in closing because of what i have just said i will fully understand the proposal to eliminate the minimum july 21 1 981 co benefit because it is not accomplishing the purpose for which it was originally intended most of the people who receive it were not the low wage earners for whom it was developed moreover many beneficiaries receive adequate income from other sources i believe that it is in the broader national interest to stabilize the system and keep it viable for current and future beneficiaries in doing so we must continue to honor our 46yearold contract wvith the american worker without jeopardizing senior citizens who depend on social security as their primary means of support if high unemployment and high inflation continue to have a negative impact on the social security system we must attempt

interested in how we can restore economic growth in our economy and my topic this afternoon will deal with how we can cut down the deficit for 1983 and indeed create a balanced budget for fiscal year 1983 beginning on october 1 primarily let me observe that today 928 000 workers in the construction industry are out of work that is 18 1 percent of the total in that industry two hundred and fifty thousand of the workers in the automobile industry are out of work that is 20 8 percent of the workers in that industry these two industries together total 1 178 000 workers who are out of work because of a decline in their industries the principal question is why in the opinion of this member from california the reason or the answer to that question is highinterest rates currently the prime in this country is about 16 percent how do we get that prime rate down the answer is that we must reduce the quantity of borrowing which the federal government contemplates taking from the credit markets over the course of the next year how do we do that we have got to reduce the size of the deficit now when you serve in this house in this institution it almost exudes from the walls that you really cannot cut spending of the federal government that it is part and parcel of the premises and it is impossible to really do it well this member from california yesterday made a presentation to the budget committee whereby a plan was presented that we could balance the budget in 1983 i would like to talk about that this afternoon as we prepare to do battle over the budget this year as we have done in the past i am sure that all of us are not just a little more uneasy this time about the budgetary socioeconomic financial and political ramifications of being confronted with the largest deficit in our nations history we are simply not following the script very well which if we recall why our constituents sent us here 18 months ago calls for movement in the opposite direction we are supposed to be balancing the budget not busting it it becomes imperative therefore for us to find an alternative to the administrations fiscal year 1983 budget a chief obstacle which has thus far prevented us from coalescing around an acceptable substitute is the continuing debate over economic assumptions in february the office of management and budget indicated that the fiscal year 1983 deficit would be 107 2 billionincluding offbudget itemsthe congressional budget office estimates the onbudget deficit alone will be closer to 157 billion the variation in just the onbudget deficit exceeds 70 percent due to acceptance of differing assumptions as to gnp growth inflation interest rates unemployment and changes in law with fluctuations of as little as 1 percent accounting for billions of dollars in changes to the budget it becomes nearly impossible for us to correctly predict what the final figures will be because of this uncertainty it becomes even more important for the congress to take decisive action on the budget and reduce the projected deficitwhether 100 billion or 200 billionby an amount large enough and meaningful enough to make a critical difference large enough to relieve much of the constrictive pressure on the credit markets and meaningful enough so that the message to both taxpayers and the business community would be clear as to our intention to finally do something about outofcontrol federal spending i submit therefore that despite protestations to the contrary not only must the budget be balanced it can be or to be more exactbecause of continued volatility of economic assumptionsas closely balanced as possible under existing circumstances this can be accomplished by cutting 110 billion from the projected fiscal year 1983 deficit whatever that figure may ultimately be a cut of this magnitude would certainly be large enough to materially affect financial markets and meaningful enough to send a clear message that we are finally serious about putting the nations fiscal house in order my program for reducing the deficit by 110 billion can be divided into two underlying premises seven direct components and two indirect additives as follows premises first measures undertaken to reduce the fiscal year 1983 budget should encompass the final 6 months of fiscal year 1982 as well such measures as freezing current benefit levels scaledback increases selective cuts rescissions deferrals or eliminations ought to be implemented as soon as possible inasmuch as fiscal year 1982 spending is not only excessive to begin with but alsobecause of its exaggerated deficithas contributed significantly to the fluctuating and undermining economic indicators after all the more pessimistic analyses including the congressional budget offices result from the higher deficits interest rates and unemployment and lower productivity and revenues caused by the fiscal year 1982 budget i believe that by attacking the fiscal year 1982 deficit at least partially we will affect the economic indicators in such a way as to make the administrations original forecasts and assumptions more feasible and acceptable and even though it may be too late to reduce actual spending for this yearfiscal year 1982in many programs budget cuts based upon fiscal year 1982 levels of spending ought to be possible in most cases this is especially important for two reasons fiscal year 1983 spending is largely an extension of fiscal year 1982as well as previousspending and larger cuts are possible in the more egregiouslyinflated fiscal year 1982

resources management and development i am a cosponsor of this legislation and as a representative from maine and a resident of a coastal area there i believe the concept embodied in h r 5543 is a significant one the bill establishes a stable source of funding to insure the continuation of important coastal and marine resource programs that serve both national and state interests as the need for management of our coastal and ocean resources increase it is essential that we give the relevant agencies adequate financial support so that the goals of the coastal management laws enacted by congress can be carried out this proposed legislation gives the states and federal government the opportunity to continue the essential partnership which was established in the coastal zone management act of 1972 and which congress has since recognized as an internal part of ocean resource management the partnership initiated in those laws has led to a balanced and coordinated decisionmaking process that sets up guidelines for a variety of activities occurring in the coastal zone the fisheries conservation zone and on the outer continental shelf h r 5543 includes provisions that insure the continued funding of the coastal zone management act and the national sea grant college program which are the cornerstone of national oceanrelated planning and research activities these laws were enacted in response to rapidly increasing pressures on this nations coastal resources which have not diminished in any way since then in fact in view of the recently approved outer continental shelf accelerated 5year leasing plan i would submit that the pressures on our marine resources are greater than ever as multiple and competing uses take place in areas of national concern or under federal jurisdiction states coastal and marine resource management agencies inevitably become deeply involved in addressing national concerns maintaining federal support of programs such as coastal zone management and sea grant as proposed in h r 5543 is an entirely appropriate role for the federal government to play the money allocated through the ocean and coastal resources management and development fund will be transferred to the states through an already wellestablished program that was set up to help the coastal states handle the pressures of a federal activity offshore drilling that federal activity now seems to be a top federal priority and we cannot ignore the impact this has on coastal communities the czm program is a very diverse one and each federally approved state program is designed to meet the needs of that particular state to obtain federal approval the state plan must take into account the national interest and also coordinate activities with local governments and the public this program therefore represents the necessary and important balance among federal state and local concerns and presents the rare opportunity for communication so that as many of those interests as possible can be recognized the resulting programs now acquired by 27 states and territories focus on the review and analysis of ocs exploration and development plans assessment and analysis of the impacts of proposed uses of marine and coastal zone resources expanded enforcement responsibility in all areas of environmental concern and resource management in the coastal zone and expanded biological research activities again i do not think it is appropriate for the federal government to turn its back on these projects especially at a time when accelerated offshore leasing is certain to generate additional state concerns we cannot simply say that we are no longer concerned with offshore fisheries problems or the impact of energy development on the coastal zone because in doing so we will damage the partnership we have so carefully crafted h r 5543 establishes a fair and equitable method of providing a continuing federal role in that partnership

man living in the comfort and safety and affluence of neutral stockholm during the brutal closing days of world war 11 he left behind a most promising career as the son of swedens most prominent family the safety the security the comfort of stockholm to voluntarily assume the task of saving human lives so raoul wallenberg did not think of this mission himself this was not an activity that

union in addition never satisfactorily has accounted for what happened to mr wallenberg the conferral of honorary citizenship on him may give the united states added leverage with the soviet union in determining whether he is still alive and possibly in securing his release honorary citizenship is exactly what its designation impliesnamely an honor that does not confer on either mr wallenberg or any members of his family any rights or privileges under the immigration and nationality act the concept of honorary citizenship must be distingished clearly from citizenship itself no member of mr wallenbergs family as a result of our action today can possibly claim any derivative rights under our laws even mr wallenberg himself will not be recognized as an american citizen under united states domestic law or under international law if he is found to be still alive conferral of honorary citizenship in no way can be described as giving away anything tangible the meaning and significance of our action today is entirely symbolicbut it is a critically important symbolic gesture in an age when many nations treat human life so cavalierly a few of the statements in the legislative record underscore the critical significance of the step we are about to take today secretary of state alexander m haig jr said that mr wallenbergs contribution during the dark days or world war ii in hungary stands out as a beacon to all those who respect human rights and dignity he expressed his full support for this legislation assistant secretary of state richard fairbanks informed the judiciary committee thatthe conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would serve to underscore the seriousness with which the american government and people view sovietbehavior in the wallenberg case conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would also serve to reaffirm to the government of sweden that the united states firmly supports the quest to resolve wallenbergs fate former secretary of state edmund muskie informed two subcommittees of the house committee on foreign affairs that the chronological record of state department and war refugee cables and conmnunications 0 documents the unitedstates governments position of responsibility for the selection of wallenberg the directive and funding for his activities the appreciation for his work and the deep distress over his disappearance mr muskie concluded that its isthe uniqueness the extraordinary link between a man raoul wallenberg and our nations conscience that makes this action appropriate mr muskie went on to say raoul wallenbergs mission on behalf of the united states behind nazi lines in world war ii was without precedent what hie accomplished on our behalf risking his own life to save the lives of tens of thousands of people is unparalleled in our history the cost to him the years of his life can never be repaid the action of bestowing honorary citizenship on wallenberg undertaken by the congress of the united states will recognize his humanitarian sacrifice under our direction this is an important part of american history this adoption of raoul wallenberg as our own citizen makes clear to our posterity that the american government did act to save lives threatened by the holocaust i can add nothing further to the eloquent statements submitted by numerous witnesses before subcommittees of both the committee on foreign affairs and the committee on the judiciarywvitnesses who underscored the critical importance from both a national and

colleagues in this chamber some of my thoughts concerning the budget substitutes before us and relate these observations to our country and the needs of the ninth congressional district in new jersey while i agree with the president that the federal deficit must be lowered that we must reduce the tax burden and that we should move in the direction of smaller government i deeply feel that many of the proposals contained within the latta budget as revised from 2 weeks ago will accomplish these goals at the expense of the northeast i have supported the president in the past but believe that many aspects of his budget and the latta substitute are this year detrimental to the essential needs of new jersey and the entire northeastern region president reagans february budget which is before us today as the vehicle through which consideration of the budget alternatives will proceed was meant to be the next step in the administrations program to reduce federal spending cut taxes and provide for certain necessary increases in defense expenditures the president stated publicly that if his budget were fully enacted into law our federal deficit would be held to 91 5 billion in fiscal year 1983 and would decline step dily in the years to follow while the president had the best of intentions it was widely recognized by economists and business leaders that the adoption of the administration budget would lead to unacceptably high deficits the fact of the matter is that if the presidents budget were to be fully enacted by this body our federal deficit would be 132 4 billion for fiscal year 1983 according to the congressional budget office this is unacceptable even by the presidents own standard for reducing the federal deficit financial leaders have argued that the large budget deficitswith the prospect of even higher budget deficits to come in the futurewould create servere pressures in the nations credit markets keeping interest rates at unfortunately high levels and thereby preventing recovery from the current recession of the two budget alternatives befare us this afternoon both are relatively close in terms of the projected deficit in fiscal year 1983 the latta substitute calls for a deficit which is 8 2 billion lower than the jones substitute however by fiscal year 1985 this situation has been reversed with the jones deficit lower than the latta deficit by 11 7 billion in terms of cumulative deficits over 3 years jones is clearly less than latta deficits previouly approved by the senate are higher than those of either house proposal throughout this period while the deficits resulting from the presidents proposals are the highest of all under the administrations proposal before us today medicaid cuts total 57 million for new jersey of this amount approximately 4 million would be taken from residents of new jerseys ninth congressional district food stamp cuts would be 66 million from new jersey recipients and particularly hit hard familes of the working poor 32 000 recipients who try to work would lose eligibility or have benefits severely reduced welfare afdc cuts totaling 47 million in new jersey would tighten eligibility still further the presidents budget states that our basic welfare standard is to help the poor work their way out of need rather than fostering dependence on government assistance the administrations budget proposals however would simply continue those policies initiated last year which in fact eliminated most incentives to encourage the poor to seek and hold jobs these policies are a direct consequence of the administrations view that welfare should serve the extreme poor it was bad policy last year to achieve much of the welfare savings at the expense of the working poor it is surely misguided to make deeper cuts this year supplementing the marginal incomes of the working poor is a legitimate and necessary part of a sensible welfare policy neither new jersey nor the nation can afford a set of welfare programs which drive the poor out of the work force i now in place of the initial proposal the house republican leadership compromise being offered by mr latra places even further unacceptable cuts on entitlement programs as a matter of fact i understand that the new latta proposal more than doubles the cuts in basic benefit programs for the poor over what they were in the original latta proposal proponents of the new latta package claim that such large savings will come from reform of the medicare medicaid reimbursement systems for hospitals and physicians however in the absence of comprehensive acrosstheboard reforms these cuts will be shifted to medicare medicald beneficiaries and private pay patients i believe that cuts of this nature will undoubtably require the nations elderly to pay huge new outofpocket costs for medical care i feel that requiring such cuts fails to rcognize that the elderlys outofpocket costs for medicare increased as a result of last jears cuts i do not believe that such a cut can be justified when medicare now pays only 38 to 44 percent of older persons total health care costs the latta substitute represents a loss of at least 2 1 billion in housing for the state of new jersey during the next 3 fiscal years section 8 subsidies would be reduced so that 106 planned housing units for senior citizens in hackensack n j could no longer be afforded statewide it is my understanding that 1 715 dwelling units intended for both families and senior citizens could not be constructed i find these cutbacks under the revised latta proposal to be just as unacceptable as i found them in the original proposal voted down by the house 2 weeks ago i cannot bring myself to support cuts of this nature when funding is being directed instead to an already bloated defense budget which i addressed in the amendment i introduced to the jones the proponents of the revised latta package have claimed that education is provided as an addon over fiscal year 1982 levels this assertion ignores several fundamental facts that seem to me to add to education cuts in the latta package i direct the attention of my colleagues to the fact that 700 million in deferrals are not included in the fiscal year 1983 function 500 baseline thus lowering the base to which the additions are made latta reduces funding for the guaranteed student loan program latta reduces needbased student aid programs and reduces funding for scientific research this will detrimentally affect the national science foundation nasa ani space research with tuition costs increasing as federal support programs decrease we face the very real danger of sacrificing the most important investment in our futureeducational opportunity for our citizensin the name of shortterm budget savings the latta energy budget represents a revised 1 4 billion reduction below fiscal year 1982 program levels under these provisions i am afraid congress will be taking additional steps to abandon its attempt to establish a national energy policy that pursues a balanced and broad based range of energy programs relieving our dependence on foreign oil is vital to our nations economic recovery and the deep cuts or total elimination of many conservation and renewable energy programs will not serve to foster unitedstates energy independence the revised latta package reduces the natural resources and environment function by 400 million below fiscal year 1982 levels at a time when the environmental protection agencys responsibilities are increasing the resources allocated under latta for the achievement of its tasks will be inadequate i believe that the environmental laws which protect the health of the american public and maintapn the quality of our natural environment should not be abrogated through the budget process by this congres in a time of increasing environmental concern we must address the problems of hazardous waste disposal and provide the necessary funding for the environmental protection agency in summary the revised latta proposal before the congress this afternoon reduces the deficit by making drastic cuts in entitlement programs designed to help the poor outlay reductions below current services levels would be directed at medicare medicaid food stamps afdc child nutrition guaranteed student loans and supplemental security income while nondefense discretionary programs will be frozen at fiscal year 1982 levels latta proposes reductions in the following discretionary programs employment and training transportation energy postal service space and science subsidized housing health programs education legal services and small business loans the jones budget alternative shows that we do not have to severely reduce entitlement and discretionary programs in order to reduce our federal deficit however it does not measure up in its treatment of defense spending as well it raises taxes in an unacceptable amount without greatly decreasing the deficit i cannot support it i cannot support latta e"]], "top_unsure": [[0.00021457672119140625, 0.5002145767211914, 0, "i thank the gentleman for

mr fauntroy contains anywhere near an adequate level of investment for job training it should be pointed out that funding for job training is not income maintenanceit is not a subsidy for

for job training will save anything we will end up adding to the deficit now and in future years through welfare costs unemployment payments food stamps and other public assistance the budget

billion for employment and trainingthe same level recommended to the budget committee by the committee on education and labor in addition to providing training to unskilled disadvantaged workers this amount would allow spending up to 1 billion for retraining relocation and job search assistance to dislocated workers and approximately 850 million for supplemental employment and training assistance

the first budget resolution the house spoke very clearly in adopting the oakar amendment to that resolution that it would not tolerate budget reductions in the medicare program today i am introducing legislation which will asture the solvency of the medicare trust fund by injecting general revenues into that fund these general revenues would be generated by repeal of some of the most outrageous provisions of the internal revenue codethose relating to tax preferences for oil producers and royalty owners we have a moral commitment to the health of our nations older citizens and medicare is perhaps the most significant and important federal pro gram helping to fulfill that commitment today 26 million older persons and 3 million disabled persons depend on medicare to help meet their health care costs sixty percent of these beneficiaries are older women as important as medicare is it only meets between 33 to 40 percent of the health needs of older americans clearly significant reductions or added outofpocket costs for beneficiaries would be a tragedy for many of our neediest elderly and disabled citizens i believe it is the height of folly to look to reductions in medicare benefits in order to cut federal expenditures when at the same time we have wholesale giveaways to oil companies existing in our tax code there are a number of provisions some of which passed last year as part of the economic recovery tax act that have little if any economic justification and which should be repealed i am proposing that the revenue collected by closing these loopholes be specifically earmarked and directed to the federal hospital trust fund from which medicare is financed last year i joined the gentleman from new york peter peyser and 74 of my colleagues in proposing to repeal those sections of erta which amended the windfall profit tax act by exempting 2 barrels of oil per day3 starting in 1985for royalty owners reducing the tax on newly discovered oil from 30 to 15 percent over 5 years and exempting stripper oil by independent producers altogether from the windfall profit tax these three provisions will cost the treasury 1 962 billion in 1983 2 333 billion in 1984 and 2 995 billion in 1985 for a 3 year total of 7 29 billion the bill i am introducing today would also repeal these provisions these massive unjustified exemptions for royalty owners and producers were motivated by nothing more than pure political gamemanship certainly not by economics or sound energy policy in addition to the repeal of the erta provisions i am also proposing significant changes in two other provisions of the codethe percentage depletion allowance and the expensing of intangible drilling costs under percentage depletion independent producers and royalty owners are given an option accorded to no other taxpayers in our country they may choose cost depletion which is essentially like straight line depreciation available to all taxpayers holding capital assets or percentage depletion which allows a deduction of 18 percent of gross oil related iricome with certain restrictions since percentage depletion can be used for whatever number of years the oil well continues to produce we are left with the outrageous result that total deductions can far exceed the taxpayers investment if it could be demonstrated that percentage depletion led to greatly increased production of oil perhaps it could be justified however economists question whether percentage depletion has any stimulative effect at all on the production of oil even worse the drain on the treasury is tremendous 1 5 billion each year in 1983 and 1984 and 2 2 billion in 1985 for a 3year total of 4 2 billion another preference accorded the oil industry is the allowance of expensing for intangible drilling costs idcs include drilling shooting and cleaning the well draining road making stirveying and geological work in preparation for drilling construction of derricks tank pipelines necessary for drilling and preparatiop of the well for production in any other context costs like these would be treated as capital expenditures and depreciated over the useful life of the asset or perhaps some other reasonable fixed period of time which bears some relation to its useful life however idcs can be expensed in the first year which results in a tremendous tax deferral opportunity for the oil industry although the 1976 tax reform act restricted the use of idc expensing the tax preference is still very much in existence analysis by the joint economic committee has concluded that the major oil companies who comprise 70 to 75 percent of those using this device can absorb the increased tax without a shortage of capital if the expensing option were eliminated the cost to the treasury due to idc expensing is staggering 3 5 billion in 1983 7 7 billion in 1984 and 8 4 billion in 1985 for a 3year cost of 19 6 billion the total in foregone revenue represented by these provisions equals 6 962 billion in 1983 11 533 billion in 1984 and 13 595 billion in 1985 for a 3year grand total 32 09 billion all the figures i have cited were generated by the joint committee

director harper indicated that it was well with regard to multiyear funding to wait until that report could be made so that we would have governmentwide multiyear funding rather than a specific type of multiyear funding for the department of defense and then another type for the rest of the government that is why we got into the problem in the first place with procurement because we had the dod

recommended the establishment of this commission wvhich after 2 years of consideration of this subject said that we ought to have governmentwide policy rather than have one agency doing it one way and have another agency do it another now for us to take this step with multiyear funding for the department of defense without any projectbyproject control as we have set it up in the government

help maintain the nations airports we all know how costly it is to maintain a learjet these days and they have been able to escape because of their plight wait a minute what am i saying i am saying this is a class budget let us talk about that thank goodness the black caucus has recognized it and done something about it ifthis fails i will support the jones budget i think he has done a wonderful job everyone in this room would like to write everything a little bit differently i understand that i am a congregationalist by background and we always figured that if any two of us totally agreed one of us ns superfluous it is the same with this body but we have to sit down and make some hard choices they have made some hard choices we must line up behindone of these budgets rather than pout that we could not present our perfect one let us talk about a few issues the reagan budget that is probably going to be passed today i wish we could vote on it without coats so we could see the presidential cuff links go in the air the reagan budget that will probably be passed by the shiny new cuff links is not new it has been tried by england we are now told that over 600 businesses a week are failing in england that inflation is not under control and they have had the worst race riots the country has ever seen so we are going to say this is a terrific program let us sign up let us do it also forget it that is crazy qrammlatta reagan is also a gigantic transfer amendment let us talk some more about this budget that is probably going to pass i think it is awful that the japanese prime minister is on his way to this country to tell us that yes while they will have the second highest gross national product in the world this year heaven forbid we should ask them to help support any of the american troops that are providing defense for them in their country or heaven forbid we should ask them for help to pay for some of the ships that we are keeping out there so they can flood the country with their subarus"]]}
