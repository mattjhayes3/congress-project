we look at the reports that have been emanating from dod ever since the socalled mccain report and that was the danger of going hollow report that admiral kelso spearheaded 6 or 7 months ago we have seen a drop in ammunition reserve levels we have seen a drop in training time we have seen a drop in repair levels of our military equipment and we have seen also a drop in a very impor tant category and that is the number of aircraft and other military equipment with respect to being fully mission capable if you remember back to the days of the 1970s we had about 50 percent of our military aircraft that were fully mission capable the rest of the aircraft were being taken apart for spare parts so that the few aircraft that we thought we could keep running had adequate spares to stay in the air so after rebuilding defense in the 1980s bringing down the berlin wall with that strong america and emerging once again the only superpower in the world we are seeing our military readiness being reduced and i have to go back to a point that the ranking member the gentleman from south carolina brought out that i think is very important the dod task force on readiness has acknowledged recently that unitedstates forces are running too hard what does running too hard mean it means you cannot take president clintons cuts in defense of 127 billion and continue to go to all of these

in fact the arms embargo in such a way that the insurgent serb nationalists that minority of the population always had the possibility of supply and resupply from yugoslavia whereas the croatians first and much more critically over the longer period of time the bosnians simply did not have the opportunity to get arms that is the most immoral kind of act on an international level that you could apply to people and then to also propose that you have safe havens and the united nations resolutions for safe havens and then we acting with the united nations and the u n as a whole does not have the guts to enforce its own safe haven resolutions which then leave a city like gorzade being destroyed destroyed before the very eyes of the world and a city like srebrenica being simply strangled

that bill and under all of our understandings i say to my colleagues if you kill somebody you are committing murder and if you kill 10 people youre a serial killer but at least over there in international terms if you kill 200 000 people which is what has happened by the serb nationalists in that attack on 2 united nations members croatia first and then bosnia and i mentioned earlier that the attack on vukovar was at least as vicious as brutal as the kind of result that is happening in gorazde the whole world watching day after day after day did absolutely nothing but that attack 200 000 killed and what were suggesting is please be nice please stop you know something along those lines where every agreement previously has been broken every ceasefire has been violated every imaginable atrocity has been committed and then instantly denied along the way one wonders whether if they kill a hundred thousand more people we will dismantle nato and whether if they kill another 200 000 there will be a ticker tape parade in london or whatever as my colleagues know it really boggles the mind to try to imagine what it is that the worldand the other irony here this is the very

will not allow that kind of thing to happen here we are within the western context and there are other contexts around the world where this sort of genocide has occurred and maybe we have just become inured to it but appeasement as the gentleman has so clearly pointed out simply never pays appeasement leads to small worse things later and the ultimate tragedy here in the former yugoslavia comes in several points one of which is that now at least as things stand milosevic in belgrade knows perfectly well that he can do anything he wants in kosovo because no one is going to do anything he thinks if you cant do anything in bosnia clearly you cant do anything in kosovo there is an area where 90 percent of the population is albanian and that group of people has been reduced essentially to servitude their schools have been closed they are not allowed to learn through schools the albanian language albanians have been driven out of their jobs every imaginable kind of atrocity is occurring in the nighttime in an effort to drive those people out and the only time that there seems to have been a credible force a threat of credible force was when the president issued the ultimatum withdraw from sarajevo or youre going to get hit they apparently thought that was the case i think that probably the serb nationalists are fairly convinced now that that is not the case the credible threat of

this house there is no defensible policy reason to close this area to hunting as called for in this bill my amendment does three things it permits hunting now taking place in the east mojave to continue it allows the california department of fish and game to stay involved and continue its extremely successful wildlife management program in the area and it protects the east mojave as a national preserve within h 5500 the jurisdiction of the unitedstates park service we passed a very similar amendment in 1991 we passed an amendment on the floor of the house 235 to 193 and then the house went on to pass the amended bill 297 to 136 so i think that this amendment should have a great deal of support here on the floor of the house today this is a commonsense compromise to preserve hunting as a traditional use in the east mojave while enhancing its status to ensure the protection of the resources of the area in a responsible way this area is currently a national scenic area managed by the blm under my amendment this would be managed by the park service as a preserve hunting has always been permitted there in season and in keeping with wildlife management policies under may amendments the california fish and game department is to stay involved in the management of wildlife just as in every other state this is a states rights issue as well the east mojave is a significant hunting area quail chukar dove and rabbit hunting in particular and there is also deer and sheep hunting the california fish and game department shows approximately 178 000 hunter days in 1992 and that does not include hunting for deer and sheep we all know that in dear colleague letters and in comments back and forth that these figures have been attacked but i just want to tell my colleagues that these hunting days that have been documented back in 1992 at 178 000 are predominantly in the east mojave area that would be protected under my amendment these estimates on the hunter days are based on the same accepted standards used by federal and state agencies throughout the united states the permits for the limited sheep hunting are auctioned and have brought in approximately 500 000 over 7 years to a dedicated account under the active management of the california department of fish and game this herd is actually growing i could go through the days of hunting that are attributable to various species for example dove it is 23 000 hunter days quail 37 000 chukar 5 000 jackrabbit 11 000 for coyotes 3 000 and for deer 19 000 hunter days a very significant and important part of my amendment that is in the bill or in the amendment says and i am reading from the bill here the secretary may designate areas where and establish periods when no hunting fishing or trapping will be permitted for reasons of public safety administration or compliance with provisions of applicable law so really what we are giving the secretary is the ability to suspend hunting in that area when he feels that in emergencies there should be a closure and this would be pursuant to a subsection that could be put into effect only after consultation with the appropriate state agency having responsibility for fish and wildlife in that area let me say to my colleagues that there are many groups that support this amendment the california department of fish and game the wildlife legislative fund of america the international association of fish and wildlife agencies the north american foundation for wild sheep the california outdoor sportsmens coalition the united conservation alliance the isaac walton league in california and other chapters around the country and the california wildlife federation the western association of fish and wildlife agencies and that is made up of all state fish and game agencies of alaska arizona california colorado hawaii idaho montana nevada new mexico north dakota oregon south dakota utah washington and wyoming i just want to say that the designation as a preserve points out that this is a 20yearold tool somebody may ask my colleagues may ask who came up with this idea the answer is that we did we in congress came up with this preserve hunting in certain areas where there were conflicts where we wanted to provide for the traditional uses in these areas and it works the national preserve designation was created by congress in the 1970s the fundamentals are identical whether it is a park or a preserve many people will attack this amendment today and say we have degraded the status from a park to a preserve but really it is not degraded and the park service protects this area and manages the area very much in the same manner as they would in a park we have provided for preserves in the creation of the big thicket national

security council to adopt a resolution that condemns the sinking of the tugboat and that provides for an internationallysupervised investigation of the incident it also urges the cuban government to do the following release from prison and cease to intimidate all survivors of the sinking identify all individuals from the sinking and recover and return the bodies of the dead to their families so that these men women and children may have appropriate burial services finally the resolution urges the president to direct the unitedstates representative to the united nations to urge the u n high commissioner for human rights to investigate the sinking of the 13th of march it is very distressing that any government including fidel castros can get away with such coldblooded murder that is why i introduced this resolution so far the cuban dictatorship has responded in several ways to the incident first it stated the day after the incidentonly after the brave survivors had spoken upthat the massacre was the fault of a group of antisocial individuals and incredibly the castro regime declared the massacre an accident and even congratulated itself for not killing the 31 survivors to this day they have expressed no regret for the loss of life fortunately the conscience of the archbishop of havana jaime ortega compelled him to state that the sinking of the tugboat was in no way accidental the archbishop also stated that quote the violent and tragic events that produced the sinking of a boat where so many of our brothers and sisters lost their lives are according to accounts given by survivors of a roughness that can scarcely be imagined as some of us know nothing ever goes wrong in cuba without castro and his puppets blaming the united states predictably castro blamed the united states for the massacre raul castro called this an american anticuba campaign and interference by the united states in cubas internal affairs yes you heard correctly it is americas fault that castro and his henchmen committed a massacre of 40 innocent men women and children on the high seas the castro dictatorship claims that it quote thoroughly investigated the event and exhaustively informed its public of how the tragic events occurred if this were not the tragedy that it was that claim would be laughable the fact of the matter is that no one outside of the castro regime has seen any report the human rights group human rights watch americas states that quote cuba continues to deny human rights watch americas request to see the official results of the governments official investigation finally the castro dictatorship has also clearly demonstrated that it fears the wrath of its own people by refusing to list who was killed in the massacre or to recover the bodies of those who died on the ocean floor no one outside the dictatorship knows exactly who was on the boat that it is why in the resolution we ask that the government release a list of the victims and recover and return to the families the bodies of the dead my colleagues the cold war has indeed ended but it is still winter in havana the miserable and oppressive climate in tropical cuba will persist as long as we are silent on atrocities such as this let us stop turning a blind eye to that fact i ask you to join with the archbishop of havana and freedomloving people throughout the world in taking the castro government to task for this act of murder i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.9855346726253629, 0.014465327374637127, 1, "relating to the entitlement commissions

moussavi decided to go public with his case he was then threatened over the telephone that if he testified before the united states congress about the corruption in the mexican government that when he returned to britain he would have one less child mr alex argueta a developer from tucson az is living proof that large centralized banks in mexico defraud their clients and steal their savings mr

released only after he signed a promissory note which changed the terms of his loan and subsequently deprived him of 20 million in addition the committee heard more generally about the lack of banking

to strike the requisite number of words my colleagues have heard the committee on appropriations side of this issue now i shall attempt to clarify the issue and lay out the facts and the reality the reality first of all is there is no penalty clause reinstituted there was a penalty clause in the years prior to 1990 together with the gentleman from pennsylvania i endeavored with the then chairman of the transportation appropriations subcommittee the gentleman from florida to work out a means by which we could repeal the penalty clause achieve an increasing level of funding out of the trust fund for airport improvement programs commensurate with the inflow of tax dollars from the ticket tax to the trust fund in sufficient amount to ensure a dedicated revenue stream to keep on track the improvements in airport capacity enhancement that are necessary to accommodate air traffic growth and reduce delays in the systems we achieved that understanding this chairman in the committeereported bill in 1990 worked out language that repealed that penalty clause i say to my colleague the gentleman from north carolina and to the gentleman from michigan and in walking in lockstep the office of management and budget the department of transportation the federal aviation administration the house committee on appropriations subcommittee on transportation the senate transportation appropriations subcommittee and our committee moved ahead with an authorization level that was matched by the appropriation level without the penalty clause and at the same time we agreed to increase to 75 percent the amount of money coming out of the aviation trust fund into operations and maintenance an amount that was agreed upon with omb the department the subcommittee on transportation and the aviationusing and traveling public as an amount that was appropriate an amount that reflects the department of defense usage the public interest role in air traffic control and the contribution of general revenue dollars that would be appropriate at that level for 2 years this accommodation worked for fiscal 1993 the appropriation level was reduced for fiscal 1994 the appropriation level was drastically reduced from the amount authorized we intended that level to go up to 2 1 billion and we were slowed down by the other body that refused to approve a 3year bill last year we got into a 1year bill the gentleman from michigan raised the question of more frequent authorizations our objective is a little different we think it is more useful to set forth a 3year authorization level so that the aviation community the offloe of management and budget the department of transportation the faa can all plan on dependable amounts of money for airport improvement projects and that the committee on appropriations can look ahead down the line and we worked with the committee to see not what is needed in the system but what level of funding do they think they can provide and we put an authorization that reflected their judgment as well as that of the executive branch now if we reduce the amount of money out of the aviation trust fund for the aip program and we keep the percentage going out of the trust fund into o m then there is going to be a very great disparity over time and the amount of money going into o m out of trust fund dollars will escalate as the aip goes down we do not think that that is appropriate we do not think that that is fairness in the context of the agreement that we reached almost 3 years ago in fact if we look at the levels of funding we see that when the amount went down from 1 8 billion which the administration requested to 1 5 billion that the subcommittee on transportation in the house reported to this body we see some very significant changes in the way in which the o m is funded if we cut it even further we would even exceed that 75percent amount coming out of the o m so i think it is appropriate keeping the two in check"],

thought the new challenges that are being thrust upon us in this rapidly changing postcoldwar world in the period that operation uphold democracy has been in existence united states troops have managed to provide hope where there was once only desolation installed restraint where brutality had long held sway and conveyed to all haitians the importance of forbearance and selfcontrol during this very sensitive period of transition towards the restoration of democracy in haiti it is now up to the congress to ensure that the united states stays the course long enough to ensure that our participation in the multinational force and the u n led mission yields lasting results i commend general shelton and the thousands of men and women in the unitedstates armed services currently serving with compassion and professionalism in haiti and i commend president clinton and the many analysts advi sors and practitioners throughout our government who found a way to enable the united states to face this postcoldwar challenge during the cold war american power and global preeminence were measured in terms of our capacity to confront the thenmighty soviet union either directly or through surrogate wars in third world nations multibilliondollar weapons systems and the worlds best trained fighting men and women set our nation apart from the worlds other military establishments it is my hope however that the end of the cold war will heighten our awareness that americas greatness can also be demonstrated in ways other than we grew used to during decades of cold war rivalry our readiness to work with the world community to devise strategies to uhdergird democracy promote individual liberty and halt macabre and sustained brutalization of peoples leyorid our shores are also worthy of our consideration and support the use of unitedstates troops in such actions raises many difficult but important questions do we have the means to accomplish the mission are the political economic and humanitarian consequences of inaction considered unacceptable by the the united states and the international community are our nations interest in promoting democracy and economic stability abroad advanced in the process what is the required level of consultation between the legislative and executive branches of our government for which types of operations is congressional authorization required these are important questions with which we are now forced to grapple now that the cold war is over with regard to the operations aspects of operation uphold

become obvious and as result the operation has proceeded thus far without any major setbacks nonetheless there will be moments of crisis this operation is not free of danger there will be casualties and so it is incumbent upon us all to prepare the american people and ourselves for these difficult momentsif moments of crisis and setback are not to give way to despair and defeat the important point to remember is that operation uphold democracy represents a new global commitment in the postcoldwar world to uphold and defend democracy and this is an effort in which the united states of america and every person in this chamber should be proud to be a part i have never heard any of my colleagues from either side of the aisle even suggest that the united states become involved in every or even most of the lowintensity conflict that will continue to emerge around the world nonetheless we must be prepared to recognize that there will be those occasions when the suffering of defenseless human beings may be so grave the repercussions of that crisis within our own borders so great and our ability to make a difference so clear that the use of troops in a nontraditional

troops will leaveregardless of what does or does not develop on the ground instead we should do all we can to ensure that our mission is executed as quickly and as effectively as possible haiti does not have a longstanding history of democracy that is a point that has been made repeatedly and it is true it is also true however that haitian people have risked life and limb over many years to free

gentleman from tcf texas and the gentleman mi from pennsylvania and i ject commend them for what they have done me i rise in support of h r 4308 iva legislation to reauthorize the north american ms wetlands conservation act lcts i want to commend the chairman of the der committee mr studds the ranking minority du member mr fields and one of the chief cosponsors of the bill mr weldon for tireless ro and creative work that went into the bill why i observethis legislation goes ihe swell beyond the originalstraight reauthorization legislation i introduced the program created by the statute we crafted several years ago is working well with a few minor exceptions from its inception in 1989 this program has funded 289 wetlands conservation projects in 36 states 10 canadian provinces and 8 mexican states conserving more than 1 3 million acres of wetlands in canada and the united states alone the traditional manner of protecting wetlands is through outright purchase using federal dollars this program stretches dollars through cooperative agreements between the federal state and nongovern mental organizations more than 110 million in federal north american wetland conservation act has generated more than 212 million in socalled partnership funds that kind of leveragelor federal moneyis hard to find and it has been private conservation groups such as ducks unlimited and the nature conservancy that have made substantial commitments of their resources to make the program a success my biggest concern is that projects under this program utilize too many short term agreements in my mind long term conservation which is terminology from the original statute means protecting the resources for at least 25 years and mostly in perpetuity the committee report reinforces this interpretation and i expect future projects will take this admonition seriously the committee made other constructive modifications to my bill to reauthorize the prigram authorizing cash contributions from nonunited states sources will create opportunities for more projects in mexico the enhanced planning and reporting will give the council and the commission more tools to plan future projects and expand the scope of those projects my one caution however is while project diversity is an important goal the original intent of the program was and still is to protect migratory waterfowl if we stray too far from this foundation we may undermine the strength and purpose of the program i also want to thank the committee for taking my concerns into account in section 5 of the legislation dealing with the conservation of coastal wetlands language was insertedmaking reference to official noaa coastal zone boundary characterization reports that make almost 80 percent of michigan eligible to qualify to receive project consideration this is good legislation and reauthorizes a~program marked by success i urge its adoption"], [0.014722377061843872, 0.48527762293815613, 0, "let me tell the gentleman that the idea that we are putting the money into drug control is obviously a nice thing to be doing however it was in the drug control functions where they demonstrated all the savings the last year when they were going public with all this money they were saving at the white house and we were told about all the staff they were cutting and everything that was going on at the white house the fact is the only place that was taking a huge blow was in the drug control portion of the bill now we get out to a year later all of the headlines have been written the stories have been done and all of a sudden we are in with an additional amount of money for that office that in fact swells the budget and causes some concern i am a little concerned we get past the press release and now we are back to the spending and in my view it is something that the house ought to address again on this floor as a matter of amendments in disagreement or other kinds of devices that would be open to us if it were not for the provisions of this rule that waive all points of order"], [0.01588672399520874, 0.5158867239952087, 0, "underlying the entire national health care reform debate lie two central philosophical questions how much government do we want in the american system how much government can we afford some people believe the government should take over and manage our entire national health care delivery systemwith centralized control and decisionmaking on the other end of the spectrum are those of us who believe that our health care decisionmaking must remain predominantly private personal and market driven clearly the current patchwork of government and market forces that crisscross our health structure have left an imperfect situation in which millions of americans lack access to quality care and the cost of providing that quality care is skyrocketing but is more government controlsome of us might say interference the answer looking at the history of american health care spending we see alarming trends that raise serious red flags about the costs of governmentrun health care in 190 this nation spent 4 billion on health care in 1960 total national health expenditures were 27 1 billion in 1965 the year government became a health service payor for millions of americans through medicare and medicaid national health spending had increased to 41 6 billion over the next 15 years national health spending quintupled reaching more than 250 billion in 1980 over the next decade health spending more than doubled again and by 1991 this nation was spending 751 8 billion on health care put another way in 1960 we spent 7 8 percent of our gross domestic product on health care by 1991 that number was 14 1 percent not only has governments entry into a major portion of our health care market not had a positive effect on the cost of care but rather many of us believe governments intrusion into the marketplace has been a major factor in the enormous increase in health spending simply put government control tends to inflate rather than lower costs the president keeps telling us that his health reform plan will control health spending while ensuring that everyone has health care and bringing down the national debt if it sounds too good to be true that is because it is even the congressional budget office which was under enormous political pressure to provide a favorable review of the clinton plan has found that under the best of circumstancesthat is if price controls are 100 percent effectivethe clinton health plan will generate additional deficits of 130 billion over the next 5 years when has anything the government does been anywhere close to 100 percent effective a more realistic review conducted by the wellrespected policy firm of kpmg peat marwick found the clinton plan will likely add 579 billion to the national debt in the next 7 years if its price controls are 50 percent effectivewhich is also a stretch for the federal government as we look at other analyseslike those that predict massive job loss under the clinton plan and thosethat show the presidents approach has severely underestimated the costs of the new health entitlement he promisesits no wonder americans are increasingly rejecting the clinton plan the answer to those two central questions is becoming loud and clear americans do not want government making their health care decisions and they cannot afford it either and they know it and they are asking us to look at the other choices"], [0.016116857528686523,

situations such as this i know we are taking time here i can see that some members are bored with this that we are taking the time of the body but i want to tell you that if you were a federal employee making 60 000 or 50 000 or 40 000 and you had no deep pockets no big contributors to call on and you are trying to educate your kids this would be important to you i would hope i would be as consistent on this issue if reagan were president or if bush or jack kemp were president that i would be up here making the same points whoever might be involved this has been absolutely wrong now if a different person gets involved it should make no difference what i want to say in closing is that i hope we can work out bipartisan legislation that would set up a groupperhaps a nonprofit group that would look at these kind of cases that would exercise discretion i must tell my colleagues that although i believe it is right to assist these five travel office employees i think the precedent that we are setting here is not necessarily a good precedent let me say for myself that this is a special circumstance a onetime example a onetime case but how we treat the least of these people under a political cloud indicates how we will treat anybody else i will revise and excend my remarks and submit the rest of my statement in the record with a number of documents with it if i may i reserve
