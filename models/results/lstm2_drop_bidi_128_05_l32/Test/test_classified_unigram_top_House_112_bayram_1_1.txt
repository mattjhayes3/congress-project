public sector jobs are cut and where private sector jobs though they have been growing are offset by those public sector cuts leaving us with an unemployment rate which were happy to have at 8 6 percent but within the historical context is still a national disgrace and an outrage to have unemployment at 8 6 percent for so very long but were happy to have it because it has been as high as 10

right now 14 million people are unemployed and companies really arent hiring for most of these people unemployment insurance is the only thing thats keeping them in their homes and not out on the street according to the census bureau unemployment insurance has pulled 3 2 million americans out of poverty last year and thats why congress needs to make sure that all americans continue to have this vital lifeline available any credible economist will tell you that unemployment insurance creates jobs every dollar invested in unemployment insurance yields a return of 1 52 in economic growth at least 200 000 jobs would be lost if congress fails to pass the extension of unemployment insurance benefits congress must not leave washington for the holidays without extending unemployment benefits that create jobs and put money into the pockets and on the tables of millions of americans both democrat and republican politicians we together have not passed that jobs bill while the republicans are in the majority and i believe bear the weight of the responsibility its a responsibility of every member of congress to call for the extension of unemployment insurance benefits and

changing medicare to a voucher program means that they will no longer have access to a guaranteed set of health benefits that the value of a limited voucher wont keep up with rising health care costs that the voucher would become insufficient over time and the care they need could become unaffordable that too many taxpayer dollars will be spent on advertising campaigns and administrative costs

exclusions for certain services discrimination based on income illness or age and more uncertainty if a serious illness or need for longterm care occurs seniors know that privatizing or voucherizing medicare will mean that they pay more in premiums or do without and it doesnt end there in addition to medicare cuts republicans also want to take away medicaid for the nearly 6 million seniors who depend on it for nursing home or longterm care they say proudly that they will cut funding to states by 1 trillion this means that disabled and frail elderly americans will be placed on waiting lists

very same budget proposal where republicans give seniors a limited voucher to pay for higher insurance premiums they protect the pentagon from spending cuts on unnecessary weapon systems one trillion dollars in tax expenditures 700 billion in tax cuts for the wealthy few 40 billion in tax breaks for oil companies and billions of dollars to continue inefficiencies at the pentagonall of this

telling them that the broken bodies ive seen at walter reed and bethesdawhich now have been consolidated to walter reed at bethesda and ill be there next tuesdayi was telling them about seeing four young men that have no body parts below their waist theyre living they would have died in vietnam medical technology has advanced to the point that a young man or young woman can live with half a body nothing below their waist the admiral told me of seeing a young man that he visited that has no arms or legs no arms or legs and hes living uncle sam youve got a tremendous responsibility to take care of these heroes for the next 10 15 20 25 30 years and this congress cant even balance the budget no veteran from these two wars should ever be told that your check did not come in this month because

point marine air station to train afghans to be policemen sergeant balduff emailed his wife amy the night before he died and said i dont trust them i dont trust them i dont trust any of them the next night a trainee stood up at a dinner and shot and killed the colonel and the sergeant to my friends who have spoken and my friends who are speaking after me we must demand that this congress awaken

genetically engineered salmon escaping could be detrimental to wild stocks the list goes on and on and on our fishing communities are already facing challenges and genetically engineered salmon would have an additional effect of lowering wild salmon prices as already seen with normal farmed salmon lower prices combined with declines in wild salmon stocks would be economically detrimental to our

bipartisan as possible i want to thank him for the time he took to meet with me personally to discuss this legislation and ways to improve it going forward i oppose this bill in its current form for

from criminal or civil liability for any harm that may result from a companys actions that stem from the sharing or receiving of cyber threat information as long as the company can show it was acting in good faith this bill would also create a new exemption to the freedom of information act that is unwarranted since current law exemptions provide the flexibility necessary to protect sensitive

not sufficiently address these concerns finally the bill would allow companies to share private consumer data without adequate protections or oversight private entities would decide the type and

further stress already overallocated water in the west oil shale development also poses a potentially serious threat to water quality the process of transforming the kerogen in shale into oil leaves behind salts and numerous toxins watersoluble chemicals that could leach into the groundwater that is the source of much of the regions surface water during the critical time when flow is lowest flushing these chemicals from the oil shale production zone as several companies have proposed would also create huge volumes of highly saline water that will require further treatment the technical feasibility of isolating and treating contaminated groundwater has not been demonstrated the proposed development of this resource will recreate major new demands on the energy grid as well by some

months now i have come to this floor to tell the stories of men and women in the military who have been raped by other soldiers as heinous as those assaults are the greatest injustice is suffered after the assault when victims are doubted debased disrespected and discharged from the military that they have so proudly enlisted in last night i had a long conversation with an army and navy veteran terri odom who told me she dreamed to serve in the military since she was a little girl she was so determined that between her junior and senior summer she went to boot campnot to some playground area somewhere in her community but to boot camp after high school she went to sicily with the seabees she told me that she had never been happier serving her country seeing the world even swimming in the mediterranean it was like terri was living a military recruiting commercial while there she was befriended by an nco 25 years her senior he was a father figure to terri and she trusted him explicitly when he volunteered to walk her home one night terri accepted the offer without hesitation she told me that when he first grabbed her she was more confused than scared this is a young woman who was very proud of her service and had the utmost respect for her colleagues particularly one who had such a distinguished career this couldnt possibly be happening terris story is graphic i only tell you the details so you can understand how horrific the response has been from our military terri was raped repeatedly her abuser used pipes and other objects he found in her bathroom that was being remodeled he cut her arms and vagina then poured paint thinner into her wounds he punched her with the full force of his 6foot4inch 270pound frame terri it should be noted is 5 foot 3 inches she fought back even did some damage but she was outmatched she woke up in a bathtub covered in blood she was missing teeth and fingernails yet her first thought was that she couldnt be late for duty she also knew that she could get medical attention and file a criminal complaint at the base surely the navy would take care of her it turns out she was wrong about that as she was about her rapist terri cleaned herself up showered showed up for duty and reported the rape to her chain of command she requested medical attention but was told instead to take an aspirin and sleep it off no one in terris chain of command allowed her to get medical attention instead they told her to drop the rape story or her career would be over despite valiant efforts to stop it terri was eventually honorably discharged against her will which is exactly what happens to 90 percent of military personnel who report rapes the navy lost a good soldier that day the navy also kept a rapistnot officially of course because there was never an investigation the reason because in the military the authority to request one lies with the chain of command but the chain of command is incentivized not to because they are judged on how few instances of rape and other mishaps occur during their command this is as true today as it was when terri served that is why terri odom has once again answered the call to service she is here with me this morning to make sure her story is heard this nation must aggressively pursue rape charges in our military sexual assault cases must be taken out of the chain of command and must never be punished by nonjudicial remedies like a mere demotion in rank finally a uniform is not a getoutofjailfree card military sex offenders must be entered into the same national database as

this point to try and get an faa reauthorization bill both out of the house and to the point where we can get it to a conference committee so he said he is very frustrated with the process we are very frustrated with the process and today the extension that the majority is offering even frustrates us more because we know that this is an extension not a clean extension but it has a rider on it involving essential air services the debate today and the discussion about this extension is not about essential air service some members may support essential air service others may not support it theres been a lot said on the floor today about subsidizing a 3 000 subsidy per ticket just for the record we are not debating that that is to be taken up by conferees if we ever get to conference members can in fact have their opportunity to make changes in the eas program at that time it should not be a part of this extension but for the record let me say that in reference to an airport that was mentioned in montana it is actually 607 miles from denver to the denver airport so if you live in that community its not just a short drive to get in a rental car and drive to the denver airport also the nevada airport that was referenced from salt lake city you are talking 234 miles and the list goes on and on so thats an issue that we can debate at the appropriate time some changes may need to be made to the essential air service program but i think also we need to keep in mind were not just talking about passengers getting from point a to point b when theres hundreds and hundreds of miles to get to the nearest large hub airport to catch a flight but were also talking about moving medical supplies donor organs and a number of other things so its not just passengers and let me also say my friend mr mica mentioned as well that weve had an open process here well in fact we have not the process has not been open on this extension in fact the majority dropped the bill on friday without consulting the minority they did not consult with us about what may be in the extension in addition to that they went to rules committee and asked for a closed rule so that no member who might be affected by this legislation or might have an essential air service airport in their district that may want to go to the rules committee and in fact get an open rule or come to the floor to debate the merits of keeping their airport on the eas program they did not have that opportunity because the majority asked for a closed rule had the majority come to us in the minority and said we want a clean extension we want to move it forward we wouldnt be here today we in fact would probably have voice voted this extension it would have gone to the senate it would have been voice voted there and in fact we would have been a step closer to making certain that the faa is able to operate after the deadline on saturday finally let me say that we are frustrated because ive heard chairman mica say many times and as the ranking member mr rahall has said we have worked closely together we have done everything we can do in order to work together with mr mica and mr petri in order to get a bill but i have read reports and i have just heard mr mica say on the floor again today that you know we could wrap this conference up in 20 minutes and he said today we could wrap it up within an hour that there is only one issue that is remaining just for the record let me say if thats the case we have not been consulted on that one issue there are several issues and just for the record i would say major issues that have not been resolved on our side on the house side between the majority and minority let alone with the other body are one funding levels two essential air service three is repeal of the national mediation board rule four is the dca perimeter rule often referred to as slots other outstanding issues are occupational safety and health protection for flight attendants the 3hour rule for tarmac delays the lithium battery issue and the aircraft activity disclosure to the public the barr program and i have a list of other things to our knowledge that have not been resolved so when the chairman or others say that we could wrap this up in 20 minutes or in 1 hour i dont believe that is the case in fact i know its not the case we have not been consulted or negotiated to the extent that we could reach an agreement among ourselves on the house side let alone with our colleagues over in the other body so let me just say that its a disappointment to me we have worked closely together to move the faa extension on a permanent basis we are here on wednesday the faa extension in fact will expirethe faa will have to lay off employees this saturday if in fact this extension is not approved by both bodies and sent to the president and the senate has already told us that they are not going to accept this extension with this rider in fact in the extension they will approve the clean extension and its my understanding the other body is going to pass a clean extension and send it over here sometime today or by the end of the week it would be my hope that the majority would in fact accept a clean extension so that the faa can continue to serve the flying public and do all of the things that are essential to keeping the safest aviation system in the world as safe as possible so that we can begin to try and get a permanent bill and a longterm bill as well finally i would conclude by saying that we need to appoint conferees the senate has passed their bill in february of this year we have passed our bill in april and we are here now in the latter part of july and chairman mica is saying that all of these issues have been resolved but one and we do not even have conferees appointed so i would just encourage the leadershipranking member rahall and i have sent a letter to the speaker and to the leadership and to the majority saying look lets appoint conferees the senate has appointed conferees the only opportunity we had to appoint conferees in the last congress was in fact stifled and held up by the senate and frankly by two senators from the state of tennessee over one issue lets get the nonsense behind us there are things in the essential air program that i would like to see changed there are things in the bill that i would like to see us reach an agreement on the only way to do that is to get an extension passed so the faa can get past saturday and operate until september 16 it will give us an opportunity to appoint conferees so that we can meet with the conferees who have already been appointed in the other body to reach a permanent agreement the american people deserve better than what theyre getting today on the floor of this house and the american people deserve to know that we in fact are doing everything that we can to move forward to keep the safest aviation system in the world exactly thatthe leader in safety around the world so with that i ask my colleagues to vote no on this extension in the hopes that we could pass a clean extension i yield back the balance of my time"]]}
