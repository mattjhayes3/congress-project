reviewing this proposal to put it to two tests the first test is does the policy work on the ground in nicaragua and is it likely to succeed this is a military action by soldiers that we are supporting and i think that as we think about whether or not they could militarily succeed putting aside the cia reports and even our own defense reports that say they are unlikely to overthrow the sandinistas it is important to review a little history of our involvement in nicaragua the united states has invaded nicaragua 12 times in history if you go the 1920s and 1930s it sounds an awful lot like the congressional record of today and if you look at the old newspapers from those periods you will see that the headlines remind you of the headlines of today so to the people of nicaragua the people that were involved in those times this is nothing new 1 1700 i think a second fact we must recognize is that in the late 1970s when this country underwent a revolution 50 000 nicaraguans lost their lives this is a country of about 3 3 million and if we remember in the vietnam conflict we lost about 50 000 people on almost any day you can drive by the vietnam memorial here and get a sense of what that conflict and that loss of life meant in this country so we can imagine what that meant in nicaragua when we begin thinking about whether or not a military solution to the problem is something that can work on the ground in nicaragua so i simply submit on the basis of that anecdotal evidence and the evidence we see from our own military and our own central intelligence agency that having a military policy and a military solution to our problems is not likely to succeed i think the next thing we should look at is this does the policy reach the goals and the vital interests of the united states on this point i think there has been some confusion because we have many different goals that are enunciated by the administration i think we should try to better articulate what our goals are i think there are two i think we have two vital interests in nicaragua the first is to reduce the foreign military influences in that country certainly soviet cuban libyan whatever foreign military influence is in this country and the second is to keep the sandinistas from interfering with their neighbors with many of whom we have treaties and obligations if we put this policy against that testwhat are our goals and are we reaching them i think members would agree with me that we are not previous speakers on the other side have said that we just cannot negotiate with communists certainly there are people in our country who have that view i do not think the president has that view if he did have that view he would not be negotiating with mikhail gorbachev and the soviet union if he did have that view he would not be negotiating with the chinese on a variety of subjects and i believe that the president has even said that the contras are in the field in order to put pressure on the sandinistas so that we can get to negotiations to resolve and reconcile our vital interests if that is our goal then what are the people in the region who are leading the effort and working to make this effort come about saying about contra aid president arias who is the author of the live and viable plan of the moment said when he received his nobel peace prize that president reagan knows very welland i quote that the contras are the problem and not the solution and yesterday the people who have been active n the contadora process said this we urgently call upon the countries with ties or interests in the region to halt unconditionally unilaterally and immediately any actions aimed at destablization or any type of aid to irregular forces as is established in the san jose declaration for the attainment of peace and democracy n central america in conclusion i would say let us give peace a chance let us give the people in the region a chance we have been trying the military solution for 6 years now let us give the other way a chance let us give life to the words of a great american uttered about his brother when he said we see wrong and try to right it we see suffering and try to heal it and we see war and try to stop it we have tried the military solution let us try something else let us give peace a chance let us not give this aid to the contras"], [0.02373826503753662, 0.9762617349624634, 1, "i thank the gentleman from massachustts there is virtually nothing the gentleman said that i would disagree with it is a very thoughtful moderate balanced statement and i would simply like to add to it i myself have been deeply concerned i could use a lot of adjectives such as horrified and shocked to describe my feelings about what appeared to be the unmeasured response of the israeli government to the violence on the west bank and the announcement by the defense minister that israel is going to use force and beatings as a matter of policy that to me was totally illconsidered there is no question that israel pays a formidable price in international good will and credibility when statements like that are made of all the governments in the world of all the peoples in the world to use excessive violence it is hard to think of a country wvhose history within recent memory four decades makes such action less appropriate and more offensive i have to say that in all honesty it has been a very painful process for all of us here who have a deep sense of commitment to israel who want to see her survive who want to see her maintain her special relationship with our country and who want to see her maintain the very special moral and ethical quality that has differentiated israel from all the governments in the middle east and most of the governments in the world it has been painful for those of us who care about those things to see what is going on and i hope very much that israel will cease the policy of public beatings breaking hands and breaking bones in response to arab violence i regret saying this publicly but congressman barney frank of massachusetts did bring up this subject and he treated it in a very thoughtful way so perhaps it is appropriate to comment on it i expressed these views privately in an hourlong meeting with the israeli ambassador to the united states about a month ago so here i am going public but let me just add a footnote that first of all these are very trying experiences under similarly trying experiences with comparatively untrained or insufficiently trained troops we had our kent state we had our my lai and we consider ours a moral and an ethical country but sometimes the training of troops and the training of national guard personnel is not sufficient for the extraordinary conditions under which they all of a sudden have to function and i suspect there was some degree of lack of training and lack of preparedness for these violent episodes on the part of the israeli troops they are trained soldiers and they are trained for combat they are not trained for civil disobedience and civil rebellion and it must be quite clearly recognized that these young kids these palestinian kids were not playing kids games they were not playing spih the bottle they were not playing mumbletypeg they were playing lethal games when you throw a molotov cocktail people get killed when you throw large hunks of rock and cement people get killed a young arab youth was killed by a hunk of cement that was thrown by a palistinian and we have seen pictures of both soldiers and television cameramen writhing on the ground in agony after having been hit by large rocks these are very serious lethal games that the palestinian youth are playing apparently these lethal games are not entirely spontaneous some kind of master hand is organizing them and guiding them and i think the israeli government has an absolute right in its own self defense to meet that kind of lethal violence with sufficient force to quell it and to control it it is very difficult to measure what kind of force is sufficie force as we have found out in our country let me also say that the israeli government for 40 years repeatedly has expressed the position that it is willing to sit down with the arabs and talk about all the issues the only arab chief of tate who took them up on that was president sadat and we all know regrettably the tragic history that ensured fi 9m his pattern of cooperation and hi openhandedness in dealing with the state of israel assassination has become an accepted means of political expression in the arab world and no doubt one of the reasons which gives king hussein pause at accepting a public posture of cooperating with the is aelis is the memory that he has frorm childhood of the vision of his grandflther being shot down in cold blood by arab extremists when there was suspicion that his grandfather was cooperating with the jewish agency of palestine of course this long precedes the establishment of the jewish state in 1948 and perhaps it was true that he was cooperating with the jewish agency for palestine in trying to bring some kind of common understanding some kind of consensus some kind of compromise and some kind of conciliation to the very troubled period in those days predating the founding of the state of israel tlpat policy of assassination for willingness to meet with the israelis halfway or even a quarter of the way has persisted there have been a whole string of political assassinations directed against the socalled arab moderate such as the massacre of syrian citizens in the village of horns by syrian troops those assassinations have no doubt had a very stultifying impact on tlhe willingness of arab chiefs of state or arab civilians andcivic leaders to express some willingness to meet israel at the conference table israel today has a clearly expressed position of being ready to sit down and negotiate with the arabs on every aspect of peace whether israel should agree to a process of trading land for peace is a decision that only the israelis are capable of making how much land for how much peace i could not define the land areas on the west bank or in gaza that israel could reasonably give up without having to face far higher security risks these are very sophisticated military and security decisions that i do not feel qualified to make i am not sure that many of the 535 members of the house and senate are qualified to make that decision either how much peace what does peace mean peace certainly means more than nonbelligerency israel gave up a very considerable portion of land in the sinai desert to establish peace with egypt yet they did not get peace what they got was a minimal level of nonbelligerency peace means far more than that peace means commerce peace means the exchange of students peace means the exchange of scientists peace means the exchange of business people peace means joint programs for development of all kinds peace meaiis joint telecommunications projects involving radio and telephone and television peace means joint projects affecting the environment such as the mutual joint exploitation of the scarce water resources in the middle east and peace means the exchanr e of cultural representatives even with egypt the one country in the middle east that has gone further than a status of total belligerency even with that country israel signed a peace treaty but did not get peace at the most they have gotten a begrudging arrangement for nonbelligerency that is a lot the absence of war is a heck of a lot better than a continuation of war but still israel paid a great price for peace and did not ever get what we normally think of as the full measure of peace and the blessings of peace they got a small measure of nonbelligerency nothing more so israel had to do some agonizing introspection on how much land will not jeopardize their security for how much peace how much can israel trust a signature an arab signature on a peace treaty i do not know the answer to that i suspect the israelis are far more sophisticated and far better equipped to make that decision of haw much land they are willing to sacrifice for a collection of arab signatires on a peace treaty i suspect that the israelis are far letter qualified to make the decision a to whether if the arabs ever had a viable military option they would not instantaneously take advantage of it no matter how many signatures were on how many peace treaties i cannot answer that question all of these issues have to be factored into the question of how much land for how much peace these are agonizing questions for all of us and i would state that our predilection for pushing israel against her better judgment into a posture of agreeing to make some sacrifices of land for some kind of peace is basically dubious proposition i know that president reagan and secretary shultz would desperately and urgently like to see some kind of resolution or at least the beginnings of some kind of resolution to these agonizingly complicated and emotion ridden anxiety ridden problems of the middle east it is only natural they would they would take legitimate pride in that accomplishment i give president reagan total credit for having been a friend of peace in the middle east and having been a stout and loyal friend of the state of israel i give secretary shultz credit beyond my ability to express in words he has been an extraordinarily talented thoughtful wise human being in his policies toward the middle east and i must say that when he was appointed secretary of state coming to that job from the vantage point of having been ceo or chief executive officer of the bechtel corp doing billions of dollars of business in the middle east i and some of my colleagues had some pretty profound reservations about him but they were quickly dispelled when we had a chance to hear him out discuss the issues with him and watch his performance he is an extraordinary man no matter what administration succeeds the reagan administration i suspect that secretary shultz will be sorely missed for his great qualities of heart his great qualities of intellect and his great qualities of integrity and decency that shine forth in every arena he is a remarkable human being but i suggest that we have to think about a whole long succession of presidents at least since world war ii almost every one of whom had the same conviction that they wanted to settle this agonizingly difficult problem of the middle east on their turf they have come up with one quick fix after another in the 40 years since world war ii the israelis have a long memory and they have to place all these individual efforts by individual presidents and secretaries of state to find a solution to the problem on their watch they have to view all of these successive efforts with a long and deep sense of history and perhaps they look around the world and see that some problems just cannot be solved by a quick neat solution we have problems with the soviet union that apparently although hopefully they are being reduced in order of magnitude now for 40 years since world war ii have been virtually intractable after all of the negotiations that have taken place over the 7 years of the reagan administration we and the soviets are each still spending 300 billionodd a year on defense hopefully we will gradually reduce that amount but we have not solved the basic problems between ourselves and the soviet union the british who are about as civilized a people as has ever populated this earth have still got agonizingly difficult problems with the irish the irish have agonhlingly difficult problems between irish catholics and irish protestants when you go to ireland and you visit with the protestant leadership in belfast and then you say what wonderful people they are they are intelligent they are thoughtful they are witty and they have got a rich history surely they can be expected to negotiate away these problems then you go to dublin and you meet with the irish catholic leadership and you say what marvelous thoughtful intelligent people these are why cant they get together well they have not gotten together these problems go back 400 years apparently they are virtually intractable there arc other places around the world the problems that the belgians have with nonbelgianspeaking groups and the problems the frenchcanadiansthe quebecquoise the levesque supportershave with the englishspeaking government in canada seem to be comparatively intractable as well so there are problems around the world which do not seem to be susceptible to a quick fix of easy rapid solutions it is just possible that the israelis thinkand i do not know this for a factthat there are not any quick fixes to the problems between arabs and israelis and that in all likelihood once they get into the business of territoryforpeace they are going to be under great pressure to make sacrifices of territory that are not in their best interests there are some israelis who have profound misgivings about the nature and quality of the land they gave back to egypt when they made a peace with egypt i think they expected a larger richer definition of peace than what they got so there may be some reservations about moving down that slippery slope of peaceforterritory or territoryforpeace i would respect their right to make those decisions and i would respect their right to tell us look we understand your tremendous eagerness your noteworthy praiseworthy eagerness to bring some kind of solace peace and reconciliation to the middle east but after the peace conference is over you all go back home and we are the ones who are left to live with these understandings we are the ones who have to evaluate over the years how much territorial sacrifice in terms of real security we made for how much of a peace what value do we place on that peace how much can we rely on that peace how much can we rely on the integrity of the arab signatures on that peace treaty there is no one who can make those decisions there is no one who can examine that calculus of factors other than the israelis themselves so i want to say how much i respect congressman frank for the very thoughtful way in which he treated this issue i want to say how much i respect the 30odd members of the senate for their bona fides and their real desire to contribute to world peace by the letter that they recently wrote to prime minister shamir but i think on the bottom line once we have made some suggestions and once as friends we have given whatever advice we choose to give the israelis on the way they have controlled the riotsand remember from their point of view it has to be considered gratuitous adviceonce we have given them our best judgment on adopting this policy or that policy or refusing to adopt this posture or that posture and explain that their decision may have a price tag and may cost them in good will military and economic aid and may cost them in credibility around the world then i think in all fairness we ought to let the israeli knesset the israeli military and security branches of their government make the hard decisions on into the actual process of reconciliation negotiation and compromise they have had the offer on the table ever since 1948 to talk what kind of preconditions we should impose upon them as to how and under what circumstances the talks get started is a very serious question i suggest that we should be very reluctant to force israel into any format into any system of negotiations that they feel may threaten their security they are a sovereign state we are a great friend of theirs we can give them advice and counsel and express the costs and the benefits to them of various alternative policies but when it comes to biting the bullet and making these critically important decisions involving the security of the region the peace for the region and the security of the state of israel i think we are going to have to let them

survived the devastation of the second war a group of giants european statesmen winston churchill robert schuman jean monnet alcide de gasperi of italy paul henri spaak of belgium decided that the centuries of bloodshed and hatred and bitterness that characterized europe must come to an end and to do so they must form first an economic and eventually a political union to pool their enormous resources and talents for the benefit of their people there were many skeptics when the european community was born on the 25th of march 1957 six states the federal republic of germany france italy belgium the netherlands and luxemburg signed a treaty which was politically a customs union encompassing these six in 1973 the united kingdom denmark and ireland joined the community greece did so in 1981 and spain and portugal last year today the european community is a body of 12 countries with a population of over 320 million people a gross domestic product of almost 3 trillion it is the largest aggregation of free and democratic societies on the face of this planet the european communitiy is the largest trading partner of the united states twoway trade amounts to about 125 billion a

not agree but i think it is critical for all of us to understand that on the fundamental commitment to freedom independence a growing economic relationship and most importantly the preservation of human rights both within our respective nations and in the world at large we are at one with the european community it was 30 years ago that this historic treaty was signed and i believe it is appropriate for members of congress to congratulate our friends in the european community to tell them that they have done the job well to tell them that we wish them further success and to indicate to them that we are looking forward to the further expansion of the european community itself a number of nations on the periphery of our own are knocking on the door asking for admission it is our policy to encourage this growth because we know that in europe in unity there is strength and while there are some favorable signs emanating from the soviet union we must always be on guard and expand and strengthen the free nations of western europe the congress of the united states has established a permanent delegation to the european economic community and my distinguished friend and colleague

we shall approach this meeting as we approach every one of our encounters with a spirit of friendship and openness and compromise because we know that the issues that bind us toi 1658 gether are

resolution of issues surrounding the recapitalization of the federal savings and loan insurance corporation the banking finance and urban affairs committee has reported h r 27 which provides much needed funds for fslic and establishes new guidelines for regulatory actions involving troubled savings and loan institutions in areas suffering from severe economic distress i am hopeful that the house will be able to act on this legislation in the near future and that we will have the cooperation of the other body in moving a recapitalization bill to the presidents desk expeditiously we are all aware that the senate has encased its version of the fslic recapitalization in a larger multititled bills 790that deals with everything from interstate banking to agricultural lending practices to be specific the senate bill addresses the socalled question of nonbank banks the senate bill addresses the question of glasssteagall as it applies to banks and bank holding companies and provides for a moratorium on the ability of the federal reserve to issue any rulings allowing bank holding companies to engage in various activities some argue should be determined by the congress the senate bill contains a provision regarding the question of powers of statechartered savings banks the senate bill addresses the socalled south dakota insurance loophole the senate bill addresses the question of restrictions on savings and loan holding companies and similarly restrictions on unitary savings and loan holding companies the senate bill addresses the question which has been considered by your banking committees in the past of a qualified thrift lender test for thrift institutions the senate bill creates a national commission to study and report back to the president on changes needed in our financial laws to promote a competitive american financial industry the senate bill addresses the question of nonbanking activities performed by foreign banks operating in the united states the senate bill addresses the apportionment of funds by omb concerning the fdic the federal home loan bank board and the ncua under the grammrudmanhollings act the senate bill addresses the socalled interstate acquisition question of failed or failing banks and provides the fdic with bridge bank authority the senate bill addresses the question of credit union conservatorship authority the senate bill addresses the question of socalled checkhold legislation the senate bill addresses the question of the cashing of government checks by depository institutions the senate bill addresses the question of loans and loan loss writeoffs by qualified agricultural banks the senate bill has a provision establishing the full faith and credit of the federal government behind deposits of federally insured savings and loan institutions and finally the senate bill calls for a study of so called high yield bonds this is a significant array of issues that touches in some manner virtually every facet of the nations financial industry frankly i am in sympathy with many aspects of the senatepassed bill but it would be improper and irresponsible to ask my colleagues to accept these provisions on which there have been no hearings no debate and no votes in the subcommittees and committee of jurisdiction in the house of representatives there are at least three key reasons why i think it would be a mistake to attempt to bring the s 790 issues to the floor of the house in the form of a conference report at the present time first the issues are too important to be acted on without hearings debate and votes within the committee and on the house floor the house should have an opportunity to work its wifl on each of these issues second the parliamentary procedure we would face with such a conference is so convoluted and involved to render the objective a virtual impossibility third the issues involved in the senate bill are so controversial that such a conference would almost certainly doom chances for early action on fslic something that has become very close to an emergency situation that has little room left for more delays let me just outline some of the parliamentary problems facing us if we tried to deal with the s 790 package assuming passage of h r 27 this approach would then require the chairman to ask unanimous consent to have the text of h r 27 substituted for the text of s 790 and request a conference there is no doubt in my mind that there would be an objection to this unanimous consent request assuming and i think it is a fair assumption the unanimous consent would be objected to one would then go back into committee and have the committee direct its chairman to go back to the floor and move to go to conference with the senate on their legislation i do not believe the committee nor the house would act favorably on such a request but lets assume the unanimous consent request is approved we then would go to conference with the senate banking committee the house containing a onetitle bill and the senate containing 10 titles 9 of which bear no relationship to the house bill as far as the house germaneness rule is concemed in conference the house conferees hands would be severely tied we could not seek to amend their 10 titlies to more adequately perhaps reflect the house views because we would run into very serious scope problems which would completely kill the conferencereported bill in the house and in fact force us back to conference on just the fslic titles in both bills the house conferees would be forced therefore to essentially adopt all of the language contained in the 10 senate titles without any substantive change whatsoever and report these titles back to the house under the house rules as members of the house know these 10 titles of the senate bill not germane to the house bill would all be subject to challenge under the germaneness rule and therefore subject individually to separate votes under this kind of scenario any reasonable person would have to conclude the house would reject any and all of these 10 titles simply because neither the house nor its banking committee would have had an opportunity to address these issues in a normal legislative fashion i have discussed these matters with a number of members of the house banking committee on both sides of the aisle and with the leadership of the house this morning i met with the democrats in a committee caucus there is a strong consensus in favor of dealing with the very important issue of fslic now and taking up the other issues in s 790 in regular orderwith hearings and the opportunity for the committee and the house to work its will it is therefore my considered opinion to proceed in regular order towit it is my intention a to seek expeditious action by the house on h r 27 the fslic recapitalization legislation and b to have s 790 referred to the house committee on banking finance and urban affairs for its consideration it is my intention to have the financial institutions subcommittee of the house banking committee proceed to full hearngs on the matters contained in s 790 as well as others i believe approaching this matter in a regular order fashion is not only best for the legislative process but will provide the best legislative outcome on all of the issues"], [0.024597108364105225,

important element in sustaining this nations increasingly fragile economic health l want to take this opportunity to congratulate both chairman rostenkowski and chairman gray for their dedication to the process that has brought us to this point today i commend them for their leadership during the many hours of difficult often fractious debate on this reconciliation package now the time has come for us tomake an extremely difficult decision and the alternatives to this bill are simply unpleasant the consequences of this legislation are many are obvious and are considerable if we do not approve this bill what will be the reaction in financial markets around the world and how serious will our efforts to being down the deficit be viewed by the american public not very i fear if we fail to pass this bill the impact of automatic budget cuts under the grammrudmanhollings law will be devastating for every segment of our societythe rich and the poor white collar and blue collar whites blacks hispanics the northeast and southwestno one and no place can expect to be spared the consequences if we fail to act and given the recent turmoil in the worlds financial markets what we are trying to do today still may not be enough to reassure those markets the messages coming from wall street and from main street are crystal clear get the economy back on an even keel and do whatever is absolutely necessary to do it that means reduce the deficit now not later even if that means raising taxes president reagan has expressed confidence in the economy and contends that all the economic indicators are robust i have a distinctly different view of just how robust the economy is today consider these indicators the trade defiitin the month ofaugust the trade deficit was 15 7 billion bringing the cumulative total for the year to 114 1 billion thats 6 billion ahead of last years record setting trade deficit unemploymentofficially more than 7 million americans remain out of work despite the nearly 5 years of steady economic expension povertymore than 36 million americans are officially living at or below the poverty level many of these people hold jobs that pay minimum wage a level of income that has lost nearly a third of its value to inflation over the past 8 years and a recent study by the physicians task force on hunger in america reports that as many as 20 million children elderly and blue collar workers are undernourished and this in a country that has witnessed record grain harvests for 3 straight years if these are the good times as so many in the reagan administration assert i shudder to think what bad times would bring what if we do not pass this reconciliation bill we all know what will happen the automatic budget cuts as required by law will cut a large swath through every government agency and coincidentally just days before our national thanksgiving holiday lets take a look at where some of these automatic cuts would occur in housing the only federal program that provides specially designed housing for the elderly would be cut by more than 1 000 units we can scarcely afford to reduce the availability of these units considering that by 1995 one in three households will be elderly in addition public housing subsidies would be trimmed by 120 million in programs providing funds for desperately needed repairs and maintenance federal education programs would be slashed a whopping 1 8 billion deep cuts would be made i n programs for disadvantaged children and in financial assistance to lowincome college students more than 340 million would be lost to community development urban development and economic development grant programs these programs have served as the cornerstone of federal assistance to local governments striving to revitalize their cities drug abuse programs a major priority of the white house would lose nearly 12 million while the drug enforcement agency stands to be cut by nearly 43 million but among all this carnage there is one cut under grammrudmanhollings that seems to make a lot of sensethe 4 3 million reduction for the office of management and budget these automatic budget cuts simply make no sense especially coming as they would at a time when the united states is struggling to recover from a historic trade imbalance just a few short months ago the house passed a landmark trade bill among the bills provisions are programs to bolster education and job training programs as a means of improving our competitive position in world trade i cannot think of a better way to shoot ourselves in the foot on trade than to allow these automatic spending eductions to take place at this critical juncture jeopardizing these types of educational and job opportunities these is however a practical and workable alternative beforeus today we can and we must reassure the country and the world that we will not tolerate massive budget and trade deficits any longer we can take an important and long overdue first step in that direction by passing this bill while this bill makes an important contribution to reducing the deficit it also includes some important provisions related to health care and to pensions of particular interest to me is a provision that will permit medicare certification of infant heart transplants in conjunction with hospitals performing adult heart transplants this program will provide a crucial model to other health insurance programs and demonstrate what are needed criteria for establishing similar pediatric coverage i this bill also includes reforms in medicare payment practices that will save 650 million over 3 years by reducing allowable payments for eight procedures that the physicians pay ment review commission has determined are overpriced by medicare other various payments to participating physicians hospitals and other providers are also reduced for savings of approximately 9 4 billion over the next 3 years this represents greater efficiency and more accountability in the medicare program over the long term these reforms should vastly improve the quality of care the elderly receive the bottom line on medicare in this bill is that beneficiaries are protected from the deep cuts we have been required to make the bill also further protects participants from billing problems by now requiring that even those physicians not accepting medicare assignment must file claims directly to medicare under this change physicians would bill participants for only that portion of the bill that medicare will not reimburse the bill also instructs the department of health and human services to develop fee schedules for radiologic and anesthesia services and for durable medical equipment such as prosthetics and establishes new coverage for therapeutic footwear required for the treatment of severe diabetic foot disease this reform would produce a savings of 110 mil h9173 lion over 3 years by reducing the need for hospitalization and surgery finally this bill encourages states to voluntarily establish health insurance risk pools so that those individuals who cannot afford to buy private health insurance or do not have access to employersponsored plans will be able to have some type of basic minimum health coverage in the area of pensions new stiffer require ments ate included in this bill to ensure that retirees can count on the benefits they have been promised furthermore to ease the burden on the pension benefits guaranty corporation the cost of insurance premiums to corporations enjoying the protection of the agency has been wisely increased the higher premiums will make a significant contribution to the financial health of this overwhelmed agency other pension reforms wil hopefully discourage some employers from terminating pension plans and encourage others to maintain full funding of their plans in the end what this bill does is begin the process of restoring the peoples faith in our ability to deal with the deficit on a bipartisan basis there are no smoke and mirrorsin this package and we have not turned our back on the tax reforms of 1986 intended to benefit low and middleincome taxpayers the revenues raised in this bill are a careful thoughtful balance of fees proposed by president reagan on users of federal services various business taxes and extensions of current tax laws or closing some loopholes we cannot afford to miss this historic opportunity to turn the corner on the budget deficit i urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to

strong support for h r 3058 the labor health and human services and education appropriations bill for fiscal year 1988 my statement is entitled a committee responds this year this title is appropriate and fitting the subcommittee on labor health and human services and education held hearings for 4 months this year we heard from a broad spectrum of witnesses including those from the administration and numerous interest groups unlike other years many interest groups joined forces and pushed for their priorities this strategy was not only effective but sensible it has become clear to the members of the subcommittee and i presume to congress and the american people that there are programs that are in desperate need of a substantial increase in federal funding a few years ago there was a lot of publicity concerning the findings included in a nation at risk the administration publicly stated that it shared the concerns of our nations educators over the state of education however in its 1988 budget the administration didnt address those concerns the congress both the house and senate did put its money in the right place the conference agreement on the budget for fiscal year 1988 recognizes the domestic needs of this country without ignoring our national defense the budget conference agreement provided the appropriations committee with the necessary flexibility to address several problems and provide additional federal funding to key programs several of which i will address in my remarks this year the debate over education funding has centered around providing assistance to atrisk children these are the children who lag behind their classmates on standardized tests and who have not realized the benefits of our educational system many of these children are minorities some are handicapped some come from broken homes and they come from both urban and rural communities these children are however part of our future for our society to be all that it can be they must become productive and successful members of it we will have nice offices with no one to staff them well have a huge military with no one to operate the weapons and well have empty college dormitories because only a small fraction of our population will be ready or able to take part in higher education the labor health and human services subcommittee understands the problem facing at risk children in this nation and what needs to be done to insure these children the opportunity to get on the right track h r 3058 provides funds for highly successful and cost effective federal programs for our nations childrenprograms such as head start chapter 1 compensatory education maternal and child health block grant job corps and many others in this bill we have provided a 650 million increase for the chapter 1 program an effective program which can do a lot to address the problems of at risk children in relative terms this is a small step in recouping the damage that has been wrought since 1980 the proposed 1988 funding level for chapter 1 as adjusted for inflation is still approximately 13 5 percent less than it was in fiscal year 1980 presently only 40 to 45 percent of the 8 9 million eligible students are served by this program the increase provided for in this bill will allow the chapter 1 to increase its participation by 15 percent or 715 000 students i am also proud to note that the committee provided a 125 4 million increase for the head start program programs such as head start which are referred to as early intervention programs have been proven time and time again that they are costeffective programs early childhood education is a critical investment head start works hand in hand with the chapter 1 program insufficient funds have limited head start participation to only 16 percent of the eligible children every eligible child should have the benefit of a head start experience we have made a big step in the right direction another subject that id like to mention is the subject of aids this is another area where the committee and the congress heard the facts and responded the committee heard testimony from all sources that the federal aids research and education effort should be expanded greatly several institute directrors discussed the need to expand clinical trials on aids increased funds will also go to expand the effort to develop a vaccine for aids and expansion of efforts to develop drugs for treatment of aids and to test those drugs it became clear from testimony we received that we had to try for a new balance between our search for cures or vaccines with efforts to prevent and control the spread of aids and until such time as we find a cure funds must be provided to expand education and prevention efforts particularly those affecting the minority and iv drug using communities this bill provides 945 million for aids research and education 315 6 million of this increase can be associated with various information and education activities throughout the public health service including 95 8 million for testing and counseling the overall increase if 466 2 million over 1987 the presidents revised budget request requested 766 million just 5 years ago we provided 5 5 million for research the committee report points out in clear and specific terms the danger we face with this disease the

last fall as assist ant to the president for national security affairs i was involved in negotiating the socalled budget summit agreement under this agreement the congress and the adninistration adopted an overall framework for budget reduction according to this plan the department of defense was required to reduce its planned program for fy 1989 by 33 billion to 299 5 billion this was well below the level that the administration felt was necessary for our security but in the interest of reducing the overall budget we agreed to accept greater risk in our national security posture since assuming my responsibilities as secretary of defense in november the task of making the very difficult decisions required to meet this agreement fell on my shoulders i cannot overstate how difficult these decisions were they involved cancelling a number of programs delaying others and making reductions in our overall force structure the budget i submitted represented the soundest overall defense program under these difficult budgetary constraints i am gratified that to date the congress has not reduced overall defense spending below the level agreed to in the budget summit agreement however i am very concerned about congressional reductions to a central element of our defense programthe presidents strategic defense initiative sdi program sdi is the cornerstone of our overall defense program it holds the promise of a more stable and effective deterrent posture based on a balance of offense and defense the hopes we had for a more stable and safe deterrent under the abm treaty regime have not been realized the soviet union has continued to modernize and expand both its strategic offensive and defensive forces in an effort to blunt the credibility and effectiveness of our deterrent it is time we recognized this and took the steps necessary to rectify an increasingly unstable situation the case for the sdi program is further strengthened by the disturbing proliferation of ballistic missile technology the administrations request for department of defense sdi activities in fy 1989 is 4 5 billion this figure represents a reduction of 1 7 billion from what we had previcusly planned to spend in fy 1989 i recommended this reduction to our request with considerable reluctar ce us congressional reductions in sdi funding to date have already resulted in substantial delays in the lwogi w n hoever i felt that i had made a conlitnient to present the minimum overall budget requ et thatwhile accepting greatcr risk wsns consistent with our security requ remvnts the request the president submied for the sdi program reflects a balr~ice between our legitimate sccuri~y requirerrnnts and existing budgetary constraints and it is a sound technical program i regret the redections recrnmended by the armned servires committee because they would cause major restructuring and delays in the program further reductions in funding or other restrictions on the program would have the gravest consequences i urge you in the strongest po sible terms to oppose any such amendments if the congress sends the president a defense bill that contains a funding level for sdi that is in my view inadequate i would have no choice but to recommend a veto of that bill while i would make such a recommendation with regret i would not be living up to my responsibilities to the president or the nation if i failed to do so the point is that we came into this budget cycle with a budget summit agreement providing total defense spending of 299 5 billion after this agreement the armed services committee took the funding allotted to us for defense spending went through a series of hearings and came out with recommended funding levels for research and development for procurement for sdi and for other defense functions the committee itself came up with 3 7 billion for sdi to reduce it further i think is reckless is counterproductive and is a breach of faith with the budget summit agreement the amendment that i will offer will be 3 7 billion which is simply a re statement of the committee position restated i would urge the members of the committee not to cut sdi further we have

farreaching education bills of the tecade and i commend the chairn n mr hawkins mr jeffords rnd our colleague from pennsylvania mr goodlin0 for their forward leadership h r 5 makes good on the federal promise to join with states and local school districts in enhancing the quality of our nations elementary and secondary schools it does so by offering a package of prograins that collectively reaffirm the federal commitment to access to quality education for disadvantaged students and other students with special needs i come to you today as a former educator and local school board member i am acutely aware that we must encourage and reward excellence in education and provide assistance to children who might otherwise never catch up with their more fortunate classmates h r 5 accomplishes that goal however i must reiterate my belief that the role of the federal government in education should be a limited one beyond my philosophical opposition to sending tax dollars to washington only to see 60 cents returned it is undeniable that state and local governments are best equipped to know what their particular community needs most local governments can provide the kind of flexibility creativity and attention to detail that is impossible on the federal level the final version of h r 5 includes my amendments on youth suicide prevention the roukema amendments establishes authorized youth suicide prevention programs as allowable prograins under the antidrug abuse act and chapter ii block grant fund the chapter ii block grant which provides money for such programs as early childhood development at risk students schoolwide improvements now includes one more important program suicide prevention let me be clear this does not mandate suicide prevention education this allows suicide prevention programs as an option my amendment allows local schools if they desire to apply chapter ii block grant money to establish needed prograins in youth suicide prevention my own district in northern new jersey was the scene of a terrible tragedy last year we all remember so vividly that four young people took their own lives dramatic evidence of the rising incidence of suicide across the country in the aftermath the community sought funds to develop a program to counsel children teachers and parents however their only recourse was the lengthy difficult process of applying for a federal grant which in the end was denied now i do not want a national competitive grant program to be the only recourse for communities to receive money if they desire my amendment is constructed to give the authority solely to the local entity without imposing the federal qovermients will oi discretion on local agercies it is an eflort to supplement and help schools deal with a tragic problem within their communities if they choose that option the school is the one institution that is the common denominator for all these students the purpose of my amendment is to use the schools to identify highrisk students and to identify them before they drop out in addition our local option provides the opportunity for the community to decide if there is a genuine need principals school teachers and officials who are most sensitive to the specific local circumstances will have the opportunity to establish programs and train personnel there is no doubt that suicide among teenagers is among the most serious social problems in that age group suicide is the leading cause of death among persons between the ages of 15 and 24 second only to traffic fatalities the number of young people taking their lives has increased greatly in the la t few decades last year the subcommittee on elementary secondary and vocational education conducted hearings on teenage suicide prevention a panel of expert witnesses offered their advice on how to prevent these tragedies the experts confirmed that there is a well established relationship between drug abuse and youth suicide my amendment recognizes this connection between drugs problems and other problems facing our young people no piece of legislation can be perfect and this bill is no expection i have serious reservations about one program included in h r 5that is the bilingual education act i have long been a critic of the bilingual education program for its failure to recognize the need to teach english to nonenglish speaking children as early as possible experience during the life of this program has demonstrated that teaching students in their native language has not proven effective although this compromise allows additional funding for alternative teaching methods such as immersion and english as a second language i would have liked to have seen it go further while alternative methods provide some flexibility bilingual education programs should be geared toward getting school children assimilated into englishspeaking classes rapidly and effectively the inability to speak english can severely hamper a citizens ability to participate fully in the mainstream of america we should not hesitate to support educational methods that ensure such participation another issue of great concern to me was the program improvement provision program improvement requires states to perform evaluations of local education agencies to determine improvement or decline in school progress state and local jurisdiction must be clearly defined while locals deserve the freedom to determine their curricula and programs states have certain oversight authority to ensure that schools remain in compliance with basic program requirements the conference agreement carefully balances this relationship states will receive a percentage of program funds to be used at the local level for program improvement furthermore the compromise allows local agencies workable time frames for improvements and provides states with the needed funds to help implement such changes the dual federal and state commitment is clearly formalized in this compromise i commend my colleague mr goodling for his tireless effort in forging this solution in the spirit of compromise the house accepted the senate proposal on magnet schools but not without a fightl the senate proposal establishes a separate program identical to magnet schools yet without desegregation as the main objective i simply do not see the need for establishing a new costly program for alternative schools the current program is effective and commendable in its purpose yet underfunded magnet schools have established quality schools in areas with a high concentration of minority students these schools have excelled in their academic standards and vocational skills they offer a curriculum capable of attracting substantial numbers of students of different racial backgrounds but most noteworthy students are accepted on the basis of talent not wealth although magnet schools are one of the most effective programs in h r 5 in the last year only 48 of the 126 districts which applied for funds received them there simply was not enough money to be distributed there can be no questioning the impact and far reaching effects of this

knowledge that the liquidation of the jewish people in europe had begun was acknowledged by the new york times on november 13 1938 when it stated germany issued a new series of decrees yesterday to complete the liquidation of the jews history has shown us that no one in the international community responded to this statement which indeed was a horrifying prophecy as a result of global silence hitler escalated his persecution of jews wherever he could and authorized the creation of the infamous final solution by 1945 when the war was over the truth was there for all the world to see over 6 million jewish men women and children gone from this earth exterminated by the cruelest means ever devised and the one date that burns in the collective jewish memory is kristallnacht november 9 1938

today is a bill that could lead to a senior citizen and retired citizen disaster instead of a substitute solution of the catastrophic care difficulties we face the michel substitute before us at this moment is designed to avoid that disaster by attempting to be responsive to the need for major medical catastrophic assistance to retired citizens the package that weare considering at this moment

speaker tip oneill i believe decided to flex his authority in a direction that went beyond that which is good for the house essentially we began a process known as panning and panning is to use our television cameras to pan the house during special orders when oft times we are discussing very important items of the house and yet there are relatively few members of the house present on the floor they are either in committee or they are indeed in their offices using their televisions to observe the work on the floor and clearing their other legislative business if we are going to have that sort of panning in the house indeed it would logically be argued that one should pan during the entire session of the house for under normal work conditions we may be carrying on very important legislative business and still members will be in their committees or they will be in their offices et cetera and at a time of critical debate nonetheless there may be few members relatively on the floor we know that is the way the work of the house goes forward the point that i want to make is first that such panning draws a negative kind of attention and misunderstanding to the work of the house it may very well serve to undermine the exercise of free speech of a person in special orders with whom you may disagree but indeed to pan the house without a further explanation does attack the credibility of the workings on the floor that reality was never brought to mind in more crystal clear fashion than recently when we found ourselves working in the house on a memorial in which during special orders we were paying tribute to two of our past colleagues who had served us long and wellsala burton and stewart mckinney having passed away they were being addressed by way of memorial tribute during special orders to go back and look at that tape and see the panning of the house which would imply that few or almost no members cared when indeed endless numbers of members participated in those memorial services with panning it would indicate otherwise it not only affects the credibility of our house indeed it greatly affects the credibility of the words that were given that day on their behalf i might mention the words of one of my colleagues speaking on the floor in behalf of sala burton the gentleman is standing on the floor at this moment the gentleman from new york speaking to the house indicated i think that the entire event from the beginning of moving from the capitol steps out to andrews and then three planes full of people members of the house and others former members included and staff people and the memorial service itself were a tremendous tribute in recognition of what sala meant to all of us and panning at that moment there were but few

believe that the fate of this omnibus trade bill should not turn on this provision alone i will remind my colleagues that this house defeated a much more onerous plant closing bill 2 years ago as the ranking republican of the labormanagement subcommittee i led the opposition to that bill actually the provisions before us are quite modest when compared to previous plant closings bills the bill would require employers of 100 or more to provide 60days notice prior to a plant closing or mass layoff involving at least 50 workers previous legislation called for 90days notice tl 3542 and applied to employers of 50 or more and included other sweeping mandates including prior consultation despite these improvements the business community has raised some reasonable concerns about this bill perhaps the most strenuous objections have been based upon the application of the bill to layoffs and not just total shutdowns the senate attempted to address this by requiring that at least 33 percent of the workers be affected i believe this could have been addressed by increasing that percentage in the subconference i proposed that it go to 50 percent and i think through negotiations it could even go higher i repeat while i am not in agreement with the plant closing section of this bill i have no fundamental opposition to mandatory notice per so however this language is clearly not

and engineers create this base for technological advances history has shown that a sustained investment in basic research contributes to economic growth to an impoved quality of life and to enhanced national defense capabilities although nsf is a relatively small federal agency it has a big impact both on support of basic research and on development of enhanced basic research capabilities in american universities for example an nsf program with the longterm goal of developing firstrate research universities in all geographic regions of the united states is called the experimental program to stimulate competitive research or epscor the value of epscor is vividly illustrated by the results of a grant to the university of alabamahuntsville the grant was used by a young professor to build a strong research group studying superconductivity recently this group produced one of the first sets of research results on a class of materials that are superconducting at relatively high temperatures as tv and press accounts have highlighted this breakthrough has enormously important implications for a wide range of technologies including high speed computers medical diagnostic systems electric power generation and transportation systems the nsf budget proposed by the administration for fiscal year 1988 provides for an increase of almost 17 percent above the previous year and is the first of five proposed increases to produce a doubling of the nsf budget by fiscal year 1992 the science space and technology committee supports and endorses this proposal which is consistent with the committees firm belief in the importance of nsfs contribution to the nations wellbeing despite the serious federal budget deficit the committee believes that the increase in funding for nsf is essential to address important concerns about the health of the unitedstates basic research enterprise and in particular concerns about the state of science and engineering education the proposed budget increase would also allow nsf to pursue new research opportunities including interdisciplinary multipleinvestigator efforts involving linkages with industry the total authorization in h r 2330 of 1 893 billion includes 1 625 billion for research and related activities 150 million for science and engineering education and 118 million for the unitedstates antarctic program although h r 2330 as reported by the science space and technology committee provides a total authorization at the level of the administrations request it makes redirections and establishes certain priorities reflecting the concerns of the committee members the major change from the administrations request is an increase of 35 million for the science and engineering education directorate unitedstates economic competitiveness is ultimately tied to the availability and excellence of scientific and technical manpower unfortunately a decreasing fraction of american college students are choosing science and engineering studies at a time when the total pool of collegeaged students is declining significantly over the past 15 years the proportion of the unitedstates population engaged in science and engineering has declined appreciably relative to other technologically advanced nations during the same period the federal investment in undergraduate and precollege science education has dropped dramatically and is now at a level well below that of the 1960s in constant dollars at a time when the united states must compete against strong economic rivals in a global marketplace these trends are disquieting nsf must have the resources to play a strong role in strengthening science and mathematics instruction at the precollege and undergraduate levels to ensure that the pipeline of scientists and engineers remains filled and to maintain a large technically literate inventive and adaptable work force in order to provide the significant increase in funding primarily for precollege science education programs a small decrease was imposed on the administrations requested funding levels for four scientific directorates and a cut of 25 million was imposed on the unitedstates antarctic program which effectively maintains this program at the fiscal year 1987 funding level the reduction to the antarctic program does not reflect concern for the quality of the research program however only about a third of the total budget for this program is for research and direct research support the remainder is required to support the unitedstates presence in the antarctic in light of current priorities within the overall range of nsf programs level funding the large operations support budget of the antarctic program seems jsutified in particular since the funds will augment science and engineering education programs which have been neglected in recent years besides the strengthening of programs in science education h r 2330 provides funding level increases that will sustain nsf initiatives in scientific areas such as biotechnology global geosciences and advanced scientific computing also h r 2330 will allow nsf to expand its efforts in developing interdisciplinary research groups to explore new scientific frontiers at the interfaces between traditional disciplines these enterprises such as the engineering research centers program often involve industrial participation which both opens new communication channels to facilitate transfer of new discoveries to industry and also exposes university researchers to industrial technology problems the creation of links between university researchers and industrial laboratories and equally important the training of scientists and engineers who are familiar with the industrial culture will contribute to improving unitedstates performance in the commercialization of new discoveries which is a critical factor in maintaining economic competitiveness h r 2330 is balanced proposal which is essential to the health of the unitedstates basic research enterprise and to the training of a new generation of scientists and engineers i urge my colleagues to support the bill as

would like but it does go a long way toward allowing a full ranging debate on a number of important amendments about which there may be controversy but upon which i think in most cases we can reach a consensus we tried over the last 8 to 10 years to do various things to take a real bit out of the organized crime effort in this country promoting drugs we have made progress in terms of legislation but no none would suggest that we came anywhere close to winning the war the legislation before us however will help us in that regard in significant ways one of the amendments to be offered on our side which i think is a particularly important one deals with the notion of user accountability that is one thing that perhaps has been absent in our approaches in the past we have had if you will some dual standards where we have suggested that we would take care of the problem by going after the trafficker and in some ways implicitly or explicitly suggesting that the user is to be ti 6863 excused and is not part of the problem the user accountability amendments to be offered will i think change that they will say that as important as it is to go after the trafficker we will never solve the problem of the drug situation in this country until we say that the user is responsible for his or her actions and yes we should make sure that we have treatment yes we should make sure that we have rehabilitation but we also must present sanctions so that people will recognize the importance of the decisions they make when they take drugs as long as people in beverly hills and in florida and in other places think that they can use drugs recreatlonally and be excused in our society we are going to continue to have a problem in this country as long as we condemn the lowly city kid for using drugs but excuse the professional who uses drugs recreationally we are going to have a problem in this country and the message to our young people is going to ring hollow the user accountability amendments to be considered while we consider this bill are absolutely important i think we ought to look at them not only in terms of what they do by their very terms but also what they do in terms of sending a message to our society that we are not going to defeat the drug problem until we change the culture of our country and that means zero tolerance on the use of drugs"],
