is millender juanita millendermcdonald it is because of my father reverend shelly millender who taught us that education is important that we must have a quality education in order to challenge the world that would be before us and so tonight i rise with several of my colleagues to discuss the reauthorization of the elementary and secondary educationact known to us as esea this act is an act that is of immense importance to our children and the future of our nation the education of our nations children is an issue of paramount concern as members of the house of representatives it is imperative that we remain focused on our na tional priorities of raising standards and providing special assistance to children in need to ensure that all students are prepared to face the challenges of the 21st century globalization has brought us into a more competitive world where the challenges of technology will dominate the economic relations among world nations if all of our children are not jrepared to face these challenges our great country will not continue to lead the world in the vital areas of economy and technology and also in the critical areas of democracy and political participation we must guarantee quality school facilities quality teachers smaller classroom sizes and gender equity in technology so that all of our children both boys and girls are able to face these new challenges i stand with some of my members who are on the floor today as we recognize americas teachers as a former teacher i know the importance of teachers and their leadership to the classroom but more importantly their leadership for the future for our future americas future because they are guiding our children who will be the leaders of tomorrow some of them will be the members of congress therefore we must instill in them not only the moral standards character building but also quality education quality education that comes from good teachers i stand today in that salute and recognize the importance of teachers in this whole process in the 106th congress the authorization of federal aid to many education programs covered under the elementary and secondary education act known as esea is expiring these bills have passed through the house in a piecemeal approach to reauthorizing major esea programs it is expected that the final piece of the esea puzzle h r 4141 will be coming to the floor soon h r 4141 the education opportunity to protect and invest in our nations students act also known as the options act amends esea programs regarding education technology which is part of title iii the safe and drugfree schools and communities that is couched within this title iii it also amends title iv and the education block grant which is title v i am deeply concerned however with title i of h r 4141 entitled the transferability transferability is essentially a backdoor block grant program which would allow federal funds intended to target technology teacher training school safety and afterschool care needs to be used for any purpose deemed educational regardless of its relevance to the core mission when we look at tech nology we think about the digital di vide the urban and rural areas botl are in dire straits because of the lack of high technology to our students in both the urban and the rural areas when we look at teacher training we look at those persons who will be guiding and directing our students through this 21st century and indeed it is critical that we focus on professional development as an ongoing core of teacher training school safety we do recognize that children must be in an environment that is conducive to learning and therefore school safety is vital for this training afterschool care cannot just be left up to the schools now it should be the community it should be churches and all others who are getting involved in afterschool care programs these are very vital very critical areas in the holistic education of our students title i of h r 4141 allows states and local educational agencies to transfer funds between esea programs after receiving funds for specific purposes i would like to draw attention to that because we can ill afford to have moneys that should go for one program specifically for that purpose to be transferred to another program that is the whole notion of this transferability clause under title i local education agencies can transfer up to 30 percent of one programs funds to another without any publicly documented rationale that is wrong if we are going to really train our teachers educate our students have a school that is conducive to learning and have targeted technology that is applied for all students then we must not have this transferability clause that will snatch funding from any program one deems important to transfer these funds to another program in other words if the funding has gone to the state specifically for a purpose and a program then we should not be allowed to transfer up to 30 percent or any percent on a program that was not initially funded by this body if a local education agency receives state approval then 100 percent of those funds can be transferred between programs in such cases the state is not required to establish criteria for these decisions or document their approval again it would not be up to the state it would be up to the legislation that we apply here on the floor and this is why i believe that h r 4141 does a great injustice to this countrys young people our students 0i 1930 block grants whether by law or de facto and despite their popularity do more harm to education than good in fact by pouring federal funds into general state operating funds we are not able to guarantee that the needs of all children are served particularly the schools and the students with the most need again i reiterate those students are the students who are in the urban i schools like my schools in the watts area in the compton area and the i linwood area and the wilmington area those are the schools where there are the students with most needs and also in the rural communities where those students are falling behind in tech nology transferability as mandated in title i of h r 4141 increases the odds that esea money will not reach urban minority students for muchneeded educational programs a study done by the general accounting office in january of 1999 reported that federal funds are 8 times more likely than state funds to target disadvantaged students why are we putting this in the hands of the state when this has been documented by gao that the funds will be targeted more for disadvantaged students in coming from the federal as opposed to the state the report further concluded that federal monies helped to close the gap in spending between the richest and poorest districts currently local education agencies that receive federal money are required to use the funds on specific populations and for specific purposes no more no less the transferability clause of h r 4141 will allow local education agencies to use federal funds in any way they like resulting in the possible exclusion of funds for programs tat serve disadvantaged students in lowincome districts we know that is not right we know that we cannot look to any local education agency to apply the funds that should be documented in legislation from us we just give them that autonomy to transfer 30 percent of those funds to any program they deem important it is shocking to think that funds earmarked for the improvement of our education systems core mission can be used for virtually any purpose transferability makes this prospect a reality and it is likely to have a negative effect on teacher training school safety and education technology under h r 4141 we run the risk of diminishing our present emphasis on teacher training that is critical to maintaining a high standard among our schools under h r 4141 schools can decide to use funds targeted for upgrading and improving teacher quality for other purposes funds that could be used for teacher recruitment and certification may also be transferred to other programs

having recruiting and retention problems in the military and they give this long laundry list of what is wrong with the military see they are the same ones who endorsed socialization policies of our military socialization policies that in fact then begin to hurt the military a sergeant at fort campbell kentucky came up to me and says congressman if the army gets any more sensitive it is going to cry we have to stop and think what are we doing to the military i have traveled around and i have conducted a lot of hearings being chairman of personnel well many are quick to blame recruiting and retention problems on a good economy easy access to other sources of college funding reduced propensity to enlist a shortage of quality recruits my findings point to other issues that stress the military force it is called lack of spare parts lack of adequate training time aging equipment and high depreciation rates on our equipment socialization policies longer working hours and prolonged

armenian genocide these brave people with the history of well over 3 000 years old were subject to numerous indignities and periodic massacres by the sultans of the ottoman empire the worst of these massacres occurred in 1895 when as many as 300 000 armenian civilians were brutally massacred and thousands more were left destitute additional massacres were committed in 1909 and 1920 by 1922
