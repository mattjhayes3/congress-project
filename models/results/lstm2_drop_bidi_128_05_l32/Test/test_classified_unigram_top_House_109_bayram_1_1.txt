make our country safer our military stronger and to bring stability to the region while we may not always agree on the approach to take mr lantos strove very hard for a bipartisan resolution and i

the three national elections conducted in iraq in 2005 imagine in january in october and now in december three times courageously they went to the polls and his resolution spells that out his resolution would encourage all americans to express support for the people of iraq in their efforts to achieve a free open and democratic society and again throughout his resolution he makes that point and he expresses thanks and admiration to the members of the united states armed forces and the armed forces of other nations in iraq including the members of the security forces of iraq whose heroism permitted the iraqi people to vote safely that is the spirit of the resolution that we should be voting on today one that brings us together that is clear to the iraqi people that their courage is an example to the world but sadly this congress is not an example of democracy to the world when instead 6f using an occasion to unify once again the republican majority brings to the floor a resolution rejecting the good offers of the gentleman from california to come together in a bipartisan way and uses what should be a cause for celebration as instead a means to denounce those who disagree not kery democratic and also to insist that if you want to congratulate the people of iraq you must support the status quo more of the same in iraq is not making the american people safer more of the same in iraq is not making our military stronger more of the same in iraq is not bringing stability to the region so i think you will see democrats united in congratulating the people of iraq commending our men and women in the armed services and supporting that in a democracy we will have different views and that we will respect them i have said it before and i will say it again

the republicans think that we cannot have disagreement in time of war so as we go into this holiday season i know that we can come together and say to our men and women in harms way that we honor them for their service we are grateful to them for their patriotism their courage and the sacrifice they are willing to make for our country and in this holiday season we strive for peace on earth and goodwill toward man which would not be possible without our men and women in the armed services that should be the spirit in which we go forward not in the divisive manner the republicans have put forward that is really quite sad but i hope that in the vote that we have today that the iraqi people will know that on both sides of the aisle we all see them as an example of democracy and hope that

research on new nuclear weapons there are plenty of options to choose from last october during the final presidential debate before the november election president bush claimed that the gravest threat americafaces is the threat of nuclear attack unfortunately the president has done very little to address this threat one of the primary nuclear threats america faces is the development of such hostile weapons by countries like iran and north korea that is why we need to engage these nations in aggressive diplomacy not aggressive saber rattling earlier this week north korea indicated that it wishes to hold bilateral talks with the united states presumably to receive financial assistance in exchange for dismantling its nuclear weapons program iran on the other hand feels threatened by recent

take down saddam hussein this president probably thinks that negotiations are beneath him but i have got news for the bush administration negotiations work and foreign assistance works we need to start relying more on nonmilitary security tools to work out our international differences the other major nuclear threat comes not from foreign countries but from terrorist organizations like al qaed a to address this threat we must secure the nuclear stockpiles that are out there before they get into the hands of terrorists most people agree that the best program to secure nuclear materials is the cooperative threat reduction program or ctr which enlists the department of defense to dismantle nuclear warheads reduce nuclear stockpiles and secure nuclear weapons and materials in the states of the former soviet union ctr is crucial in keeping nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists terrorists know that it would not be difficult to steal material from poorly guarded nuclear plants in russia that is why it is important to increase our funding for ctr and provide funding to extend the program so that other regions of the world can be included last year the cooperative threat reduction program received only 409 million from the defense budget and the department of defense did not even use all of this money we should triple or quadruple our funds and our efforts for ctr in

medicare covers breast reconstructive surgery after a mastectomy or accidental injury medicare understands the importance of postsurgical psychological adjustment as women rehabilitate after a damaging cancer treatment or devastating injury are men not entitled to such wholeness after prostate cancer treatment ed drugs help men who have lost sexual function as a result of medical conditions like prostate cancer diabetes multiple sclerosis parkinsons or spinal cord injuries men need these medications not to enhance their lifestyle but to return them to normal just like women need reconstructive surgery to return as close as possible to normal in fact wholeness is so important that according to a university of chicago study 68 percent of men were willing to forego treatments that were more effective in eradicating prostate cancer in order to maintain sexual function why would we force men to choose between the most effective medical treatment and wholeness i could not agree more that we should ban ed drugs for sex offenders but a flat ban on ed drugs for all seniors lowincome americans people with disabilities who have edrelated diseases or conditions is just plain discriminatory and wrong so while i respect the concerns of those who support a total ban on ed drugs i hate to see congress go down this path of political correctness we must offer our seniors our poor and our people with disabilities medically correct health care plans the real answer to controlling the cost of medicare and medicaid is not micromanaging the programs but driving forward the adoption of technology that will enable us to manage chronic illnesses proactively reducing both the cost and suffering of hospitalizati6ns and emergency department visits for our seniors and those disabled amongst us that much said and with the hope that we will allow doctors to determine treatment protocols i acknowledge our public responsibility to extend access to medicaid benefits for

governmentr controlled company run major ports s throughout our country including part s of the port of beaumont in my district t in southeast texas v we hear that the uae ports deal will not jeopardize national security because this government company will actually help us with homeland security my question is are we now going to outsource national security as well the recent disturbing decision to allow the united arab emirates to have a stake in operations in unitedstates ports is a dangerous decision that defies common sense history has shown that friends of the united states come and go those who are our friends today may not be our friends tomorrow the uae although alleged friends today have not been our friends in the past and there is nothig that proves that they will continue that friendship in the future the uae recognized the taliban it laundered money that financed the 9 11 terrorists and it continues to participate in the arab boycott against our ally israel this country harbored terrorists that played a role in killing 3 000 people on september 11 we cannot ignore their perilous past last time i checked we were at war against the taliban i find it extremely hard to believe that we would want to give a country that supported our enemies access to our ports if this deal were to go through these same foreign entities would have access to unitedstates manifests showing what cargo is being shipped and where and when it is going according to a recent zogby poll taken in october 2005 it found that over 70 percent of those who live in the uae do not even like the united states if this arrangement goes through who is going to stop a potential terrorist from posing as someone else going to work for one of these ports and gaining access to information with the intent to harm americans we do not need to take this risk with national security currently only 5 percent of the more than 14 million containers entering through our nations ports are screened clearly our ports are already vulnerable in a day and age where we are allowing 95 percent of the cargo to come and go through our ports without inspection it is hard to believe that we are willing to give security to a foreign entity much less one that has anything but a strong record in preventing terrorism even the unitedstates coast guard which is in charge of port security seems uneasy about letting this take place many americans across our land are opposed to this foreign operation in our homeland the port of beaumont in texas one of the operations proposed to be run by this uae deal ships onethird of the military cargo going to iraq and afghanistan this is more than any other unitedstates port now we want to give a foreign government access to unitedstates military shipping information i think not we cannot allowed our ports to be infiltrated by foreign governments and this is not a partisan issue it is an issue of national security for this reason i have joined colleagues from across the aisle in introducing a bill that will stop this uae operation from going through i have joined the gentlewoman from florida in introducing legislation to prevent this dangerous and deceptive deal this deal should become a no deal before it becomes an ordeal just last week we introduced the port security act of 2006 this is the house version of legislation already introduced in the senate this bipartisan legislation will prohibit foreign stateowned companies from controlling operations at unitedstates ports and stop the uae deal by mandating a congressional review of existing foreign stateowned companies that are operating in american ports there is an innate and inherit problem not to mention a serious national security risk with letting stateowned foreign companies buy interests in american ports i am not opposed to foreign privately owned companies operating in our country i understand we live in a global economy foreign ownership of a hotel or car company is one thing but foreign government ownership in port operations especially those that handle military cargo is absurd there are entirely too many issues that need to be ironed out before we start offering our ports and our national security up to foreign governments for sale or for lease this decision is unwise it is a risky business this ought not to be and that is

to share with the american people is a moment for us to be able to move forward and not to recount or to go back over a pathway that is not productive a few weeks ago we were discussing legislation that of its very name is extremely controversial in the course of that legislation h r 748 the child interstate abortion notification act ciana the debate was vigorous and i know that in this congress we have had our differences of opinion as it relates to the question of choice the ninth amendment the right to privacy and in this instance the question of parental consent it is interesting to note that those of us who may side on the position of choice and the right to privacy recognize the intensity and the questions being raised about children who are put in harms way whether or not that means that a child without counsel because of some tragedy in her life has to seek an abortion the vigorousness of the debate centered around the idea of the enormous range of differences of opinion expressed by different states i think they are equally divided 23 22 27 some states having no provisions for parental consent as it relates to a child securing an abortion some states having a very complicated process with judicial review and some states having a medium process the debate in the committee on the judiciary by members on my side of the aisle really centered and focused on the structure of the legislation that seemingly would close the door shut on a child that would seek counsel beyond the parent in this very troubling time in their life it also sought to clarify whether an innocent bystander who could provide a mode of transportation might in fact be held criminally liable under this particular law so there were a number of amendments being offered that would hopefully clarify this very difficult question this is a time when passions rise high temperatures rise high as well as i said there is a vigorous disagreement about this question of abortion and even more vigorous when it involves a child who is under the age of majority e 1745 so there were a number of amendments offered by my colleagues one offered that in particular the description of the amendment simply offered by the gentleman from new york allowed an adult who could be prosecuted under the bill go to a federal court and seek a waiver to the states parental notice laws if this remedy was not available subsequently there was a house report 10951 and in that report a series of amendments were described in particular to give license to sexual predators may i repeat that again to give license to sexual predators i started out by saying and i do intend to follow that charge that i have made that this is an effort to go forward to be able to highlight a mistake an indiscretion a pathway that hopefully we will not return to and allow us to heal on our own if you will but also to cite that this is not the way to run the peoples house that amendment simply stated that it allowed an adult who could be prosecuted under the bill to go to the federal district court and seek a waiver to the states parental notice laws remember i started out by saying state parental notice laws are varying around the nation it was ultimately written to suggest that that particular gentleman from new york had an amendment that would have created an additional layer of federal court review that could be used by sexual predators to escape conviction under the bill it suggested that that roll call that particular amendment was defeated 11 to 16 subsequently there was another amendment by the gentleman from new york to exempt a grandparent or adult sibling from the criminal and civil provisions in the bill again simply stated as plain as can be and by the way though i am not intending to challenge legislation that has already been passed on the floor of the house albeit i disagree with it vigorously in terms of the restraints it puts on the interaction between a child and confidante a trusted adult who can help steer them in the right direction let me just suggest this was a constructive amendment because it was to give the child an ability to consult with someone that may be out of the pipeline and be out of the childs distress area meaning we have never looked at the point that possibly the parent could be the predator or could be engaged in incest all of these are terrible things to discuss but in a responsible debate these were the considerations why these amendments were authored ultimately that amendment to allow a grandparent or sibling to confide or that child to confide in that particular adult or that particular sibling adult sibling it was described by the gentlemans amendment was described as having exempted sexual predators from prosecution under the bill and suggested that it was defeated in a roll call vote subsequently the gentleman from virginia offered an amendment to protect innocent bystanders who might have someone take their mode of transportation a taxicab a bus or other mode of transportation not knowing who they are carrying and ultimately caught up in the legislation and be prosecuted so this was to exempt innocent bus drivers taxicab drivers and others who would be transporting individuals and again the amendment was described as exempting sexual predators a subsequent amendment that limited liability to the person committing the offense in the first degree was ultimately described and suggested that it would aid and abet criminals then an amendment that i offered the amendment was to exempt clergy godparents aunts uncles or first cousins from the penalties in the bill again to give a young woman a greater latitude of who to seek comfort and counsel from and ultimately that anendment was described ms jacksonlee offered an amendment that would have exempted sexual predators from prosecution under the bill if they were clergy godparents aunts uncles or first cousins of a minor then though i had two separate amendments one a gao study that would have determined whether this particular legislation was necessary and whether or not the confusion of the states with different bases of determining parental consent whether or not that created an added problem the description in house report 10951 just lumped them all together which reads that would require a study by the government accounting office so in essence my amendment was described as exempting clergy godparents aunts uncles or first cousins of a minor and suggesting that i was exempting sexual predators and then adding insult to injury if i might use a phrase that i then wanted a gao study completely wrong complete misconstruing of the amendment and of the intent so we had a vote last week that ultimately wound up correcting the language in some form it did not however distinguish that i had two amendments and did not ask for a study of sexual predators who happened to be godparents clergy aunts uncles or first cousins first of all might i say in the prosecution of this particular entity i do not believe that any prosecutor worth his or her salt would allow this legislation to exempt an individual who happened to be a relative who happened to be a sexual predator there is no basis in the bill and if that was the case then it means that the parents the very underlying crux of the bill parental consent it means that the bill also protects parents that are sexual predators if you follow that line of reasoning so this is an attempt to have us go forward and not backwards the amendments were very clear on their face the amendments stood alone the general accountijig office shall conduct a study detailing the impact of the number of unsafe and illegal abortions performed on minors who would be affected by this law you see i have lived through a time when women went to back alleys and a coat hanger was a medical device so i thought it was appropriate that if we were going to pass a legislative initiative that we thought would help secure young lives then we needed to have a study that would determine whether or not it was in fact securing them or endangering them and the idea of course was to suggest that we needed to find out more about the impactof this legislation this ultimately got construed i do not know how as a gao study of sexual predators this is not a nice word to say oil the floor of the house because as we have seen the rash of attacks on our children two young babies killed just in the last 24 hours little precious danielle having been determined and identified decapitated a couple of years ago as cochair of the congressional childrens caucus we were briefed by alonzo washington on that tragic case the cases in florida the cases in texas no one wants to promote the extending of any criminal exemptions for the likes of those who prey on our children nowhere in this gao study would that say that and might i say that the war against sexual predators and child predators and child sexual predators is a bipartisan war it is not a frivolous desire of any of us to stand up against those heinous actors that will go against our children i would not in the least be hesitant to stand alongside of any member in this body and know full well of their undying commitment to weed out ferret out prosecute and incarcerate those individuals with the most evil intent to do harm to our children that is why a number of members took to the floor of the house to express such outrage not because we do not accept the fact that there could be mistakes there are politics in this house games that are played at all times there is vigorous debate on the question of choice parental consent but it was the very fact that something so sacred our children could fall victim to such a divide as we went to the committee on rules we would hope it would have been cleared up through that matter let me also just cite tle other jacksonlee amendment that was plain and simple the prohibitions of this section do not apply with respect to conduct by clergy godparents aunts unclesor first cousins simply to say that they could stand in place for example if there was some achilles heel some failure in the parental structure that this child needed to go outside of the family home a simple process no more no lessso we had hoped that there would have been some solution to this in the committee on rules as i indicated this report was filed thursday april 21 and the accompanying report was 10951 the point that should be part of the rules of this house that i hope that we will as we go forward make really part of our institutional fabric is that house reports from now on or from last thursday on should describe recorded votes with objective nonargumentative captions the committee on the judiciary majority cannot do that in house report 10951 by captioning the five amendments that i mentioned with remarks that would suggest that we are harboring that we are kowtowing playing to sexual predators the opportunity that was given to address this question in the committee on rules was troubling because questions were posed as to why such language was utilized might i say as an aside you realize that the house reports and my colleagues realize the house reports are used in history they are used by historians and political scientists students researchers of all kinds policymakers they are used to tell the story of america that is why we rise to the floor of the house and raise our voices and consent and dissent that is why we pay tribute to americans on this floor that is why each morning we say the pledge of allegiance and the chaplain or one who has been so designated offers a word of prayer it is for all of america to reflect and read it is a document that leaves a legacy that 2 days from now or 5 weeks or 1 year or 10 years from now cannot be changed so to ask the question why or to suggest to my colleagues that i only stand here today to remind you that if we can find any sense of unity in this very fractured nation and divided house and senate i would simply ask that it be adhering to the rules of this body and the simple reporting of the work we do here every day the reason why again i would cite this as an important request and one that i hope the correction of last week will not be simply the correction of that time but it will be embedded that we try and work not to do it again is because when we get on this floor and there are words that are not befitting or becoming of the debate albeit the member did not intend any wrongdoing or missteps but because someone else found those words to be inappropriate we have a procedure called to take the words down why do we do that we do that to pro tect the integrity of this record and i think that is the right thing to do in the furor of debate sometimes we step beyond the pale we are committed we are passionate we believe in what we are standing for and we are americans we stand in debate with our eyes on the flag of the united states and the words in god we trust this nations underpinnings allow us to do so but when sometimes in the heat of debate words flare we are allowed and some will ask that the words be taken down and in the course of the debate and the vote occurs there is a procedure to address that issue that means that we care about the integrity of this process and the written word that will then be there for thousands and thousands and millions and millions and years and years to be reviewed we are owed that kind of respect so this statement today should not be considered an effort to recount or repeat it is hopefully an effort in a moment of evenhandedness to suggest that this kind of mischaracterization not take place anymore in the committees of the house the final reporting and or the committee on rules and that we strictly stick to the conciseness and integrity of the process which is a nonargumentative objective reporting of the work of an individual member and certainly words such as predator and sexual predator and child predator to be thrown in the direction of members who leave their homes and their jurisdictions every day in the backdrop of some heinous criminal act maybe affecting their own constituents maybe some child law because as i was driving on the freeway yesterday in texas because of the amber alert that all of the members of this house were willing to support there unfortunately was a highlight of another kidnapped child from new mexico possibly on the run into texas not knowing whether there was an issue of sexual predator or child predator it was a kidnapped child a child that was vulnerable so it is not something that i personally take lightly and i would just suggest that the gentleman from new york and the gentleman from virginia who raised their voices i would think that their integrity also is wellknown and that to associate their work with that definition is one that is enormously frightening this clarification is used as well when you can find that the entity or the act or the actions have subjected you to public ridicule well a story is a story and this was written about so that will not be able to be taken down there will be articles that would suggest that amendments by the named persons exempted sexual predators we cannot go back to that we cannot pull that down that is in the annals of news that will be able to be researched so frankly i thought it was enormously important that this misdeed be called again to the attention of my colleagues why because i hope going forward we will not do it again allow me to quote from the ranking member of the committee on rules who said that it was not indicated how this was brought to our attention the committee on rules discovered yesterday that the committee on the judiciary report on this very bill which was authored by the majority staff contained amendment summaries which had been rewritten by committee staff for the sole purpose of distorting the original intent of the authors so in essence no one contacted our offices to be able to determine whether or not we actually intended that exemption meaning as the report was being written if it had not been for the staff of the committee on rules we would not have had the opportunity to clear the air i do want to pay tribute to the committee on rules in this instance republicans and democrats who listened to our protest if you will and frankly i had hoped and thought that that matter could be resolved there in the committee on rules the response of the majority of the coinmittee on rules is to stand by it or they stood by those amendments as they were described it appeared as stated by the ranking member that the representations being made in the committee on rules is that one the majority stood by it and two that the alterations to our amendments were deliberate when asked again why such an outoftheordinary approach was taken the majority responded and suggested that it was the tone of the debate that caused such to be done because we oppose the legislation the gotyou game was being played that is why i rise today because i would like to have today may 10 2005 really be the last last day that we would entertain such actions no matter how vigorous the debate in opposition how be it that we would step away from the integrity of this house the respect for the three branches of government and do as was done the exact quote as i understand and i repeat it here the majority offered to say you dont like what we wrote about your amendments and we dont like what you said about the bill that can take us all over the map that is why we are in this place that is why a president of the united states can stand with the georgian people and talk about democracy andhold his head up high because we are allowed to stand on the floor and vigorously disagree in a manner where we will not be punished so i would ask as we go forward that this kind of tone this kind of approach not be utilized i do not know what you would call it but i certainly know that it has no place here so the resolution that was offered and debated on asked for a number of actions i think now i should applaud one of the actions in the emergency supplemental in the rules that were passed last week the opportunity was taken to clarify the amendments i am not sure whether or not any formal apology was made but i imagine that when the record is corrected we have received a response that addresses the historical record of this body so it serves no purpose to ask for an apology today i do think we were a little bit off our mark and i would hope that having not asked for an apology and having not received it and seeking only the straightforward clarification that will be the approach that we will take one that we will be allowed to debate in this body whether it be in committee or on the floor and vigorously disagree and that in that disagreement there will be no punishment the only factor that we should have as the test of whether we are right or wrong or whether or not we prevail is that vote and in many instances the majority now in control of the house the senate the supreme court the executive by one party prevails in the instance of the committee on the judiciary in this occasion on these amendments the majority prevailed the minority however felt passion about the amendments and in fact believes that they were right and i personally believe that two amendments one to do a study of the negative impact of this legislation if it might occur or what dangerous procedures might occur of this legislation where would a child seek to go because they were fearful of getting parental consent that was a sincere amendment to get important facts and giving a child the opportunity to talk to godparents or aunts and uncles or cousins clergy or grandparents was not sinister it was simply to protect lives so i would hope that that would be where we would divide on our beliefs our reasons for the legislation not on how we talked about a bill for there have been many legislative initiatives that have had vigorous talk and members have agreed and disagreed about the vigorous talk but the only criteria for prevailing or not prevailing is that vote not a characterization by someone else that you are the leader of exempting sexual predators saying it over and over again of course may cause some to cringe and it is not my intent but i think clarification is very important and in the course of the battle of that particular legislation you can be assured as it was being debated if the glimpses of the words that were gotten were only that it was something to do with sexual predators that just muddies the water of the good intentions that you might be having and the intent of what you wrote in that amendment it would almost be like those who are abhorring drug cartels and drug dealers that if they were to have an amendment dealing with a gao study determining the extent of drug cartels influence in the united states or the growth of drug cartels between 1990 and 2005 and all of a sudden it was characterized as an amendment for the gao to promote drug dealership and drug cartels you would not want to hear that on the floor but it certainly would be the complete opposite of your intent and it would have mischaracterized the debate where you were standing and trying to determine whether some legislation promoted drug cartels more so than broke them up the constitution allows us the opportunity for three branches of government and i think that this country is unique because of it very unique in its uniqueness we have checks and balances the checks and balances do not purge into the inner workings of each body so we are the holder of our own records and it leaves little room sometimes in another body to go and complain about the workings of one specific body particularly the words that are spoken and so there are no other grounds or no other opportunities to clear the air other than to seek this personal privilege i hope that in the course of this discussion it was not rendered in anger or anguish it was simply rendered to say that what occurred deserved the greater attention of this body and that it was on the brink of abuse and the sadness is that we had to rise to the floor more than once before it was ultimately corrected in the waning hours of last weeks legislative session does that speak well of us it does not the rules committee is a place where we ferret out rules our respective committees is a place where we vigorously oversee legislation and provide our input and insight and our thought processes to do what is right i would venture to say there has not been one committee hearing and markup where some member promoted the criminal elements that would do harm to america and if any thought came to the mind of a colleague that that was the intent of that member i would assure you that the best approach of that particular colleague would be to query that member in that committee room none of us were queried about the question of the intent of our amendments whether or not they had to do with predators child sexual predators sexual predators no one was queried and therefore the interpretation that was attributed to us was purposeful and here on this floor the same courtesy should be extended and if you are misunderstood if you misspeak from the integrity again of this record that would be for all to see someone should query you and give you the opportunity to correct your words or in the alternative when the height ofthe debate is so furious there is a challenge by someone at some point that the words be called out there are a lot of papers here because i am looking at this debate that went on and so i will not add to some of the accusations that were made in the debate going back and forth i am simply going to conclude by asking again that it not ever be done again and asking that we respect the individual rights of members to defend and represent their constituents and to offer vigorous debate both consent and dissent and as well the rightto vigorously disagree on a legislative initiative if we can hold to those tenets and the idea of the constitution which i hold very dear which i will read briefly into the record the sacred rights of mankind a statement by alexander hamilton 1775 are not to be rummaged for among old parchments or musty records they are written as with a sunbeam on the whole volume of human nature by the hand of the divinity itself and can never be erased or obscured by mortal power of course this is high language to talk about the rights bestowed upon mankind humankind that they are not found in paper and this quote is correct but one thing is right as well is that although all is not said and done on the written word it certainly is a parallel to our rights because we look to a written document for our rights we look to the written word we look to the madison papers to determine our rights and therefore the written word is extremely important we have had our say on this and i hope that it has been a deliberate statement we will do work in the judiciary committee in the coming days and weeks and months we will have many opportunities to vigorously disagree i might say we have had many opportunities to agree and i expect that we will find common ground throughout the days and weeks and months democrats and republicans around issues of importance to the nation but when we use this document to exercise our job and to debate vigorously and disagree we should not be cited for what we have said about a bilr or punished because we have said something about a bill that others would not agree with our final act will hopefully be one that is respectful of this house and of this place to the judiciary committee members as we gather on a daily basis weekly basis i believe they will all agree that we have the right to disagree and to debate vigorously in the committee in the rules committee and on this floor again i close by saying i hope never again never again i rise to raise a point of personal privilege under rule ix clause 1 of the house rules this point as did the point raised by my colleague on the judiciary committee from new york mr nadler relates to the malreporting by the republican leadership of the committee on the judiciary with respect to h r 748 the child interstate abortion notification act of 2005 while i appreciate the efforts of the chairman of the judiciary committee for having filed a supplemental report part 2 of house report 10951 i must raise this point of personal privilege nonetheless in drder to emphasize the fact that the accuracy and the veracity of house committee reports carries tremendous weight and implications for the reputation professional record and personal life of members of congress again while the supplemental report to 10951 makes some corrections to the mistakes made in part 1 the report still contains an inaccurate representation of the amendments that i representative sheila jackson lee offered in committee on april 13 2005 in room 2141 of rayburn i offered two amendments en bloc that read as such amendment no 1 designated as dl005 page 3 after line 2 insert the following 3 the prohibitions of this section do not apply with respect to c onduct by clergy godparents aunts uncles or first cousins amendment no 2 designated as dl006 add at the end the following"], [0.047074198722839355, 0.45292580127716064, 0, "this evening i would like to discuss a major problem that is moving rapidly across the country that is the problem of methamphetamine methamphetamines first came into prominence during world war ii many japanese kamikaze pilots were given methamphetamine to allow them to finish their mission from that point on it spread to hells angel and other biker groups on the west coast and has been slowly spreading its way from west to east across the country it is the most highly addictive drug zhat is known at the present time often causes complete addiction after only one usage it creates a euphoria that lasts between 6 and 8 hours there i a huge dopamine release in the brain and it is cheap it costs much less than heroin and cocaine provides increased energy many young mothers who have two or three kids and have a tremendous energy drain become drawn to this particular drug people who are working two jobs sometimes truck drivers who want to stay awake for 2 or 3 days on end find that methamphetamine serves their ends often it always results in fairly rapid weight loss however whatever goes up must come down and we find that those who are using methamphetamine usually will experience at times extreme anxiety depression hallucinations many times will actually sink into a psychosis violent behavior is often a side effect many methamphetamine addicts experience crank bugs these are the hallucination that there is a bug underneath the skin as a result in order to get those bugs out they will pick at their skin that will cause rather extreme skin lesions to result also when they use it orally their teeth disintegrate very rapidly extremely quick aging and usually death ensues within a few years of methamphetamine use it always causes brain damage and much of this brain damage is irreversible an 18year old who has been on meth for a year will have a brain scan that will look very like an 80year old alzheimers patient there is so much brain tissue that has been destroyed that the two brain scans are somewhat indistinguishable it is very common to see a great deal of meth abuse in rural areas and this is due to the fact that when you hanufacture meth there is a very strong odor of ether and as a result if you manufacture in the city sometimes that odor is easily detectable the chief ingredient of methamphetamine is pseudophedrine a common cold medicine oklahoma has done a fairly effective job of eliminating the meth labs by making pseudophedrin e a class v substance and that puts it behind the pharmacy counter but many other states have failed to follow suit other ingredients of methamphetamine are lithium batteries drain cleaner starter fluid anhydrous ammonia and iodine it is a tremendously toxic mix and of course it lease a lot of toxic waste in order to clean up a methamphetamine lab it will cost anywhere from 5 to 6 000 many of the suits that are worn by those cleaning un those meth labs cost about 500 and they can only be used one time because of the toxicity some areas of middle america have had as many as 1 500 to 2 000 meth labs per year in these states so it a huge expense to clean up and a huge problem in terms of addiction the average meth addict in my state nebraska will commit roughly 60 crimes a year to feed that habit so if you have ten meth addicts in a community that is 600 crimes a year if that a small town that is a huge impact much of the child abuse child neglect homicides suicides that we see in these areas are due directly to methamphetamine abuse many counties in these areas spend 70 to 80 percent of their law enforcement dollars and their manpower on meth issues our jail cells and our prisons are filled we simply cannot keep up and take care of the methamphetamine problem so the question is what can congress do with this huge problem currently our byrne and our hidta funds which are high intensity drug trafficking funds have been drastically reduced we need to restore these funds this is a huge problem in terms of funding the gentleman from missouri and also the gentleman from indiana have introduced legislation that regulates the sale of pseudophedrine that is necessary in the manufacture of methamphetamine and also they would provide extra funds for meth lab cleanups the gentleman from indiana bill tracks manufacturers of pseudophedrine worldwide and of course the pseudophedrine goes to many of the super labs they are only seven or eight factories for pseudophedrine worldwide and so if we know where those drugs are going where the pseudophedrine is going we have a pretty good idea where the super labs are so these bills would be tremendously helpful so i call attention to the meth problem call attention to the reduction in funding and we really need to do everything we can to stamp this problem out"]]}
