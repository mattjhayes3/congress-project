kicking sometimes crying right there in front of you on the table so what did gosnell do he would take a pair of scissors plunge them into the baby and sever his or her spinal cord no care whatsoever about the pain involved one of gosnells employees who witnessed this barbarism described the babys scream as follows i cant describe it it sounded like a little alien well this wasnt an alien it was a human being just like you and me although in an earlier form of development gosnell thank god is in prison but we have now learned that the largest abortion provider in this country planned parenthood

arise stemming back from a man who was born in eritrea named abdurahman alamoudi and this is from discoverthenetworks org he mr alamoudi immigrated to the united states in 1979 that would be the same year you will recall that radical islam declared war on the united states attacked our embassy in tehran took over 50 americans hostage and held them for over a year that same year that year 1979 is the year mr alamoudi came to the united states and then he became a naturalized unitedstates citizen in 1996 in 1981 he founded the islamic society of boston it is not in this article but i have also seen the documentation of his founding and it is i think worth noting that the islamic society of boston that mr alamoudi founded the two mosques in the boston area one of which produced the tsarnaev brothers where they worshipped and learned more about islam this article says from 1985 to 1990 mr alamoudi served as executive assistant to the president of the saar foundation in northern virginia in 1990 alamoudi founded the american muslim council the following year he established the american muslim armed forces and veterans affairs council whose purpose was to certify muslim chaplains hired by the military during the 1992 presidential election cycle alamoudi courted both the democratic and the republican parties when bill clinton emerged victorious alamoudi increased his donations to democrats he went on to serve the clinton administration as an islamic affairs adviser and a state department goodwill ambassador to muslim nations in 1993 the defense department certified alamoudis american muslim armed forces and veterans affairs council as one of two organizations along with the graduate school of islamic and social sciences authorized to approve and endorse muslim chaplains among the chaplains endorsed by alamoudis group was james yee who eventually would be arrested in 2003 on suspicion of espionage it is very reassuring that this man arrested on suspicion of espionage here in the united states was certified by mr alamoudis group in march 1993 alamoudi disparaged the federal government for the flimsy evidence it had used as a basis for arresting mohammed salameh a suspect in the world trade center bombing of february 26 of 1993 salameh was later convicted and sentenced to life in prison on what apparently mr alamoudi thought was flimsy evidence it goes on in 1995 alamoudi helped president clinton interesting verb that helped alamoudi helped president clinton and the american civil liberties union develop a presidential guideline entitled religious expression in public school which established a legal justification upon which the aclu would file lawsuits restricting christmas celebrations and removing nativity scenes from public schools alamoudi made numerous controversial statements during the 1990s and early 2000s including these in 1994 he said hamas is not a terrorist group i have followed the good work of hamas in march 1996 alamoudi said he was honored to be a member of the committee that is defending islamic association of palestine or iap founder musa abu marzuk who in 1997 would be deported from the united states because of his hamasrelated activities i really consider him to be from among the best people in the islamic movement that is a quote from alamoudi alamoudi added hamas and i work together with him in december of 1996 as alamoudi continued to work with the clinton administration to find good muslims to work in the government alamoudi told a meeting of the iap i think if we were outside this country we can say oh allah destroy america but once we are here our mission in this country is to change it you can be violent anywhere else but in america in october 2000 alamoudi attended an antiisrael protest outside the white house where he proudly declared himself a supporter of hamas and a supporter of hezbollah and apparently there is video of that in 2000 alamoudi literally began making regular trips to libya where he met with government officials to discuss strategies by which they could create headaches for saudi arabia in january 2001 alamoudi attended a conference in beirut with leaders of numerous terrorist organizations including al qaeda hamas hezbollah and islamic jihad in june 2001 alamoudi was a guest speaker at a northern virginia conference where senior islamic militants from throughout the middle east were gathered many of the speakers denounced the zionist entity that aims to destroy the muslim ummah or community that same month alamoudi attended a briefing on president bushs faithbased initiative and the white house invited him to the post9 11 prayer service on september 14th at the national cathedral in washington in september 2003 british customs officials arrested alamoudi at heathrow airport as he was returning from libya with 340 000 in cash given to him by president muammar qadhafi to finance a plot involving two u k based al qaeda operatives intending to assassinate saudi crown prince later king abdullah alamoudi was subsequently extradited to the united states in october 2003 he was arrested at dulles airport on charges of having illegally accepted 10 700 from the libyan mission to the united nations with alamoudi in custody federal authorities released a transcript of a telephone conversation in which he had lamented that no americans had died during al qaedas 1998 bombing of the unitedstates embassy in kenya recommended that more operations be conducted like the 1994 hezbollah bombing of a jewish cultural center in buenos aires in which 85 people died and clearly articulated his objective of turning america into a muslim nation alamoudi was indicted not only for his illegal dealings with libya but also for tax evasion and immigration fraud he ultimately pled guilty to and was convicted of being a senior al qaeda financier who had funneled at least 1 million into the coffers of that terrorist organization he also acknowledged that he had pocketed almost 1 million for himself in the process in october 2004 alamoudi was sentenced to 23 years in federal prison during the holy land foundation for relief and development trial of 2007 which examined evidence of the hlfs fundraising on behalf of hamas the unitedstates government released a list of approximately 300 of hlfs unindicted coconspirators and joint venturers alamoudi was named in that list in addition to the affiliations listed above alamoudi has also been at various times a board member of american muslims for jerusalem the head of the american task force for bosnia a board member of the council for the national interest foundation a director of the council on americanislamic relations cair which by the way has very open access to the highest officials including the president they are the ones that got langley to call off a 2day seminar for law enforcement on radical islam and got the rules changed so people that were american experts on islam could not talk to any unitedstates government group about radical islam unless they got approval from people like those that cair approved of cairwe are talking also about a named coconspirator in the holy land foundation trial in which convictions were obtained for principals in the holy land foundation for supporting terrorism i would humbly submit that had eric holder not become attorney general and barack obama not become president of the united states many if not all of those coconspirators would have been then indicted and tried as supporters of terrorism instead a new president and a new attorney general came in and instead of being indicted and tried for supporting terrorism as they were named in the federal district court in dallas and the fifth circuit court of appeals said in opinionsthere was plenty of evidence to support that they were coconspiratorswell the new administration dropped the matter and these people became helpful to the administration in advising on islam it also notes that mr alamoudi was a founding trustee of the fiqh council of north america a board member of the interfaith impact for justice and peace a regional representative for the islamic society of north americawhich was also a named coconspirator for supporting terrorisma board member of mercy international president of the muslim student association of the unitedstates and canada a board member of the somali relief fund secretary of the muslim brotherhood affiliated success foundation and director of the talibah international aid association in fact in an article back in 2004 andrew c mccarthy noted that abdurahman alamoudi was sentenced today to 23 years imprisonment for terrorism financing false statements on his naturalization petition and tax violations the sentence was imposed by judge claude hilton of the unitedstates district court in alexandria virginia alamoudi was influential in the american muslim circles and thus in washington he participated in several political and charitable organizations founding the american muslim councilan enthusiastic supporter of hamas and hezbollah the federal government permitted him a key role in selecting the islamic clerics who minister in the military and in the prison system over the years moreover he occasionally traveled the globe as an emissary of the state department as we now know he also traveled to libya engaged in financial transactions with qadhafis government and collected hefty sums including the 340 000 seized from him when he was arrested last year which were designed to be routed back to his causes in the unitedstates without the knowledge of american authorities all of those activities violate the international emergency economic powers act imposes terrorismrelated sanctions prohibiting unlicensed travel to and commerce with libya i will parenthetically insert here that it had to be very convenient for mr alamoudi this convicted supporter of terrorism to be working for the state department as he went to different countries and apparently continued to conspire to support terrorism as the state department funded his travel on its behalf but also found was this article the author was brian blomquist and the date is june 27 2003 it is an article about the esteemed unitedstates senator charles or chuck schumer entitled schumer wants fanatical imams rooted out of jails armed forces the article says militant muslim imams are preaching a distorted hateful form of islam to unitedstates soldiers and federal prisoners creating a dangerous situation senator charles schumer charged yesterday schumer said the problem is that the pentagon and the federal bureau of prisons select muslim imams on the advice of islamic groups in the grip of the fanatical wahhabism strain of the religion while the potential wahhabi influence in the unitedstates armed forces is not well documented these organizations have succeeded in ensuring that militant wahhabism is the only form of islam that is preached to the 12 000 muslims in federal prison schumer said at a senate hearing on extremist wahhabi islam which has been linked to terrorism in february the new york prison system barred its top muslim chaplain from its prison facilities after the imam warith dean umar said the 9 11 hijackers should be treated as martyrs the imams flood the prisons with antiamerican probin laden videos literature and sermon tapes the point of prison should be to rehabilitate violent prisoners mr schumer is so right the article goes on the bureau of prisons uses the graduate school of islamic and social sciences which is under investigation for possible funneling of money to terrorists and the islamic society of north america which has board members with terror links schumer charged american muslim foundation president abdurahman alamoudi said his organization had no role advising the pentagon alamoudi said he formerly gave the pentagon advice on selecting imams but they pushed me out well we know that that was not until right before the british government arrested alamoudi and then provided apparently the unitedstates government plenty of evidence to show that alamoudi was supporting terrorism that is why i was so shocked since the fbi got information from britain gathered their own information that they had been gathering at least since 1991 on radical islamic beginnings here in the united states that during the bush administration the fbi would have a partnership outreach program with the council of americanislamic relations of which mr alamoudi was a board member cair was a named coconspirator for supporting terrorists which the courts have said there is plenty of evidence to support that they are while the fbi had gathered such evidence they were outreach partners with this organization cair named as a coconspirator with the holy land foundation this article from wnd pentagon admits chaplains from muslim brotherhood group published on march 6 2014 by aaron klein said the unitedstates army and air force has selected two muslim chaplains from a program run by an islamic group closely tied to the muslim brotherhood that was named by the justice department as an unindicted coconspirator in a scheme to raise money for hamas wnd broke the story in 2011 that the controversial islamic society of north america or isna is the official endorsing agency for the unitedstates armed forces muslim chaplain program wnd further reported that year that the muslim chaplain program was founded by a terrorsupporting convict while the armys first islamic chaplain who is still serving has been associated with a charity widely accused of serving as an alqaida front now isna has announced that two of its former applicants for chaplaincy were selected to serve on active duty in the united states army and air force the significance of this news is that the department of defense has not selected an isnaendorsed chaplain for active duty in over 15 years said the isna press release isna chaplain services director and islamic endorsing agent abdulrasheed muhammad said in a statement that the two chaplains selected for active duty are ready to serve allah and the countrymaking the statement in that order after speaking by phone with both soldiers it was more than clear both were eager and ready to serve allah and country may allah bless our new chaplain candidates and their families as they prepare for new challenges and opportunities in the army and air force chaplain corps said muhammad while the new chaplains ties to isna has received some attention in the conservative blogosphere in recent days missing from the conversation is the larger partnership between the unitedstates military and not just the isna but also other terrortied groups in fact muhammad himself the isnas endorsing agent has been tied to a group accused of serving as an alqaida front by the way parenthetically 1993 was the year in which we had another terrorist attack that being the first attempted bombing or the first bombing of the word trade center in an attempt to bring it down and kill tens of thousands of americans since the muslim chaplain programs inception in 1993 isna has been the official endorsing agency of the new chaplains in 2005 isna initiated a yearly muslim chaplain conference that includes leadership talks for chaplains in both the military and the unitedstates prison system discover the networks notes that isnathrough its saudigovernmentbacked affiliate the north american islamic trustreportedly holds the mortgages on 50 percent to 80 percent of all mosques in the unitedstates and canada thus the organization can freely exercise ultimate authority over these houses of worship and their teachings states discover the networks isna was founded in 1981 by the saudifunded muslim students association which was founded partially by the muslim brotherhood the two groups are still partners wnd previously attended an msa event at which violence against the unitedstates was urged by speakers we are not americans shouted one speaker muhammad faheed at queensborough community college in 2003 we are muslims the unitedstates is going to deport and attack us it is us versus them truth against falsehood the colonizers and masters against the oppressed and we will burn down the masters house well with those kind of comments coming at their meetings it is so wonderful that principles from these organizations have such close ties with the current leadership in the country in the white house in the state department and in the justice department this article goes on isna was named in a may 1991 muslim brotherhood document an explanatory memorandum on the general strategic goal for the group in north america as one of the brotherhoods likeminded organizations of our friends who shared the common goal of destroying america and turning it into a muslim nation according to discover the networks islam scholar stephen schwartz describes isna as one of the chief conduits through which the radical saudi form of islam passes into the united states according to terrorism expert steven emerson isna is a radical group hiding under a false veneer of moderation that publishes a bimonthly magazine islamic horizons that often champions militant islamist doctrine the group also convenes annual conferences where islamist militants have been given a platform to incite violence and promote hatred states emerson emerson cites an isna conference in which alqaida supporter and plo official yusuf al qaradhawi was invited to speak emerson further reports that in september of 2002 a full year after 9 11 speakers at isnas annual conference still refused to acknowledge osama bin ladens role in the terrorist attacks also isna has held fundraisers for terrorists notes discover the networks after hamas leader mousa marzook was arrested and eventually deported in 1997 isna raised money for his defense the group also has condemned the unitedstates governments post9 11 seizure of the financial assets of hamas and palestinian islamic jihad isna meanwhile has an extensive relationship with the obama administration which recently announced it is open to diplomacy with the muslim brotherhood this is where i have to say having visited with leaders in the middle east muslim leaders who are actually friends of the united states not in official open meetings but when we get in private they ask the question why does your unitedstates administration continue to support the muslim brotherhood do you not understand the muslim brotherhood has been at war with the united states since 1979 and you have got friendly muslims that want to help youi would submit that the current president of egypt is one of thoseand yet you are insistent on helping the muslim brotherhood that is at war with the united states oh not with violence yet but they claim they are getting so much accomplished in taking over the united states without violence that they dont want to use that yet that will come later if necessary but right now they are doing such a good job as advisers and in important positions in the administration that they should not be using violence well back to the article the relationship began even before obama took office one week before last years presidential inauguration again keeping in mind this article is from 2014 one week before last years presidential inauguration sayyid syeed national director of isnas office for interfaith and community alliances was part of a delegation that met with the directors of obamas transition team the delegation discussed a request for an executive order ending torture isna president mattson represented american muslims at obamas inauguration where she offered a prayer during the televised event mattson also represented isna at obamas ramadan dinner at the white house in june 2009 obama senior aide valerie jarrett invited mattson to work on the white house council on women and girls which jarrett leads yeah that is what you want you want someone who supports the muslim brotherhoods idea that women dont have rights they have no business showing their face in public or driving or having property yeah that is what you want advising the white house on womens issues for heavens sake the article goes on one month later the justice department sponsored an information booth at an isna bazaar in washington d c also that month jarrett addressed isnas 46th annual convention according to the white house jarrett attended as part of obamas outreach to muslims in february obamas top adviser on counterterrorism john brennan came under fire for controversial remarks he made in a speech to muslim law students at an event sponsored by isna at new york university in his speech brennan who later became cia director stated that having a percentage of terrorists released by the unitedstates return to terrorist attacks isnt that bad since the recidivism rate for inmates in the unitedstates prison system is higher he also criticized parts of the bush administrations response to 9 11 as a reaction some people might say was over the top in some areas that in an overabundance of caution we implemented a number of security measures and activities that upon reflection now we look back after the heat of the battle has died down a bit we say they were excessive ok wnd reported brennan stated at the isnaorganized event that the obama administration is working to calibrate policies in the fight against terrorism that ensure americans are never profiled speaking at the questionandanswer session brennan declared himself a citizen of the world we need to be looking at ourselves as individuals not the way we look or the creed we have or our ethnic background i consider myself a citizen of the world he said brennan told the audience the obama administration is trying to make sure that we as americans can interact in a safe way balance policies in a way that optimizes national security but also optimizes the opportunity in this country never to be profiled never to be discriminated against yes that is right sure if you hate america and you want americas western lifestyle and freedoms destroyed you want women subjugated we shouldnt profile people just because they want america destroyed as part of their religious beliefs that kind of thinking gets a nation in trouble and thus we are in trouble this article was published this week january 5 2016 from jennifer hickey ripe for radicalization federal prisons breeding ground for terrorists say experts here we are in 2016 substantiating the statements that senator chuck schumer made back in 2003 that our prisons have been for years now a breeding ground for radical islamism under both republican and democratic administrations we have allowed people who have been namedand for which the federal courts have said there is plenty of evidence to support that they are coconspirators in financing terrorism and supporting terrorismwe have allowed them to pick imams approve imams put imams in our military and in our prisons is it any surprise that 13 years after chuck schumer raised that issue that since nothing has been done about it that the federal prisons are a breeding ground for radical islamists this quote from representative stephen fincher my friend from tennessee says over the years our federal prisons have become a breeding ground for radicalization that is supportive of what chuck schumer said years ago in fact this article by carol brown december 5 2014 american thinker com prisons are breeding grounds for jihadist muslims comprise 15 of the prison population this number far exceeds the percentage of muslims in the general population it is eighteen times greater to be exact so there are 18 times more muslims in federal prison than the percentage of muslims in the general population that raises issues questions and problems put another way there are about 2 4 million muslims in the united states and 350 000 of them are in jail that means more than 12 of muslims in america are incarcerated reports on the number of prisoners who convert to islam vary and are framed in different ways some sources estimate 40 000 prisoners per year convert others put the numbers closer to 135 000 per year some posit that 80 of inmates who find faith while in prison convert to islam one thing is for sure the majority of those who convert to islam in prison are black with as many as one in three black prisoners converting the number of hispanic prisoners converting to islam is also on the rise these numbers are staggering and the implications are serious as will be addressed further on in this article there are numerous reasons why conversions to islam are skyrocketing in our jails many prisoners feel angry disenfranchised and yes even victimized and wronged by society many harbor a deep disdain for america they are therefore prime targets for recruitment to a religious ideology that shares many of these attitudes in addition islamic teachings are often framed as a noble code of ethics to live by case in point the nation of islam is the largest prison ministry i am sure they are meaning the largest prison ministry in the united states this is going on as i speak it has been going on for the 13 years since chuck schumer brought it up in the senate and we dont appear to have learned any lessons from this my friend dana rohrabacher is pushing that we invite the president of egypt president elsisi to come speak to a joint session of congress i was talking to chairman royce about it he believes it would be a good idea our majority whip steve scalise just met with president elsisi in egypt i am thrilled he did he is a muslim leader who understands the muslim brotherhood is a threat to freedom in egypt and in america and in europe it is time we did something about it to protect ourselves you dont have to profile muslims but you should be profiling those who are studying radical islam like qutb like in his booklet milestones which osama bin laden said radicalized himor helped yet this administration will not allow our justice department our intelligence departments and agencies and our state department to be educated on radical islam so of course you are going to be admitting a woman who takes a mans name that denotes a terrorist islamic jihadist from hundreds of years ago tashfeen malik our homeland security has run off people who are real patriots like phil haney and who are brilliant on the issue of radical islam we have run them out the message is clear that you had better not study radical islam and you had better not know anything about radical islam in homeland security because if you do we will run you off if we dont do something worse thank god phil haney had such a clean record they were looking for anything our country is in trouble and there are people who want to destroy it it is ridiculous that anybody still has to say we know all muslims are not terrorists of course they are not but it is ridiculous to continue to allow and to even encourage radical islamist imams in our prisons to transform prisoners into additional radical jihadists who are going to go off like bombs figuratively and literally at some point down the road we also have to look at our immigration policy when it comes to continuing to allow people like alamoudiwho hates america who considers himself to be a person who could help bring about the global caliphate a person who is financing terrorismhave his wife come and have a child in america before he started trying to radicalize that country and take power unto himself as if he were a dictator morsis wifemorsi the former president of egypthad a child here do you think that child was being brought up to love america do you think alamoudis child was being raised to love america while his parents were scheming to terrorize it anwar alawlaki is one about whom my friends on both sides of the aisle have discussed the proprieties or improprieties of having a president just issue an order to kill an american citizen anwar alawlaki a man who led staffers in muslim prayers right here on capitol hill capitol hill staffers were led in prayer by a man who ultimately the obama administrationthe president himselfconsidered to be so dangerous he had to take him out with a drone strike in yemen he was so dangerous to the united states that we couldnt even risk arresting him later he had to take him out with a bomb strike how was he an american citizen his parents who raised him to hate america came to america on student visas they studied here and had anwar alawlaki they took him back to yemen and taught him to hate america he became so dangerous that even president obama felt he had to order a strike on an american citizen without his having had a trial without due process he felt he had to take him out with a drone because that american citizenan american citizen only because his parents came here on visaswas too dangerous for them to do anything else it is time we started protecting our homeland and we need an administration that will do it in closing let me just add that the reports have been that the obama administration used the nsa to spy on members of congress to help it keep the iran treaty in play we have got to get to the bottom of that if it turns out that our president was unconstitutionally spying on members of congress i do not care if they were all democrats or republicans i do not care they may have been democrats it doesnt matter if he were spying on members of congressusing the nsa or any other government agency to spy on members of congresswe need to find out if it happened if he were he needs to be removed from office period otherwise we cant save the nation i hope and pray those allegations are not true i hope and pray that the president of the united states did not have the nsa spying on members of congress to help him with the iran deal to help him as he was supporting the biggest supporters of terrorism in the world i hope and pray that is not true i hope and pray it is not but we need to find out i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0, 0.0, 0, "a poll of my

classes of new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines which may be reasonably anticipated to endanger public health or welfare congress further defined motor vehicle as a selfpropelled vehicle designed for transporting persons or property on a street or highway any reasonable person would understand that selfpropelled vehicle means a vehicle that can propel itself of its own initiative one would think of pickup trucks semis vans or cars one thing that does not come to mind is the back portion of a tractor trailer being the trailer portion which has no way of selfpropelling itself unfortunately the epa doesnt seem to see it that way in last years proposed rules for greenhouse gas emissions and fuel efficiency standards for onroad heavyduty vehicles and engines the epa attempted to regulate truck trailers as selfpropelled vehicles furthermore the epa has a voluntary program called smartway that provides engineering guidelines for aerodynamics and reduced truck weight smartway which is voluntary is intended to improve fuel efficiency for combined tractor tailers however smartway only improves fuel efficiency when tractor trailers are traveling at highway speeds of more than 50 miles per hour smartway provides no benefits whatsoever when the tractor trailers are traveling at less than 50 miles per hour around towns which are where most of the tractor trailers are used in the united states but epa wants to mandate all trailers to be governed by smartway even those that travel less than 50 miles per hour in fact if the government manipulates the weight of trailers cargo gets displaced which results in more tractor trailers on the road higher consumer prices and more greenhouse gas emissions just to meet current freight demands the trailers that epa is proposing to regulate are highly customized to the individual specifications of each customer trailer manufacturers should not be forced to comply with a onesizefitsall standard especially when given that so many trailers do not gain any fuel efficiency benefits from smartway my amendment would prevent the epa from using any funds in the bill to regulate trailers under the greenhouse gas rule not only should these guidelines remain voluntary because they only benefit some trailers epa has no business regulating trailers under the clean air act given that they are not selfpropelled this proposed regulation by the epa is another example of a federal agency overstepping its bounds and attempting to enact a regulation that benefits some parts of the economy but harms others if this attempted overreach by the epa is enforced it will be costly and counterproductive because the private sector is moving faster to improve fuel efficiency and reduce air pollution than the epa can move congress would be wise

documentation of his founding and it is i think worth noting that the islamic society of boston that mr alamoudi founded the two mosques in the boston area one of which produced the tsarnaev brothers where they worshipped and learned more about islam this article says from 1985 to 1990 mr alamoudi served as executive assistant to the president of the saar foundation in northern virginia in 1990 alamoudi founded the american muslim council the following year he established the american muslim armed forces and veterans affairs council whose purpose was to certify muslim chaplains hired by the

he went on to serve the clinton administration as an islamic affairs adviser and a state department goodwill ambassador to muslim nations in 1993 the defense department certified alamoudis american muslim armed forces and veterans affairs council as one of two organizations along with the graduate school of islamic and social sciences authorized to approve and endorse muslim chaplains among the

numerous terrorist organizations including al qaeda hamas hezbollah and islamic jihad in june 2001 alamoudi was a guest speaker at a northern virginia conference where senior islamic militants from

bushs faithbased initiative and the white house invited him to the post9 11 prayer service on september 14th at the national cathedral in washington in september 2003 british customs officials arrested alamoudi at heathrow airport as he was returning from libya with 340 000 in cash given to him by president muammar qadhafi to finance a plot involving two u k based al qaeda operatives intending to assassinate saudi crown prince later king abdullah alamoudi was subsequently extradited to the united states in october 2003 he was arrested at dulles airport on charges of having illegally accepted 10 700 from the libyan mission to the united nations with alamoudi in custody federal authorities released a transcript of a telephone conversation in which he had lamented that no americans had died during al qaedas 1998 bombing of the unitedstates embassy in kenya recommended that more operations be conducted like the 1994 hezbollah bombing of a jewish cultural center in buenos aires in which 85 people died and clearly articulated his objective of turning america into a muslim nation alamoudi was indicted not only for his illegal dealings with libya but also for tax evasion and immigration fraud he ultimately pled guilty to and was convicted of being a senior al qaeda financier who had funneled at least 1 million into the coffers of that terrorist organization he also acknowledged that he had pocketed almost 1 million for himself in the process in october 2004 alamoudi was sentenced to 23 years in federal prison during the holy land foundation for relief and

the sentence was imposed by judge claude hilton of the unitedstates district court in alexandria virginia alamoudi was influential in the american muslim circles and thus in washington he participated in several political and charitable organizations founding the american muslim councilan enthusiastic supporter of hamas and hezbollah the federal government permitted him a key role in selecting the islamic clerics who minister in the military and in the prison system over the years moreover he occasionally traveled the globe as an emissary of the state department as we now know he also traveled to libya engaged in financial transactions with qadhafis government and collected hefty sums including the 340 000 seized from him when he was arrested last year which were designed to be routed back to his causes in the unitedstates without the knowledge of american authorities all of those activities violate the international emergency economic powers act imposes terrorismrelated sanctions prohibiting unlicensed travel to and commerce with libya i will parenthetically insert here that it had to be very convenient for mr alamoudi this convicted supporter of terrorism to be working for

armed forces the article says militant muslim imams are preaching a distorted hateful form of islam to unitedstates soldiers and federal prisoners creating a dangerous situation senator charles schumer charged yesterday schumer said the problem is that the pentagon and the federal bureau of prisons select muslim imams on the advice of islamic groups in the grip of the fanatical wahhabism strain of the religion while the potential wahhabi influence in the unitedstates armed forces is not well documented these organizations have succeeded in ensuring that militant wahhabism is the only form of islam that is preached to the 12 000 muslims in federal prison schumer said at a senate hearing on extremist wahhabi islam which has been linked to terrorism in february the new york prison system barred its top muslim chaplain from its prison facilities after the imam warith dean umar said the 9 11 hijackers should be treated as martyrs the imams flood the prisons with antiamerican probin laden videos literature and sermon tapes the point of prison should be to rehabilitate violent prisoners mr schumer is so right the article goes on the bureau of prisons uses the graduate school of islamic and social sciences which is under investigation for possible funneling of money to terrorists and the islamic society of north america which has board members with terror links schumer charged american muslim foundation president abdurahman alamoudi said his organization had no role advising the pentagon alamoudi said he formerly gave the pentagon advice on selecting imams but they pushed me out well we know that that was not until right before the british government arrested alamoudi and then provided apparently the unitedstates government plenty of evidence to show that alamoudi was supporting terrorism that is why i was so shocked since the fbi got information from britain gathered their own information that they had been gathering at least since 1991 on radical islamic beginnings here in the united states that during the bush administration the fbi would have a partnership outreach program with the council of americanislamic relations of which mr alamoudi was a board member cair was a named coconspirator for supporting terrorists which the courts have said there is plenty of evidence to support that they are while the fbi had gathered such

the official endorsing agency for the unitedstates armed forces muslim chaplain program wnd further reported that year that the muslim chaplain program was founded by a terrorsupporting convict while the armys first islamic chaplain who is still serving has been associated with a charity widely accused of serving as an alqaida front now isna has announced that two of its former applicants for

active duty in over 15 years said the isna press release isna chaplain services director and islamic endorsing agent abdulrasheed muhammad said in a statement that the two chaplains selected for active duty are ready to serve allah and the countrymaking the statement in that order after speaking by phone with both soldiers it was more than clear both were eager and ready to serve allah and country may allah bless our new chaplain candidates and their families as they prepare for new challenges and opportunities in the army and air force chaplain corps said muhammad while the new chaplains ties to isna has received some attention in the conservative blogosphere in recent days missing from the conversation is the larger partnership between the unitedstates military and not just the isna but also other terrortied groups in fact muhammad himself the isnas endorsing agent has been tied to a group accused of serving as an alqaida front by the way parenthetically 1993 was the year in which we had another terrorist attack that being the first attempted bombing or the first bombing of the word trade center in an attempt to bring it down and kill tens of thousands of americans since the muslim chaplain programs inception in 1993 isna has been the official endorsing agency of the new chaplains in 2005 isna initiated a yearly muslim chaplain conference that includes leadership talks for chaplains in both the military and the unitedstates prison system discover the networks notes that isnathrough its saudigovernmentbacked affiliate the north american islamic trustreportedly holds the mortgages on 50 percent to 80 percent of all mosques in the unitedstates and canada thus the organization can freely exercise ultimate authority over these houses of worship and their teachings states discover the networks isna was founded in 1981 by the saudifunded muslim students association which was founded partially by the muslim brotherhood the two groups are still partners wnd previously attended an msa event at which violence against the unitedstates was urged by speakers we are not americans shouted one speaker muhammad faheed at queensborough community college in 2003 we are muslims the unitedstates is going to deport and attack us it is us versus them truth against falsehood the colonizers and masters against the oppressed and we will burn down the masters house well with those kind of comments coming at their meetings it is so wonderful that principles from these organizations have such close ties with the current leadership in the country in the white house in the state department and in the justice department this article goes on isna was named in a may 1991 muslim brotherhood document an explanatory memorandum on the general strategic goal for the group in north america as one of the brotherhoods likeminded organizations of our friends who shared the common goal of destroying america and turning it into a muslim nation according to discover the networks islam scholar stephen schwartz describes isna as one of the chief conduits through which the radical saudi form of islam passes into the united states according to terrorism expert steven emerson isna is a radical group hiding under a false veneer of moderation that publishes a bimonthly magazine islamic horizons that often champions militant islamist doctrine the group also convenes annual conferences where islamist militants have been given a platform to incite violence and promote hatred states emerson emerson cites an isna conference in which alqaida supporter and plo official yusuf al qaradhawi was invited to speak emerson further reports that in september of 2002 a full year after 9 11 speakers at isnas annual conference still refused to acknowledge osama bin ladens role in the terrorist attacks also isna has held fundraisers for terrorists notes discover the networks after hamas leader mousa marzook was arrested and eventually deported in 1997 isna raised money for his defense the group also has condemned the unitedstates governments post9 11 seizure of the financial assets of hamas and palestinian islamic jihad isna meanwhile has an extensive relationship with the obama administration which recently announced it is open to diplomacy with the muslim brotherhood this is where i have to say having visited with leaders in the middle east muslim leaders who are actually friends of the united states not in official open meetings but when we get in private they ask the question why does your unitedstates administration continue to support the muslim brotherhood do you not understand the muslim brotherhood has been at war with the united states since 1979 and you have got friendly muslims that want to help youi would submit that the current president of egypt is one of thoseand yet you are insistent on helping the muslim brotherhood that is at war with the united states oh not with violence yet but they claim they are getting so much accomplished in taking over the united states without violence that they dont want to use that yet that will come later if necessary but right now they are doing such a good job as advisers and in important positions in the administration that they should not be using violence well back to the article the relationship began even before obama took office one week before last years presidential inauguration again keeping in mind this article is from 2014 one week before last years presidential inauguration sayyid syeed national director of isnas office for interfaith and community alliances was part of a delegation that met with the directors of obamas transition team the delegation discussed a request for an executive order ending torture isna president mattson represented american muslims at obamas inauguration where she offered a prayer during the televised event mattson also represented isna at obamas ramadan dinner at the white house in june 2009 obama senior aide valerie jarrett invited mattson to work on the white house council on women and girls which jarrett leads yeah that is what you want you want someone who supports the muslim brotherhoods idea that women dont have rights they have no business showing their face in public or driving or having property yeah that is what you want advising the white house on womens issues for heavens sake the article goes on one month later the justice department sponsored an information booth at an isna bazaar in washington d c also that month jarrett addressed isnas 46th annual convention according to the white house jarrett attended as part of obamas outreach to muslims in february obamas top adviser on counterterrorism john brennan came under fire for controversial remarks he made in a speech to muslim law students at an event sponsored by isna at new york university in his speech brennan who later became cia director stated that having a percentage of terrorists released by the unitedstates return to terrorist attacks isnt that bad since the recidivism rate for inmates in the unitedstates prison system is higher he also criticized parts of the bush administrations response to 9 11 as a reaction some people might say was over the top in some areas that in an overabundance of caution we implemented a number of security measures and activities that upon reflection now we look back after the heat of the battle has died down a bit we say they were excessive ok wnd reported brennan stated at the isnaorganized event that the obama administration is working to calibrate policies in the fight against terrorism that ensure americans are never profiled speaking at the questionandanswer session brennan declared himself a citizen of the world we need to be looking at ourselves as individuals not the way we look or the creed we have or our ethnic background i consider myself a citizen of the world he said brennan told the audience the obama administration is trying to make sure that we as americans can interact in a safe way balance policies in a way that optimizes national security but also optimizes the opportunity in this country never to be profiled never to be discriminated against yes that is right sure if you hate america and you want americas western lifestyle and freedoms destroyed you want women subjugated we shouldnt profile people just because they want america destroyed as part of their religious beliefs that kind of thinking gets a nation in trouble and thus we are in trouble this article was published this week january 5 2016 from jennifer hickey ripe for radicalization federal prisons breeding ground for terrorists say experts here we are in 2016 substantiating the statements that senator chuck schumer made back in 2003 that our prisons have been for years now a breeding ground for radical islamism under both republican and democratic administrations we have allowed people who have been namedand for which the federal courts have said there is plenty of evidence to support that they are coconspirators in financing terrorism and supporting terrorismwe have allowed them to pick imams approve imams put imams in our military and in our prisons is it any surprise that 13 years after chuck schumer raised that issue that since nothing has been done about it that the federal prisons are a breeding ground for radical islamists this quote from representative stephen fincher my friend from tennessee says over the years our federal prisons have become a breeding ground for radicalization that is supportive of what chuck schumer said years ago in fact this article by carol brown december 5 2014 american thinker com prisons are breeding grounds for jihadist muslims comprise 15 of the prison population this number far exceeds the percentage of muslims in the general population it is eighteen times greater to be exact so there are 18 times more muslims in federal prison than the percentage of muslims in the general population that raises issues questions and problems put another way there are about 2 4 million muslims in the united states and 350 000 of them are in jail that means more than 12 of muslims in america are incarcerated reports on the number of prisoners who convert to islam vary and are framed in different ways some sources estimate 40 000 prisoners per year convert others put the numbers closer to 135 000 per year some posit that 80 of inmates who find faith while in prison convert to islam one thing is for sure the majority of those who convert to islam in prison are black with as many as one in three black prisoners converting the number of hispanic prisoners converting to islam is also on the rise these numbers are staggering and the implications are serious as will be addressed further on in this article there are numerous reasons why conversions to islam are skyrocketing in our jails many prisoners feel angry disenfranchised and yes even victimized and wronged by society many harbor a deep disdain for america they are therefore prime targets for recruitment to a religious ideology that shares many of these attitudes in addition islamic teachings are often framed as a noble code of ethics to live by case in point the nation of islam is the largest prison ministry i am sure they are meaning the largest prison ministry in the united states this is going on as i speak it has been going on for the 13 years since chuck schumer brought it up in the senate and we dont appear to have learned any lessons from this my friend dana rohrabacher is pushing that we invite the president of egypt president elsisi to come speak to a joint session of congress i was talking to chairman royce about it he believes it would be a good idea our majority whip steve scalise just met with president elsisi in egypt i am thrilled he did he is a muslim leader who understands the muslim brotherhood is a threat to freedom in egypt and in america and in europe it is time we did something about it to protect ourselves you dont have to profile muslims but you should be profiling those who are studying radical islam like qutb like in his booklet milestones which osama bin laden said radicalized himor helped yet this administration will not allow our justice department our intelligence departments and agencies and our state department to be educated on radical islam so of course you are going to be admitting a woman who takes a mans name that denotes a terrorist islamic jihadist from hundreds of years ago tashfeen malik our homeland security has run off people who are real patriots like phil haney and who are brilliant on the issue of radical islam we have run them out the message is clear that you had better not study radical islam and you had better not know anything about radical islam in homeland security because if you do we will run you off if we dont do something worse thank god phil haney had such a clean record they were looking for anything our country is in trouble and there are people who want to destroy it it is ridiculous that anybody still has to say we know all muslims are not terrorists of course they are not but it is ridiculous to continue to allow and to even encourage radical islamist imams in our prisons to transform prisoners into additional radical jihadists who are going to go off like bombs figuratively and literally at some point down the road we also have to look at our immigration policy when it comes to continuing to allow people like alamoudiwho hates america who considers himself to be a person who could help bring about the global caliphate a person who is financing terrorismhave his wife come and have a child in america before he started trying to radicalize that country and take power unto himself as if he were a dictator morsis wifemorsi the former president of egypthad a child here do you think that child was being brought up to love america do you think alamoudis child was being raised to love america while his parents were scheming to terrorize it anwar alawlaki is one about whom my friends on both sides of the aisle have discussed the proprieties or improprieties of having a president just issue an order to kill an american citizen anwar alawlaki a man who led staffers in muslim prayers right here on capitol hill capitol hill staffers were led in prayer by a man who ultimately the obama administrationthe president himselfconsidered to be so dangerous he had to take him out with a drone strike in yemen he was so dangerous to the united states that we couldnt even risk arresting him later he had to take him out with a bomb strike how was he an american citizen his parents who raised him to hate america came to america on student visas they studied here and had anwar alawlaki they took him back to yemen and taught him to hate america he became so dangerous that even president obama felt he had to order a strike on an american citizen without his having had a trial without due process he felt he had to take him out with a drone because that american citizenan american citizen only because his parents came here on visaswas too dangerous for them to do anything else it is time we started protecting our homeland and we need an administration that will do it in closing let me just add that the reports have been that the obama administration used the nsa to spy on members of congress to help it keep the iran treaty in play we have got to get to the bottom of that if it turns out that our president was unconstitutionally spying on members of congress i do not care if they were all democrats or republicans i do not care they may have been democrats it doesnt matter if he were spying on members of congressusing the nsa or any other government agency to spy on members of congresswe need to find out if it happened if he were he needs to be removed from office period otherwise we cant save the nation i hope and pray those allegations are not true i hope and pray that the president of the united states did not have the nsa spying on members of congress to help him with the iran deal to help him as he was supporting the biggest supporters of terrorism in the world i hope and pray that is not true i hope and pray it is not but we need to find out i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a poll of my constituents in pennsylvanias eighth district one of the true swing districts in this house shows that they disapprove of the administrations nuclear deal with iran by a 2 to 1 margin these returns are in line with recent national polls showing americans as a whole overwhelmingly disapprove of the agreement by a similar count and they have every right to what we have learned about this deal is that it does not go far enough to achieve its ultimate goal to prevent iran from getting a nuclear weapon in fact it would allow just that when it sunsets in the meantime anytime anywhere inspections of iranian nuclear sites were neutralized to provide up to 24 days notice prior to any inspection in addition this deal precipitates a nuclear arms race in the middle east a reality we are already seeing as nations like egypt jordan and saudi arabia have already begun building up their nuclear infrastructure in response the hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctions relief provided by this
