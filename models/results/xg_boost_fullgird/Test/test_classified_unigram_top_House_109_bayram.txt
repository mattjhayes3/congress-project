state but 10 years ago in wisconsin we figured out a reasonable answer i led the fight to create a new medical liability system where injured parties receive every single dollar of economic damages to which they are entitled but where there is a modest cap on noneconomic damages things like pain and suffering loss of society loss of companionship you know what it worked we hear a lot about studies here we know as a fact in wisconsin it worked in a short period of time wisconsin became one of only six states not to have a medical liability crisis as a result as the state medical society reported physicians especially those in highrisk specialties actually moved into our state from states like ohio and pennsylvania and florida and illinois it worked but sadly my state recently lost its way even though by any reasonable measure our reforms work the wisconsin courts struck them down we can only hope that wisconsin enacts a new medical liability reform act but until then we should pass the health act it will not only help wisconsin doctors and patients but those in every state facing a medical liability crisis this bill is statefriendly it does not preempt state reforms if a state like wisconsin has a cap on noneconomic damages whether that cap is higher or lower that cap will take effect more important it is doctorfriendly it is patientfriendly it will help us get a handle on at

receive taxpayers are finding their own answers while some federal lawmakers in washington remain deaf to their desire because they are too busy dueling over illegal immigration doctrines state

illegal entry just like houston illegals have been drawn to colorado like moths to a flame and like many states colorado has left the porch light on for them because they have bad laws that encourage illegal entry such as laws that protect employers that hire illegals providing illegals benefits that many americans do not receive such as unemployment grants and even medical care this may explain

farreaching requirement which will require many of those 1 million people to prove that they are in the state legally to receive benefits without that proof they lose the benefits that americans have to pay for because americans always pay always pay for illegal entry illegals will lose unemployment checks grants to pay energy bills and even some public medical care and even applying for these perks means a monetary punishment to illegals they are also now busting business owners who until recently have left their own porch lights on guiding illegals their way in the name of a bigger bottom

chance to serve and we saw that gratitude every day in her work ethic rarely has this body seen a member who studies so tirelessly that with which she was responsible legislative council once told her staff that theyd never seen a member pore so intently over draft bill text but this was indicative of the life of steady consistent and unfailing effort that she led on behalf of jacksonville and the

cases the unauthorized release of personal information like a phone record can lead to a tragic result unfortunately existing federal statutes that could be used to target data thieves are inadequate these statutes have clearly not deterred data burglars from treating confidential phone record information as a commodity to be bought and sold over the internet without the consent of consumers sometimes for as little as 100 the underlying bill targets companies and individuals who traffic in fraudulently obtained confidential phone records and provides new protections for the privacy of calling logs themselves it establishes a new section 1039 in title 18 of the united states code that will provide explicit penalties for those who use fraud to obtain confidential phone records the bill imposes a prison sentence of up to 10 years and a fine of up to 500 000 on any person who in interstate commerce sells transfers purchases or receives confidential phone records of a telephone company without the prior consent of the consumer the bill includes enhanced penalties for cases where the information is used in furtherance of crimes of domestic violence or a threat to law enforcement officials or their families we need to pass this bill to demonstrate that we take seriously the obligation to protect the confidentiality of consumer telephone records and to make clear to data thieves that their conduct will result in a felony conviction this legislation supports crime victims prosecutors and companies and individuals who have been the targets of this fraud a companion

medical liability crisis not just because medical liability premiums were soaring not just because insurance carriers were discontinuing the sale of medical liability insurance but because too many physicians felt forced to leave their practice leave their specialty or leave the state for a more affordable state but 10 years ago in wisconsin we figured out a reasonable answer i led the fight to create a new medical liability system where injured parties receive every single dollar of economic damages to which they are entitled but where there is a modest cap on noneconomic damages things like pain and suffering loss of society loss of companionship you know what it worked we hear a lot about studies here we know as a fact in wisconsin it worked in a short period of time wisconsin became one of only six states not to have a medical liability crisis as a result as the state medical society reported physicians especially those in highrisk specialties actually moved into our state from states like ohio and pennsylvania and florida and illinois it worked but sadly my state recently lost its way even though by any reasonable measure our reforms work the wisconsin courts struck them down we can only hope that wisconsin enacts a new medical liability reform act but until then we should pass the health act it will not only help wisconsin doctors and patients but those in every state facing a medical liability crisis this bill is statefriendly it does not preempt state reforms if a state like wisconsin has a cap on noneconomic damages whether that cap is higher or lower that cap will take effect more important it is doctorfriendly it is patientfriendly it will help us get a handle on at least a small portion of our health care costs it will encourage doctors to continue to practice in vital specialties and it will attack defensive medicine i urge support for the health act"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a few weeks ago the unitedstates department of commerce reported that our

have dividend income and 26 million taxpayers realize capital gains i think that shows how little they know about employee ownership in america of so many companies where people work so to dismiss out of hand as if no one benefits from these provisions is absolutely false and not to mention the effect of these investment tax reductions on our economy and what that means for peoples individual lives and their prosperity i spent some time earlier going through a number of statistics about how we have record unemployment record homeownership record productivity and so many indicators of strength in

come here and expect a handout and a free ride and now americans they are speaking out recently taxpayers in houston forked out over 125 million in hospital costs in just 1 year by treating more than 53 000 illegals taking advantage of the system in our hospitals taking advantage of americans and really taking advantage of legal immigrants it is morally wrong for illegals to enter this country with the expectation that they will live off of others it is morally wrong for them to expect that americans will pay to take care of them take care of their health costs their education costs and their social services costs but now it is becoming illegal for illegals to get these services that even many americans do not receive taxpayers are finding their own answers while some federal lawmakers in washington remain deaf to their desire because they are too busy dueling over illegal immigration doctrines state leaders are stepping in across the couhtry just this week in colorado lawmakers took a cue from their citizens by cutting through the conflict and passed 11 bipartisan bills taking a tougher stance on illegal entry just like houston illegals have been drawn to colorado like moths to a flame and like many states colorado has left the porch light on for them because they have bad laws that encourage illegal entry such as laws that protect employers that hire illegals providing illegals benefits that many americans do not receive such as unemployment grants and even medical care this may explain why half of colorados immigrants are illegal but those days may be over because now state legislators are aiming to flip the switch and turn out the lights and turn off the benefits that make being illegal so lucrative this week they passed 11 immigration bills including making people prove that they are legal residents of colorado in order to receive state and federal benefits that is a farreaching requirement which will require many of those 1 million people to prove that they are in the state legally to receive benefits without that proof they lose the benefits that americans have to pay for because americans always pay always pay for illegal entry illegals will lose unemployment checks grants to pay energy bills and even some public medical care and even applying for these perks means a monetary punishment to illegals they are also now busting business owners who until recently have left their own porch lights on guiding illegals their way in the name of a bigger bottom line those businesses who exploit illegals make a profit off of cheap labor but americans pick up the tab for all social services now they are going to lose a grip on that filthy lucre that they have gotten businesses that exploit those already living in the shadows of our society beyond the scope of federal work and wage regulations it will cost those illicit businesses money in the form of fines if they do not keep records proving that they hire only legal residents and while many americans do not turn out at the polls it seems some illegals find some way to vote in this country and now it is going to be a felony if they do so and while colorado
