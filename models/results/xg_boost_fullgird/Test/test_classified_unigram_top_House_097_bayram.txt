church of some 30 million souls for more than a generation the reach of this amazing prelates influence extended well beyond poland with the advent bf the papacy of john paul ii who at his inauguration indicated that it was because of his mentor wyszynski that the roman catholic church has its first polish pontiff 0 this symbol rept sents the time of day during the house proceedings e g o 1407 is 2 07 cardinal wyszynski spent much of his priestly life under the harsh anticlerical tyrannies of nazism and communism yet thanks to his brilliant leadership the polish catholic church today is far stronger than it was when he became primate of poland in 1949 in fact i believe it is fair to say that of the various current power centers in poland only the catholic church speaks for the vast majority of the polish people given what has transpired in postworld war ii poland that is a remarkable turn of events on a number of occasions during this period poland was rocked by domestic political troubles in each instance cardinal wyszynski played a pivotal role in the resolution of those problems primarily because he possessed the uncanny ability of knowing just when and how much to resist totalitarian rule and when to compromise without repudiating his principles adhering to those principles i might add cost him time in prison throughout that ordeal his paramount concern was that the church would never reject the will of its people for the better part of the last year the worlds attention has been riveted upon poland as we all know there have been moments when it appeared soviet intervention was imminent miraculously that has been avoided to date and much of the credit for that must go to cardinal wyszynski always able to keep things in perspective he skillfully served

unfortunate experience of imprisonment in soviet labor camps she said it all started in 1949 when her husband was arrested for being a member of a ukranian nationalist association and writing zamizdat the underground press he was sentenced to 30 years that began strokatakaravanskis long stuggle to secure freedom for her husband she petitioned the government and like her companion nadia svitlychny

for safety unfortunately it was to no avail for the police were not long in catching them no reason was given for strokatakaravanskis arrest but she is certain it stemmed from her fight on behalf of her husband she spent 4 years at the labor camp before being released in december 1975 four more years elapsed while she waited for her husband to complete his 30year term today after half a lifetime of waiting and hoping the two have been reunited and reside in the united states the most tragic thing about the story that unfolded in my office yesterday was that for every one of these examples of

thousands of innocent people whose only desire is a little freedom i would encourage my fellow members of congress to take the opportunity to seek out those individuals in their respective districts which have ethnic heritage and allow them through some mechanism to serve in an advisory capacity on both domestic and international issues my actions in the congress have benefited from the input i have received from my ethnic citizens advisory council and i am confident that many other members would benefit similarly while the united states must continue to speak out constructively for

is far stronger than it was when he became primate of poland in 1949 in fact i believe it is fair to say that of the various current power centers in poland only the catholic church speaks for the vast majority of the polish people given what has transpired in postworld war ii poland that is a remarkable turn of events on a number of occasions during this period poland was rocked by domestic political troubles in each instance cardinal wyszynski played a pivotal role in the resolution of those problems primarily because he possessed the uncanny ability of knowing just when and how much to resist totalitarian rule and when to compromise without repudiating his principles adhering to those principles i might add cost him time in prison throughout that ordeal his paramount concern was that the church would never reject the will of its people for the better part of the last year the worlds attention has been riveted upon poland as we all know there have been moments when it appeared
