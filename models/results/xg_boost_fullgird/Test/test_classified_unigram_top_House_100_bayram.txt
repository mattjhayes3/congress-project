negotiations with the soviet union relative to its presence in nicaragua it is a most fascinating letter signed on to by a large portion of the democratic leadership including the people who brought the bill to the floor the othl day that had provisions in it whiei would have committed our military to central america and to the nicaraguan problem for the first time but in this letter to the president they say some very fascinating things that i think the american people should reflect upon for example in this letter they are saying quite clearly that the nicaraguan communist government represents a real threat to unitedstates security they say at present the greatest danger of such a threatmeaning to central america in this case and they above say that the united states has valid security concerns in central america and then they say at present the greatest danger of such a threat is in nicaragua under the government of the sandinista junta then they go on to say some very interesting things for instance they make the point about the massive amount of soviet aid that is there including as they put it mi24 hind attack helicopters and then they make this statement there are also rumors of the construction of submarine bases and airfields capable of landing the largest bombers we know that that is more than rumor unless of course pictures of those bases are simply rumor because on this floor during the debate my colleague the gentleman from california actually showed this house pictures of the airfields pictures of the submarine bases it is more than rumor it is fact that is the problem that we are faced with anyhow they go on and they suggest to the president that what he ought to do is to negotiate the soviet presence out of nicaragua the problem with this letter is that it does not seem to recognize that those negotiations have already been under way and that the soviet union is not responding in a manner which helps our security interests i have here another letter this one from colin powell the national security adviser to the president who has pointqd out to us he wrote it to one of our colleagues the chairman of the subcommittee on europe and the middle east and he says in the letter president reagan raised the issue of nicaragua with the general secretary pointing out that continuing massive soviet supply of military equipment to the sandinista regime aggravates the situation in central america and constitutes another instance in which soviet actions in regional conflicts made unitedstates soviet relations more difficult secretary schultz pursued the same topic with the soviets in postsummit consultations in other words what this letter says is that there is an ongoing process of discussions taking place on the very topic that the democrats are saying open negotiations about i am surprised that they do not know what is really going on but let us go on in the letter because this is the problem mr powell goes on and points out the soviet position on the question is clear they propose to limit military assistance to the sandinistas to only small armswhich the general secretary characterized as police arms in exchange for unitedstates stopping its military assistance programs to the other nations of central america and to the nicaraguan democratic resistance this proposal needless to say is not congruent with our commitments to the central american democracies nor with our national interest its acceptance would leave the present dangerous sandinista military preponderance over its neighbors entirely intact moreover it would have us legitimize a dangerous extension of soviet power onto the mainland of the western hemisphere now the only thing that i can conclude is either the people who signed on to this letter are totally ignorant of the negotiations that are ongoing or they intend for us to accept the soviet proposal because i can come to no other interpretation of what they are saying to the president if in fact what they are saying is mr president accept what the soviets offer let us understand what that means it means the soviets would continue to send the small arms in ak47s for instance automatic rifles while we would send no aid whatsoever to the central american democracies what that would mean is that the guerrilla forces that have been funded and have been supported out of nicaragua would be able to get those ak47s to use against el salvador to use against guatemala to use against honduras to use against costa rica and those countries would not have any help to respond the soviets are saying let us send small arms we wont send tanks but we are going to send small arms but you send nothing is that really the deal that the democrats would have us sign on to i

above fiscal year 1987 levels and more than 1 2 billion above the administration request my colleagues will ask why a 300 million cut is the right amount to cut from the interior appropriations bill the response is that a 300 million reduction would reduce by one half the level of increase in appropriations from last year to this year except for the increase in the fillrate of the strategic petroleum reserve last year the congress approved 8 3 billion for the department of interior and related agencies appropriations bill as part of the omnibus continuing resolution this year the committee is recommending a 9 45 billion bill an increase of almost 1 2 billion if one sets aside the decision to provide 600 million in strategic reserve funds this leaves an increase in

happen in todays interest rate market is the rea going to go out and borrow private money to repay subsidized public funds of course not this 7 2 billion savings is no savings at all another

happen are twothirds of my colleagues in the house and twothirds of the members of the other body going to put their names on the line to6 override a presidential veto of a tax increase that is what it would take to raise 16 billion in taxes this year i dont think its going to happen finally the conference agreement reconciles only 4 billion of the 30 billion savings requiired for fiscal year

strikingly clear particularly in the northeast the decline of highelevation forests in vermont is well documented as is the acidification of hundreds of lakes throughout the northeast most recently sugar maple trees in vermont have been dying at an alarming rate acid rain is threatening to turn vermontthe green mountain state and the home of maple syrupinto the brown mountain state with sour syrup dead lakes and stunted trees despite the abundance of evidence vermonters are repeatedly told that more study is necessary but i dont think vermont sportsmen maple producers and outdoorsmen would agree and scientific experts dont either their message is the science does support the bill last august the epa released the preliminary results of its eastern lakes survey which showed startling new signs of damage in the east over 1 000 lakes are dead and over 4 000 lakes have virtually no buffering capacity left to neutralize acid rain the presitigious national academy of sciences has found a direct link between sulfur dioxide emissions and acid rain damage in a march 1986 report the nas concluded that a casual relationship exists between so2 emissions and acidification of lakes in the admirondacks research conducted by the unitedstates forest service made public at a senate envionment and public works committee hearing last december turned up alarming declines in growth through the southeastern united states in yellow pines an important commercial species the regional survey of southern pine stands found growth reductions of 40 to 50 percent over the last 20 years this study is significant for two critically important reasons first it illustrates that acid rain is not exclusively a northeastern problem florida lakes and southern appalachian forest are dying while fragile alpine environments in the west are also threatened second this study is especially significant because it illustrates the economic costs of not acting to reduce acid rain opponents of the bill complain loudly about the cost of reducing emissions but they ignore the costs of inaction forest decline could have a devastating economic impact on the forest products industry in the east in addition a draft study prepared by epa brookhaven national laboratory and the army corps of engineers estimated that materials damage to statues monuments and historical buildings may be as high as 6 billion per year if congress weighs the costs of action against the costs of inaction i am confident that congress will move expeditiously and favorably on this legislation after 4 years and a number of approaches we have finally developed an acid rain bill which can pass the house of representatives h r 4567 as approved by the health and environment subcommittee will mandate the emissions reductions necessary to curb acid rain and it will give the states maximum flexibility in achieving these emissions reductions this bill has several advantages the first is flexibility the bill mandates tough new statewide average emissions standards for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide the governor of each state will have the flexibility to choose from a wide array of options to meet this statewide emissions standard the bill does not mandate scrubbers in many states switching from highsulfur to lowsulfur coal will be sufficient to meet the emissions standard by providing this flexibility h r 4567 will promote leastcost methods of meeting emissions standards and saving ratepayers millions of dollars the flexibility of h r 4567 also allows governors concerned about the loss of highsulfur coal jobs to preserve these jobs the second criterion is ratepayer protection the bill would create a pollution control trust fund with a small fee on fossil fuel power produced in or imported into the untied states this trust fund would be used to cap residential rate increases attributable to the bill to no more than 10 percent this fee would increase the average residential customers monthly rate by an average of only 25 to 50 cents per month the inclusion of this provision in the bill illustrates the willingness of the sponsors to reduce to the extent possible the regional inequity in rate impacts the third and most important criterion large and meaningful reductions recent scientific evidence suggests that reductions of sulfur dioxide alone is not enough to ensure the future protection of our forests lakes and streams in addition to a 10millionton reduction in sulfur dioxide our bill requires a 4millionton reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions nitrogen oxide is a precursor of ozone which has been linked to forest decline and crop damage in numerous studies nitrogen oxide emissions will be reduced by tightening emissions standards on cars and trucks the tough emissions reductions contained in h r 4567 will insure that our forests lakes and streams do not meet a fate similar to those in europe this is the year for acid rain legislation this approach has been endorsed by a wide range of groups including the new england governors conference it has also been strongly endorsed by the league of women voters the league of conservation voters

whether or not more ought to be done at this particular time in the prevention role we believe that the substitute which does a great deal to try to expand the protection of existing workers and prevent the kind of problems which we have been talking about today is much superior in that regard we do a number of things in our amendment which help the present workers we expand the coverage under osha to take in other areas to include thousands if not millions of workers in the transportation and the mining industries we also upgrade the z tables that is those tables which were established some time ago which have not been upgraded a list of those hazardous chemicals about which we are concerned here today we give the secretary authority to do that there are only 400 on that list today and there could be thousands on there after that is done we employ training to ensure that the workers in the plant and the employers know how to deal with the problems of occupational diseases and their causes the secretary is required to recommend monitoring when it is essential depending on the type of exposure we create the office of hazard communications in order to deal with a serious problem and ensure that we provide maximum protection to our workers present and future we do a great deal h r 162 all it does is by threat of litigation ask the employer to be so scared that he might do something we require him to do it under the regulatory process we also are concerned about the prior workers and our proposal has significant advantages over notification that is the im

the whole federal program and that program cannot go into effect for 2 years why not take that group of workers we already know who they are some hundred thousand that we know the kind of exposure they have had we know that they are being subjected to possible disease notify them and do it in a way that will be respon sible with the employers concerned and with the workers help them find out whether or not they do have a problem we would have those notices out in a matter of months we have to wait 2 years under this other bill before the first notice goes out with all of the new bureaucracies created and the unnecessary steps which have to be gone through in view of the niosh studies which have already been done this substitute has the tremendous support of the administration

begin negotiations with the soviet union relative to its presence in nicaragua it is a most fascinating letter signed on to by a large portion of the democratic leadership including the people who brought the bill to the floor the othl day that had provisions in it whiei would have committed our military to central america and to the nicaraguan problem for the first time but in this letter to the president they say some very fascinating things that i think the american people should reflect upon for example in this letter they are saying quite clearly that the nicaraguan communist government represents a real threat to unitedstates security they say at present the greatest danger of such a threatmeaning to central america in this case and they above say that the united states has valid security concerns in central america and then they say at present the greatest danger of such a threat is in nicaragua under the government of the sandinista junta then they go on to say some very interesting things for instance they make the point about the massive amount of soviet aid that is there including as they put it mi24 hind attack helicopters and then they make this statement there are also rumors of the construction of submarine bases and airfields capable of landing the largest bombers we know that that is more than rumor unless of course pictures of those bases are simply rumor because on this floor during the debate my colleague the gentleman from california actually showed this house pictures of the airfields pictures of the submarine bases it is more than rumor it is fact that is the problem that we are faced with anyhow they go on and they suggest to the president that what he ought to do is to negotiate the soviet presence out of nicaragua the problem with this letter is that it does not seem to recognize that those negotiations have already been under way and that the soviet union is not responding in a manner which helps our security interests i have here another letter this one from colin powell the national security adviser to the president who has pointqd out to us he wrote it to one of our colleagues the chairman of the subcommittee on europe and the middle east and he says in the letter president reagan raised the issue of nicaragua with the general secretary pointing out that continuing massive soviet supply of military equipment to the sandinista regime aggravates the situation in central america and constitutes another instance in which soviet actions in regional conflicts made unitedstates soviet relations more difficult secretary schultz pursued the same topic with the soviets in postsummit consultations in other words what this letter says is that there is an ongoing process of discussions taking place on the very topic that the democrats are saying open negotiations about i am surprised that they do not know what is really going on but let us go on in the letter because this is the problem mr powell goes on and points out the soviet position on the question is clear they propose to limit military assistance to the sandinistas to only small armswhich the general secretary characterized as police arms in exchange for unitedstates stopping its military assistance programs to the other nations of central america and to the nicaraguan democratic resistance this proposal needless to say is not congruent with our commitments to the central american democracies nor with our national interest its acceptance would leave the present dangerous sandinista military preponderance over its neighbors entirely intact moreover it would have us legitimize a dangerous extension of soviet power onto the mainland of the western hemisphere now the only thing that i can conclude is either the people who signed on to this letter are totally ignorant of the negotiations that are ongoing or they intend for us to accept the soviet proposal because i can come to no other interpretation of what they are saying to the president if in fact what they are saying is mr president accept what the soviets offer let us understand what that means it means the soviets would continue to send the small arms in ak47s for instance automatic rifles while we would send no aid whatsoever to the central american democracies what that would mean is that the guerrilla forces that have been funded and have been supported out of nicaragua would be able to get those ak47s to use against el salvador to use against guatemala to use against honduras to use against costa rica and those countries would not have any help to respond the soviets are saying let us send small arms we wont send tanks but we are going to send small arms but you send nothing is that really the deal

amount would still be nearly 900 million above fiscal year 1987 levels and more than 1 2 billion above the administration request my colleagues will ask why a 300 million cut is the right amount to cut from the interior appropriations bill the response is that a 300 million reduction would reduce by one half the level of increase in appropriations from last year to this year except for the increase in the fillrate of the strategic petroleum reserve last year the congress approved 8 3 billion for the department of interior and related agencies appropriations bill as part of the omnibus continuing resolution this year the committee is recommending a 9 45 billion bill an increase of almost 1 2 billion if one sets aside the decision to provide 600 million in strategic reserve funds this leaves an increase in discretionary spending of approximately 600 million the amendment i am offering would cut this increase in half i believe my amendment is necessary to compensate for the

this is not going to happen in todays interest rate market is the rea going to go out and borrow private money to repay subsidized public funds of course not this 7 2 billion savings is no savings at all another assumption is that congress is going to raise nearly 20 billion in taxes this year the conference agreement assumes that 1988 revenues will be in the range of 932 billion is this really going to happen are twothirds of my colleagues in the house and twothirds of the members of the other body going to put their names on the line to6 override a presidential veto of a tax increase that is what it would take to raise 16 billion in taxes this year i dont think its going to happen finally the conference agreement reconciles only 4 billion of the 30 billion savings requiired for fiscal year 1988 my colleagues know that the amount of unreconciled savings slips and slips and slips through the budget process is this year going to be any different i dont think so mr chairman i think it is clear that we have nearly 30 billion in furmy money in the budget resolution in order to reduce this funny money a bipartisan group of members have gotten together and agreed that congress needs to make the tough choices to achieve real deficit reduction our goal is to reduce this funny money by around one half or 15 billion this works out to be a need for approximately a 300 million reduction

meat ax approach well weve tried the scalpelweve tried to make careful measured cuts in programs weve tried to work with members of the committee to achieve 300 million in reductions but our efforts

of impeachment based on the extensive record of his corrupt conduct the constitution itself establishes that impeachment and indictment are two separate and distinct proceedings conduct which may not be specifically criminal but which is harmful to the integrity of institutions of government is well within the ambit of the impeachment remedy moreover impeachment serves a fundamentally different

strikingly clear particularly in the northeast the decline of highelevation forests in vermont is well documented as is the acidification of hundreds of lakes throughout the northeast most recently sugar maple trees in vermont have been dying at an alarming rate acid rain is threatening to turn vermontthe green mountain state and the home of maple syrupinto the brown mountain state with sour syrup dead lakes and stunted trees despite the abundance of evidence vermonters are repeatedly told that more study is necessary but i dont think vermont sportsmen maple producers and outdoorsmen would agree and scientific experts dont either their message is the science does support the bill last august the epa released the preliminary results of its eastern lakes survey which showed startling new signs of damage in the east over 1 000 lakes are dead and over 4 000 lakes have virtually no buffering capacity left to neutralize acid rain the presitigious national academy of sciences has found a direct link between sulfur dioxide emissions and acid rain damage in a march 1986 report the nas concluded that a casual relationship exists between so2 emissions and acidification of lakes in the admirondacks research conducted by the unitedstates forest service made public at a senate envionment and public works committee hearing last december turned up alarming declines in growth through the southeastern united states in yellow pines an important commercial species the regional survey of southern pine stands found growth reductions of 40 to 50 percent over the last 20 years this study is significant for two critically important reasons first it illustrates that acid rain is not exclusively a northeastern problem florida lakes and southern appalachian forest are dying while fragile alpine environments in the west are also threatened second this study is especially significant because it illustrates the economic costs of not acting to reduce acid rain opponents of the bill complain loudly about the cost of reducing emissions but they ignore the costs of inaction forest decline could have a devastating economic impact on the forest products industry in the east in addition a draft study prepared by epa brookhaven national laboratory and the army corps of engineers estimated that materials damage to statues monuments and historical buildings may be as high as 6 billion per year if congress weighs the costs of action against the costs of inaction i am confident that congress will move expeditiously and favorably on this legislation after 4 years and a number of approaches we have finally developed an acid rain bill which can pass the house of representatives h r 4567 as approved by the health and environment subcommittee will mandate the emissions reductions necessary to curb acid rain and it will give the states maximum flexibility in achieving these emissions reductions this bill has several advantages the first is flexibility the bill mandates tough new statewide average emissions standards for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide the governor of each state will have the flexibility to choose from a wide array of options to meet this statewide emissions standard the bill does not mandate scrubbers in many states switching from highsulfur to lowsulfur coal will be sufficient to meet the emissions standard by providing this flexibility h r 4567 will promote leastcost methods of meeting emissions standards and saving ratepayers millions of dollars the flexibility of h r 4567 also allows governors concerned about the loss of highsulfur coal jobs to preserve these jobs the second criterion is ratepayer protection the bill would create a pollution control trust fund with a small fee on fossil fuel power produced in or imported into the untied states this trust fund would be used to cap residential rate increases attributable to the bill to no more than 10 percent this fee would increase the average residential customers monthly rate by an average of only 25 to 50 cents per month the inclusion of this provision in the bill illustrates the willingness of the sponsors to reduce to the extent possible the regional inequity in rate impacts the third and most important criterion large and meaningful reductions recent scientific evidence suggests that reductions of sulfur dioxide alone is not enough to ensure the future protection of our forests lakes and streams in addition to a 10millionton reduction in sulfur dioxide our bill requires a 4millionton reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions nitrogen oxide is a precursor of ozone which has been linked to forest decline and crop damage in numerous studies nitrogen oxide emissions will be reduced by tightening emissions standards on cars and trucks the tough emissions reductions contained in h r 4567 will insure that our forests lakes and streams do not meet a fate similar to those in europe this is the year for acid rain legislation this approach has been endorsed by a wide range of groups including the new england governors conference it has also been strongly endorsed by the league of women voters the league of conservation voters
