in time of crisis i would also like to thank my friend and colleague mr bobby scott for working with me to bring the best possible bill to the floor today finally allow me to thank sarah hamlett who put in countless hours to make this bill a reality today we have an opportunity to take important action that will encourage the natural altruism and patriotism that americans have repeatedly demonstrated in times of crisis in the past 5 years our nation has seen two great disasters one at the 1h5243 july i7 206 hands of terrorists and one at the hands of mother nature in both cases americans responded with a tremendous outpouring of compassion lending their time skills and dollars to a range of charitable organizations in response to both 9 11 and hurricane katrina the thousands of civil aviators who make up angel flight america stood ready to serve and indeed played a major role in the disaster response flying over 150 missions following 9 11 and more than 2 200 missions in response to katrina these pilots led an aviation disaster response second only to that of the unitedstates military but providing a coordinated aviation response during national emergencies is only a part of the underlying mission for most nonprofit volunteer organizations their most common mission is to provide emergency medical transportation services for needy families each year volunteer pilots transport hundreds of people with lifethreatening illnesses thousands of miles in order to receive specialized medical attention as well as transporting patients in remote locations who would otherwise be unable to receive care yet despite the importance of their mission these organizations have been left out of the volunteer protection act in its current form this legislation addressds this mission by amending the volunteer protection act to include organizations such as angel flight so they may continue to fulfill their mission and provide a critical service for needy families seeking specialized medical attention it is important to note that i have worked closely with congressman scott to ensure that this legislation does not shield pilots from liability in instances of criminal misconduct or gross negligence instead this legislation provides nonprofit volunteer pilot organizations the security they need to grow and expand their mission to more parts of our country

hero i spoke with sergeant weirs mother and father 2 days ago lynn and jackie weir and it is just extraordinary to me that there are families in this country that love freedom so much love our country so much that even in the most grief and sadness they could ever imagine or experience a hundred percent believe in the mission the service the sacrifice of their own son to defend liberty for our nation lynn weir told me that if he would have tried and he didnt to keep his son from going he could not have kept his son from going he said david weir from the time he was a little boy wanted to serve his country in uniform he was a member of the 101st airborne this was his career this was his way of life he leaves a wife behind alison a little 18monthold son gavin who does not understand what has happened but everyone else knows very clearly what has happened a great american patriot died doing what he wanted to do which was to stand in harms way on behalf of our civilian population as the greatest generation did as other generations have been called to at a time when there is a very real and imminent threat to our way of life called the islamic jihadists and sergeant weir goes to heaven leaves this earth as others have in the most sacrificial way answering the scriptural call that says no greater love hath any man than to lay down his life for his friends and i say to

his life a sacrificial life of service to others putting everyone else above himself believing in his mission and his comrades his father said he talked to him the day before and he was so excited about getting out in the streets of baghdad because he didnt want to be sitting behind a desk because that was not what he was trained to do that was not what he volunteered to do that was not what he was prepared to do he did what he went there to do and it cost him his life and while his parents grieve our state and our nation stand united i believe in their full appreciation of his life and his sacrifice and his extraordinary courage and bravery on monday this coming monday i am honored to be with the family in chattanooga tennessee with full military honors as we lay him to rest in the

my tribute and our honor on the house floor tonight of these great american patriots who volunteered to serve our country and make their life secondary to ours he wrote me and said if we could only get the truth communicated to the public they would know we have made great strides here in iraq weekly we are transferring responsibility for the security ih many provinces and another one was transferred yesterday and cities back to the iraqi military while certain people want to say it is a civil war i want to tell you firsthand it is more about islamic jihadists crossing over the borders they continue to attempt to disrupt a young emerging democracy the insurgents are capitalizing on the inexperience of this government and directly causing the sectarian violence and socalled fueling the fire they get more and more strength and resolve when they hear the discourse in our country they know it is only a matter of time before we give up because we perceive the war in iraq is too difficult we all know anything worthwhile is not easy freedom is not free the iraqis are trying to make itwork if we retreat the terrorists win they win now and they win in the future when they have a safe haven to plan train and operate and attack us again it is our choice we are either going to support our efforts to win the global war on terror or we are going to support those that want to retreat inside our borders and wait for the next attack we found out on 9 11 if we retreat they attack finally why did we go to iraq ask yourself why did we fight germany in world war 11 japan attacked us not germany the same principle applies we couldnt take the chance then and we cant now those that say otherwise are sympathizing with the enemy that is from lieutenant colonel brett hale to me on the ground in iraq what a patriot as he says the word is not getting out in this country in a fair way of the progress that we are mak ing as general casey said if we leave they will follow us home these threats are real i have been down here 4 weeks in a row as i have been in washington to try to go through the severity of these real threats around the world and the fact that the jihadists are spreading like wildfire through europe read the book while europe slept read the book londonstan you will know that through the mosques there is a radicalization under way even the pope cant speak of it because it is not politically correct to say that fanaticism in religion is not good for the world it ought to be obvious regardless of what the religion is or how many there are or what is politically correct fanaticism does lead to holy wars and the crusades and we dont want that we want the mullahs and the ayatollahs to condemn suicide bombings we want peace and security for the world we want our allies to have a backbone and stand up and acknowledge the threat we want our president to go to the united nations and say we cant appease other countries we have to stand behind security for all and freedom for people and liberty everywhere we are all amazed in this country that from our own hemisphere to the south the president of venezuela comes to our country and says this hugo chavez is his name in this country we call each other out of respect even the people who just spoke whom i couldnt disagree with more the people who just spoke are all talking politics they are all interested in the next election not frankly the future of our country and preserving liberty and standing up and meeting the challenge of this generation it is all for them about 47 days from now in an election instead of i believe in my gut standing up and protecting our country but despite that because we are decent reasonable we call them honorable we call each other honorable regardless of whether we agree or not i have got to tell you what the president of venezuela did in this country yesterday was dishonorable it dishonored his nation it dishonors the people of his nation it dishonors everyone south of here in our hemisphere because what it does is it causes people in this country not to trust or even like people who come into this country and say what president hugo chavez said yesterday he said this the devil was here yesterday it still smells of sulfur around here he added he said the president of the united states the gentleman to whom i refer as the devil came here talking as if he owned the world truly as the owner of the world i think we could call a psychiatrist to analyze yesterdays statement made by the president of the united states as the spokesman of imperialism he came to share his nostrums to try to preserve the current pattern of domination exploitation and pillage of the peoples of the world he said the president of the united states came to talk to the peoplesto the peoples of world what would those peoples of the world tell him if they were given the floor i think i have some inkling of what the peoples of the south the oppressed peoples think they would say yankee imperialist go home i have the feeling dear world dictator that you are going to live the rest of your days as a nightmare because the rest of us are standing up all those who are rising up against american imperialism who are shouting for equality for respect for the sovereignty of nations this was the president of venezuela in our country saying this and let us praise a democrat in this house named charlie rangel whom i seldom agree with but boy do i appreciate his patriotism in defense of our country and its traditions when he said this today he said you do not come into my country my congressional district and you do not condemn my president if there is any criticism of president bush it should be restricted to americans whether they voted for him or not i just want to make it abundantly clear to hugo chavez or any other president do not come to the united states and think because we have problems with our president that any foreigner can come to our country and not think that americans do not feel offended when you offend our commander in chief thank you charlie rangel for being an honorable democrat who stands united at this time of war hugo chavez is a troublemaker in a big way he wants to work with iranian president ahmadinejad i watched his interview last night on anderson cooper and he calmly looked anderson cooper in the eyes and he gave a very warped view of history not even willing to acknowledge that the holocaust took place completely in denial you would have to wonder where in the world he gets his facts or his view of the world this is a troubling time in american history i say to young people everywhere i go the days ahead will be very very difficult we need to be honest with them about this but the character of this great nation was born out of the sacrifices the courage and the willingness to face these challenges of our grandparents and our greatgrand7 parents the greatest generation they are the standard for stepping up to meeting global challenges and they gave us our character we didnt get our character by the big buildings or wall street or wealth or even military power we got it by sacrifice and dedication and commitment and family and they are the standard they didnt cower or retreat from these challenges they stood up they faced them head on they showed us what it took to preserve freedom and extend it from one generation to the next and we must do the same thing we must come together as a nation i hate it that we are in the middle of this political campaign while we are at war because it is not good for us to say the things we say even on the floor of this house it is not good for lieutenant colonel hale and others to look back here and see the potshots being fired i hate it that over half of the democrats in the senate voted to remove saddam hussein by force and almost half of the democrats voted and now they all say it was a mistake let me tell you there has never been a pretty war never there has never been one perfectly executed and you do not remove a genocidal mass murderer with a picnic it is ugly and a brand new democracy takes a while to develop and it is tough tough but thank goodness that men and women in uniform will volunteer to go serve and carry out this tough mission and extend liberty from one generation to the next these are

just trying to come up with better drugs and the latest surgery techniques to treat complicated illness is not enough we really need to focus on preventive care you are talking about in the last few minutes of course your specialty in talking about mental illness and as it relates also to childhood obesity and i could not help but think as i was listening to your discussion and as you know this week we just passed h r 554 h r 554 is the personal responsibility in food consumption act of 2005 this is a bill my colleagues are aware of the fact it would not allow someone to sue a fast food manuficturer because they have gorged themselves with a multiple number of big macs or any other kind of fast food or sometimes what we refer to as junk food it is not the fault of the food industry i used a little analogy when i was talking about this on the floor yesterday in discussing the rule of my belt which is a size 36 that is i hate to admit the size of my waist but if i wanted really out of blind pride to suggest that i had a 24inch waist and i cinched that belt down a couple of notches in doing so i put pressure compression on something referred to as the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve it would result in a condition of numbness and lack of feeling on the anterior thigh then should i go out and sue the belt company because they are at fault because i misused a product this is what this bill of course is all about a commonsense type bill parenthetically i also want to mention the gentleman from florida the author of the bill our good friend and colleague is actually in the hospital now and recovering hopefully from a fairly minor condition but we want to pay tribute to him i kno he is proud that we passed this bill this week the comment that i wanted to make is this issue of personal responsibility and parents should have that personal responsibility obviously in the way they conduct themselves in regard to how they eat and a healthy diet and exercise but even more importantly is the responsibility that they have to give a good example and instructioi to their children i think it is probably the worst form of child abuse to let these youngsters that at a very early age overeat and become obese you have talked about the issue of poor mental image selfimage and of course i also see you talked about hollywood and of course this issue of there is no such thing as mental illness i think probably they might predominate in some of those diseases which we categorize as mental illness but quite honestly when a child goes to school and there is this emphasis on thinness and you see these youngsters wearing these britney spears jeans and that sort of thing a child even a little bit overweight and certainly one that is significantly obese of course they are going to have a poor image of themselves they are going to withdraw and they are going to become shy it is very likely they are going to be picked on how in the world can they grow and develop with a healthy selfimage no wonder they end up needing to be counseled and treated by the gentleman from pennsylvania and other mental health care specialists yes unfortunately some even go on to harm themselves and possibly even commit suicide so i guess the most important thing that i would want to say as a physician member is that we need to prevent this we need to make sure that parents get the message that they have an obligation not just to take care of themselves but first and foremost to take care of these precious children that they bring into the world it is their responsibility to make sure that they are from the very beginning when they start eating at the table to make sure that they are healthy and stay healthy so you do not have to have them ending up in your office treating them for not only mental illness but also the many complications of obesity you mentioned them you mentioned diabetes high blood pressure so many things and talk about the cost to this health care system of ours we always talk about waste fraud and abuse in the medicare and the medicaid programs and wanting to eliminate that and we are very diligent and will continue to be so

house of representatives passed the child safety and violent crime reduction act of 2005 and i am a strong supporter of the legi slation i hail its passage but title vi of this legislation is drawn from a bill that i introduced in the first session of the 109th congress my legislation is known as the child pornography prevention act of 2005 and as the title states the intent of my legislation is to prevent american chjldren from becoming victims of pornography every one of us knows that the fuel that fires the wicked hearts of child predators is child pornography and it must be confronted in america every day in this country children are sadly exploited in pornographic enterprises sometimes b those closest to them believe it or not in their homes sometimes by commercial producers in the home children are forced to pose for pornographic pictures or act in pornographic videos sometimes by family members and even friends and caretakers and other trusted individuals sadly our resources in the law enforcement community inform us that these pictures and videos are posted on the internet or surreptitiously spread to sexual predators in the commercial arena and in hollywood as our cultures become more and more youth oriented and sex has become more and more prevalent we must ensure that children are not being used in the production of prurient material and provide law enforcement with the tools to prosecute those who exploit children a main tenet of my legislation is the language that will fix a technicality known as home pornographers to get at the first problem that i just described home pornographers have used this loophole to evade federal prosecution in child pornography cases these individuals will use digital cameras polaroid cameras video cameras to make pornographic images of children download them and distributethem on the internet my legislation first and foremost makes it clear that federal prosecutions of home pornographers may proceed in federal court because their activities impact on interstate commerce another element of my bill which has become in many ways more controversial is the addition of a new section of the criminal code section 2257a which adds a recordkeeping requirement that will force people in even in the entertainment industry to keep records of the names and ages of their subjects along with proof of their identification when they are engaged even in simulated sexual activity on screen anytime hollywood uses a simulated sex act in a soap opera a cable television show a movie or other production a record must be kept to show that a child was not used even in the creation of a simulated sex act heretofore the law has only required that such records be kept in the cases of hardcore pornography where actual sex was being performed and recorded for entertainment value but if a child is used in a simulated sex act the impact of such abuse on that child is in many ways just as real as it would be had the production involved actual sexual contact therefore my bill require these records be kept for simulated sex because by doing so certain bad actors in the entertainment industry will be deterred from using children also my bill goes a step further by requiring that records be kept even in the case of what is known as lascivious exhibition once again no child should be used in either nude pictures or sexually explicit materials or even in activities that have a prurient interest this is again the type of images that fuel the flames of the wicked hearts of child predators and should be stopped finally the legislation expands the ability of investigators and prosecutors to pursue the people who are used to distribute child pornography these distributors also will be required to follow these new recordkeeping provisions and this will provide law enforcement with a powerful tool against them as well providing law enforcement with the tools to combat child pornography contained in my legislation is a muchneeded and overdue step that must be taken to protect our children from those in society who have no decency and no shame i also commend those legitimate producers of entertainment products in the united states of america with whom we have had dialogue and with whom we have worked in the development of this legislation it is not my purpose in any way to suggest that those that are involved in the legitimate entertainment industry in this country have anything to do with the illegitimate industry that is pornography in america nevertheless it is important that even in main street hollywood america that we ensure that children are not used even in the creation of entertainment materials that simulate sex acts and our legislation will create the

for concern so if we trust dubai ports world on the first crucial half of a cargo transactionthe loadingwhy would we not trust the company to be involved in unitedstates cargo operations in a strictly management capacity nonetheless the company has moved forward to sell the operations to a unitedstates buyer dpw announced yesterday it has retained credible wellknown legal and financial firms to handle this transaction the company has agreed to abide by a voluntary commitment to hold unitedstates ports separate until the sale is complete and still it seems that its not enough i would ask what more would we have dpw do when will this be dead enough to satisfy the unitedstates congress the action i am sad to say sends exactly the wrong message to the world about the climate for international businesses in the united states it sends the wrong message about our willingness to engage in transactions that create growth and jobs here at home it tells the world that we are an unreliable trading partner while we are sometimes obsessed with the socalled outsourcing of american jobs abroad why are we not similarly concerned about our ability to insource jobs through foreign direct investment moving to the military aspect of our relationship with dubai today we may blatantly insult a moderate arab ally that has generously allowed the use of its port and airfield facilities for our military general peter pace chairman of the joint chiefs of staff has called the unitedstates military relationship with the uae superb dubai provides servicing and port security that is good enough for the unitedstates navy i worry how that relationship will proceed in the future and i believe that this entire affair will end up as diplomatic disaster for the united states throughout the moderate middle east lawrence lindsey recently wrote in the wall street journal the uae isnt any old arab country it sits astride the strait of hormuz through which a fifth of world oil passes iran sits on the other side from a global perspective efforts by the unitedstates congress to alienate the ijae at this time look about as sensible as russian roulette there are many other respected voices who have spoken to the economic security and global issues raised in this controversy robert samuelson the renowned economist wrote recently in the washington post about how this action will damage american interests in addition to the damage done to our relationship with the uae and other allies in the middle east samuelson holds the view that it has weakened worldwide confidence in the dollar samuelson concludes every country has the right to protect its security interests but those interests must be defined coherently and not simply as the random expression of political expediency james glassman of the american enterprise institute testified before a financial services sulcommittee our ties through trade in fact have made us more safe as our trading partners become more prosperous open and democratic but our politicians and pundits should know that we cant pick and choose if we decide to deny firms from developing nationsarab asian or otherwisefrom investing in the united states those firms will go elsewhere and we will pay the pricein higher interest rates higher mortgage rates higher inflation lower stock prices less participation in a world growing more and more creative and exciting since world war ii the united states has enjoyed economic growth and an increase in economic standard of living that has never before been achieved in world history this has gone handinhand with our values of democracy and freedom of thought we have watched other nations fail because they were too closed either economically or politically or both one of the critical factors in our stunning success has been free trade and the free movement of capital throughout the world i cant say it any better than thomas friedman who wrote people across the world still look to our example of pluralism which is like no other if we go dark ages if we go down the road of pitchforkwielding xenophobes then the whole world will go dark ages there is a poison loose today and americaamerica at its bestis the only antidote thats why it is critical that we stand by our principles of free trade and welcome the world to do business in our land as long as there is no security threat this is a feelgood vote in the heat of the moment that i think the house will live to regret its time for us to decide whether we are going to continually respond to 9 11 with a reactive fear or whether were going to move forward and engage tlhe world with confidence today i will vote for the latter"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "well it is refreshing to hear about good things going on in iraq of course we know that some have been concerned a civil war may be breaking out over there but the truth is what this boils down to is they have been finding with the ieds these explosive devices that have been killing now both iraqis and americans that that hasnt worked they have seen we have a president with firm resolve that we are going to stay the course and make sure the country is ready to stand on its own and then let her stand so they realized they were not being successful in that regard so a lastditch effort you have terrorists from other areas coming in and blowing up their own precious mosques to try to turn shia against sunni it is obvious that this is a lastditch effort to try to divide the country because it scares a lot of folks over there greatly to think about a democracy succeeding right in the heart of the middle east i mean that could spread to iran boy that scares iran it could spread to syria there are a number of countries over there that it scares them because democracy as the president has said could change things and those folks are right on each others borders if i could take you back to 1973 between my sophomore and junior year in college i was an exchange student in the former soviet union back then we didnt call it the former soviet union it was the soviet union and i spent asummer there and associated with and dealt with college students there in ukraine where i was and i developed a number of friends one of whom was an engineering student a smart guy he spoke a little better english than i did russian well a lot better english than i did russian we had some wonderful conversations very frank veryhonest discussions and at one point he was saying you americans seem to not understand why we would cling to communism but it is the best thing we have ever had we have had two major wars on our own soil and we have had to divert most everything to defense just to protect ourselves as he pointed out you on the other hand you have got two major oceans protecting the east and the west think about that that is profound and that is something that will be written about the united states hundreds of years from now when someone writes about the rise and fall of the greatest nation in the history of the world that we had two major oceans now i would say that is a blessing from god that is what has allowed this nation to be nourished and to grow without much threat of intervention from other countries because they had to cross two major oceans to get here the thing that concerns me is finding out we are potentially allowing footholds on our own soil we are giving up an advantage i didnt realize we had other foreign countries managing leasing utilizing avenues of entry in our ports but now we have one transaction that is up right now with the uae the united arab emirates as some have pointed out the uae has been our friend since 9 11 and that is interesting in and of itself but there is a transaction in question that has stirred up much of america for them to purchase or lease terminals at six of our ports so i think it bears looking into if this goes through of course they would be handling shipping arrivals departures unloading at the dock and other security sensitive functions yes we would still have our coast guard yes we would still have american customs at work some of us are aware that they do not always catch everything we are a little sarcastic sometimes in texas but they may have containers sitting on their docks for a number of days they will necessarily be aware of the manner in which our government inspects containers how it selects the maybe 5 to 6 percent that it actually xrays how it goes about selecting which container will be one of themaybe 1 percent that they actually examine the current administration has looked at the issue and seems surprised that americans are really upset about the issue and i want to say about this president he is the first president in at least 30 years to take seriously the threat of a foreign government i know i was in the united states army at fort benning georgia back when the united states soil was attacked and americans were taken hostage that is an act of war under international law you attack somebodys embassy as ours was attacked in iran it is an act of war and it justifies defending yourself and we did nothing we begged them to let them go and then later because of a lack of leadership here in washington there was a failed rescue attempt that embarrassed us even further but it sent a message that perhaps we do not have the stomach we cannot handle these things perhaps if we had had an administration in washington 30 years ago that took care of business when we were attacked we would not be worrying about these issues now but it did not and so we do some say well since the uae is one of three nations to have recognized the taliban as an official government that that gives them concern as it should there are indications that the uae also saw an opportunity for making money and so apparently there were al qaeda moneys that flowed through uae systems but this administration has done more to fight terrorism abroad than any perhaps in history this terrorism is a relatively new phenomenon for our young country but we have not done so well at home and so it bears looking at even more closely we need legal immigration we need people legally coming across the border willing to work most all of us were a result of immigrants even being here it is a good thing if you are willing to work but we need to secure our borders so terrorists do not come in now since there is a war going on near our unitedstates border at our unitedstates border and some of us believe there have been insufficient efforts by the federal government to intervene and help our sheriffs and those that are trying to fight that war it gets even more critical i personally do not believe that this great nation should be contracting out any rights to manage operate use"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "well for some additional comments on that before we move to our policy debate i think you make excellent points i want to congratulate you for your initiative on this matter but i also know this is not a new initiative for you when you were a mayor of kansas city it was something that you were very dedicated to a lot of coalition building a lot of talking across the aisle or talking with maybe unnatural partners that you would not naturally see could be your allies and i think that you know we know and i know that when we go to our committees and when we go home or when we are in different arenas with our follow members republican or detnocrat we can get a lot done when we are not on screen or when we are not a talking head on a 60second campaign or television ad i think that the american public has sort of lost faith that maybe we can accomplish things we know that things get done i think that what we are running the risk of and you mentioned collateral damage what we run the risk of is losing the ear of the american public not only are they not bringing their children to the television to listen to what we are talking about they are turning us off because they cannot find the truth in what we are saying because we overexaggerate or we try to disparage peoples character or lose respect in our arguments i think if we lose the attention of the american public we run the risk of an apathetic country that no longer cares or has faith in their leadership to be able to cut through and cut to the chase and lead so i think we are not alone in the congress there is a center aisle caucus that was put together with republicans and democrats together to try to solve this problem but i am really pleased that tonight we

develop badly needed parliamentary infrastructures to foster just and thriving civil society based upon democratic principles in his second inaugural address president bush issued a global call to freedom the heritage of all mankind through the commission members of congress have answered the presidents call to move the principles of democracy around the world and beginning next year democratic

honor a great american hero i spoke with sergeant weirs mother and father 2 days ago lynn and jackie weir and it is just extraordinary to me that there are families in this country that love freedom so much love our country so much that even in the most grief and sadness they could ever imagine or experience a hundred percent believe in the mission the service the sacrifice of their own son to defend liberty for our nation lynn weir told me that if he would have tried and he didnt to keep his son from going he could not have kept his son from going he said david weir from the time he was a little boy wanted to serve his country in uniform he was a member of the 101st airborne this was his career this was his way of life he leaves a wife behind alison a little 18monthold son gavin who does not understand what has happened but everyone else knows very clearly what has happened a great american patriot died doing what he wanted to do which was to stand in harms way on behalf of our

fueling the fire they get more and more strength and resolve when they hear the discourse in our country they know it is only a matter of time before we give up because we perceive the war in iraq is too difficult we all know anything worthwhile is not easy freedom is not free the iraqis are trying to make itwork if we retreat the terrorists win they win now and they win in the future when they have a safe haven to plan train and operate and attack us again it is our choice we are either going to support our efforts to win the global war on terror or we are going to support those that want to retreat inside our borders and wait for the next attack we found out on 9 11 if we retreat they attack finally why did we go to iraq ask yourself why did we fight germany in world war 11 japan attacked us not germany the same principle applies we couldnt take the chance then and we cant now those that say otherwise are sympathizing with the enemy that is from lieutenant colonel brett hale

devil came here talking as if he owned the world truly as the owner of the world i think we could call a psychiatrist to analyze yesterdays statement made by the president of the united states as the spokesman of imperialism he came to share his nostrums to try to preserve the current pattern of domination exploitation and pillage of the peoples of the world he said the president of the united states came to talk to the peoplesto the peoples of world what would those peoples of the world tell him if they were given the floor i think i have some inkling of what the peoples of the south the oppressed peoples think they would say yankee imperialist go home i have the feeling dear world dictator that you are going to live the rest of your days as a nightmare because the rest of us are

this and let us praise a democrat in this house named charlie rangel whom i seldom agree with but boy do i appreciate his patriotism in defense of our country and its traditions when he said this today he said you do not come into my country my congressional district and you do not condemn my president if there is any criticism of president bush it should be restricted to americans whether they voted for him or not i just want to make it abundantly clear to hugo chavez or any other president do not come to the united states and think because we have problems with our president that any foreigner can come to our country and not think that americans do not feel offended when you offend our commander in chief thank you charlie rangel for being an honorable democrat who stands united at this time of war hugo chavez is a troublemaker in a big way he wants to work with iranian president ahmadinejad i watched his interview last night on anderson cooper and he calmly looked anderson cooper in the eyes and he gave a very warped view of history not even willing to acknowledge that the holocaust took place completely in denial you would have to wonder where in the world he gets his facts or his view of the world this is a troubling time in american history i say to young people everywhere i go the days ahead will be very very difficult we need to be honest with them about this but the character of this great nation was born out of the sacrifices the courage and the willingness to face these challenges of our grandparents and our greatgrand7 parents the greatest generation they are the standard for stepping up to meeting global challenges and they gave us our character we didnt get our character by the big buildings or wall street or wealth or even military power we got it by sacrifice and dedication and commitment and family and they are the standard they didnt cower or retreat from these challenges they stood up they faced them head on they showed us what it took to preserve freedom and extend it from one generation to the next and we must do the same thing we must come together as a nation i hate it that we are in the middle of this political campaign while we are at war because it is not good for us to say the things we say even on the floor of this house it is not good for lieutenant colonel hale and others to look back here and see the potshots being fired i hate it that over half of the democrats in the senate voted to remove saddam hussein by force and almost half of the democrats voted and now they all say it was a mistake let me tell you there has never been a pretty war never there has never been one perfectly executed and you do not remove a genocidal mass murderer with a picnic it is ugly and a brand new democracy takes a while to develop and it is tough tough but thank goodness that men and women in uniform will volunteer to go serve and carry out this tough mission and extend liberty from one generation to the next these are difficult days america needs to pull together i want to yield to my colleagues that have come tonight two of the people i respect the most in the house first the gentlewoman from north carolina e 1830 virginia foxx is a new member but you would never know it because she has got tons of experience and she has been down here standing up for what she believes day in and day out i want to yield to her on this most important issue of global security"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "as the gentleman pointed out and he is so right we need to move into the 21st century in regard to our health care system and modeling just trying to come up with better drugs and the latest surgery techniques to treat complicated illness is not enough we really need to focus on preventive care you are talking about in the last few minutes of course your specialty in talking about mental illness and as it relates also to childhood obesity and i could not help but think as i was listening to your discussion and as you know this week we just passed h r 554 h r 554 is the personal responsibility in food consumption act of 2005 this is a bill my colleagues are aware of the fact it would not allow someone to sue a fast food manuficturer because they have gorged themselves with a multiple number of big macs or any other kind of fast food or sometimes what we refer to as junk food it is not the fault of the food industry i used a little analogy when i was talking about this on the floor yesterday in discussing the rule of my belt which is a size 36 that is i hate to admit the size of my waist but if i wanted really out of blind pride to suggest that i had a 24inch waist and i cinched that belt down a couple of notches in doing so i put pressure compression on something referred to as the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve it would result in a condition of numbness and lack of feeling on the anterior thigh then should i go out and sue the belt company because they are at fault because i misused a product this is what this bill of course is all about a commonsense type bill parenthetically i also want to mention the gentleman from florida the author of the bill our good friend and colleague is actually in the hospital now and recovering hopefully from a fairly minor condition but we want to pay tribute to him i kno he is proud that we passed this bill this week the comment that i wanted to make is this issue of personal responsibility and parents should have that personal responsibility obviously in the way they conduct themselves in regard to how they eat and a healthy diet and exercise but even more importantly is the responsibility that they have to give a good example and instructioi to their children i think it is probably the worst form of child abuse to let these youngsters that at a very early age overeat and become obese you have talked about the issue of poor mental image selfimage and of course i also see you talked about hollywood and of course this issue of there is no such thing as mental illness i think probably they might predominate in some of those diseases which we categorize as mental illness but quite honestly when a child goes to school and there is this emphasis on thinness and you see these youngsters wearing these britney spears jeans and that sort of thing a child even a little bit overweight and certainly one that is significantly obese of course they are going to have a poor image of themselves they are going to withdraw and they are going to become shy it is very likely they are going to be picked on how in the world can they grow and develop with a healthy selfimage no wonder they end up needing to be counseled and treated by the gentleman from pennsylvania and other mental health care specialists yes unfortunately some even go on to harm themselves and possibly even commit suicide so i guess the most important thing that i would want to say as a physician member is that we need to prevent this we need to make sure that parents get the message that they have an obligation not just to take care of themselves but first and foremost to take care of these precious children that they bring into the world it is their responsibility to make sure that they are from the very beginning when they start eating at the table to make sure that they are healthy and stay healthy so you do not have to have them ending up in your office treating them for not only mental illness but also the many complications of obesity you mentioned them you mentioned diabetes high blood pressure so many things and talk about the cost to this health care system of ours we always talk about waste fraud and abuse in the medicare and the medicaid programs and wanting to eliminate that and we are very diligent and will continue to be so but this is almost a nobrainer it is like we heard former speaker newt gingrich say to a group of us earlier today and the gentleman from pennsylvania was a part of that as we had himcome to speak to members of the house we are not talking about lowhanging fruit here in regard to saving money and saving lives we are talking about fruit that is lying on the ground sitting there rotting waiting for us to pick it up so clearly that is what my message would be in regard to that"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "as we recap here as the evening grows short we have been chatting here awhile about natural gas the clean fuel the abundant fuel the one we have lots of we are not short on natural gag we are short because we havec locked it up much of the midwest is locked up and 85 percent of the continental shelf has been locked up to me that is bad public policy we need to deal with that we need to have that debate t it the mineral mi s manag ement hamye been taking information fromthe publicon whatthey should doin the next 5year plan and 80some percent of those communicating and it is thousands and thousands and thousands have been produced in the outer continental shelf very strong support for it in fact 80some percent of those from florida who are very opposed to this public policy leaderp there were produced most people know that a natural gas producing oil has never harmed anything what is interesting and the gentleman is more from the gulf area but i am told that after katrina that one of the fears were by the fishermen that some of these platforms would be removed from the gulf and they would lose their best fishing i have been told by the people over at mines and management who have to manage all this nationally that every test that has been done there is more wildlife there is more aquatic life there are more fish and creatures around where we produce than where we do not produce they like the break they like the shade they like to b6 in around those platforms and under them and that is where the good fishing is"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "before i yield to my colleague from california let me just take 1 minute first of all when my colleague and good friend says that we have a delicate relationship with venezuela i would like to point out to him that president chavez is in tehran today he is over there talking to the ayatollahs who he has invited to venezuela he has been buying thousands of ak47s he is trying to expand his military operation down there he goes on television every sunday for 5 hours and he calls the president of the united states a donkey and other names so if you are talking about a delicate relationship being in jeopardy let me just say the reason for the delicate relationship being in jeopardy is because mr chavez is shooting off his mouth i have met with him several times with you folks and he always says he is going to tone down the rhetoric and he never does regarding the 100 million of cocaine that came out of venezuela into the mexican airport we have talked to intelligence sources and they said there was no information coming from venezuela about that shipment they said that is totally false i yield to my good friend from california for 2 minutes li 2145"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "before i yield to the gentlewoman from connecticut i would like to give myself such time right now as i might consume we have a strategy and it is a
