federal tax rates on longterm capital gains from 49 to 28 percent as a result of this farsighted action there has been a significant increase in both the number of individual investors and in total equity values unfortunately however despite these positive developments current economic conditions demand that we enact additional tax measures to further stimulate capital format ion and to end the tax bias against savings and investment for this reason i am today introducing the comprehensive savings incentive act of 1981 a bill designed to significantly increase both our savings and productivity rate to expand the number of individual shareholders and to create millions of dollars of equity capital for our financially starving industries in brief the bill is comprised of three major provisions the first provision permanently increases the amount of money an individual may exclude from taxation on dividends and interest earned on savinus accounts from the current limit of 200 400 to 1 000 2 000 for individuals and married couples as my colleagues will recall the 200 400 provision was incorporated within the socalled windfall profits tax bill and is expected to significantly increase our gross national product the rate of private investment productivity and employment i believe that far greater benefits are to be gained by increasing the exclusion amount and by making it a permanent part of our tax code the second provision of this legislation modifies our tax code as it affects individual retirement accounts at present to qualify for an ira an individtual must be earning an income either as a salaried or selfemployed worker and must not be eligible for an organized pension or retirement plan iras are personal taxdeferred retirement plans which allow individuals to put 15 dercent of their yearly incomeup to 1 500into a special interestbearing account while i believe there is merit in reevaluating the eligibility requirements for an ira my bill simply recognizes that because of recurrent doubledigit inflation we must increase the amount of money people are ab le to setaside in an ira for this reason my bill increases the individual limit of 1 500 to 2 500 and correspondingly increases the spousal deduction from 1 750 to 3 000 the third and final provision of this legislation provides for a further rollback in the effective tax rates on capital gains from 28 to 21 percent for individuals and corporations i am convinced that a further reduction in the capital gains rate is overdue and that it can be financed in effect by higher realizations of gains and related tax receipts consisting largely of ordinary income earned by brokers executing sales commissions in fact this finding is consistent with the results of the 1978 reduction which has increased capital gains receipts to the treasury department by some 900 million additionally it is significant to note that a reduction in the capital gains tax from 28 to 21 percent received the enthusiastic support of the senate in its consideration of the revenue act of 1978 at that time the senate finance committee reported that the committee believes that lower capital gains tax will markedly increase sales of appreciated assets which will offset much of the revenue loss from the tax cut and potentially lead to an actual increase in revenues in addition the improved mobility of capital will stimulate investment thereby generating more economic activity and more tax revenue it is my firm belief that this type of antiinflationary individual tax cut compliments the presidents own tax proposal which i fully support and will help produce lasting jobs in the private sector minimize the risk of a new and worse recession result in lower interest rates increased capital investment and productivity and will strengthen the dollar abroad what i am proposing here today is an idea designed to benefit all americans for in this time of economic crisis we must do all thatwe can to increase the amount of available capital capital is the lifeblood of our economy and without it we will continue to experience high interest rates high unemployment astronomical trade imbalances and sagging levels of productivity i believe that if enacted this legislation will unlock important sources of capital and will allow american industries to expand their facilities to create thousands of jobs to more effectively compete abroad and to more efficiently produce those products we depend upon in our daily lives i urge my colleagues to join me inthis

other body the bill itself might never become law since it taints it to that degree section 2405 to which i object provides unemployment compensation benefits to essentially all exservicemen who voluntarily leave the military this reverses and retreats from the change we made in the reconciliation bill where we prohibited such payments except under certain circumstances this reversal or retreat from action we have already taken in the reconciliation bill should be defeated for basically four reasons the first reason i offer is the fact that this is bad policy a serviceman and an employee in the private sector should be treated equally the same rule should apply to either one in the private sector when an employee leaves voluntarily a place of employment he is not qualified for unemployment compensation benefits yet if section 2405 stays in this bill we are going to treat the serviceman differently than the private employee by allowing him unemployment compensation benefits when he voluntarily leaves the service it is bad policy to create this difference in treatment when we used to have draftees i guess one could rationalize the law being that way on the grounds that we were involuntarily plucking a man or woman out of their employment and putting them in the service of their country and perhaps we should do something for them when they leave we do not have that anymore now we have a voluntary military people go into the military knowing they are going to leave at a certain time most of them are preparing for that date as a matter of fact most

january 1 after this year when there is no balance of repayable advances made to the fund and no unpaid interest thereon the increased excise tax on coal is estimated to increase receipts of the trust fund by 193 million in fiscal year 1982 299 million in 1983 313 million in 1984 and 327 million in the increased excise tax on coal is estimated to increase net tax receipts after accounting for lower income tax receipts as a result of the coal excise tax by 141 million in fiscal year 1982 218 million in 1983 and so forth these figures are set out in the committee report a accond reason for supporting this measure is that lisibility for certain claims would be transferred from responsible operators to the fund generally these are the claims which had been denied or were pending prior to march 1 1978 and which were rereviewed and approved as a result of the black lung benefits reform act of third the bill eliminates the requirement that the fund pay retroactive lump sum benefits after eligibility is determined when the claim is being contested by the responsible operator the fund will however still pay benefits accruing after the initial determination of eligibility is made fourth the rate of interest paid by responsible operators on repayment to the fund of amounts paid by the fund on claims for which the operator is liable is increased from 6 percent to the prime rate determined annually the rate for calendar year 1982 would be 15 percent the bill also amends the method for computing interest paid by the fund tc the general fund for repayable advances basically the rate would be equal to~ the current average market yield on outstanding unitedstates obligations with comparable maturity for the calendar month preceding the month in which the advance is made

the imbalance is in your favor and against us in the united states also one thing that does not come up and i think i will probably briog it up the next time that we meet with our counterparts is that nowhere in this equation do they ever mention the cost of our strategic program that we have developed in the past and which we are attempting to develop now this is not a part of the equation but is just as much for the benefit of our nato allies as it is for us certainly they have grown and prospered and have developed a very healty economy under the umbrella that has been offered by our strategic weapons systems i would wonder whether by negotiation or not if we would not be unwise at this time to either in fact or even announce that we were planning to withdraw our troops and if the gentleman does not feel that this might be waving a red flag or be precipitating a very unhealthy balance in the nato scenario at this time to precipitiously say that we are going to withdraw our troops now whether we do it at negotiation or not then say if you dont buy more and spend more and so forth we are going to withdraw our troops i wonder if this would be unsettling and unbalancing"],

legislative body took a positive step to encourage savings and investment by reducing the maximum federal tax rates on longterm capital gains from 49 to 28 percent as a result of this farsighted action there has been a significant increase in both the number of individual investors and in total equity values unfortunately however despite these positive developments current economic conditions demand that we enact additional tax measures to further stimulate capital format ion and to end the tax bias against savings and investment for this reason i am today introducing the comprehensive savings incentive act of 1981 a bill designed to significantly increase both our savings and productivity rate to expand the number of individual shareholders and to create millions of dollars of equity capital for our financially starving industries in brief the bill is comprised of three major provisions the first provision permanently increases the amount of money an individual may exclude from taxation on dividends and interest earned on savinus accounts from the current limit of 200 400 to 1 000 2 000 for individuals and married couples as my colleagues will recall the 200 400 provision was incorporated within the socalled windfall profits tax bill and is expected to significantly increase our gross national product the rate of private investment productivity and employment i believe that far greater benefits are to be gained by increasing the exclusion amount and by making it a permanent part of our tax code the second provision of this legislation modifies our tax code as it affects individual retirement accounts at present to qualify for an ira an individtual must be earning an income either as a salaried or selfemployed worker and must not be eligible for an organized pension or retirement plan iras are personal taxdeferred retirement plans which allow individuals to put 15 dercent of their yearly incomeup to 1 500into a special interestbearing account while i believe there is merit in reevaluating the eligibility requirements for an ira my bill simply recognizes that because of recurrent doubledigit inflation we must increase the amount of money people are ab le to setaside in an ira for this reason my bill increases the individual limit of 1 500 to 2 500 and correspondingly increases the spousal deduction from 1 750 to 3 000 the third and final provision of this legislation provides for a further rollback in the effective tax rates on capital gains from 28 to 21 percent for individuals and corporations i am convinced that a further reduction in the capital gains rate is overdue and that it can be financed in effect by higher realizations of gains and related tax receipts consisting largely of ordinary income earned by brokers executing sales commissions in fact this finding is consistent with the results of the 1978 reduction which has increased capital gains receipts to the treasury department by some 900 million additionally it is significant to note that a reduction in the capital gains tax from 28 to 21 percent received the enthusiastic support of the senate in its consideration of the revenue act of 1978 at that time the senate finance committee reported that the committee believes that lower capital gains tax will markedly increase sales of appreciated assets which will offset much of the revenue loss from the tax cut and potentially lead to an actual increase in revenues in addition the improved mobility of capital will stimulate investment thereby generating more economic activity and more tax revenue it is my firm belief that this type of antiinflationary individual tax cut compliments the presidents own tax proposal which i fully support and will help produce lasting jobs in the private sector minimize the risk of a new and worse recession result in lower interest rates increased capital investment and productivity and will strengthen the dollar abroad what i am proposing here today is an idea designed to benefit all americans for in this time of economic crisis we must do all thatwe can to increase the amount of available capital capital is the lifeblood of our economy and without it we will continue to experience high interest rates high unemployment astronomical trade imbalances and sagging levels of productivity i believe that if enacted this legislation will unlock important sources of capital and will allow american industries to expand their facilities to create thousands of jobs to more effectively compete abroad and to more efficiently produce those products we depend upon in our daily lives i urge my colleagues to join me inthis bipartisan effort to restore economic vitality to this great nation by cosponsoring the comprehensive savings

bill it is indeed quite possible that if this section remains in the bill in the other body the bill itself might never become law since it taints it to that degree section 2405 to which i object provides unemployment compensation benefits to essentially all exservicemen who voluntarily leave the military this reverses and retreats from the change we made in the reconciliation bill where we prohibited such payments except under certain circumstances this reversal or retreat from action we have already taken in the reconciliation bill should be defeated for basically four reasons the first reason i offer is the fact that this is bad policy a serviceman and an employee in the private sector should be treated equally the same rule should apply to either one in the private sector when an employee leaves voluntarily a place of employment he is not qualified for unemployment compensation benefits yet if section 2405 stays in this bill we are going to treat the serviceman differently than the private employee by allowing him unemployment compensation benefits when he voluntarily leaves the service it is bad policy to create this difference in treatment when we used to have draftees i guess one could rationalize the law being that way on the grounds that we were involuntarily plucking a man or woman out of their employment and putting them in the service of their country and perhaps we should do something for them when they leave we do not have that anymore now we have a voluntary military people go into the military knowing they are going to leave at a certain time most of them are preparing for that date as a matter of fact most of them use their last days of leave or they use the service training they are getting in service to prepare for when
