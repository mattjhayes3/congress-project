freetrade agreements particularly with societies with lower standards of living but in the final measure free trade is a better answer to the worlds economic disequililbrtum than foreign aid shared economic hope is a more effective deterrent top war than competitive protectionism when it comes to advancing peace as well as prosperity big fences simply do not make good neighbors if there is any hope of countries and peoples coming to have shared values in a world of nuclear weapons and fractured group identities competition must be in trade not arms in markets not land masses nafta in this context is a step toward providing citizens of the globe a common selfinterest shared prosperity based on shared economic growth of all the major economic issues before congress nafta is a decision for which there are a large number of meritorious arguments on each aide there are certain risks involved in enacting nafta but my best judgment at thispoint is that the aimrican economy especially the iowa economy will benefit in the long run from freer trade and that more jobs will be created than lost in the united states because of nafta my support for nafta in based partly on a look at the benefits of free trade throughout american history one of the lessons of t 19vs was that protectionist ltegislation such as the smoothawley tariff lengthened and deepened the great depression by reverse logic in recessionary times promotng policies that impel the growth of international trade is likely to serve as an economic sttnoulant trade barriers are particularly harmful to icmaas agrtealtualbased economy hence the importance of reginal agreements like nafta and the larger multicontinent gatt process lt cannot be stressed enough that defeat of na ta will preduce a double whammy for the iowa farmer loss of new markets south of our border and loss of the last vestiges of leverage for fairness in agricultural trade in the gatt discussions if nafta goes down the french would crow the contention on the continent would be that americans have no right to petition for fairer trade in agricultural commodities that is reduced subsidies if we refused to embrace free trade in our own hemisphere our farmers are the most productive in the world yet in the absence of international markets this very prodhctivity is the largest contributor to our excess supply problems what iowa farmers need is open markets abroad that are based on fair and equal trade this it also true for iowas manufac turing and services economy many companies with substantial capital investments in the first district like hon industries in muscatine expectto be able to create more iowa jobs because they will not only be subject to lower mexican tariffs but the dismantling over time of madenmexico product requirements some companies will always seek the lowest wage environment for this type of company mexico is more attractive without than with nafta because mexico will not have to adjust its labor or environmental standards and will be able to keep in place discriminatory tariffs with or without nafta some jobs will flow to mexico with nafta more new jobs are likely to be created is the united states than would otherwise be the case several years ago the united states established a freetrade agreement with canada in advance of the agreemeat most economists suggested it would be good for the united states and even better for canada in retrospect the agreement has proven good for canada and even better for the united state canada which had very high tariffs on united states goods has bee required to drop far more trade barriers than the united states in this regard a like circumstance exists with mexico their tarifs are extremely high often s to 10 times higher than very modest unitedstates ones and their current nontarift barriers vat unitedstates companies in a competitively untenable posltion under nafta in exchange for assured asee to the united states and canadian markets the mexicans must give the moat os tarf and on accepting changes in their environmental and labor policies while freetrade arrangements with lowerwage societie holds particular risks for some co panies midwesten farmers as well as farm implement food processing and trucking companies centered in cities like cedar rapids and the quad cities should be benefited and it must be empha esd without nafta united states cotpanies are free to invest in mexico all nafta does is lower already low barriers to mexican imports and in exchange lower what are substantially higher barriers to united states exports to mexico the most risky aspect of the agreement relates to the significant wage differential in mexico this could pose a problem in some industries but it should be stressed the same problem exists without an agreement one protection for us that seldom is noted is that the effect of an agreement can be measured over time and either party will retain the right to withdraw if it does not prove fair here those of us who are fortunate enough to live north of the rio grands must understand that when opportunity and hope are lacking at home individuals will make the obvious decision they vote with their feet for a better life president salinas is neither exaggerating nor threatening when he suggests the choice for america is whether we want more mexican products or more mexican people another factor of interest is that the asian countries which unlike mexico have developed an enormous trade surplus with the united states in recent years radically oppose the agreement they conjecture taht a partnership of countries of north america will cause more job creation hereand a rower reliance on imports from asia economists point out for instance that when the united states imports a finished product from the far east almost all the component parts are manufactured in the far east in mexico the reverse is the case a growing jobs base in mexico can potentially impel a growing jobs base in the united states as mexican buying power increases so will mexican demand for united states goodsa likewise our european competitors are very apprehenive of nafta because they fear they will be boxed out of the mexican market because they will be forced to pay tariffs that united states firma will not one cedar rapids company for instance4 tells me they expect to be in a positton to replace a european companys current dqnzinance of the mexican market for agricultural byproducts finally two notes about the democratic process first critics of nafta are right to be upset with the tactics of the admistratiox bi ledging other peoples noneythat is taxpayer dollars to influence votes for instance however meritorious establishment c a north american development ban might be in another context i voted i committee against establishing such mechanism as part of the naft agreement because i considered i grossly unseemly to advance a mult million dollar spending program just t influence a few votes to fvor naft people can credibly be for or agalng nafta but positions should be base on principle not promises of program in a more positive se it is inte eating perhaps profoundly so that a important policy identified with a 11 ting president should be supported i the majority by the party that has tb greatest interest in seeing the pm dent not succeed while less thean 4 percent of the presidents own party i expected to vote for the oston advt cated by their leader whatevr tb merits of nafta and s a policy in tiative it is most decideadly a ci callit is remarkable that so man members of the presidente politiol opposition are putting their view of tb countrys best interest above pertiat ship this is particularly remarkab given the fact that individual

more tha the president was at issue and the american leadership in the world mci notably on economic issues like gai but also political issues from korea t bosnia would have been weakened president clinton had been dealt a eel back on nafta for all these reasons i believe the ratifying nafta ts the best economi choice that america can make at tj moment and that the risk of pushin ahead is not as

the international treaty known as the london convention which effective february 20 1994 banned the dumping of radioactive waste at sea currently the ocean dumping of radioactive waste is regulated under the ocean dumping act the oda allows dumping of radioactive waste only after congress has passed a joint resolution authorizing the dumping although this provision has been in force since 1985 congress has yet to authorize any radioactive dumping for decades unitedstates law on ocean pollution has been more stringent than international law at the time of enactment the radioactive dumping provisions in oda were among the most restrictive in the world going well beyond international treaty obligations that is no longer the case the ocean radioactive dumping ban act corrects this by eliminating odas current arduous permitting process and i h 1243 replacing it with a simple ban it ensures that the united states retains its leadership position in protecting the worlds marine environment the relevance of the united states banning radioactive dumping is far reaching historically the united states has set international policy on ocean dumping of radioactive waste until last year the united states had resisted an international ban through the united states influence the issue was left unresolved that all changed last november when the clinton administration reversed the united states policy and announced its support for a ban the reversal which was brought on in part by heavy lobbying from the global legislators organization for a balanced environment enabled the

oceanography subcommittee held a hearing on the threat of contamination from the russian dumping of nuclear waste for four decades the former soviet union and now the russian republic has been dumping nuclear waste from nuclear submarines and weapons plants into the worlds oceans the information gathered by the subcommittee was sobering the wests first concrete evidence about the dumping came last sumtumer following the release of the yablokov report which was commissioned by president boris yeltsin to detail the extent of soviet nuclear disposal at sea according to the report the soviet union had dumped over 2 5 million curies of radioactive waste into the arctic ocean and other marine environments by comparison the accident at three mile island in my home state of pennsylvania released 15 curies of radiation during the hearing the subcommittee discovered that since 1959 the former soviet union dumped 18 nuclear reactors a reactor screen 11 000 to 17 000 cannisters of nuclear waste and hundreds of thousands of gallon of liquid radioactive waste it also learned that solid nuclear fuel waste totaling 10 million curies is currently stored aboard vessels in murmansk harbor even after the fall of communism moscow has continued to dispose of radioactive waste at sea in october 1993 russia dumped 900 tons of lowlevel radioactive waste in the sea of japan in violation of a previously

odd minutes talking about the wide range of issues and concerns that were raised on this whole issue of the north american freetrade agreement ranging from the question of exports versus imports the political situation the problems that mexico has faced which we all acknowledge are still there i think that as we look at this issue we should take the next few minutes to be very specific about some of the marvelous success stories that exist as it relates to the nafta now as we all know some of the most virulent opponents to the north american freetrade agreement stated as that debate raged last year that we would see the economies in the rust belt of the country devastated if nafta were to be implemented all of the jobs because of businesses flowing to mexico would be evaporating and they said to people like the gentleman from arizona and to me that yes you come from the western part of the united states your states border mexico and you will have real improvement but the rest of the country will pay the price from the implementation of the nafta so i would like to take a couple of minutes to start out by pointing to a few successes that exist in ohio now we know that some of the strongest opposition came from members of the ohio delegation and for starters as we look at the first 6 months the headline of this article chrysler starts shipping jeeps to mexico in january chrysler began shipping its first jeeps to mexico the company will ship about 3 800 jeep wranglers and cherokees to mexico from its toledo oh plant in 1994 thanks in part to lower tariffs as a result of the north american freetrade agreement that an article in the journal of commerce the jeep sales have also benefited suppliers to chrysler who are spread throughout that region then there is an article in the cleveland plain dealer axle maker sees silver lining from jeep exports with the export of nearly 4 000 united statesmade jeeps to mexico toledobased dana corp now has to produce more axles for the popular vehicles the chairman of the dana corp indicated in december of 1993 that the company may even close its plants in mexico and bring business back to the united states now that is a little different than what we heard last year during this debate on the nafta then if you look also in ohio cougar and thunderbird production moves from mexico to ohio the ford motor co announced in january that it plans to shift production of its cougars and thunderbirds from mexico to lorain oh ford plans to build an additional 8 000 thunderbirds and cougars this year in lorain using current workers on overtime a ford spokesperson who credits the nafta for the production move said the company may also move its production for the grand marquis from mexico to the united states the company

amendment we have the opportunity to strike at the heart of overburdening government relations and allowing industry to compete the fastener advisory committee has just forwarded their study on the probable economic consequences of implementing final regulations without amending the fastener quality act the advisory committee has reported that without their recommended changes congress could be placing an additional cost of almost 1 billion on the industrial fastener manufacturing industry the report states that if enacted without the recommendation changes could have a devastating economic influence upon all factsof our industry but especially to small businesses that manufacture distribute specific fasteners that are covered by the act further the report explains congress believed the act would cover only 1 percent or 60 million of fasteners sold in commerce not the 55 percent of the market as estimated by the fastener industry coalition that would be affected i believe it is important to make clear that the intent of congress was truly that 1 percent of those fasteners used in critical applications would be covered that 1 percent of the market place should not be damaging to the small business manufactures trying to complete in the other 99 percent of the market my amendment that is before us now would allow for first allowance for chemistry certification from raw material vendors to be used the fastener manufacturer cannot change the chemistry of the raw material therefore all testing of chemistry for finished fastener lots would be redundant as long as lot traceability to the mill heat of the raw material has been maintained it is my understanding that nist has agreed to work out regulation language that will allow current inventories to be utilized as the nist accreditation process takes place failing to adopt this particular provision would have an estimated cost to the industry of between 100 million to 286 million further my amendment redefines the definition of the sale of fasteners with minor nonconformances historically the industry has allowed for the sale of minor nonconformances this provision just allows fastener industry to maintain the industry standard this provision is intended to ensure that the fastener quality act will not be interpreted to override the provisions of industry and government standards these standards provide procedures and safeguards for the sale or other accepted means of disposing of fasteners found to deviate from one or more of the physical specifications set out in such standards failing to adopt this amendment according to the fastener advisory committee will have an estimated cost to industry as high as 285 million i want to thank the gentleman from michigan chairman of the committee on energy and commerce for his willingness to find a compromise on the issues represented by this amendment the third recommendation of the fastener advisory committee and the one that has the largest negative impact on small business and distributers deals with the issue of mixing like fasteners nist has acknowledged the cost to be 375 million for all distributors to comply with an estimated ongoing yearly cost to each distributor of 65 000 unfortunately this was not something that we were able to get worked out in our negotiations and we could not agree that this mixing of fasteners or what is called commingling should take place i personally have heard from the fastener industry coalition which represents over 2 500 unitedstates fastener distributors and manufacturers and importers with over 60 000 employees in support of this particular commingling provision we have heard from the national fastener distributors association we nave heard from the industrial fastener institute we have heard from the specialty tools and fasteners distribution association and so on and so forth i have a whole list of these people that i will put into the record however the point is that while i regard that as something that needs to be looked at in the future that is not a part of this amendment it was not something that we could work out i think it is important to recognize that what chairman dingell and i have been able to work out will be an important step forward that will save perhaps as much as onehalf billion dollars a year to unitedstates industry and will enhance the competitiveness therefore of unitedstates industry therefore if we want to help business if we want to help provide jobs if we want to help american competitiveness we can do so by supporting this

san diego area alone last month between 300 000 and 400 000 illegal aliens crossed our borders to reduce these numbers we must reduce the incentives and stop rewarding those who make a mockery of our countrys laws we have a serious problem with illegal aliens because we offer them too sweet of a deal today there are 4 million illegal aliens residing in the united states last year federal and state governments spent at least 6 billion in taxpayer dollars on services to illegal immigrants including unemployment benefits subsidized housing food stamps education benefits and medical care further the gao reports that 22 percent of our federal inmates are illegal aliens also 49 percent of all illegal aliens apply for unemployment insurance and 35 percent receive benefits at least 2 4 million immigrants entered the united states illegally last year over the past 2 years illegal immigrants cost california taxpayers 3 billion directly and an untold sum indirectly today we can send a message to illegal immigrants you can no longer slip across our border and siphonoff services from our own citizens many people enter this country because its still a land of opportunity but we are quickly becoming a beacon of entitlement to whomever can sneak in we must stop saddling taxpayers with the costs of illegal immigration providing more services to illegal immigrants will not solve the problem in fact it will do just the opposite by providing free services to people who enter this country illegally we con tinue to encourage the next wave of illegal immigrants that is why my amendment is so important it prohibits the corporation for national service from making a grant to a government program if it does not have a written policy that prohibits the delivery of services to illegal immigrants furthermore private organizations will not be eligible for national service grants unless they have a written policy that prohibits the delivery of personal services to illegal aliens this amendment also applies to action programs authorized under the domestic volunteer service act my amendment provides for two necessary exemptions first organizations which provide emergency services to illegal aliens can still participate in national service as long as they have a written policy of reporting illegal aliens to the ins therefore hospitals which have been required by law to provide emergency medical care to illegal aliens will still qualify to participate in the national service program if they report illegal aliens to the ins second compulsory educational programslike public schools will be able to receive national service volunteers providing these programs also have a written policy of reporting illegal aliens to the ins in short with certain exceptions my amendment prohibits organizations that are participants in the national service program from subsidizing illegal aliens i know that some critics will contend that a worthy charity will be denied volunteers because of my amendment but let me point out that this amendment will not in any way change what charities can do right now all this amendment does is ensure that we channel new federal spending so as not to subsidize those services given to illegal aliens nothing in this bill prohibits organizations from continuing to run their own programs to serve illegal aliens without federal help government money brings certain conditions the bill before us already lays out conditions for funding as long as this house is intent on further expanding the size and role of the federal government we may as well be sure that taxpayers hardearned cash does not further encourage illegal immigration we also have an opportunity to say to our nations citizens we will not make you compete with illegal aliens its already tough for many americans to reach the american dream saddled with government debt high taxes and overregulation the last thing americans need is to compete with illegal aliens for their

competitive protectionism when it comes to advancing peace as well as prosperity big fences simply do not make good neighbors if there is any hope of countries and peoples coming to have shared values in a world of nuclear weapons and fractured group identities competition must be in trade not arms in markets not land masses nafta in this context is a step toward providing citizens of the globe a common selfinterest shared prosperity based on shared economic growth of all the major economic issues before congress nafta is a decision for which there are a large number of meritorious arguments on each aide there are certain risks involved in enacting nafta but my best judgment at thispoint is that the aimrican economy especially the iowa economy will benefit in the long run from freer trade and that more jobs will be created than lost in the united states because of nafta my support for nafta in based partly on a look at the benefits of free trade throughout american history one of the lessons of t 19vs was that protectionist ltegislation such as the smoothawley tariff lengthened and deepened the great depression by reverse logic in recessionary times promotng policies that impel the growth of international trade is likely to serve as an economic sttnoulant trade barriers are particularly harmful to icmaas agrtealtualbased economy hence the importance of reginal agreements like nafta and the larger multicontinent gatt process lt cannot be stressed enough that defeat of na ta will preduce a double whammy for the iowa farmer loss of new markets south of our border and loss of the last vestiges of leverage for fairness in agricultural trade in the gatt discussions if nafta goes down the french would crow the contention on the continent would be that americans have no right to petition for fairer trade in agricultural commodities that is reduced subsidies if we refused to embrace free trade in our own hemisphere our farmers are the most productive in the world yet in the absence of international markets this very prodhctivity is the largest contributor to our excess supply problems what iowa farmers need is open markets abroad that are based on fair and equal trade this it also true for iowas manufac turing and services economy many companies with substantial capital investments in the first district like hon industries in muscatine expectto be able to create more iowa jobs because they will not only be subject to lower mexican tariffs but the dismantling over time of madenmexico product requirements some companies will always seek the lowest wage environment for this type of company mexico is more attractive without than with nafta because mexico will not have to adjust its labor or environmental standards and will be able to keep in

the united states in this regard a like circumstance exists with mexico their tarifs are extremely high often s to 10 times higher than very modest unitedstates ones and their current nontarift barriers vat unitedstates companies in a competitively untenable posltion under nafta in exchange for assured asee to the united states and canadian markets the mexicans must give the moat os tarf and

are fortunate enough to live north of the rio grands must understand that when opportunity and hope are lacking at home individuals will make the obvious decision they vote with their feet for a better life president salinas is neither exaggerating nor threatening when he suggests the choice for america is whether we want more mexican products or more mexican people another factor of interest is that the asian countries which unlike mexico have developed an enormous trade surplus with the united states in recent years radically oppose the agreement they conjecture taht a partnership of countries of north america will cause more job creation hereand a rower reliance on imports from asia economists point out for instance that when the united states imports a finished product from the far east almost all the component parts are manufactured in the far east in mexico the reverse is the case a growing jobs base in mexico can potentially impel a growing jobs base in the united states as mexican buying power increases so will mexican demand for united states goodsa likewise our european competitors are very apprehenive of nafta because they fear they will be boxed out of the mexican market because they will be forced to pay tariffs that united states firma will not one cedar rapids company for instance4 tells me they expect to be in a positton to replace a european companys current dqnzinance of the mexican market for agricultural byproducts finally two notes about the democratic process first critics of nafta are right to be upset with the tactics of the admistratiox bi ledging other peoples noneythat is taxpayer dollars to influence votes for instance however meritorious establishment c a north american development ban might be in another context i voted i committee against establishing such mechanism as part of the naft agreement because i considered i grossly unseemly to advance a mult million dollar spending program just t influence a few votes to fvor naft people can credibly be for or agalng nafta but positions should be base on principle not promises of program in a more positive se it is inte eating perhaps profoundly so that a important policy identified with a 11 ting president should be supported i the majority by the party that has tb greatest interest in seeing the pm dent not succeed while less thean 4 percent of the presidents own party i expected to vote for the oston advt cated by their leader whatevr tb merits of nafta and s a policy in tiative it is most decideadly a ci callit is remarkable that so man members of the presidente politiol opposition are putting their view of tb countrys best interest above pertiat ship this is particularly remarkab given the fact that individual eleotlo politics in almost all instances is bel ter served by an antinapta vote this vote thus symbolizes an aspe of american democracy that is unlik that of any comparable democratic at ciety it would simply be inconceivab that an opposition party would bail ot a french or german or british or aui trallan prime minister in a like eel ting but many republicans undel stood that the presidency more tha the president was at issue and the american leadership in the world mci notably on economic issues like gai but also political issues from korea t bosnia would have been weakened president clinton had been dealt a eel back on nafta for all these reasons i believe the ratifying nafta ts the best economi choice that america can make at tj moment and that the risk of pushin ahead is not as great as the risk doing nothing if the agreement lata proves not to benefit the unite states it can and should be reasseei"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "although we are still an infant among most nations of the world america has developed over the past two centuries a culture as interesting and unique as any in history american art music theater and film has made this country one of the most advanced and artistic cultures in the world i can think of few ways to better teach the next generation of americans about their history than to let them hear the music read the literature and see the films of the twenties forties sixties et cetera art not only serves as a form of entertainment it tells the american story we are all quite aware of the fiscal problems that continue to plague our economy unfortunately the arts like all segments of our society must share in americas fiscal sacrifice like many of my colleagues i do not support the nea authorization bill before us it simply does not cut enough at a time when we cannot find the means to properly care for the elderly and provide homes for the homeless while still attempting to eliminate our huge budget deficit i cannot support the funding levels in this bill we must prioritize spending and make difficult choices we just cannot afford this level of nea spending i oppose the crane amendment abolishing the nea totally i fear that if we eliminate funding for the nea this year we will never be able to resurrect it this would be an injustice not only to todays americans but to the next generation of young americans who will not experience the many works of art we now enjoy local symphonies and plays are some examples of the art the nea provides i encourage presentations of beethoven bach and other contemporaries like gershwin our children could be deprived of the full value of these works if we eliminate funding for the nea that is why i oppose the bill as it stands before us so that we may bring it back to the floor in a form that will permit the funding of morally responsible worthwhile and entertaining works of art while still maintaining the sense of fiscal responsibility the economic climate demands"]]}
