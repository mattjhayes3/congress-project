parenthood as it has already done by passage of both h r 3495 and h r 3134 in addition the rule provides for consideration of the shortterm continuing resolution as a member of the committee on appropriations i am always disappointed when we are forced to consider continuing resolutions especially given the work this house has done in the appropriations process this year for the first time since 2009 the house appropriations committee was able to complete all 12 appropriations bills and complete them before the august recess unfortunately just as in years past senate democrats prevented consideration of any appropriations bills on the floor of that body this leads us to the unfortunate situation of having to put forward a shortterm cr to fund the government through december 11 this continuing resolution is simple most programs will continue being funded at their fy15 levels however it does adjust certain spending levels for critical needs such as providing 700 million for wildfire suppression activities in the west and it extends several programs that would otherwise lapse like the collection of recreation fees for public lands in addition it maintains the moratorium on state and local jurisdictions taxation of the internet i hope that in the weeks and months ahead the house the senate and the president can come to an agreement on a path forward which ensures we are not in this same place in december some of my colleagues have stated publicly that they cannot support this cr because it provides funding for planned parenthood i want to assure my colleagues

innovation act it is one of the worst misnomers that i have seen in my time in congress this should be called the antiinnovation act this is yet the latest of a decadeslong attack on the patent rights of the american people that were placed into the constitution by our founding fathers for decades now large multinational corporations very powerful economic entities that have influence on government have been trying to neuter the patent rights of the american people why have they been doing this why do they want to eliminate or to dramatically reduce the rights of our inventors to control what they have invented because these are big guys who dont want to pay the little guys when they steal from them the fact is that our founding fathers knew it was important for someone who has created something whether it is a writer or an inventor to have the right to control his or her creation for a certain period of time the time period has been 17 years traditionally since the time of our constitution our founding fathers knew this was important to our countrys wellbeing not just in terms of the rights of the individual which we agree with as americans and which were written into our constitution as part of the bill of rights only one place is the word right used in the body of the constitution and that is in the section dealing with providing our inventors and yes our writers with the right to control what they have created for a certain period of time in order to profit from it our big corporations and these multinational corporations that have no loyalty to the united states these people who are continually going overseas to china and elsewhere are trying to neuter this so that they can take any new innovation without having to pay the person who has actually been the inventor and created this that is totally contrary to what our country has been all about we have had the strongest patent system in the worldthe strongest in the world what has that given the american people it has uplifted our standard of living of ordinary people yes these folks in the multinational corporations they live very well well the american people have lived well because we have had the technology whether it is agricultural technology or transportation technology or any of the other type of energy technologies that we have these have uplifted us and created more wealth for our society americans security prosperity and yes freedom have been due to our technological advantages it is not that our people worked harder it is not that we had such natural resources there are countries all over the world where people work hard and have natural resources it is our freedom and our respect for the individual rights of our citizens that have given us prosperity and security

supposed innovation act which as i say should be called the antiinnovation act is all about in fact there is a legitimate problem of frivolous lawsuits in our country there is no doubt about that it is not just in the area of technology it is throughout our medicine and everywhere else but there have been a number of people who have taken patent law and claimed rights that they werent given by the patent office and issued frivolous lawsuits to people to try to get them to pay money to them they are called patent trolls this excuse for changing our patent system is a lame excuse in the sense that we dont need to destroy the patent rights of the little guy in order to cure this problem every provision of the innovation actevery provisionlimits the rights of legitimate patent holders in

and impactful life of phyllis schlafly had come to an end at the age of 92 i got to know phyllis throughout the political activism of the country among conservative politics it goes back for me quite a ways now too i might add but i didnt pay a lot of attention to what was going on in the early 70s when phyllis schlaflys eyes went on some of the transformative shifts that were taking place in america phyllis was a prolife activist before roe v wade she saw it coming she knew what it meant she became one of the strongest prolife voices in all of america and i would say the most persistent the most consistent and the most relentless voice for the longest period of time phyllis was active on the public scene from at least as far back as 1952 all the way up until the last days of her life which ended this past weekend i would like to go through some of those milestones of phyllis schlaflys life and then perhaps have some comments about those milestones along her life as i review some of that material i look back on her impact particularly in republican politics she was a campaign manager for a successful republican candidate for congress in st louis in 1946 it was for claude bakewell she served as an elected delegate to eight republican national conventions i dont know that there has been a more consistent or persistent voice at our republican national conventions over more than a half a century than we have heard from phyllis schlafly she was an elected delegate to the republican national conventions in 1956 1964 1968 1984 1992 1996 2004 and 2012 you might wonder what she was doing in those missing convention years of 1960 1980 2000 and 2008 well she was an elected alternate in those conventions and i would suspect that her choice was similar to that of what i had made a time or two in the past as wellthat i wanted to make sure that there were young people that had an opportunity to be a delegate and that young people had an opportunity to come up and be active in politics phyllis schlafly had facilitated thousands of young people to come into active politics phyllis attended the republican national convention in cleveland this last july where it was the last time that i saw her as she came into the republican reception the members reception upstairs i had an opportunity to speak a few words with her and see that radiant smile on her face she was dressed in just a very very colorful and gracious dress and seated in a wheelchair the brightness in her eyes told me there was a lot of spirit left in phyllis schlafly phyllis has played an active role in every republican national convention since 1952 the earliest real impactwhen people began to notice who phyllis schlafly waswas when she published on may 1 1964 the book a choice not an echo it was a small little book that gave us an understanding about how presidential candidates are selected it was a description of some of the backroom deals that were made about the dynamics of the presidential process she called it for 1964 she identified who the backroom supporters would be how they would try to stop barry goldwater from being nominated the book a choice not an echo holds up to this day she wrote a supplement to it as well to bring it up to speed and published that book sometime in the last year or two a choice not an echo was an impactful book and it was one that is one of the foundational documents that identifies the basis of modernday conservatism phyllis schlafly was one of a very few original conservatives here in america she has been one of about three voices that were still active in the public scene that go back to the era in the early 60s for phyllis it goes back as far back as 1946 when she managed a congressional campaign phyllis life has been deeply engaged in this kind of activity she was elected first vice president for the national federation of republican women 1960 to 1964 she was a candidate for congress in 1952 and 1970 in two different districts phyllis received numerous awards she founded the republican national coalition for life in 1990 with the specific mission of protecting the prolife plank in the republican platform and no one has been more active and had more voice on the prolife movement and more effective than phyllis schlafly throughout these years her voice on this public scene will sorely be missed she was a volunteer and a founder of eagle forum the people that worked with and for eagle forum out across through the states came as volunteers she also established offices in all of illinois and here in washington d c and kept a voice and a presence here phyllis schlafly became a conscience for conservatives as we are trying to clarify the meaning of the constitution understand our place in history and stand up for those principles that matter often the voice of phyllis schlafly was echoing in our ears here on the floor of the house of representatives she would gather the young eagles to come here at least once a year usually twice a year to hear from them and give a number of us an opportunity to speak to the young people and take questions but the bright lights that she identified that she brought into activism have made i think a dramatic difference across america as that conscience of conservatism has multiplied across hundreds and then thousands of young eagles that i had an opportunity to meet with and exchange ideas with and listen to one of my stories about phyllis schlafly i will start it first with this when i arrived here in this congress 14 years ago one of the first days that i was here to walk out on this floor to vote i walked back through the back of these chambers and one of the members from missouri todd akin came over to me and introduced himself he said i want to talk to you about court stripping and i said to him you mean article iii section 2 of the constitution and he said yes how do you know that well the reason i had paid attention to that was because it was phyllis schlafly who had written about it in my years that i had been working in my construction office all i ever really wanted to do was raise my family and run my construction business i didnt really think about being involved and trying to be in the middle of public policy i thought there were good reliable people who would be here making those decisions but i would send off for what at that time were little articles that i would callyou had to sign up for them and you had to send off a check and they would send you the mailing of her forum document phyllis was all over the newspapers i cant count all the publications but i know she has published at least 27 books i would read these articles that would show up in these publications maybe the headline caught me but i would skip the author i would read the story i would read the article and boy that is clarity of thought utter clarity of thought and then i would look up who wrote that phyllis schlafly time after time after time before i really knew who phyllis was i was reading her material she was impacting my thinking and i am wondering who wrote this document phyllis schlafly hundreds and thousands of documents hundreds and thousands of analyses that she had done and not only that she was not disciplined to stick to a particular topic i was looking through some of these topics that phyllis had written books on of the 27 books she picked a few topics family and feminism her book on family and feminism the power of the positive woman and feminist fantasies those things that wont come true phyllis schlafly her comment on the judiciary the book called the supremacists the tyranny of judges and how to stop it i have it here i have a story about that i might tell if we have time a little later on religion her book no higher power obamas war on religious freedom her book on nuclear strategy strike from space and kissinger on the couch then her book on education child abuse in the classroom her book on child care who will rock the cradle and on phonics first reader and turbo reader that is an example of the kind of work that phyllis did she wasnt narrow at all in her scope she understood her faith her christianity her religion her role as a mother of six a grandmother a greatgrandmother she understood her role as a wife she understood her role as a student as a law student with a law degree and she understood her role here in america when the era came forwardand it was a mistake then it would be a mistake nowphyllis schlafly when they thought it was all done and the equal rights amendment was going to be ratifiedthere were a few states leftphyllis schlafly started the battle to shut down the era and it was almost singlehanded for a long time but she mobilized a nation and put an end to the equal rights amendment which would have ended up with drafting women into the military there is much going on today that she didnt agree with but we have slowed down this train of liberalism she has been a significant player in it i see that we have some members who have arrived at the floor that i believe would like to add some words to this i yield to the gentleman

evenings of crimson and gold and gray clouds silhouetted against the twilight glow of the evening and then i glanced over to the buildings here at the capitol and was suddenly brought back to reality when i saw so many flags on our buildings flying at half mast flying at half mast because once again we are remembering the tragedies that have shaken our nation time and time again this has been a bloody summer a bloody summer of many attacks that have been associated with folks with mental illness i know most people with mental illness are not violent and i know that there are many other tragedies that occur but tonight during this week which is mental health week in america i want to highlight what we must do as a nation what we cannot continue to push aside just think of what happened this summer just a few examples june 13 attack on the dallas police headquarters by a man who had a history of family violence and mental instability july 23 lafayette louisiana a shooting in a movie theater by a man who had had a judges orders to send him to a mental hospital in the past august 16 antioch tennessee a movie theater attack august 26 roanoke virginia a live onair shooting a tragic scene of a reporter being killed and a cameraman august 28 2015 houston texas while a deputy police officer was at a gas station riddled with bullets by a man who had a history of mental illness september 22 the son of a state senator former state senator of virginia killed a man and also killed himself in bowling green and this last week october 1 in roseburg oregon nine people were killed and the gunman killed himself in another tragic scene there is more to it than this of course in this country last year 125 people with mental illness were killed in some sort of a police shooting where the police oftentimes did not even know but the confrontation grew and ended in a death it is estimated there were somewhere between 1 200 and 1 500 murders in this country this last year by people with mental illness but more than that there are 10 000 or more maybe 20 000 maybe 100 000 people with mental illness who are the victims of crime some are killed there are thousands and thousands of people who are homeless who die that slowmotion death of homelessness of their physical ailments and their illnesses there were 41 000 suicide deaths 1 2 million suicide attempts that required some medical care 43 000 substance abuse overdose deaths this list goes on and on and on and what happens is when we treat people with mental illness early in their life their prognosis is improved in many cases they can go on to have fruitful lives but when it is untreated they likely develop other problems not just with mental illness but social job and physical health persons with serious mental illness in treatment are 15 times less likely to engage in an act of violence than those who are not in treatment in america some 60 million people in any given year will have some diagnosable mental illness from the very mild and transient ones which we all experience to severe mental illness such as schizophrenia or bipolar or extreme depression but of those with serious mental illness about 4 million of those 11 million will not have any treatment for a variety of reasons treatment may not be available they may refuse treatment or what happens so often with those with serious mental illness they are characteristically unaware that they have an illnessit is a brain illness a serious mental illnesslike a person with alzheimers or stroke or traumatic brain injury a person who may not even know that they have a problem what do we do about this as a nation mostly we just talk sadly and tragically what we do here in the house of representatives we will have a moment of silence but it is not followed by action what we need is not more silence we need action we need people in this country to rise up and say this is the time this is the day this is the issue where we are once and for all going to do comprehensive reform of our mental health system in america our mental health system in america is fragmented at best a system with regulations that are abusive and neglectful towards those with serious mental illness and more so it is worse if you are a minority or lowincome this is odd because in a field that is filled with some of the most compassionate and caring people i know people i have had the pleasure to work side by side with in my role as a psychologist we have federal policies and state policies that leave their hands tied their eyes blinded and their mouths gagged to prevent treatment from occurring ultimately the individuals suffer and their families suffer tonight we will review what the problem is and what can be done systemically thoroughly and definitively what this country must do if we are serious about treating mental illness one of my colleagues from the toledo area who represents northern ohio is with us now i yield to the gentlewoman from ohio"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "this bill includes over 9 billion in appropriations for 22 nondefense programs that are not authorized by law nine of these programs

standard upon our private citizens the unitedstates army corps of engineers and the epa go out and purport to be defenders of wetlands good stewards of our wetlands yet the greatest cause of wetlands

and complete them before the august recess unfortunately just as in years past senate democrats prevented consideration of any appropriations bills on the floor of that body this leads us to the unfortunate situation of having to put forward a shortterm cr to fund the government through december 11 this continuing resolution is simple most programs will continue being funded at their fy15 levels however it does adjust certain spending levels for critical needs such as providing 700 million for wildfire suppression activities in the west and it extends several programs that would otherwise lapse like the collection of recreation fees for public lands in addition it maintains the moratorium on state and local jurisdictions taxation of the internet i hope that in the weeks and months ahead the house the senate and the president can come to an agreement on a path forward which ensures we are not in this same place in december some of my colleagues have stated publicly that
