important check on any preimplementation costbenefit analysis and these retrospective reviews better clarify the true costs of regulation even president obama supports retrospective reviews and issued an executive order requiring agencies to conduct them more importantly retrospective reviews work in april of 2014 the gao issued a report on retrospective reviews at 22 executive agencies that report found that more than 90 percent of retrospective regulation reviews led the agencies to revise clarify or eliminate regulation text90 percent however the pace of retrospective review is much slower than planned and the 22 agencies reviewed by the gao had plans to conduct more than 650 retrospective reviews but had only completed 246 of them as of august of as you can see the agencies are already doing this work it is good to go back and review we shouldnt be afraid of that we should encourage it this provision in the bill simply allows congress to work with agencies to prioritize regulatory areas most important to the american taxpayer we need to maintain the ability to make such requests and i urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a few weeks ago i had the pleasure of going to the 50th anniversary commemoration of the vietnam war in little rock and to see all the hugs and emotion at that event truly it was a tumultuous time in our world it was so good to see the healing that those men and women experienced at that 50th anniversary i looked at that table set for the pow mia ceremony and of course i was thinking about

training in 1963 from there sergeant bennett volunteered to go to south vietnam as a special forces adviser with the military assistance command on december 29 1964 his unit was airlifted to a small village after it had been overrun by the viet cong upon landing sergeant bennetts unit was confronted by enemy forces twice he refused extraction by military helicopters as he was concerned for the pilots safety and wanted to continue the fight against the enemy after a furious and courageous battle sergeant bennett was taken prisoner by the viet cong like so many of his colleagues he spent 179 days as a pow and attempted to escape three times at great risk his captors executed him on june 25 1965 only 24 years old sergeant bennett was the first american pow killed in vietnam and like so many other servicemen who lost their lives there his remains have never returned home"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a lot of this is talk and with due respect to my friend from colorado i hear the point but i would say a lot of that is we are hearing we we this we this we the federal we this it really should be we the people at the state we the people at the local level it is important that we get some of the power that we like to monger up here among us in this house to return it back to the states to return it back to the individual school boards who best knows to make these decisions other than these parents and these school boards we talk about accountability as dr phil would say how has that been working for us the last 40 years we need to get the accountability back to where it goes where

of this house thinks this deal is bad a majority of the senate thinks this deal is bad and a majority of the american people think this deal is bad we have not had any input and the effort here today is to simply make a bad deal a little less bad the idea behind mr meehans bill is to provide restitution to american victims it is not just any american victims it is the victims of iranian terror 150 billion is going to flow to iran it seems to be common sense that the first 43 billion should instead be paid to the victims of iranian terror joseph cicippio was one of those victims he lived right outside my congressional district he spent 5 years in brutal captivity before being released in 1991 a vote for this bill today is a vote for the victims of iranian terror i also want to say congressman meehans congressional district is right next to mine i want to thank him for his thoughtful creative approach and his leadership in this country and in this house on this bill"]]}
