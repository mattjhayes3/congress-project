reinventing history secretary of state albright was announcing that north korea is not a terrorist state or even a rogue state but merely a state of concern this member points this out because of the recent changes in perception regarding north korea on the verge of collapse the hermit kingdom is at least attempting to give the impression that it is reaching out to south korea and to the west if north korea is in fact sincere in its peaceful overtures that certainly would be a dramatic positive development however it would be premature to assume that the dprk has irrevocably reformed its behavior it would be naive in the extreme to believe that a few gestures constitute a reversion of 50 years of violently confrontational behavior and terrorism and it would be foolish to pretend that north korea no longer deserves to be labeled as a terrorist state in recent days a historic meeting has occurred between the north and south korean leaders kim dae jung went to pyongyang and promised to open the spigots of foreign assistance although at the norths insistence it is called economic cooperation that is the south gives and the north cooperates by accepting in return the north has promised to permit some longawaited family reunions of those who have been torn from their families 50 years ago from a public relations standpoint north korea scored a remarkable victory kim jong il was described as cherubic in the new york times and amazingly senior administration officials called him courageous and visionary but the question remains has kim jong i1 and the totalitarian elite that rules north korea made a commitment to peace when one examines north koreas record on weapons of mass destruction missiles and support for terrorism it is not at all clear that it has made a permanent commitment to peace despite the 1994 agreed framework that was touted as capping the north korean nuclear threat there is ample evidence that pyongyang continues to pursue an undeclared nuclear program an unclassified 1998 cia report concludes that north korea possesses between 6 and 12 kilograms of plutonium which it acquired before the yongbyon nuclear reactor was shut down in 1995 this weaponsgrade material has not been accounted for in addition press reports from publications such as janes intelligence review suggest the dprk has continued its efforts to acquire uranium enrichment technologies in 1998 a secret underground facility was discovered that certainly seemed like it was related to nuclear activities i hope that north korea has made a change but we need to see exactly what it has done before we reach any new conclusions about its intentions according to the congressional research service russian and former east german nuclear scientists are operating in north korea in contrast to the time when the 1994 agreed framework was signed north korea seems on the threshold of being able to attack the united states with a missile that could deliver chemical biological or possibly nuclear weapons it has produced deployed and exported missiles to several countries of great concern to the united states the dprk has launched a threestage taepodong 1 missile and continues to develop a larger longerrange missile the taepodong 2 not only does north korea now possess a missile capable of reaching unitedstates soil but it is clear that it intends to sell such fully developed weapons systems to the highest bidder according to a 1999 national intelligence estimate the proliferation of mediumrange ballistic missilesdriven primarily by north korean no dong saleshas created an immediate serious and growing threat to unitedstates forces interests and allies and has significantly altered the strategic balances in the middle east and africa while individuals in the executive branch argue that north korea has agreed to halt its missile program it is important to note that the north only has agreed to a moratorium on flight tests design rocket motor tests production and sales to other socalled states of concern can continue it was just last week at negotiations that took place between unitedstates and north korean officials that the dprk flatly refused to halt development of missiles instead they made it clear that development of new and more capable missiles will continue in addition north korea demanded 1 billion to impose a moratorium on new missile exports unfortunately this is all too typical of the norths pattern of threats and extortion north korea insists that it is not a terrorist state but its past and even recent actions certainly suggest otherwise the dprk has remained a haven for the terrorists of the japanese red army faction pyongyang regularly has infiltrated training and resupply teams into south korea and japan other actions include border violations infiltration of armed saboteurs and spies hijacking kidnapping assassination and threats against media personnel and institutions to finance these terrorist activities north korea uses counterfeit unitedstates currency recently a japanese red army terrorist was caught while traveling in southeast asia with a north korean diplomatic passport this terrorist was carrying over 100 000 in counterfeit currency in short north korea has not to date behaved like a country wishing to join the international family of nations former secretary of defense william perry a truly outstanding public servant was tasked with reviewing unitedstates policy toward north korea he concluded that north korea had two options the first option would be the path of engagement if the dprk really sheds its rogue behavior the united states should respond with a reduction of sanctions and gradual extension of normal political and commercial activity if however the dprk chooses the path of confrontation the perryrecommended policy is that the united states and our allies must meet the norths aggressiveness with firmness resolve and military might it must be clear that america would respond in that fashion it is far too early to tell which path the dprk will choose it is possible that they will opt for peaceful engagement america and south korea obviously hope that it is the path the dprk will choose but we must end the cycle of extortion which the north has successfully pursued with the united states one insubstantive summit meeting does not guarantee such a sea change in behavior this nation must maintain its resolve to preposition 100 000 troops in the asiapacific area with 37 000 on the korean peninsula we must resist the temptation to throw even more money at the north without demonstrable progress in reducing the threat and we must continue to aggressively pursue the development of ballistic missile defenses capable of defending this nation against the emerging ballistic missile threata threat made evermore immediate by the north korean missile development program and its missile exports this member genuinely hopes that north korea will one day become merely a state of concern but until this member sees ample evidence to the contrary he must continue to view north korea as a terrorist state and to regard the korean peninsula as the place on the globe where american forces might again be attacked and a tragically costly war begun again"], [0.0, 0.0, 0, "a couple of different points that i want to make here one is that this is a very difficult process we have a budget agreement that the president says he supports that all of us in congress say we support that calls for very difficult appropriations levels and quite bluntly none of us are really happy with it we want to keep the budget caps we are trying to stay with the budget agreement we all go out home and say we want to save all this money for social security but when it comes to each bill it is always well we really need this we really need that we have been trying to save a little bit of money in each one because a number of us strongly felt that while everybody talks about the need to stay within the budget agreement the fact is that the money we had on the table for laborhhs for interior and veterans was not sufficient and that every side was kind of doing a winkwink and saying well we are trying to try to stay within the caps and within the budget agreement knowing we were not working towards that every dollar we save in this appropriations bill the agriculture appropriations bill is going to be able to be used for those programs that the gentleman from wisconsin and others have said they are concerned about and will help us preserve social security that is the real tradeoff yes it will be difficult for members offices to live under a freeze which is in effect a reduction but we also gave each member of congress flexibility to move their funds around and most members do not even spend their full account furthermore this is another round in my opinion of pick on the majority whip the plain truth of the matter is that the majority and minority are both getting the same amount of money in this we reduced in this agreement the amendment that will be offered the money going to leadership not by a lot but by some this amendment does not really please anybody but at least it moves the ball forward and reduces some funds overall the minority leader the gentleman from missouri gets the same amount as the majority whip he can either give it to the minority whip or do it elsewhere the fact is that early on for many different reasons in the majority side the whips office was disproportionately cut in its budget that is why the majority is choosing to put the money in the whips office the minority has the same amount of funds what is good for one side is good for the other we have also reduced the committee spending we need to lead by example every dollar we can save in the operations that support congress in our own operations in all of the many organizations here we can put into educating our children into the health concerns raised by the gentleman from california in the difference diseases we can put it into our national defense that is one of the problems here we have just seen all of our secrets in our military offensive and defensive pc tentially be at risk to china at the same time unless we spend more money in defense we are completely vulnerable if we spend more money there it squeezes elsewhere i believe this amount of sacrifice is minimal on our parts and it is courageous because normally congress does not allow any amendment on the leg branch i think there should be more

foolish to pretend that north korea no longer deserves to be labeled as a terrorist state in recent days a historic meeting has occurred between the north and south korean leaders kim dae jung went to pyongyang and promised to open the spigots of foreign assistance although at the norths insistence it is called economic cooperation that is the south gives and the north cooperates by accepting in return the north has promised to permit some longawaited family reunions of those who have been torn from their families 50 years ago from a public relations standpoint north korea scored a remarkable victory kim jong il was described as cherubic in the new york times and amazingly senior administration officials called him courageous and visionary but the question remains has kim jong i1 and the totalitarian elite that rules north korea made a commitment to peace when one examines north koreas record on weapons of mass destruction missiles and support for terrorism it is not at all clear that it has made a permanent commitment to peace despite the 1994 agreed framework that was touted as capping the north korean nuclear threat there is ample evidence that pyongyang continues to pursue an undeclared nuclear program an unclassified 1998 cia report concludes that north korea possesses between 6 and 12 kilograms of plutonium which it acquired before the yongbyon nuclear reactor was shut down in 1995 this weaponsgrade material has not been accounted for in addition press reports from publications such as janes intelligence review suggest the dprk has continued its efforts to acquire uranium enrichment technologies in 1998 a secret underground facility was discovered that certainly seemed like it was related to nuclear activities i hope that north korea has made a change but we need to see exactly what it has done before we reach any new conclusions about its intentions according to the congressional research service russian and former east german nuclear scientists are operating in north korea in contrast to the time when the 1994 agreed framework was signed north korea seems on the threshold of being able to attack the united states with a missile that could deliver chemical biological or possibly nuclear weapons it has produced deployed and exported missiles to several countries of great concern to the united states the dprk has launched a threestage taepodong 1 missile and continues to develop a larger longerrange missile the taepodong 2 not only does north korea now possess a missile capable of reaching unitedstates soil but it is clear that it intends to sell such fully developed weapons systems to the highest bidder according to a 1999 national intelligence estimate the proliferation of mediumrange ballistic missilesdriven primarily by north korean no dong saleshas created an immediate serious and growing threat to unitedstates forces interests and allies and has significantly altered the strategic balances in the middle east and africa while individuals in the executive branch argue that north korea has agreed to halt its missile program it is important to note that the north only has agreed to a moratorium on flight tests design rocket motor tests production and sales to other socalled states of concern can continue it was just last week at negotiations that took place between unitedstates and north korean officials that the dprk flatly refused to halt development of missiles instead they made it clear that development of new and more capable missiles will continue in addition north korea demanded 1 billion to impose a moratorium on new missile exports unfortunately this is all too typical of the norths pattern of threats and extortion north korea insists that it is not a terrorist state but its past and even recent actions certainly suggest otherwise the dprk has remained a haven for the terrorists of the japanese red army faction pyongyang regularly has infiltrated training and resupply teams into south korea and japan other actions include border violations infiltration of armed saboteurs and spies hijacking kidnapping assassination and threats against media personnel and institutions to finance these terrorist activities north korea uses counterfeit unitedstates currency recently a japanese red army terrorist was caught while traveling in southeast asia with a north korean diplomatic passport this terrorist was carrying over 100 000 in counterfeit currency in short north korea has not to date behaved like a country wishing to join the international family of nations former secretary of defense william perry a truly outstanding public servant was tasked with reviewing unitedstates policy toward north korea he concluded that north korea had two options the first option would be the path of engagement if the dprk really sheds its rogue behavior the united states should respond with a reduction of sanctions and gradual extension of normal political and commercial activity if however the dprk chooses the path of confrontation the perryrecommended policy is that the united states and our allies must meet the norths aggressiveness with firmness resolve and military might it must be clear that america would respond in that fashion it is far too early to tell which path the dprk will choose it is possible that they will opt for peaceful engagement america and south korea obviously hope that it is the path the dprk will choose but we must end the cycle of extortion which the north has successfully pursued with the united states one insubstantive summit meeting does not guarantee such a sea change in behavior this nation must maintain its resolve to preposition 100 000 troops in the asiapacific area with 37 000 on the korean peninsula we must resist the temptation to throw even more money at the north without demonstrable progress in reducing the threat and we must continue to aggressively pursue the development of ballistic missile defenses capable of defending this nation against the emerging ballistic missile threata threat made evermore immediate by the north korean missile development program and its missile exports this member genuinely hopes that north korea will one day become merely a state of concern but until this member sees ample evidence to the contrary he must continue to view north korea as a terrorist state and to regard the korean peninsula as the place on the globe where american forces might again be attacked and a tragically costly war begun again"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a couple of different points that i want to make here one is that this is a very difficult process we have a budget agreement that the president says he supports that all of us in congress say we support that calls for very difficult appropriations levels and quite bluntly none of us are really happy with it we want to keep the budget caps we are trying to stay with the budget agreement we all go out home and say we want to save all this money for social security but when it comes to each bill it is always well we really need this we really need that we have been trying to save a little bit of money in each one because a number of us strongly felt that while everybody talks about the need to stay within the budget agreement the fact is that the money we had on the table for laborhhs for interior and veterans was not sufficient and that every side was kind of doing a winkwink and saying well we are trying to try to stay within the caps and within the budget agreement knowing we were not working towards that every dollar we save in this appropriations bill the agriculture appropriations bill is going to be able to be used for those programs that the gentleman from wisconsin and others have said they are concerned about and will help us preserve social security that is the real tradeoff yes it will be difficult for members offices to live under a freeze which is in effect a reduction but we also gave each member of congress flexibility to move their funds around and most members do not even spend their full account furthermore this is another round in my opinion of pick on the majority whip the plain truth of the matter is that the majority and minority are both getting the same amount of money in this we reduced in this agreement the amendment that will be offered the money going to leadership not by a lot but by some this amendment does not really please anybody but at least it moves the ball forward and reduces some funds overall the minority leader the gentleman from missouri gets the same amount as the majority whip he can either give it to the minority whip or do it elsewhere the fact is that early on for many different reasons in the majority side the whips office was disproportionately cut in its budget that is why the majority is choosing to put the money in the whips office the minority has the same amount of funds what is good for one side is good for the other we have also reduced the committee spending we need to lead by example every dollar we can save in the operations that support congress in our own operations in all of the many organizations here we can put into educating our children into the health concerns raised by the gentleman from california in the difference diseases we can put it into our national defense that is one of the problems here we have just seen all of our secrets in our military offensive and defensive pc tentially be at risk to china at the same time unless we spend more money in defense we are completely vulnerable if we spend more money there it squeezes elsewhere i believe this amount of sacrifice is minimal on our parts and it is courageous because normally congress does not allow any amendment on the leg branch i think there should be more but normally we do not allow any tonight we are taking a very important step that no other congress has done"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a couple of years ago when ratings for

was astounded absolutely astounded first of all he is wrong we are not planning to do that what is even worse although i have been here only 5 years i did serve under a democratic administration of this house thatfirst year i was here not only did we take social security money and spend it we took every cent of social security money and spent it not only did we take all of the social security moneyand spend it but we spent a couple of hundred billion dollars beyond that and added that to the national debt that is what we had 5 years ago here in this house under democratic control today the republicans are controlling it we are not adding to the national debt we are trying not to spend a cent of social security to get our budget out what a dramatic change and to have someone from the

american people to lock away every penny of the social security surplus so that washington bigspenders could not keep raiding the funds to spend on government programs now we have the opportunity to meet this commitment if only president clinton will stop playing partisan games with the retirement dollars of hardworking americans when the president says we cannot trim waste 1 percent from the massive federal budget in order to protect social security i cannot help but question his priorities paying for more wasteful spending of taxpayer dollars or protecting social security the choice is simple as we close in on a final budget let us be very clear on one thing we will not go home until every penny of the social security trust fund is protected and we are not going to raise taxes on

much too serious to leave to the generals i rise today to say exactly the opposite war is far too important to be left to politicians today the house stands on the verge of sending the senate a bill that may very well terminate the f22 program on one side we have a carefully planned smoothly executed plan by politicians to scrap the fighter on the other side we have every general in the pentagon telling us our national security will suffer a fatal blow if we choose to give up air dominance in the next century in a letter to congress last week secretary of defense william cohen told us that canceling the f22 program means we cannot guarantee air superiority in future conflicts six former secretaries of defense have echoed secretary cohens words calling the f22a essential program that must be fully funded make no mistake about it if we cancelthe f22 we are making a decision to stake the lives of american soldiers on inferior equipment because some in congress think they know more about air warfare than the united states air force ironically canceling the f22 wont even accomplish its stated goal of saving money secretary cohen has told us the alternative to the f22 an upgraded f15 already over 25 years old will cost the same as the f22 but will not provide air dominance the secretary has also told uscorrectlythat not only will the joint strike fighter or jsf be unable to fill the air superiority role it will also be unable to handle its strike role without f22 support this is the legislative equivalent of rejecting a cadillac in order to buy a yugo for twice the price the jsf is not was never contemplated to be and cannot be made into the f22 it is not an airsuperiority fighter it is a subsonic tactical fighter that goes into a conflict after the f22 establishes air dominance the jsf cannot itself establish air dominance in september of 1939 neville chamberlain told the british people to go home and rest easy because he hadpurchased peace for our time the following september an unprepared great britain began a fight for its life with nazi germany we must not make a longterm mistake for a shortterm gain by canceling the f22 we must not allow our easy victory in kosovo to lead us to mistakenly assume we will always have air superiority again the facts are clear firstthis decision may very well end the f22 program by raising future costs so high we will not be able to restart it later secondwithout the f22 american forces will to a certainty be outgunned by the next generation of missiles and aircraft already nearing production by three nations russia france and sweden each of which is ready to use them or sell them to the highest bidders thirdby giving up air superiority we are encouraging our enemies to attack us and ensuring that young americans will pay on the battlefields of the future only a few short years away in short we will have rejected the wisdom of george washington who told congress o be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace the ancient chinese military strategist sun tzu said the same thing two thousand years ago when he wrote that ictorious warriors win first and then go to war while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win if congress kills the f22 program we will pay dearly later for ignoring this sage advice now"]]}
