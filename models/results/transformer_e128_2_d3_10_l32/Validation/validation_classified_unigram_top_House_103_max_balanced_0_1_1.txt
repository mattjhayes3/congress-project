geneiral montgomery and meeting admiral howe over at the compound i went back to the ranger base found out we had a twostar general there nothing wrong with not announcing that spoke to him he took me to his men i saw how they lived and where they lived and i said does anybody know of a gunner or crewman from the third helicopter that made it back to new port and crashed with the ranger on board with his leg blown off and one door gunner with his hand pierced by fire and they said sure well get him for you and they got me a young man mason is his first name and i said these two heroic rangers that should get the medal of honor from fort bragg special special special ops guys i said did they fast rope down into hell itself no sir we went right down on the deck three or four feet off the deck they jumped off did they have bandoleers around them extra rifles for the crew to create a perimeter of six guys to wait for a rescue i said they have radios no sir he said they jumped right out of the helicopter ran to durants helicopter second down ofthree and he said they got durant out they got ray frank out 31 combat months in vietnam 1 year younger than clinton there is a story of two young americans with different lives and he said as he got them out we took an rpg in the side that is when the ranger behind them lost his leg and they pulled up went back to newport leaving the durant crew durant plus three his copilot ray frank or pilots they are both pilotsthe two pilots the two door gunners and the two rangers left those six alone we never got to them ever until 11 oclock at night and nothing was left but blood expended 7 6 ammo and expended 9 millimeter ammo and durant said himself that he fought until he was out of ammunition the call went out to the first helicopter within minutes and they ginned up within minutes so i repeat it on this floor with general montgomery the only time i saw him really get upset was he said no malaysian had to be at gunpoint ordered to help they all wanted to help but as soon as it started to get dark they had no night vision capability they didnt know which armored vehicle to use the column was led up to the k4 circle by he said a deuce and a half truck that was kicked with an rpg grenade when the rangers came out the next morning they came that same route i learned up at walter reed yesterday and they said it was an unrelenting gauntlet of automatic weapons and rpgs all the way back in the 15th hour of the fight so the call went out immediately generalmontgomery said he started trying to rally a rescue force because now we go from unitedstates command to quick reaction force under admiral howe in the united nations they were ginned up in about an hour as they start up the road still in daylight they hit this first big k4 circle near the airport and get hit with incredible fire and the two mountain division guys and four malaysians give their lives greater love than this no man has trying to reach the site they never got any further than k4 from that point while it is daylightit was not until the dead of night between 11 and 12 oclockthat we got other groups the rangers meanwhile from the airport to save their own they start up a main road right from this big catholic church area i will show my colleagues the old downtown they hit an ambush right away the aideed forces have motorola radios they were up on the radios instantly the coordination was frightening and one of the rangers from his hospital bed yesterday said sir we were up against 20 000 men i said no people women children i said nobody is going to believe me if i say 20 000 i said if it was ten its frightening he said well let me put it this way congressman in any one scene looking down a street or an alley we saw hundreds of people my sergeant took a bullet right in his throat he was dead instantly dropped i said to him officer you want me to take that gun he said i got up on the gun turret 40 millimeter grenade launcher and he said here are women coming at me with a grenade launcher ammunition around their bodies these rocket propelled grenades and he said and children at their sides and i said what do you do and he said fire then he said donovan bliley and cliff and i forget his last name i will get it and put it in the record the two pilots from the first helicopter to go down they didnt get hit out of the sky he said we were being so massively assaulted that cliff and donovan came down over the crowd bent that big h60 up in the area he said its now light got a 701 powerful engine he said i have never seen a guy do things with a helicopter like this and they got down over the crowd and blew people literally away with the downdraft of the helicopter including women and children he said were firing and he keeps doing that with his helicopter were yelling for emergency help then they hit him with a rocket propelled grenade he goes down hard the pilots body is trapped in the and i do not know which one is trapped in the wreckage and i want to put in an article from the new york times monday the day before yesterday where some person in the pentagon and the rangers up at the hospital told me about this article so i got it a senior military officer at the pentagon is critical of the rangers decision to stay with the body it was an emotional response open to question they told me this guy unnamed doesnt know anything about rangers and their creed put that in the article but let me quickly go through the rest of these pictures this is the university look at the size of this complex that the italians and the british left behind that was a thriving university complex now it is the u n headquarters a university of education turns into a war compound because of warring clans the daroods against the hawayi now here is again just quickly all the that is one of our field hospitals there is the greeks there is the nigerians all of this effort in here cannot be collapsed overnight here is the downtown area i want to hold this still i saw this big huge cathedral i assumed because of the italian colonial period it was a catholic cathedral was is correct there is not a roof on it it looks like coventry after a luftwaffe bombing half of these buildings around here are gutted this once beautiful city is utterly destroyed all it is now is a series of broken buildings where people can hide with machineguns ak47s and rocketpropelled grenades just another shot of these black hawks i know a contract has been let in california to a ballistics expert to find out why

colleagues on the other side of the aisle and two on this side of the aisle to just be talking in simple terms about what is so essential the only reason why we deserve to be here is to do the right thing and i looked at what would happen if president clintons package had not passed and we just continued with what seems to be happening spending would have gone up 27 percent the national debt would go up 48 percent but with his package spending still goes up 23 percent and the national debt still will go up 40 percent and the administration and i say this not being critical of a democrat versus a republican i say this by the mere fact that the administration seems content with this 40percent increase in the national debt they have to be content with it because you have a good faith effort on the part of democrats and republicans to reduce this deficit more and i feel like this is a group that should be nurtured i think there should be press just doing everything they can to get this story out we need the american people to know that there is a bipartisan effort to cut this national deficit so we just do not keep adding to the national debt fortypercent increase in the national debt people say that is a smaller increase than in past years it is but it is on such a higher base the absolute increase in the national debt is 1 6 trillion in the next 5 years one reason i am not discouraged john when you do come to my officesometimes i am discouraged when you are not aroundbut you have given me a tremendous feeling of participating in something that is so important and you tim pfny i am as grateful as i can be for the both of you you have hielped lead a coalition of republicans and democrats if you were not there we would not have that kind of leadership we would all be frustrated in our own way we are a force a smaller force now but the reason i know we will gain in momentum is the problem is not going away that is the thing the problem is still there it is getting worse i had a meeting with a high administration official and since it was a oneonone meeting i will just say it was someone very high up i went to plead with that individual that they at least if they cannot support the pennykasich deficit reduction plan do not oppose it let the house argue on it because if the administration were just neutral this wouldpass what we are dealing with right now is a concerted effort to kill and destroy and stamp down on something that is starting to grow that could help the administration i consider my three colleagues on the democratic side the best friends the administration has and the sad thing is they do not seem to know it i think we are the best friends they could have because the problem does not go away i went to this high government official i said the national debt is 4 trillion now in 5 years it is going to be 6 trillion interest on the national debt is going up 27 percent in the next 5 years i am thinking that is money we could be spending on programs and we would not be jlt spending it on interest on the national debt more than 50 percent of our personal income goes to pay interest on the national debt it blows my mind when i am paying all my taxes and you are paying all your taxes 50 percent of it is going to pay interest on the national debt you know what i do when i have people come and complain about the pennykasich plan i say im going to spend as much time as you want to talk about it but first i want to tell you something i want to tell you that the national debt is going up 40 percent that it is going up 1 6 trillion and that we are going to be spending 3250 billion on interest on the national debt in the fifth year that could be going for other programs 3250 billion not 250 million 250 billion interest on the national debt that is why i am voting for the pennykasich plan and one of these groups said to me but wait a second there is 100 million of real good programs is here i said you are right there is s100 million of real good programs in fact there are even some more that i like but i am supposed to vote against the pennykasich plan because there is 100 million that i like and yet this cuts 390 billion so i am going to prevent us from cutting 90 billion because i want to save 100 or 3200 million i said is that not the reason why we are in this mess the one thing that i remember and i will conclude this way i remember when president jimmy carter talked about his daughter and he talking to his daughter about national defense and we all laughed but there are times you look at your daughter or your child or your children friends and you say when they ask me what did i do was i part of the problem or part of the solution i want to tell them i was part of the solution i will conclude by saying this i am absolutely convinced that whether or not pennykasich passes and i pray on bended knee it passes but if it does not this is the beginning because we are not going to go away we are not going to give up we are tough enough to deal with this these letters that we are getting from chairmen that are saying if you vote against us you are going to lose out you know they are one kind of view they are the old kind of view but they have no impact ultimately because the problem is not going away and we are going to have to deal with it now or later the only problem is if we wait later the medicine may almost kill the patient we have to act now as soon as possible i wanted to conclude and say praise the lord for members on both sides of the aisle you mr penny and mr finomrhut and mr andrews and your colleagues that are with you you are doing the right thing it is really an honor a privilege to be part of this with you you helped restore my faith that what we are

months since it was promised states taxpayers your constituents mine the other members on the floor and about 50 or so watching in their offices that these six taxpayerfunded cameras would stop prowling an empty hall to embarrass us and give the impression that we are speaking in a cave of winds when we know from cspan cable operators all across this country the audience is creeping past 1 200 000 people i went out to chicago for our beloved colleague mr crane and did three events for him at every event people came up and said i like to listen to some of the things you say but i always feel sorry for you all alone in that big chamber i said yeah you and 1 250 000 other people i said if you are watching just remember all those people are watching with you now i have mentioned several times last week and this morning that 8 or 9 days ago when i was in somalia my nikkon camera did not let me down and i got some pictures that will help illustrate as confucius says one picture is worth a thousand words and if it is a good picture sometimes it is worth an essay i brought out of about three rolls of film that i took and this is againi know that camera has the technology to come down and frame this corner to corner whether they stay way back sitting downstairs in the control room give me a break guys and galsif you stay way back you are insulting americans who are paying your salary you are paid by taxpayers do not be so far back with your lens which is capable of coming in on tight on this so that the people do not know what i am referring to and make me out to be a jerk e 1850 i am sorry i should have referred to the control room through the speaker that was a c6 galaxy that is what i flew in over there two refueling missions on the first flight over this was a refueling c135 tanker a kc135 out of plattsburgh ny and the young man that you see up there in the boomers operation is from michigan and i am sorry i tried to memorize his name and forgot but that is a great team effort in that big c5 galaxy which is like a flying apartment house it is well not everybody in the c6 squadrons i found out are qualified to sit in the pilot seat when they are doing refueling or doing it from the copilots seat here is what it looks like coming into mogadishu now my pal who is an infantry paratropper from california was with the 75th rangers in the 173rd airborne brigade congressman duncan hunter of san diego said well how can you say it is a small city when it looks so big well the airport is so small we had to orbit for about 20 minutes because it can only hold two 05s at a time it is obviously under mortar fire sometimes what i meant by small city of course it is 700 000 people that is about 130 000 more than the city of d c but nevertheless you can see the perimeter of the desert all around the city and when a helicopter pope up 1 500 feet to 2 000 feet you can see the entire city here is the black hawk helicopter i clicked that picture as i was running to the helicopter to get on board that is the c6 in the background and within less than 4 minutes on the ground i was up in the air taxiing in i photographed the worlds largest helicopter it is not american it is a mi26 it is soviet and of course it never goes in harms way it is the worlds largest helicopter i was not in the air with the american number 2 in command the number one in command at the united nations forces under admiral howe is a turkish threestar general civik bir i had lunch with him a tremendous gentleman a little uncomfortable with most of his fighting forces under him were american but the twostar general under him is major general thomas montgomery he met me at the airplane and took me on that helicopter i am now sitting at his side with a flack jacket on i have got my armored helmet off but i have a headset on and i am talking to him i look down and i say what are those british challenger tanks and he said no were calling for a tank its painted white isnt it these are russian t72s but they are owned by india i said these are indian main battle tanks i said general tell me they were not here october 3rd during the rescue mission that took 9 hours to one site 11 to the other there was nobody left there they had been overrun durant survived the other five beaten to death their bodies desecrated alive and dead and i said what are they doing here and he said well i know what youre thinking congressman i called them in the dead of night and they said they had to check with delhi as in new delhi the capital of india so much for the rescue force just maybe 8 minutes away from the k4 circle which we tried to go through when it was still daylight on the afternoon of sunday october 3rd and the first lead truck what the guys call a deuce and a half 5 000 pound truck it was hit by an rpg two members of the 10th mountain division were wounded fatally one died on the site the other died 3 days later up in germany at the landstuhl army hospital as soon as we got back and started to circle the city here is what they call old port they are tiny why are we even in mogadishu they have got 5 or 6 ports the others are just as big as this why did we pick aideeds stronghold to set up in this is old port here is new port now i just found out this afternoon from a newsday reporter patrick told me that we lost a helicopter early in the morning on october 3 i find that out you know weeks later and i am on the intelligence committee it was unrelated to that attack on aideeds men at the olympic hotel so four helicopters went down that day one was lost 8 days earlier to an rpg on october 25 more about that in a second the third helicopter lost in the assault number five overall made it back and crashed on the dock here one of the rangers from fort bragg has his leg blown off in that helicopter he is alive in a hospital i hope to see him soon in the next week all five from that helicopter got down all right but the helicopter was totaled and i said where is it i want to see it they said it was packed onto a c5 and taken back to the united states here is the site of the crash right here an ambulance got right there and they got these guys back to the hospital compound where heroic men and women do excellent work they kept a lot of our 87 wounded alive during this october 3 and 4 a 15hour firefight is what the rangers up at walter reed hospital told me yesterday afternoon not 7 not 9 not 11 they told me 15 hours is how long that went then we circle back around to give you an idea of the equipment we have in there and why i plead in this well to get out of somalia as fast as we can meant at a minimum 2 or 3 months look at the amount of equipment we have at sword base on the old destroyed once beautiful university campus at hunter base here is a shot of the beaches along the coast this tempts our young guys to go out when they are sweating on construction projects go in the water four people have died by shark bite somebody told me two americans i can only find one who was kept alive until he got back to walter reed here and his family was flown to his side they were at his side when he died thanks to the excellent care of our americans he lost both his legs in that shark attack i know two foreigners were killed back there in the summertime we have no control over them general montgomery said his order always was and still stands no swimming in the surf whatsoever for americans general montgomery said he has had to give orders that he will discipline any superior who allows any of his men to go in the water here it gives you an idea of the air base now i have excellent pictures all over the air base ranger compound headquarters compound many of the faces of the senior older late 20s up to 45 years of age and ray frank who gave his life for us in a foreign policy nobody can figure out including the wounded up at walter reed but i cannot show you those pictures because they have been hit by mortar fire and they are just too good and i do not want to show the faces of our special forces out of fort bragg they sometimes get into movie titles or our rangers out of fort benning or the guys who train and fly them the 160th special operations aviation regiment out of fort campbell which i hope to visit monday but this shot of the airport is kind of nondescript it is the civilian side two small hughes helicopters rotten decaying buildings but i want you to see the high ground here all of the high ground mogadishu rises from the waters edge all the way up to a pinnacle and on that top highest ground is the olympic hotel here it is with god helping me with cloud cover that kind of highlighted like a heavenly light the olympic hotel the big hotel across the street this is where our rangers fast roped down in the afternoon of october 3 between 3 and 3 30 one ranger died in that operation they had to cross the street go up here to an aldeed compound where they took 24 prisoners and then hell hit four of the adeed prisoners were killed by other somalis firing wildly into them they got their men into humvees i asked a lieutenant lying in walter reed his wife beth was next to him they had saved his leg fought all week to save it he showed me his leg four big pins sticking into it but he was a tough typical ranger smiling and i said well you had armored humvees with the special opts he said yes sir armoredtranslate thatcardboard he got hit with an ak right through the side of the humvee here is where the clouds and the light are helping me again big cloud around here i did not touch this photograph bright lights shining on the high ground you cannot quite see the rise here but everybody at all our military installations old port new port the international airport the headquarters of the rangers over sword base hunter base everybody could see the smoke from this fire fight coming up three to four four to five five to six six to seven when it starts getting dark and all night long the sky filled with helicopters and exploding rocket propelled grenades and they are not the expert marksmen i had suspected i asked the men at the hospital yesterday and they said sir you cant see them going through the sky but you can see a rocket propelled grenade when it explodes and they were salvoing they had more ammunition than we could ever have conceived of they said the ak47 fire started within the first hour and the staccato was deafening for the next 4 or 5 hours and we were not sniped at it was constant unrelenting automatic machine gun fire from ak47s and they said it was the worst fire fight we all believe since world war h and i am not going to doubt their word"], [0.45928364992141724, 0.45928364992141724, 0, "i cannot believe there are 700 000 people there i had in my minds eye larger than it is when we popped up in the helicopter i could see the october 21 road that is named after the october 21 1969 revolution when aideed as a chief of staff of the army helped clad beret overthrow the prior government from that road i could see nothing but desert i could see from the indian encampment on the south i could see the base named after the gentleman from california hunter base sword base the university complex the united nations compound i could see on the top of the hill the only place we would not fly was this swollen large hump of land covered with the better buildings and at the very top of it three white buildings one of them the olympic hotel that the rangers hit in bright daylight about 3 oclotk in the afternoon on sunday october 3 and that ts what i wanted to comment on maybe it ti because we are used to living around cities where there is so much traffic that even though we eonquered most of the smog particularly in los angeles i think only 2 alert days last year we are used to the results of light industry and lots of transportation and mobility we do not know what crisp air is until we get up in the mountains or go to idaho or wyoming or up where we sometimes go up in the shenandoah and you say look at those stars feel this clear air the first thing that hit me because they destroyed even the light industry the crisp air visibility as far as your eye is capable of seeing and there is the whole city laid out in front of me newport is tiny one pier oldport is tinier with a big rusting freighter half sinking in the water right off the coast i am looking down at the water and one of the crew reminds me because i have told them about the shark dead he said lot of sharks down there we have had two shark deaths general montgomery told me his orders are that no one goes in that water and the beaches are gorgeous it looks like our coast from laguna down to the district of the gentleman from california really beautiful so we land at this airport of course it is all torn apart from years of neglect the rangers are off here to the side it has been in the print that that is where the 75th third battalion is at i get in the helicopter we pop up i fly over those t72 tanks we curve around the south bend and we start up past hunter base which i know aideed recently was considering making a major assault on he did not care about casualties it is like ho chi minh he calls and whistles out to his clan in the desert nomadic clan send me some more young men to be used as cannon fodder we fly up the october 21 highway and there is the famous cigarette factory where there has been much fighting then a little further there is the huge pasta factory i guess that is leftover from years of italian colonial rule big tall rocket holes into the side of the building where there have been fire fights all along the october 21 road which i could not see on satellite imagry in past briefings roadblocks everywhere rusted beat up broken old vehicles tires rocks bricks everything furniture all along this road which they claim they are going to try to clear i look down and here are 200 camels i said what is that he said its a camel bazaar i said what selling camels and he said yes for meat he said its kind of like a used car lot here are people living in hovels with green tarpaulin covers over them then it must go back hundreds of years like the old siouk area hundreds of tiny little fortress houses all jammed together and all of a sudden here is a residential area with gutted buildings where architects from europe must have tried to win a war they are so stylized triangles trapezoids isosceles triangles all these strange buildings we go around by the old port area i wanted to see where the helicopter had crashed the third special forces h60 and i looked out and here is a catholic church totally gutted i mean a cathedral a twin spire massive cathedral with the roof gone like it was coventry in bombedout england i looked down at a mosque it is not much better but it has been put back in shape and then a guy says follow me congressman see that block down there come to this intersection see these four big trucks thats the wreckage of our humvee where four american mps were killed on august 8 still there in the street then we circled around back i said i want to see where the helicopter crashed on september 25 and we got no remains back from on two of the three killed the wreckage is still there laying on the street and they showed me the scrape marks where it hit this large building clipped this mosque went into the street and that was about 2 30 in the morning that a firefight started there later in the day i heard that we have a 10th mountain soldier trying to rescue the two warrant officers and we did rescue them who took a bullet in his neck he is a paraplegic then they said another one of my young troops in the 10th mountain division lost an arm and a leg gordon sullivan had told me this before i left the fourstar chief of staff of the army he said we had a lot of men injured in that i have not even begun to track where they are how they are doing from the long firefight through the night and into the morning of september 25 but i have to correct something i said earlier and i think i steered duke wrong the lieutenant colonel that coordinated the whole firefight he said congressman my men went into that burning helicopter and looked for the remains of those three men we got the remains of one soldier they have had a funeral for him fernan fernan richardson he said but we cannot find any remains of the other two and the helicopter was burning so badly that magnesium was running down the street however at some point during the night the crowds went in and they must have been in a grisly ghoulish fashion got what was left of those soldiers from that crash and that is what the media reported

30year period violent crime has gone up 560 percent the fbi tells us and i find this unbelievable but i do believe it because it is their figures and they are based on their analysis that during the life of an individual 8 out of 10 americans will be the victim of a violent crime that is truly shocking but we all know it do we not look at what is happening in our communities this next oneis fascinating we just heard how during the 0year period that spending at al levels of government has gone up fivefold and welfare spendinghas 630 percent this next chart tells us about the miserable failure of liberalism in this country this chart shows starting hack here you can see in the 50s here is the poverty rate the poverty rate if falling falling falling falling and falling look when it levels offand goes back up this happens when lbj comes into power and launches the war on poverty look at the dramatic increases in spending the more spending goes up look what is happening to this line the line is level it goes down it goes up a little bit then herwe axre in 1990 whereit starts heading up of course these are the last years we have figures for so i cannot tell you more recently but the factof the matter is we have spent in this 30year period i believe 3 5 trillion that put us deeply in debt to alleviate poverty we have created a dependent culture that just saps up more and more of out taxpayer dollars this is resulting in broken homes and more violent crime of enormous proportions this is why we have got to have further time to really talk about this on another occasion next is births to unmarried women look at this line right here in 1960 it was about 5 percent of unmarried women who gave birth look over here in 1990 we are almost at 28 percent a fivefold increase what is happening to these children these children are emotionally deprived for the most part you saw that statistic on the 560percent increase in violent crime the fastest growing component of those violent crimes is juvenile crimes that is what we are creating by the social policies that are entirely misplaced here is the chart that illustrates the increase in welfare spending it is never enough all these trillions of dollars and we still havepeople in power in the federal government from the president on down who tell us oh we have got to spend more that is what president clinton was quoted as saying on the front page of the washington post last friday we have got to raise some more revenues and get this economy going which is totally inconsistent why so that we can spend more this is completely unbelievable then he has given us a plan and let us go back to this chart for a minute a plan which is going to add 1 trillion to the national debt cumulatively and which is going to end us up after the largest tax increase in history at the end of the clinton 5year plan with an annual budget deficit of s228 5 billion some plan the famlily we see federal taxes look at this increase in the average family with median income a family of four in 1948 paid about 2 percent of its total income to the unitedstates government in taxes the same family in 1986 paid 24 percent of its income to the unitedstates government in taxes and that figure went up where by 1990 it looks like over 25 percent now from 2 to 25 percent is a twelvefold increase a 1 200percent increase in taxes to the federal government that is truly dramatic this last chart which i think is very illustrative and maybe we can end on this note represents the federal budget deficit the annual deficit going clear back to the 1940s these are inflation adjusted now of course look at what we have during the world war ii years we have annual budget deficits one of them here looks like about 1943 we have an annual budget deficit inflation adjusted of about 680 billion this is truly staggering but look at what happens here of course during the war years this goes on then we get right to here which appears to be about 1947 you can see what it is it is about 180 billion a dramatic reduction just by way of comparison our budget deficit this year is 320 billion for the fiscal year ending september 30 we are not in world war ii under the clinton plan in 5 years we are going to go from 320 to 228 5 billion look at what happened here you go in 5 years from an enormous budget deficit here at over 500 billion and my word you are up to here where you have nearly 100 billion in surplus now can you see the chauge there it is a 600 billion change we went from deep deficit to surplus we are not in world war ii right now why can we not act more quickly why can we not eliminate these tax increases out the spending bring the economy back up by reducing the deficit reducing the regulation reducing the burdens on the family strengthening our families provide incentives for people to help themselves in the inner cities and in the suburbs and pull these families back together transmit family values make us stronger and better and make us grow faster economically that is the american dream and that is what i submit we need to examine in general detail to see just exactly how we can do it so that we can

that came out a few months ago from the harvard international school of public hecalth noting that 1 000 haitian children a month 1 000 children a month are dying as a direct result of the united states embargo on haiti how many do you suppose are aying today now that we have intensified this embargo and made it even more strngent we cannot disavow the responsibility for these innocent victims i heard bill gray the presidents special assistant on hrati lazt night on cnn after we jot home saying we aren really causing any arm 1aiti is a poor country gee they arehaving trouble there this isnt our jault well baloney that is not true we are causing this and we have got to recognize 6at fact and accept the responsibilitythe facts are the relief flights are not igetting in the administration is holding them back and the reason they are is because the military is getting ahold of the materials that are coming in the medicine and the food and selling them on the black market and profiting and making themselves even mnre comfortable those relief flights are not going they are not getting through because of the embargo we were feeding a million people in haiti 1 million peopl~e were counting on us for food and medicine those flights are not going through what are those folks doing i will tell you what they are doing they are starving and dying from disease we are causing an economic catastrophe tat is literally driving people into the sea i read from the washington post yesterday there is nothing for us in haitli say the haitians tme embargo is kling us one by one so whatever it takes i am igoing oing into the sea despite mr gray saying no no nothing we axre doing here is causing a problem for these pecple baloney he is wrong and it is painful and it is deadly i am very deeply troubled i am very deeply troubled as you can tell by the clinton foreign policy diving innocent victims into the sea is not whatamerica is about andit is not what democracy is about this congress is complicit we canot escape our owm accountability here we are allowing it to happen we endorse by a very thin majority a pollcy that is driving people into the sea and it is wrong and we all know it the sanctions have destroyed a very weak ecnomy that was there and the military junta is still profiting how long is this going to go on how long axe we going to cancel the relief i1ights what are we doing creating a pretext for invasien is that what hil is about well we have grt another problem here it is called the credibility at the white house bill gray lost it with me on cspan last night when i heard him say we are =nt causing a problem there but there is mcre aristide calls haiti a house afir we of course have helped set the house afire by helping torch it with our economic sanctions but more than that then we have gone ahead and we have said to the haitians q look come on out there is a better life in aaieica we have created a magnet we have now got a scene where peopie are literally floating out of haiti on just about antig that will float our helicopters from the coast guard cutters are spotting them sending the cutters to rescue them and we have a tremendous number of refugees because we have created an incentive for them to leave and an incentive for them to come this is unbelievable we have treated thls scene now the problem is this two out of three of those haitians are going to be retumed to hait o tey are not going to believe that we are xeal eo pie because we are telling them there is a better life and we are sending them back to starvation the real problem is another part of the magnet we have caumed i we have changed the standards despite bill grays personal assurances to me and other members of congress thatwe would maintain the standards for political asylumship we now jae a situation where 30 percent of those applying for asylum are being given asylum and under the rules trai lionally that has been a 5percent approval rate 31040 so we have not only deceived the haitians we are now in a position where we deceived members of congress because the rujes have been changed even though we received assurances that they would not be who can you believe in the clinton administration they are now feigning surprise by all this number of refugees is it a wave or is it a surge well it is neither it is a costly mess costly in terrns of dollars for taxpayers and lives of haitians i do not know where we are doing this as a pretext for an invasion or not i do not know whether we are doing it because the president needs votes for his domestic agenda i have no idea why wb are doing 1his stupidity there is no threat to our national security to justify an invasion and there are better solutions out there the white house knows it and i wish they would attend to those solutions and stop the starvation and killing that is going on in haiti"], [0.4603433310985565, 0.4603433310985565, 0, "i do not have any idea but anyhow mr lasater was a very close friend of the presidents and was one of his big financial supporters mr lasater was known to use cocaine and distributed cocaine freely at many parties and he was convicted convicted by the arkansas authorities of trafficking in cocaine he received a prison sentence and his prison sentence was partially reduced after he got out of prison he was in a halfway house for a few months he was pardoned exonerated by thengovernor clinton his friend during the time that he was incarcerated in this halfway househe really was not in a penitentiary he was in a halfway house most of the time during the time he was incarcerated a lady named patsy thomasson who is his chief financial officer took over control of his businesses and she ran his businesses as the chief financial officer while mr lasater was away at prison when he got out and was pardoned by president clinton ms thomasson continued to be the chief financial officer of his companies and she also became the chief officer of what was called the phoenixthe phoenix group a subsidiary of the phoenix group was the phoenix mortgage co and mr lasater became the president of the phoenix mortgage co so the relationship between patsy thomasson and mr lasater and bill clinton was of long duration and continued even after he went to jail and was out as a matter of fact mr lasater paid an 8 000 drug debt drug bill for cocaine use that bill clintons brother had incurred so he paid off a drug bill for bill clintons brother so there was a very close relationship between the clintons and mr lasater now patsy thomasson to give you some more background my colleagues now is one of the chief officers at the white house she is the personnel director at the white house she conducts quote unquote the drug testing of personnel at the white house now yesterday the people of albuquerque nm awoke to another tale of corruption that may involve the president president clinton the front page of tuesdays albuquerque journal reports that ajoint federal state narcotics investigation of the presidents friend mr dan lasater was called off before it was completed a former arkansas state police investigator j n doc delaughter told two journal investigative reporters that the investigation included lasater a close friend of the president and highdollar contributor to mr clintons campaign and the presidents brother roger clinton delaughter said the investigation was cut off prematurely for political reasons the state police investigators say he briefed the clintonappointed arkansas state police director tommy goodwin twice by telephone about the lasater clinton investigation on both occasions tommy goodwin the state police investigator was using a phone in then governor clintons personal office mr delaughter who was then on the force was not sure whether or not governor clinton now president clinton overheard the conversations but it is very clear that governor clinton now president clinton was very close to the arkansas state police director who was getting the information about the investigation delaughter said and i quote moneys could have been seized and planes could have been seized because we had evidence that cocaine was being used on planes used by mr lasater as i said before mr lasater quite frequently flew then governor bill clinton around in these planes delaughter told the newspaper that he and another investigator were barred from interviews with lasater roger clinton and another lasater associate in other words his superiors on the state police said you cant go and investigate this they stopped him cold in his tracks eventually lasater was convicted of possession and distribution of cocaine as i said before he was sentenced to 30 months in prison but served only 10 months most of which was in a halfway house before being released on parole lasater was later paroled by his friend thengovernor bill clinton now right in the thick of all this is patsy thomasson who is now the personnel director at the white house she took over the daytoday operations of the lasater companies while lasater was in prison as i speak to you tonight she is responsible for the daily administration of the clinton white house the newspaper is careful to point out that there is no evidence to support any indictment of ms thomasson or establish a direct connection between the illegal activity that led to the conviction of lasater and the presidents brother now harkening back to an earlier washington scandal one has to wonder what did ms thomasson know about the illegal activity which surrounded her and when did she realize that her boss lasater was a largescale drug pusher the albuquerque journal found no one in that firm no one in that firm other than ms thomasson the chief financial officer had any doubt about what was going on in the lasater companies i quote the newspapers story former lasater employees interviewed by the fbi said tney left or joined the firm between 1982 and 1985 because of its reputation tor cocaine use as the chief financial officer for lasater during that period are we to believe that ms thomasson now the chief personnel director at the whitehouse haa no clue about what was going on in the company the albuquerque journal reported that the fbi received sworn statements from lasater employees therethat were there at christmas parties at which cocaine was available in ashtrays cocaine was freely available at lasater company outings in lexington ky hot springs ar and elsewhere according to lasater employees reporters dick lynch and mike gallagher quote federal grand jury testimony which said that cocaine was served like hors doeuvres but we are asked to believe that the chief financial officer even though everybody else in that firm knew about it knew nothing of this and we are talking about ms thomasson ms thomasson patsy thomasson was a key player in the lasater operations the newspaper cites numerous public and court records which show her as president of the various lasater enterprises including new mexicos angel fire corp which lasater purchased in 1984 and sold in 1987 articles of incorporation show that thomasson as an incorporator of the phoenix group which was the successor to lasater co records of the sale of angel fire in 1987 to a texas investment partnership bear patsy thomassons signature she was tied to mr lasater all the way through all of his operations at the time of this sale the customs service and the fbi were busy investigating money laundering and drug trafficking she signed the partnership agreement the two agencies formed an organized crime drug enforcement task force and named lasater as the chief target of the probe pasty thomasson was given power of attorney power of attorney by mr lasater in january 1987 while he was in prison and surprisingly appears to still be acting as a registered agent for lasaters phoenix mortgage co calls by the newspaper to patsy thomasson at the white house were not returned i understand ms thomasson has taken leave of absense from her position as the director of administration for the president i continue to be concerned about the presidents association with people like mr lasater pardoning him after he was convicted of dealing in drugs giving him 65 million i believe in state bonds during the time he was being investigated and later indicted by the arkansas state police and the federal authorities for drug trafficking i continue to be concerned about his association president clintons with people like mr lasater and ms thomasson in the very limited hearings that we had on whitewater"], [0.4604542553424835, 0.4604542553424835, 0, "as a new member of the committee on rules this is really my first opportunity to manage a rule for the minority i have been present on the floor however for the other rules debates and i unfortunately have to state with some regret that the majority leadership has made my job easy today by reporting a rule that is sadly familiar with the previous five this is now the sixth consecutive rule that is restrictive and in which members are being denied the opportunity to offer amendments under a free and open process i do not think it is inaccurate to say that the people of the united states are being denied their full rights to representation in this house by their elected representatives it is that time of year when we start thinking about baseball at least in the part of the world i come from therefore let my colleagues and the american people come up to date on what the score is in the peoples house the democracy box score as the gentleman from new york the ranking member has called it of the season thus far according to the box score it is the people 0 tyranny 6 at this stage dealing with free and open rules it has been pointed out that the committee on rules did graciously consent to make in order all of the germane amendments submitted to it i am glad for that but i would ask my colleagues to think for a moment just how ludicrous the process is members were advised by the chairman of the committee on rules last thursday and that would have been march 4 as they were departing for their districts that amendments to the bill must be filed by noon on monday which for most of us is before they return to washington from their districts that in itself causes a logistics problems that can be overcome but unfortunately matters are made worse when we learn that the full text that we are to be amending the report will not be filed until noon on tuesday that is of course the day after the amendments are due in other words members are being asked to fly blind or somehow intuit what it was they were being asked to draft amendments to to take this out of beltway language it is a little bit like being asked to write a movie critique piece on a movie you have not seen yet it is hard to do we can do it on hearsay only generally what we know but it is hard to write a good critique unless we know what we are talking about if we do not have the report it is pretty hard to know nevertheless we did get some 12 member amendments that were filed by monday 8 of which the committee on rules made in order thankfully now the house is being asked to vote on this bill and the amendments to it even though i must say most members have not seen the bill and the report that were filed yesterday tuesday yes we have waived the 3day layover requirement for the report on this bill and we are again taking it up the day after it was filed this is the fifth time out of six rules that we have waived the requirement so much for deliberative and i underscroe deliberative democracy we can say this a much debated bill a much debated issue we all know what it is about that is not true we have 25percent new membership here 110 new members who have not had the opportunity to participate in previous debate let alone acquaint themselves with it another thing that happens with these debates over here is that we sometimes forget history evolves things change new things come into play different technology applies i suspect when we are talking about publio health that is particularly appropriate to say that the debate is over seems to me to be a curious way to begin the debate on this bill it seems to be the attitude of the majority leadership that it is more important to keep the trains running at breakneck speed than it is for members to know exactly what cargo is on those trains and exactly what direction they are headed why we asked the question in the committees on rules the answer it is the preference of leadership certainly it is the prerogative of the majority to make those decisions however there is a cost to those decisions and the cost is measured in the contribution of the collective wisdom of this body when it operates under a rule process that is totally open and unconstrained we are told this is a relatively noncontroversial bill i hope that is true it does good things i agree it does and that it should pass relatively easy and i think it will if all that is true and i have no reason to doubt as i say then why does the majority leadership find it necessary to hide behind what is in fact a clearly restrictive and rushed rule the majority on the rules committee claims that this rule makes in order all germane amendments that is a truth but a curious truth actually only an open rule will do that and the majority turned down an open rule in the rules committee on a straight party line vote moreover my colleague from florida mr stemans testified in the rules committee that his amendment to bar immigrants with aids was perfectly germane since this bill already deals with the public health issue of aids and yet the majority of the rules committee turned down his amendment on a straight partyline vote and they rejected an identical amendment on aids by the gentleman from new york the gentleman from florida the gentlewoman from new jersey and the gentleman from texas and they turned down a related amendment by the gentleman from new york and the gentleman from florida all on partyline votes i will include the rollcall votes on all of those motions at the conclusion of my remarks along with certain other matters i should point out that the latter amendment to bar aliens with aids from permanent immigrant status is identical to an amendment adopted in the other body by an overwhelming vote of 76 to 23 to the senate companion bill which this rule will make possible to go to conference on i think aids is a public health concern i think that the 17 million that the taxpayers have invested in it so far clearly is something that is important and relevant and i think telling america that this issue about aids is not germane does not compute when we are talking about public health in fact what has happened is we have created an obstacle for ourselves to trip over here and we have found it a convenient way to avoid this discussion on a very critical issue we are going to be denied the opportunity by this rule to fully debate and vote on that amendment there is only one way to rectify the mess that the rules committee has made of this legislation and that is to vote down the previous question and adopt the substitute rule that will do three things first it will provide for 2 hours of general debate and an openamendment process under the 5minute rule second it will make in order the solomonmccollum amendment that is identical to the other bodypassed amendment barring immigrants with aids third it will eliminate the 30daylayover waiver so that members will have a chance to study the bill before being asked to vote on it i think that is a reasonable and democratic alternative to the tyranny of the majority that we have been subjected to on six out of six occasions in this congress i urge defeat of the previous question and adoption of that open rule and i do urge adoption of what we call our open rule plus i include for the record the material that i previously referred to as follows"],

returned in 1973 and that since i have been in congress and personally participated in this issue the communist regime in vietnam has not as portrayed by this administration been totally cooperative in our efforts to achieve a full accounting of the miaspows of the vietnam war just from my vantage point i have seen numerous examples of noncooperation even though this obstructionism has been kept from the american people our own population has been told the vietnamese regime has been totally cooperative i have october 4 i994 seen a number of examples of what i consider to be obstructionism number 1 one of our own colleagues thi gentleman from florida was a pow for 6 years when i went to vietnam with the gentleman from florida about i guess it was a year and a half ago now part of a presidential mission i was talking to the gentleman from florida on the airplane he told me that during the first 3 years of his captivity he was not a pow he was an mia his family did not know that he was a pow they did not know he had been captured no one in the world outside of the vietnamese regime knew that he was in the captivity of the vietnamese i asked him in prison while he was incarcerated if he was in with the other american prisoners the answer was no so at any time during those first 3 years he could have been sent somewhere or kept and no one would have known the difference it was only 3 years later that the gentleman from florida became a pow at that time he was placed in with other american prisoners that tells me there was a purpose there was a goal in mind in keeping some of our prisoners separate from the other prisoners at any moment as i say during those first 3 years he could have been kept and we would have never known that he was ever a pow when we got to vietnam and negotiated with the vietnamese i asked for the records from the prison in which the gentleman from florida was kept that is what i would like to see because obviously if there was one pete peterson there might have been a dozen pete petersons there in fact vietnam in the prisons where our pows were kept maybe there were a dozen petersons maybe there were 50 maybe there were 100 pete petersons we will never know because the vietnameses answer to my request was i am sorry but all of those records have been destroyed now this is from a regime that meticulouslycommunists are known for keeping meticulous records yet all the records were destroyed to me that is obstructionism only last year two vietnamese majors came to our mia pow tasks force headquarters at phnom penh the vietnamese majors suggesting that they had information of american pows still being held in vietnam i personally followed up on this case going to cambodia to personally talk to the sergeant who received that report because i forced the issue there was some followup until i forced the issue there was no followup on this report finally our mia pow team decided they should meet these two majors i begged and pleaded that they not request these majors by name because after all what vietnamese military personnel will ever step forward again now that we have requested to see these people made this request of the vietnamese regime well our mia pow team made that request anyway what did we get for that request when the sergeant who took the report went to hanoi to supposedly meet with these majors again and identify them something that could very easily have been done when thissergeant went to hanoi to meet with these vietnamese majors in order to identify them he was not permitted to meet with them something the vietnamese regime could have done in a snap now is this the full cooperation we have been hearing about when i was in vietnam the last time with our miaipow task force our men were searching through the jungle in a horrendous effort to find a hospital that had been on the border of the cambodian vietnamese border during the war it was the hardest job these men and women the pow mia task force are doing a terrific job individually it is their leadership that i question the fact is for weeks they were iri the jungle searching for a hospital that the vietnamese had thousands of their own people who had gone through this hospital and pow camp i might add they could have identified that location in a snap instead our people were slogging around and wasting their time is this cooperation it appears to me the communist regime in vietnam is doing its best to cover up a crime the crime i am talking about is the murder of unitedstates servicemen who were left behind by our own government during our retreat from the vietnamese conflict for us to believe all prisoners were returned we would have to believe for example that no men and women were ever interrogated by russian military intelligence during the vietnam war because none of our airmen who were returned came back saying they had been interrogated by the russians that is hard to believe we wouldalso have to believe they released all of these prisoners giving up all of their leverage at the time that the war was still going on in south vietnam and still going on in cambodia and still goifig on in laos in fact of the hundreds of men shot down in laos only one or two were ever returned that is unbelievable no they kept our men our government left those men behind let us add which one of these things is worse i do not know but it is time to close this sorry chapter in the history of the united states of america and our relations with southeast asia we do need to close the chapter we doneed to have a full accounting and this legislation sets that as a goal"], [0.46108144521713257, 0.46108144521713257, 0, "i want to again draw on this analogy of mission creep but before

now and the end of the year because he had taken on a responsibility with a bipartisan conservation liberal group to sell six words to american youth that liberals and conservatives could agree on i will refer to one of them that newsweek titled a section of this article on values a few weeks back the word was responsibility that is one of the six words here are the only things that liberal and

rescue or give cover and support to michael durants helicopter crew to his copilot ray frank two door gunners tommy fields and david cleveland let us give them fire support on the ground until the rescue column can get there we see movement in that crashed helicopter twice they were turned down their third plea a long pause twostar general was tracking all of this they were his men he said all right you can go down the helicopter went down was hit so badly with rocket fire although it limped smoking with one of the men with his leg cut off by the rocket blast back to newport and crashed totaling the airplane but saving the crew that same helicopter that came down to a few feet off the ground randy shugart gary gordon jumped off and began to run the first landing they could not make they had to back off 150 yards away they began to run a gauntlet ofintense rifle and automatic weapons fire and rpg fire rocketpropelled grenades they are running toward durants helicopter when they got to the helicopter all four men were alive but so badly injured from the hard impact that not one of them could undohis own seatbelt and get out of the plane in the helicopter the aircraft commander sits on the right side because of the collective in some helicopters that only have one collective so durant was luckily on the right side which is the side of the helicopter up against a building the tail forming a slight wedge a v one of the men i think shugart took ray frank 35 combat months in vietnam and within a month of retirement lay him in the open side on the street take out one of the gunners tommy fields on the right side they take out michael durant thank god he is still with his fariily today and they take out david cleveland the other door gunner he is alive smiling at durant durant told me this personally he laid them on the right side the side against the wall we do not know what the fate of david cleveland was except that his burned remains came back to dover we do not know the final moments of tommy fields or ray frank michael durant chief warrant officer did hear shugart hit gordon gave him the last few rounds for an m16 rifle he had given him all that gary gordon had was his beretta pistol he went back around the front of the helicopter to hold off literally hundreds of people on the slim chance that a caravan of hummvess might arrive with enough firepower to rescue these four badly injured crewmen then michael durant heard gary gordon moan as he was struck as he had heard shugart moan when he was struck then the crowd came around the front overwhelmed david cleveland alive and michael durant alive and only durant is here to tell the story gary gordon and randy shugart got the medal of honor i asked that they be awarded that before i knew their names and knew the full story because i had heard that they had begged to go down and try and rescue this second helicopter shot down october 3 there was a ceremony at th white house may 23 where the men were posthumously awarded the medal of honor given to their beautiful young widows one of the fathers herb shugart with his wife lois at his side randys mom and dad refused to shake clintons hand he said you had flown aideed down to kenya you have treated him like a victor you do not know enough about military operations you should not be the commanderinchief you let my son down and you let aideed live now these men are dead words to that effect at the end he told him i have nothing more to say to you this is a scene i do not want to see reenacted in the white house as

live in southern pines north carolina close to the military community that they love the special forces community in what they call the worlds greatest fort fort bragg carmen writes my dearest ian and brittany i hope that in the final moments of your fathers life his last thoughts were not of us as he lay dying i wanted him to think only of the mission to which he pledged himself as you grow older if i can show you the love and responsibility he felt for his family you will understand my feelings i did not want him to think of me or of you because i did not want his heart to break children were meant to have someone responsible for them no father ever took that more seriously than your dad responsibility was a natural part of him as easy path to follow each day after work his truck pulled into our driveway i watched the two of you run to him feet pounding across the painted boards of our porch yelling daddy every day i saw his face when he saw you you were the center of his life ian when you turned 1 year old your father was beside himself with excitement baking you a cake in the shape of a train on your last birthday brittany he sent you a handmade birthday card from somalia but your father had two families one was us and the other was his comrades he was true to both h 9432 he loved his job quiet and serious adventure filled some part of him i could never fully know after his death one of his comrades told me that on a foreign mission your dad led his men across a snowcovered ridge that began to collapse racing across a yawning crevasse to safety he grinned widely and yelled wasnt that great you will hear many times about how your father died you will read what the president of the united states said when he awarded the medal of honor gary gordon died in the most courageous and selfless way any human being can act but you may still ask why you may ask how he could have been devoted to two families so equally dying for one but leaving the other for your father there were no hard choices in life once he committed to something the way was clear he chose to be a husband and father and never wavered in those roles he chose the military and i shall not fail those with whom i serve became his simple religion when his other family needed him he did not hesitate as he would not have hesitated for us it may not have been the best thing for us but it was the right thing for your dad there are times now when that image of him coming home comes back to me i see him scoop you up ian and see you brittany bury your head in his chest i dread the day when you stop talking and asking about him when he seems so long ago so now i must take responsibility for keeping his life entwined with yours it is a responsibility i never wanted but i know what your father would say nothing you can do about it carmen just keep going those times when the crying came as i stood at the kitchen counter were never long enough you came in the front door brittany saying mommy you sad you miss daddy you reminded me i had to keep going the ceremonies honoring your dad were hard when they put his photo in the hall of heroes at the pentagon i thought can this be all that is left a picture then deneral sullivan read from the letter general sherman wrote to general grant after the civil war words so tender that we all broke down throughout the war you were always in my mind i always knew if i were in trouble and you were still alive you would come to my assistance one night before either of you were born your dad and i had a funny little talk about dying i teased that i would not know where to bury him very quietly he said up home in my uniform your dad never liked to wear a uniform and up home maine was so far away from us only after he was laid to rest in a tiny flagfilled graveyard in lincoln maine did i understand his parents burying their only son could come tomorrow and the day after that you and i would have to travel so far then there is a bit more

since it is so close to the time that we have just heard from nelson mandela and i think all of us in this chamber felt a sense of pride in seeing how a bloodless revolution had taken place in south africa and to hear him say that while he was a prisoner in his cell the inspiration that he received and even today as he comes back as president the feeling that he has knowing that the united states of america a country that truly knew and understood what freedom was all about its willingness to fight and win it how he comes back here now depending on our support i think the sense that we feel as americans when we find other countries freedom in jeopardy that no matter what differences we have as democrats or republicans that we do feel a sense of pride when we see the countries waving their flags of democracy and to know that we played a part of that whether we are talking what happened in world war i or world war ii america has always been there and always stood as a symbol for justice and that is why i think that when for the first time they had elections in haiti it was the united states that was able to sit down with the military and to play a meaningful role in making certain that they for the first time will have elections my god with all of the problems that africanamericans have had in this country to be able to vote even our people never had to suffer what haitians did as they heroically went to the polls were being shot down but standing up and going right back again determined that they were going to vote when it settled and we looked arounol even though the candidate that was supported by the united states secretly did not win still there was for the first time in recent history or in the history of haiti a dulyelected person was elected as president and that was president aristide it was rough maybe he did not do some of the things that americans would like to see him do maybe he was not an american type of president maybe he was not what some of the republicans or democrats would have had running in their national convention but one thing was abundantly clear that as it related to what the haitian people want this man received an overwhelming vote something that we would say in our elections was indeed a mandate in the middle of the night a handful of military officers all of them trained in the united states as we might suspect went in collusion with the ruling class in haiti and together they were able to overthrow the presidency and to have this president run into exile it was no great surprise when president bush stood up and said not in this hemisphere do you do this it was president bush that said that no fragile democracy would have to fear ambitious generals in this hemisphere and behind him came our present president bill clinton and reiterated what america stood for oh there was a lot of talk as to what was in our national interest should we put our troops in harm there were reports from the cia that the man was in hospitals in countries that he never visited there wasa terrible thing going against his character and reputation but nevertheless we stood our guard and we said that we will go to governors island and we will sign an agreement and we will participate with civilized nations saying that aristide would return and democracy would return and america would be on the side of democracy and the whole world heard what we were saying the organization of american states heard what we were saying the united nations heard what we were saying and we said we wouldback it up well i do not know what is in our national interest i never told bush to say he was leader of the free world i never told this president to say that he was prepared to assume that responsibility i never wrote the new world order i never told fragile governments to depend on the united states of america to protect their freedom but it was said and we were proud of the fact that they said it then all of a sudden it appeared as though those who signed that agreement at governors island decided that they were not going to keep it and they chased away a battleship that was not just the american flag but the flag of all civilized nations in the international community and the military went on to kill the officers that were in the aristide cabinet to kill the people who were innocent to kill the people in the villages and the towns that supported aristide and even though the unpopularity continued even though there were certain people that continued to create something like we were dealing with a lunatic and not the head of a nation even though heads of nations who had met aristide said he was sane even though president clintonsaid that this man was responsible still the political drums continued to beat and people were saying that we should not go into haiti i will not go into the record but i know many of my members will go into the record to see how is it that we can change so fast politically and to determine what is in our national security interest this time under this president and why things were so different under another president and today we debate the question as to whether or not you you and you should supersede the intelligence of our military that are there in haiti and for you to tell them what time they have to come back home on november 30 1950 some zhinese whom i do not know saw fit to shoot me in north korea while i was there in the second infantry division as a part of united nations forces how we would have felt at a time when we were trying to defend the ground that we fought for that you who sent us there would tell us what time we had to get russian bombers were not the people out that assassinated the leader there in it just seems to me that there comes grenada actually in alliance with the a time where we have to take our party soviet union and wuld have indeed labels and put them aside and say that put military bombers on the ground if indeed the president republican or mr rangel i was democrat is indeed the commander in impressed with the argument that we chief why do we not leave it up to him had 20 white students that got caught why would

out right away or danger whether or not they were black they should never go there in the first or white we had a right to support and place defend and protect and rescue them and the biggest hoax of

of excellent points first let me thank the new chairman from the intelligence committee because i have been very impressed with his leadership but i must say it is a different world none of us would say it is a different world none of us would say it is a peaceful world but we would say it is a different kind of environment we have to target by not being able to talk about this openly we do not know if we are targeting it right or not i was very pleased this year that the committee on armed services did practically its entire markup in the open i think that is a real change we have never seen that happen before i would hope that that would be a reason we could at least say how much we are spending on this whole area of intelligence second let me put a few things up the gentleman from oregon pointed out very well that why we have been so focused on the international arms race one of the things we forgot to look at was our domestic arms race and our domestic arms race is very out of control cities such as mine are reeling from that i think an awful lot of our constituents are much more fearful about getting shot as they drive to the grocery store than they are about having some missile coming at them i also thought the gentleman made an excellent point about the ridiculous statements that have been made in one of the prior newspaper stories and that was that we cannot fire anybody here that is why we have to keep the budget so high because if we fire them they will tell well i certainly hope that is not true i certainly hope as we look at different threats in the world radical fundamentalism and so on that there is an ability to shift the kind of personnel needs to people who understand that rather than hang on to people from the prior cold war at any cost for fear that they will say something finally let me say if we cut this money there are so many uses for it domestically and every other way remember we are still leaving 90 percent intact which is more money than most countries spend on absolutely everything in their national budget one of the things that has worried me the most is that in intelligence one of the things people talk about is maybe we ought to have intelligence out there to watch our national technology base to make sure that there are not foreigners coming in and stealing secrets from americas corporations now at the very time we are seeing that we just finished this incredible competition where we went out and we asked people to take the research we were doing in these hightechnology classified areas and figure out a way to put it out in the civilian sector we had this terrific competition ceo said we think this is silly its you liberals talking about defense diversification it wont work we have 471 million and guess what if we funded all the things that came in in this competition we would need 8 3 billion and the people applying have to put in half that money so it would be almost 17 billion all together that we would have out there to start new jobs right away now let me tell my colleagues that if we do not pick upthis resource if we do not find some way to fund all those applications that came in guess what foreign investors are going to fund them they are drooling to fund them on a 5050 match and we will not need the intelligence community to tell us why they went offshore they went offshore because we had a competition got people excited they came forward and thought of all sorts of new market approaches for the things we have invested in as taxpayers in defense that had been classified and then we could not fund it at this point we are going to be able to fund about oneseventeenth of the proposals and every one of the proposals is appearing to be jurored very very high this is eating our seed corn so madam chairman this is not saying that all of the world is peaceful we do not need it it is saying the world is different it is not peaceful let us reconfigure it is not saying that the future is not looking at intelligence but make sure the people there are looking at the proper things and it is also saying we have new threats domestically in our cities and new threats to build a tech base in the civilian side where we do not rely totally on government contracts coming from the defense department or the intelligence department and everything else is offshore that is a miserable future for this country defense diversification is our future and we are sitting here looking at the most successful thing anyone could dream of and it is going to go down the chute because we do not have any money to fund it so i think these are places where we could find the money we could begin funding these things and we can begin instant job creation in a very critical area that will help us retain some of that defense and technology base forwarding and that is one of the ideas i would have and i would hope people would vote for this very small 10percent cut"], [0.536390483379364,

of the aisle this is not going to the problem with it is once again it week saying that we should not enact solve the budget deficit but do they is in the general it is not in the spe the kasichpenny motion because it is know what it does it creates momencific there is not a one of us that too general tum momentum for change in this would answer the question do you then i have in my hand a letter from city i urge members to vote yes on the think we ought to cut spending who november 19 1993 from the same kasichpennystenholm motion to rewould not say yes in general but then president of the

budget that is when it gets now which is it are we going to ob 1995 the onethird of the federal budget that tough that is when getting the con ject to spending cuts because they are is subject to annual appropriations is not the sensus together gets much more dif specific or are we going to object to problem ficult them because they are not specific or for the first time since 1969 the houseif we were not prepared in the budget are we going to object to any spending passed budget resolution would result in to say where it would be how are we cuts for any reason that serves us the spending less money in 1995 than in 1994prepared to say where it will be day we are going to vote to cut without even an adjustment for inflation thus finally all of us know that if we are now when we passed the tax increase it should be absolutely clear that discretionary going to make significant reductions in last year in this house as opposed to spending programs are not the cause of prothe budget it

personal responsibility doest prouniversal coverage we donot we miss mote high standards does it protectabout 22 million people whowill still americaniclftiens at home and abroad members can even apply that to health care i salute my colleague the gentleman from south carolina who just said a few moments ago let us not fool the american people i agree with that what i am prepared to do here tonight for you the american people is to talk about not only the politics of health care the pragmatism of health care and the plans of health care the only way i can do that is that i have prepared a chart a road map of my thoughts i am going to explain this because it helps explain the actual debate that is going on right now about health care right here along this section this is where we presently are in america this is the present hybrid health care system that we have in america the reason i call it a hybrid system that we have is because we have medicaid medicare the va the veterans administration hospitals and clinics and we have the military health care delivery system we really technically have a hybrid health care system in the hybrid system that we have we have come along and said the present system that promotes the greatest quality health care system in the world and the system that also preserves the greatest choice of an individual of doctor or facility or alternative methods of treatment is at 85 percent right now we are right here right here at this square at 85 percent so we because of our compassion and sincerity for the uninsured and underinsured we seek to do better we also recognize that there are growing costs and we try to seek cost containment how do we want to do that do we want to move forward this way or do we want to take this direction let me explain here at the 95 percent or actually i should write 94 percent there is a system that is referred to in washington here a lot called the hawaiian health care system it has 94 percent coverage it is a universal coverage system it has been in effect for 20 years and has only been able to achieve 94 percent think about this for a moment if we are presently at 85 percent and the a model universal coverage health care right now is the hawaiian system and it is exempt it is exempt from what ever plan is going to be passed here so they must like the 94 percent now think about this utilize common sense when you were in school and you got a 85 or an 87 on a test how did you feel you probably felt pretty good you did not say oh my gosh my 87 85 is a failure i have to go out and get an all new method of learning no you did not say that if you want to get to 94 you work harder at what you are presently doing you dont go out and say i need to get a brain transplant to move to 94 percent what we seek to do is increase the access maintain the quality and have cost containment how do we do that we do it by working on what is wrong with the present system and not moving to brain transplant let us think about what is really happening out there it is wonderful to get up and talk to america and say im going to be the protector of the middle class im going to deliver to you less it is not going to cost you incredible the american people did not wake up yesterday it almost reminds me of a knockknock joke knock knock who is there the government the government who i am the government and i am here to save you come on the american people are much smarter than that so if we are paused right here this is where we are at 85 percent there are those of us that believe and support incremental reforms to the present system to open up the access to permit greater risk pooling out there we also recognize when i say open up the access i am referring to allow small businesses whether it is local chambers or associations to create greater risk pools so there is greater integration in the health care economy both vertically and horizontally as we do that we also as we are paused right here there are those here in the congress that say you know what we need to do is we should have incremental reforms to a singlepayer system they are not saying that they are not going to say that because they want to fool the american people you see the real goal is a singlepayer plan a canadianstyle universal coverage system for america but they are not going to say it they are not going to say it the ones that i respect in this body are those who come out and say i believe in a canadianstyle health care system for america i respect them because they come right out and look you in the eye and say that is my sincere belief the ones in america that you should be scared of and frightened of are the ones that finesse it they finesse it by saying well we are just going to have some triggers we are going to help out the small business sector we are going to help out the middle class we are going to protect you we are going to look out for you let me explain what this is we are right here they are sophisticated they meaning the liberal side of the democrat party is sophisticated enough that they cannot make a hard left turn and take america directly to a singlepayer plan they cannot move from here to a singlepayer plan america will say no and reject it what is their answer their answer is substantive incremental reforms to a singlepayer system so they want to move from here and take america this direction that is the debate that is going on right now the president is going to say i might loosen up a little bit vice president gore yesterday said we might relax maybe 10 years out may be acceptable it may not be acceptable we will have to look at it what are they really talking about they are talking about how to move america to a singlepayer plan without telling you without telling you so what they seek to do here is move america from the 85 percent and go this direction they want to turn left and take america this direction now this time period could last anywhere from 7 to 10 years time enough to pull america into a malaise then when they get out here in the year 2000 2002 they turn around and say those of you who like congressman buyer back in 1994 said we need incremental reforms from the present system they will say see steve you were wrong we tried but we could not make it think about this they tried what they are going to do is in the reforms they are going to rewxlte up there in the back room that we may or may not get a chance to see before we are voting on itwhich is an incredible thought they control the process when they control the process they can then control the substance and predetermine the outcome of legislation get it i got it so what they are going to do is set unrealistic expectations in different sectors of the health care economy that cannot be achieved that is why they are saying out here 95 percent we have hawaii that has been doing it for 20 years and which they are exempting and they cannot even reach 95 percent so the goal the goal is by the liberal side of this body is to move america to a canadianstyle health care system but they are not going to say it they are not going to say it because they are scared to death they are scared to death that you will not send them back to this body and their job to them is so important what is it they are going to try to do they are going to try and fool the american people i agree with my colleague the gentleman from south carolina let us not fool the american people there are those of us that firmly believe that we do not need a brain transplant when it comes to health care what it is we support are incremental reforms to the present health care system that increases the access and permits greater risk pooling to occur we seek tort reform medical malpractice reform 100percent deductibility of insurance premiums the list goes on and on there are many things that we can do to the present system without sacrificing the quality without diluting the quality without restricting the freedom of choice of doctors and facilities and alternative methods of treatment let alone of its impact upon jobs and small businesses if we want to talk about the protector of the middle class it will be the conservatives who are the protectors of the middle class i would like to yield to a gentleman from the

the members of the house to focus just for a second on what is special about this debate on the bartontauzin amendment this debate today focuses not necessarily on whether or not one supports the concept of a balanced budget amendment i believe agreat majority of this house does this debate focuses on how we are going to achieve that balanced budget amendment this amendment the bartontauzin amendment is very much like the stenholm amendment the only difference in the balanced budget features of this amendment and the stenholm amendment is the year 2000 date for the accomplishment of the balanced budget goal but the major difference the thing we ought to be focusing on today is the feature of the bartontauzin amendment that provides for some restraint on tax increases as a vehicle for achieving balanced budgets now what restraint is in here the restraint that is in here is a simple provision that says in achieving the balanced budget that all of us or a great majority of us i think want to achieve that we ought to do it without raising taxes any higher than any greater than the income of americans is growing at the time we raise taxes in other words government should not grow faster than the pocketbooks of americans americans individually and american businesses it says in effect that we can raise taxes if we need to in short the amendment we debate today says that while the government of the united states may in fact have to raise taxes it ought not do it except with a supermajority any faster than the rate of growth of income in american pocketbooks and businesses in short it says balance the budget over the term allotted principally by reducing spending wherever you can if we were to poll americans across the width and breadth of this country today i think they would agree with that principle so we are debating an amendment today that really incorporates the stenholm balanced budget amendment with the addition that the balanced budget amendment ought to be achieved with as little as possible in tax increases and as much as possible in spending cuts if members agree with that principle they will want to vote for this version of the balanced budget amendment those who have said they are concerned about this version ought to be concerned because this is a real amendment if we really want to achieve a balanced budget for america we ought to be concerned that this amendment will do it and other amendments may not do it so if we have a concern about the effect of the unitedstates constitution commanding those of us representing this nation in this body to abide by responsible spending limits then we ought to be concerned abut this amendment it will require this congress and this nation to put our fiscal house order without unnecessarily raising taxes again on the american public people have asked us why should we do this at all let me give the members an illustration of the most important reason why i think it is important for congress to enact not only the balanced budget amendment but this version of it with a limitation on tax increases it is incumbent because we need to examine the reason the mandate is normally sent to washington in town meetings across my district folks ask why do you guys keep spending money over and above the income of this government why do you keep putting us in debt why do you keep crowding out money we could be using for useful purposes in america by paying all this interest on the debt conservatives and liberals make this same request why dont you put your house in order quit paying all this interest and spend the money we send you on projects that are good for america instead of paying interest on debt to countries all over the world who buy our tbills the answer is that most congressmen come to washington with a simple mandate the mandate is go to washington get as many of those federal dollars we send you backinto your district and spend them at home the truth is that we all carry out that mandate pretty doggone good the truth is that most of us end up bringing more money home than our folks have sent up here that is why we are out of balance we carry out the mandate pretty good i think what americans want to do in this balanced budget debate is to ask us to give them a chance in voting for a constitutional amendment that would send a new mandate to all of us who come up here and the mandate would be very simple do what you can about bringing projects home do what you can about carrying out the necessary spending in government but dont spend more money than we send you each year at some point stop this crazy borrowing trend that is crowding out the funds we need to carry on a progressive and good economy for our country in short i think the message americans have been sending us in town hall meetings in our mail and in messages to members of congress is that while we want you to do a good job in making sure that projects come home and federal programs are still carried out we also want you to carry out a new mandate and the mandate is dont spend more money than we have sent you and quit raising taxes on us in order to accomplish the purpose of a balanced budget amendment the bartontauzin amendment is the only one that carries out those two mandates of urging americans to live in this government within our means and second to stop raising taxes unnecessarily because this continuous spending spree is about to sink this country into debt from which we cannot recover"], [0.5347816050052643, 0.4652183949947357, 1, "i yield myself

substitute that led up to it although that was a different substitute than the one i just offered but i think it also reflects why i will not be able to vote this time for this amendment last time when this amendment was up i myself was in a great i guess state of concern because i saw indeed what some were talking about today it seemed to me that the situation was we had an economy 2 to 3 years ago that was in dire shape the deficit was growing and there was no sufficient leadership to deal with it indeed we had a president of the united states president bush that had abdicated his role in proposing responsible budgets he would call for a balanced budget amendment and then not offer anything close to one and then walk off the field when anyone tried to engage the white house the reality of our political makeup in this country this system of three branches is that if we do not have a strong executive leadership it is highly unlikely that the lack of strong executive leadership by one can be more than made up by the diverse exercise of energy by 535 called the unitedstates congress house and senate and despite the best efforts of men and women in this body and in the body down the hall the senate despite their best efforts we need an engaged white house so between lack of a committed white house and the fact that this congress did not seem to be stepping up to the plate it seemed logical then to go to severe steps which is certainly what the amendment last time and this time would do but since then i have also seen some promise of encouragement i have seen some things that make me think that the white house the executive and the congress are willing to step up to the plate to meet the challenge to hit the ball to do what has to be done i have seen a budget package pass not by a big majority not by any means not by the 60 percent that would be required by some in this body but i have seen a budget pass that has actually begun to get a grip and despite the worst predictions of those who voted against it those on the other side of the aisle that predicted dire economic results immediately should that happen job killer as one said despite those those have not materialized indeed we have seen something else happen we have seen the deficit reach the lowest point that it has in 6 years and there is still a downward trend we have seen record economic growth more economic growth i might add in the last year than the prior 4 years under the bush administration we have seen inflation at alltime lows we have seen interest rates while going up slightly in the past couple of months mainly due to the federal reserves independent actions but we have seen interest rates stay at record lows as well we have seen an economy begin to get back on its feet again and instead of having that sputtering growth that we were experiencing it seems to be fairly consistent my colleagues it is still not good enough but we have seen definite recovery and we have seen a congress that is willing to take on the tough issues i did not happen to be with the president on nafta but that was a tough issue for a lot of members here however they voted it was done i have seen the congress take on the budget package and pass it not an easy vote for anyone and it has been done i believe that the same spirit is going to move this congress i hope it will move this congress on health care all of that to say though that i look and i say do you need the kind of steps that the stenholm amendment and others would impose i do not want to suggest for a minute that the job is done and i do not think anyone in this chamber suggests the job is done but i am wondering whether indeed we need those kinds of steps particularly i am wondering whether we need them when we look at some of the alternatives that we can have if we are going to have a constitutional amendment i have become a big believer not just because i sit on the committee on public works and transportation that does give me a focus of attention but i am a big believer in growth as we all are i say you cant cut your way out of this deficit you cant tax your way out of it youre going to have to do some of both but youre going to have to grow and you have got to put in place those policies that will help you grow some argue the deficit reduction in and of itself is sufficient for the job i do not feel that way i think it is positive i think it has a salutary effect it does have some important aspects but deficit reduction by itself will not grow this economy what i am concerned about is we focus more and more on deficit reduction to the exclusion of everything else we can actually have a contracting effect on the economy we can cause it to recede and so i want to see if there is going to be a balanced budget amendment i want to see in it a reflection of that and make sure growth can be accommodated the gentleman from texas noted a couple of hours ago that i had made and many have made a philosophical leap in some ways and he is correct i am prepared to accept an amendment to the constitution of the united states that requires a balanced budget but in doing so i want to make sure it is structured very carefully and so as we are all evolving in this process that is why i chose at this time not to support the stenholm amendment not because i do not respect what he has done not because i do not think that the constitution should forever be devoid of any language dealing with the balanced budget but because i think that there are better ways to do it than what are being offered here today i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.5343268513679504, 0.46567314863204956, 1, "i yield myself the balance of my time i think there are several reasons to vote against the gilman amendment the first one simply is that the unitedstates policy has been decided we are not going to change that tonight let us not send a confused signal about what american policy is going to be the president has decided march 31 he did that after consultation with members of the congress he has set the date tomorrow we are going to vote on the defense department appropriation bill all of us will vote or almost all of us will vote for that bill that bill provides for march 31 we are going to say tomorrow and we are going to enact into law march now let us not come along tonight and say advice to the president of january 31 that is not a clear signal at all unitedstates policy has been decided we are going to confirm it tomorrow and there is no sense muddying the waters here and giving another date tonight the second reason we should vote against the gilman amendment is we ought not to micromanage now in some ways this policy debate tonight approaches the ridiculous we are arguing about 60 days whether unitedstates troops should come out january 31 or march the congress of the united states has an appiopriate role to play we help the president formulate policy and we have done that but it is the presidents responsibility to implement policy and let us let the president implement the policy the policy is a policy of gradual disengagement let us not argue over january 31 or march 31 let the president implement the policy let us be clear next that the gilman resolution will not bring our troops home sooner it is a sense of congress resolution members should be very clear about that point this substitute does not change policy it will only send a confused and a mixed signal around the world next the united states does have a mission in somalia for these next several months a unitedstates presence there will give more time for negotiations it will give more time for the political process to take root and there are encouraging signs about that today it will give us time for the humanitarian mission to be completed and it will give the united nations time to find troops to replace unitedstates forces nobody here can assure anybody that if we wait until march 31 all these things will be accomplished all we are doing is trying to provide a reasonable chance for the somalis for the united nations for the negotiations to succeed by staying longer we will leave somalia pointed towards survival rather than towards chaos finally we should support the hamilton resolution and defeat the gilman resolution because the president has made a commitment to our u n partners to stay until march 31 the unitedstates senate now overwhelmingly has agreed to that commitment and we will agree to it tomorrow in the defense department conference report i have heard it said here i want to send a signal to the president the problem with that is when we vote tonight we send a signal to a lot of other persons not just the president we send a signal tonight to the united nations we send a signal tonight to the factions in somalia we send a signal tonight to ethiopia and to eritrea that are trying to help us in the peace negotiations if the gilman resolution is approved that message will be that the united states has lost hope for somalia once we send that signal our u n partners will withdraw at least as fast as we do the conflict will resume somalia returns to chaos and united states forces i think will be at greater risk that is not the signal we want to send by supporting my resolution and rejecting the gilman substitute we will send a far better signal that signal is that the united states will not be intimidated that signal is that we cannot solve all of the problems of somalia but we will meet our commitments and we will give them a reasonable chance to succeed i rise in support of the gilman amendment i approach this issue very cautiously because i believe foreign policy is an area where the president must be the leader of all americans i have defended a previous administrations right to formulate and enact policies designed to roll back soviet expansion in our hemisphere too much intervention by congress does weaken the presidents ability to conduct foreign policy but in my tenure in congress i have also never known a secretary of defense that would deny our troops the equipment they needed because he was more concerned with public opinion than his troops i have also never worked with an administration that excuses its action by saying we inherited these problems thats simply pathetic let us put this miserable excuse behind us once and for all george bush never envisioned a longterm american presence in somalia george bush resisted attempts by the united nations to draw us deeper into rebuilding somalia does somalia need to be rebuilt yes it does but george bush realized that american troops are the wrong tool for rebuilding somalia he intended our forces to stabilize the terrible humanitarian situation and bring our troops home and that is all the withdrawal of our troops from somalia by march 31 has nothing to do with any strategic or logistical reality and everything to do with the president trying to save face well mr president i think the world has figured out our credibility in somalia is zero so lets bring our troops home as quickly as possible let me just close by suggesting the president get himself some new foreign policy advisors its clear that his current ones are not up to the task of conducting a foreign policy in transition after all a president willing to hire a former reagan administration official as a spokesman ought to be willing to get some competent foreign policy help no matter what party they might be"], [0.5342246890068054,

chairman of the committee on the judiciary and the gentleman from texas mr bryant the subcommittee chairman and others deserve credit we had some skeptics say that the independent counsel statute was just some partisan tool that democrats liked because it harassed republicans let us just remind people of the history the independent counsel statute was first enacted by a democratic house and a democratic senate under a democratic president jimmy carter it was in fact at its most ferocious back then the trigger level that setoff the independent counsel was by everybodys agreement too low at that point but it was set up by democrats under a democratic president now that a democratic president is back in office we had predictions that we would allow it to lapse in fact that is not the case once the senate acted we haye moved very quickly the senate did not act there had been a partisan dispute in the senate the senate finally acted at the end of last session here we are at the outset of this session moving a bill to where i hope it will be on the presidents desk within the first week when we come back because there will not be many differences between us and the senate unless we adopt the amendment offered by the gentleman from pennsylvania one point should be very clear for those who want the independent counsel statute reauthorized quickly adopting the amendment of the gentleman from pennsylvania will certainly delay this and may kill it for this reason the unitedstates senate of blessed memory dealt with this exact issue last november and an amendment that embodied the principle of the amendment of the gentleman from pennsylvania was presented by the senator from arizona the senate by 67 to 31 voted it down leading the charge were two senators thie democratic senator from michigan mr levin and the republican senator from maine mr cohen the assistant republican leader mr simpson voted against the amendment the senate dealt with this issue and very firmly by better than 2 to 1 said we want to leave it as is if the house were in fact to disagree we would be guaranteeing a long conference from which perhaps no bill might emerge because the house and senate position on this central issue greatly at variance guarantees no quick action one way to get quick action so that the clinton administration will in fact be subjected to the exact same independent counsel statute remember we are talking about the same panoply of powers aimed at the executive branch now as was facing reagan and faced bush the only way to do that is in fact to defeat this amendment because if we can get this amendment defeated the differences between the house and the senate are sufficiently small and there has been sufficient discussions on a bipartisan basis from senators levin and cohen so that we can get a bill to the presidents desk very quickly next i want to talk about the substance the gentleman from pennsylvania said if a senior member of the presidents own party were to be indicted or investigated by that attorney general there would be the appearance of conflict i want to defend attorney general barr against the criticism that has been leveled at him by republicans because attorney general barr appointed by bush attorney general thornburgh appointed by i think reagan and bush attorney general meese and attorney general smith all four men who served as attorneys general under president reagan and president bush authorized justice department investigations of members of congress of both parties all four of those men authorized investigations of both democratic and republican congressmen in some cases some senior members of their own party now all four of those men under the statute as it then existed and as the gentleman from texas wants to reconstitute it had the unchallenged authority to ask for an independent counsel any attorney general at any time could ask for an independent counsel for anybody if he or she thinks there is a conflict so if in fact there was that appearance of conflict as the gentleman from pennsylvania says why did four republican attorneys general refuse to use the mechanism available to them why did mr meese and mr smith and mr thornburgh and mr barr all refuse to ask for an independent counsel we will be told that they believed that it should be mandatory that is the oddist profession i have ever heard here are four men who apparently insist that i guess their argument is stop me before i conflict again here are four men who ignored their own authority to ask for an independent counsel who now tell us that what they did was somehow wrong apparently and that an independent counsel must be offered if that seems illogical to members i think that helps them understand what the basis of what we are talking about is yes when the attorney general is asked to investigate the vice president the secretary of labor the chairman of the presidents own party we believe there is an inherent conflict when a member of congress is involved there may or may not be a conflict we leave it up to the attorney general to decide it members have also said this thing costs too much well what my friends on the other side want to do is to increase the cost of this by a factor of 10 nothing would be more likely to undermine the existence of the independent counsel than to increase the cost by a factor of 10 because 60 people are now automatically covered they would make 600 people automatically covered and if we had the same incidents of appointments among members of congress and the executive branch we could increase it by a factor of 10 if we made it automatic now i am prepared to concede that the republican attorneys general erred in the past and should have appointed an independent counsel two or three times when they did not i am sorry that they never did it i am sorry that they never dealt with the potential of a conflict i am sorry that they disagreed with the gentleman from pennsylvania who said it was an apparent conflict and he is right to use the phrase apparent conflict that is one of the things we legitimately are concerned about but when four republican attorneys general over a 12year period consistently refuse to use this authority which they had without any possible challenge how can it be argued that somehow this is the logical policy that they should have been forced to do it finally let me address the procedure we have a procedure where yes the pending amendment is already in the bill that happens from time to time because members want to make sure that the issue is properly framed in debate if it was up to me we would never do it if it was up to my friends on the republican side i believe from history we would sometimes do it and sometimes not do it because we do it when it helped them and not when it did not when we debated the defense bill we had the skelton amendment the skelton amendment was the text of the bill and we had a king of the hill situation there were two amendments prior to the skelton amendment on gays in the military they both lost we then voted on the skelton amendment and in that case we did not even have a gekas type amendment to choose between we had a situation that said if we voted for the skelton amendment it would be in the bill but if we voted against the skelton amendment it would be in the bill i challenge my colleagues to find in lican objecting to that procedure we did that it was less logical than this one because here we will be making a choice in the military issue we choose between skelton and skelton here we are choosing between bryant and gekas now members may not think that the difference between gekas and bryant is great i happen to think it is but the difference between bryant and gekas is greater than the difference between skelton and skelton i mean members who believe in that procedure frankly might have thought that it was designed not by the gentleman from missouri but by red skelton but i did not remember a single republican objection not one not during the rule debate not during the debate on the floor so we have a procedure that has been used before with republican support we have a rule that says the attorney general can appoint whenever he or she wants to an independent counsel and four republican attorneys general have declined to do that and many of them have investigated members of their own party and of the other party we have a proposal that would increase by a factor of perhaps 10 a thousand percent the cost of this the history of the independent counsel is that when mr nixon was in trouble there were difficulties and that is what led to the independent counsel statute there was not a history of executive branch officials being unwilling to prosecute members of congress jimmy carter presided over abscam which sent mostly democrats to prison republican attorneys general have indicted and convicted or dismissed charges against members of congress this is a continuation of what we have had the democrats have a challenge and i believe we are mdeting it will we apply to the clinton administration exactly the same rules that we applied to the bush and reagan administrations vote for the bryant amendment and that is what we will accomplish because we will be able to go promptly to conference with the senate and put that bill on the presidents desk vote for the amendment offered by the gentleman from pennsylvania and we will guarantee the grinding down people will be talking about gridiock we will have a difficulty with the senate which has already rejected it and we may or may not be able to resuscitate i believe we will take the appropriate action and i call for a yes vote on the bryant amendment"], [0.5341818332672119, 0.4658181667327881, 1, "i thank the gentleman for yielding i thank the gentleman for taking this time tonight i know we have a number of members who want to be involved in this discussion this issue of health care is coming soon to the floor of the house of representatives and we hope and believe that this will be a historic debate in the house over the next weeks as we in the house and as all americans are about to try to make a decision about where we want to go with our health care system whether we need to change it whether we want to make it better or whether we would continue the status quo sas the gentleman has well said our committees in the house the committee on ways and means the committee on energy and commerce the committee on education and labor and other committees have been working for almost a year to put together the legislation that we announced on friday and that we will bring to the floor in the next weeks i would like to start tonight before i describe our plan in some detail with some charts i would like to kind of back up and try to explain what this really is all about we hear a lot of terms that are confusing to people americans have been saying to me people i have seen in my own district people around the country have been saying this thing is so complicated there are so many issues there is so much fine print there are so many different provisions they hear words like triggers mandates universal coverage and lots of issues that most people do not know what they mean they do not know what we are talking about so to begin tonight i would like to get us to all back up for a minute and talk for a moment about really what this is all about we all know what health care is we all know what doctors are hospitals illness but what is our health care system and how do we pay for it how do we get health care before world war ii in this country we got health care by going to a doctor usually and if we went to the doctor we had to have money and we paid the doctor for whatever needed to be done if you did not have the money you probably did not go to the doctor because you could not afford it in the thirties we decided that we did not want people to be dying and going into their old age with no money we did not want that so we said we would have a pension system called social security because at the time we passed social security in the thirties lots of elderly people after their productive years had no savings had no money many died destitute without anything so we made a decision as a country that we would have a social security system we decided that in the midthirties we put together a requirement some would call it a mandate a requirement that every employer in the country and every employee would pay a certain amount a month so that when you retired you would have a pension called social security and it has worked it has worked wonderfully it is the most popular program in america anyone who would suggest we get rid of that requirements would really be in trouble in our political system because it is a popular program then in the sixties we found that about half the american people when they hit 65 and after they again did not have any active income coming in were not able to see a doctor half the elderly in america in 1965 did not have the money to go and see a doctor so we made a decision as a country that we would have another requirement on employers and employees that there would be a tax paid a medicare tax and that every senior citizen in the country would have prepaid insurance that they could use if they got sick and needed to see a doctor now almost every american citizen who is retired can go and see a doctor and know that medicare will be there to pay for it now in 1994 30 years after medicare we are discussing whether or not we should have a requirement in our society that every employer and every employee should pay something as prepaid insurance so that when we get sick there will be something there to help us pay the doctor and the hospital to get us well now after world war h a lot of americans who worked decided that we needed to have prepaid insurance and a thing called blue cross and blue shield came into being it was set up by doctors and hospitals and it was offered to ordinary americans to prepay their health insurance costs i will never forget when my mom and dad my dad was a milk truck driver in st louis my mom was a secretary they both worked and my dad got the blue cross i was a young kid but i remember him coming home and saying we are now in blue cross and blue shield to pay the doctor it was a wonderful day we were in blue cross and blue shield and i knew that if i had to go to the doctor we would be able to pay it wasnt just dad getting out the wallet to see what he had we would be able to pay through our insurance but then we got sophisticated and smart insurance companies and employees figured out that if we gotmore well people in our plan and we segregated our people into a plan with only well people and young people we could get a cheaper rate because we would not have to pay for the sicker older people and then someone else flgured out that if we could get well people together and young people together if we could keep the cancer patients out and the heart patients and the tuberculosis patients and all the people that had illnesses if we could kick them out of the plan we could have a cheaper plan then we figured out some people figured out well gee i am young and healthy i dont even need a plan why should i pay anything i will just stay out of the plan because i will pick the plan up when i hit 50 years old or maybe i will just wait for medicare maybe i will be lucky and never need to prepay for health insurance so i will just stay out and we got more and more sophisticated and more and more smart and we got everybody in littlebitty groups and got all fragmented and isolated and pulled apart from one another and the whole idea of insurance from the beginning was not that we would all get fragmented but that we would all be in the same pool and if you are in the same pool then you do not have to pay as much and it is like that fire extinguisher all of you know about fire extinguishers you know about a fire extinguisher when you need it you need it you really need it we have a fire extinguisher in our house and igo by it every night and i look at it and i do not even think about it i do not care about it it never crosses my mind but if we have a fire in the house boy am i going to want to have that fire extinguisher it is going to be the most important thing in my life to get the fire out that is health insurance you do not need it until you need it and it has to be affordable it has to be a fire extinguisher that you can always afford but what we have done over the last 40 years is segment and isolate and frag ment and get everybody into a different group and we have lost the idea of community that was the basic idea of insurance so the main reason for this bill and the reason that we want the american people to understand and to be for this bill is that the bill is about getting everybody back into the pool back into the prepaid health pool on a level playing field paying more or less the same amount of money so that when youneed that plan it is there for everybody now this is not just about rights we democrats are known for talking about rights we are good at that we believe people do have rights and i believe people have a right to an insurance policy but i also think to have rights you have to have responsibilities you have to be responsible and a lot in this bill is about responsibility as well as rights because we are not going to have any rights if we are not all responsible one of the tenets the basic tenets of this bill is that everybody pays and everybody gets we do not want that young person to be able to decide anymore i do not need toafford insurance i am well i do not need it you may need it you may get sick you may be a burden on the rest of society so you need to pay you need to be responsible and employers need to be responsible this bill is more about responsibility than it is rights but it is about both now let me if i can give an explanation of what our bill does what it does not address some of the concerns some of the special areas of concern so that have everyone who is watching and in the hall tonight can understand first it ensures that everyone will have a health insurance policy by january 1 1999 now there are some thatwould say do it tomorrow there are some who would say do it next year we will get a huge debate about when to start this i understand that the effort here is to find a date that is reasonable this is a big change we are asking people to get involved in health insurance and i know they cannot do it overnight and i am thinking about my small business people in st louis and jefferson county saint genevieve county mo i do not want to ask them to do something they cannot do i want to give them time so we picked a time that we thought was reasonable two years for companies over 100 4 years for companies below 100 so we give the small companies the longest time to get ready for this change but on that date it has to happen now why is it important that this requirement happen we hear all kinds of arguments well let us put in a trigger let us take time let us see what can happen let me tell you why it is important it is important because people want and deserve certainty business people tell me all the time i do not care what the rules are but just tell me what the rules are do not keep me up in the air i need to plan my life i have got to plan my business if you tell me this is something that we are all going to do that is fine but tell me when it is going to happen do not put something out there and leave it totally uncertain and we never know what is going to happen so i think we need to plant the flag we need to let people know what the requirement is now we need to help and we will get to that in a moment small employers who are going to have some difficulty doing this we understand that we are not going to ask someone to do something that is impossible orunreasonable but we need to make it certain so it is in our bill certain second we accomplish everybody being involved in health care coverage through employer employee shared responsibility and we ask employers to contribute 80 percent and employees 20 percent why do we pick those numbers well again it is a reasonable solution there are some employers that pay 100 percent today there are some that pay 90 some who pay 80 some pay 75 some pay 70 some pay 50 some pay none we have got people at all different places on the racetrack and if we axe going to ask everybody to do the same thing then we have got to find a consensus you may say 70 would be better somebody else may say 50 would be better one of the problems we have is that a lot of people are at 80 a lot of people that have insurance are at 90 and a lot are at 100 if we go to50 then they are going to get worried that their employers will say well the national standard now is 50 you need to come down from 90 to 50 all the time today when i go home people who have insurance are saying what does this bill mean to me what is going to happen to me am i going to have my insurance reduced am i going to have to pay more that is a very legitimate question so we believe if we go below 80 20 employer employee share that a lot of people who have insurance will feel disadvantaged and they will be asked by their employers to go to a lower amount so we have tried to pickwhat we feel is a consensus and an area that is reasonable in splitting the difference between what exists today third as i said we have subsidies for small employers and families i will explain more in a moment exactly how those work but obviously if we are asking employers and employees who have not beer involved in health insurance hey you have to get involved we have to help them at least for a period of transition of 5 years so they have the wherewithal to be involved fourth we have a program that is an option called medicare part c why have we gone to this the reason we have gone to this is because there needs to be a place where small employers where medicaid patients where unemployed people parttime people seasonally unemployed people in other words where people who have had trouble getting insurance can be certain that they can get insurance and that is medicarepart c it is like the medicare program but it is not the same as the classical medicare program for the elderly it would allow people in that program to make choices first of all you will have a choice if you even want medicare c second if you are in medicare c if that is your choice you still have choices you can buy a managed care plan an hmo as many senior citizens do today and like it very much and get a very good deal or many of the people in medicare c will be able to have a voucher and be able to go out and but any feeforservice plan that is a plan where you can pick any doctor you want or they can go by some other managed care plan or many in medicare c will be able to buy health care exactly as the members of congress and other federal employees do through what we call the federal employees health benefit plan which has a whole array of choices that people will have we are not trying to limit peoples choices we are trying to increase choices we are trying to foster competition we are trying to get people to make choices between plans so that we get the best possible product highest quality at the lowest possible price which is as in health care what we want in everything else we believe therefore that we will constrain costs without cost controls without premium caps by the very competition that we will foster again you get everybody back in the pool you get everybody on more or less of a level playing field and then let the competition start and believe me i believe with all my heart there will be a tremendous competition in this country for the health care dollars that will be there what are the options today some people say well you are going to have twotier health care do you know what you have today you have four tier at least private payment medicare medicaid and no pay four different ways of payment under our program you are either going to have private or you are going to have medicare a b and c the medicare programs believe me a furious competition is going on today for medicare patients in all parts of the country to get them into managed care in the medicare program i was in an hmo in my own district where they are offering all the medicare benefits 1 200 worth of prescription drugs free as an inducement to get into their hmo and they are making money what does that tell you that tells you that real competition produces real results that people really will compete managed care plans will go after all of these people that will be covered under our health care system therefore competition will make all policies of all people more affordable than they are today the problem with the health care system has been that costs have been going up at 20 and 30 and in some areas of the country 40 percent and 50 percent a year driving people out of health care because they cannot afford it the reason to get everybody involved in the health care system and to have real competition is to keep health care affordable for all americans"], [0.5337796211242676, 0.4662203788757324, 1, "i too dustry rise in opposition to the schiff amend

antitrust adequacies of that particular account division at this time in our history i he did not apparently that is how we hope members will defeat the schiff attempt to get more resources in the amendment office of the unitedstates attorney is by ap mr doolittle mr chairman i pearing before those committees that move to strike the requisite number of appropriate those monies and he did words not do that i yield to the genwhat he does do however is come to tleman from new mexico the floor of the house and try to shift mr schiff i thank the gentleman moneys from the antitrust division at for yielding to me probably one of the worst times to do first of all i have to that he knows that during the 1980s respond to the gentleman from new the antitrust division was decimated jersey with whom i have worked very closely on the committee on the judiciary and with whom i share a very high regard that i did bring law enforcement to the attention of the appropriations subcommittee i circulated a letter among my colleagues in which 35 other members of the house both democrats and republicans joined me in asking the appropriations subcommittee to keep law enforcement of violent crimes as the top priority i have to assume that the gentleman from new jerseys office for some reason did not receive my request for his signature on that letter second i have to say in deference to the subcommittee to the gentleman from west virginia and to the ranking member the gentleman from kentucky mr r6oer very largely they did exactly that there were initial proposals for example to reduce the staffing at the fbi and dea drug enforcement administration that the subcommittee reversed i think they are to be commended strongly for that however mr chairinan i still think this item is a glaring exception to establishing correct priorities as i predicted at the beginning of the debate the basic opposition to my two amendments isa passionate defense of the antitrust division i do not quarrel with that defense of the antitrust division indeed if my amendment passes or if my two amendments pass i should say the antitrust division will still receive a 5 percent increase in funding over the last fiscal year the unitedstates attorneys increase will be less than 2 35 percent that is with my transfer right now the proposal is more than 13 percent increase for the antitrust division less than 2 percent for the unitedstates attorneys office mr chairman the percentage of increase even if my amendments are adopted wilf still give the antitrust division a significant increase ever their funding over the current fiscal year here is the point mr chairman the point is the priorities it is true that the antitrust divisions work load has gone up it is also true that the unitedstates attorneys offices work load in violent crimes and serious drug offenses has gone up equally significant with that we are poised to pass a new anticrime bill with a variety of new offenses new death penalties new life in prison without parole for career serious criminals the unitedstates attorneys office and not the antitrust division is responsible for enforcing those new laws those new laws if they become enacted i share the priority as stated by the president of the united states the president in public statements right here in this chamber to a joint session of congress as well as numerous statements throughout the country the president has said that our priority must be to combat violent criminals the president has never to the best of my knowledge made any public statement that he is concerned about the effect of a smaller increase or the effect at all on the antitrust division in other words the president has never said that we are afraid of being mugged by a bunch of antitrust violators although i acknowledge the important contribution of the antitrust division i think they should get an increase but i think our first priority as best we can should be on the unitedstates attorneys who will prosecute the violent criminals"]], "top_unsure": [[2.562999725341797e-06, 0.5000025629997253, 0, "i rise in support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from pennsylvania he together with the gentleman from connecticut are offering a fiscally prudent amendment that i believe deserves broad support earlier this year at the budget committee i worked very closely with the cosponsor of the amendment mr shays together we drafted the republican alternative amendment to the budget resolution on the international affairs portion of the budget that budget amendment included the provision now being jointly offered on a bipartisan basis by mr kanjorski and mr shays the purpose of the national endowment for democracy is certainly laudable although ned is often thought of as the main entity working to promote democratic development around the world there are in fact many different unitedstates government programs and funding mechanisms working in this field these range from aid judicial reform programs to unitedstates broadcasting services such as voa and radio free europe virtually all aspects of programs run by the unitedstates information agency in some way address the issue of democratic development as well moreover ned has a long history of poor budgetary and administrative practices in 1986 the gao issued a harshly critical report which ned promised to address then in 1991 the gao issued a followup report which found that ned had taken no real action to improve its budget and program oversight procedures faced with possible defunding 2 years ago ned did adopt a plan to respond to the gaos criticism a year ago the gao reported that if ned this time actually followed through the plan had the potential of improving its financial operations this episode points to an increasing concern i have had with ned over the past few years while i have no objection with the endowments stated purpose i believe that an annual legislative earmark for federal funding of this private institution has actually harmed neds effectiveness frankly i believe that this earmark has not only reduced the incentive for ned to conduct rigorous evaluation of its own programs and their effectiveness it has also led to a low level of agency oversight and direction compared to programs directly administered by the unitedstates government i have also been concerned by the continued rapid growth of federal funding for this private organization from fiscal year 1990 to fiscal year 1993 spending on ned doubled to the current funding level of 30 million this bill proposed to increase neds funding by another 60 percent to 48 million this is the single largest percentage increase contained in the entire bill i think we should be clear on what this amendment does not do it does not terminate the national endowment for democracy despite the word national in its name ned is a private organization while most of neds funding come from the unitedstates taxpayers the endowment and its fourcore grantees do raise private funds for their work certainly they could and should do more also it is still possible under this amendment for ned to receive federal funding all this amendment does is eliminate the 48million earmark for ned contained in this bill the endowment could still compete with other organizations for specific grants through usia or aid removing the earmark removes neds sense of an everexpanding entitlement to unitedstates taxpayer funds having to compete on a level playing field for federal funding will force ned to justify every proposed project this will not only vastly improve oversight over the endowments activities but will help ensure that all such activities are fully compatible with unitedstates foreign policy goals so again i would like to acknowledge this amendments fiscal responsibility with its passage it will further reduce this bills authorization below the fiscal year 1993 appropriated level i urge adoption of the amendment"], [9.47713851928711e-06, 0.4999905228614807, 1, "i thank the gentlewoman from north carolina first of all for her tireless efforts on behalf of children and of course

reconciliation that it must preserve the budget provisions that protect our nations children and offer them a window of hope the message is simple and it must register we must hold children harmless how do we do that how do we hold children harmless well we have got several programs that people have talked about today such as the childhood immunization initiative and we have to focus on some of the facts that have been presented to us earlier for example by the age of 2 a child needs 15 immunization shots yet today only 55 percent of our 2yearolds are fully immunized against vaccinepreventable diseases the house budget reconciliation bill would provide vaccines to 11 1 million children almost 5 million of whom currently have no health insurance for immunizations the senate version of the budget on the other hand offers nothing to these uninsured unimmunized children yet we know from research that for every dollar invested in child immunization that we save 4 or more dollars in averted healthcare costs another program is the family preservation and support program in 1992 2 9 million children were reported abused or neglected an average of about 8 000 per day family preservation and support focuses on prevention of child abuse and neglect and improves our foster care adoption and our welfare systems at the same time the house bill provides 1 5 billion for this initiative the senate offers no such provision we have the mickey leland hunger program and as we have heard over 11 million children are at risk of going hungry in the united states already the mickey leland hunger program increase food assistance to the poor and encourages child support from absent parents mostly fathers the senate version offers no funds to combat childhood hunger the house reconciliation bill would provide 7 3 billion and of course we have the earned income tax credit with so many people struggling in todays economy we must do whatever we can to provide them with some assistance to lift themselves if possible out of poverty the house bill provides 28 3 billion for the earned income tax credit for the working poor the senate 18 billion we are talking about people in the case of a family of two a mother and a child 9 441 it is nothing to get rich on it would be tragic if these provisions were denied to our families and their children again i strongly urge my colleagues on the conference committee to remember the children these children whom we brought into the world and to whom we are responsible they do not deserve to live in poverty go hungry be abused or be denied immunization when we can offer them an alternative we must support the childrens provisions in the reconciliation bill and we must most of all hold children harmless in this budget

tribute to bill ford for his three decades of distinguished service to the american people as a member of the house of representatives my pleasure in doing so is diminished only by the fact tha this body will lose one of its most talented dedicated and able member bill ford came to the house of representatives in 1964 and one of the first major issues he addressed as a freshman member under the leadership of president lyndon johnson was the federal role in education in this country as we are fond of saying bill ford was present for the creation of the first ever elementary and secondary education act and the higher education act both enacted in 1965 it has been through his stewardship ever since that the federal role in education has continued to be defined as limited but vitally important to educationally disadvantaged children and adults in this country it would be fitting to call mr fordmr education and i could go on about his strong personal commitment to the education of children youth and adults in this country for over 30 years but suffice it to say that many of us on this floor today would not have gone to college nor would our children if it had not been for him needless to say bill ford is not a singleissue member while we can speak here for hours about bill fords contribution to education you have only to mention the word labor and you get an immediate vision of the tenacious bill ford in his unending defense of the rights of working men and women in this country for example he worked for 13 years to bring to enactment the plant notification lawsaying that if companies were going to dump employees or move south of our borders they were damed well going to give adequate notification to employees before doing so he has been a longtime defender also of migrant children seeing to their right to a free and equal education in our public schools in spite of the transient nature of their lives in addition to elementary and secondary education issues it was bill ford who saw to it that middle income as well as lowincome american families were given a air share of federal college aid as a devoted supporter of vocational education he caused vocational training to take a quantum leap toward the 21st century and gave high school students a sure grasp on an increasingly technological world when he authored the techprep act when black lung reform legislation needed to move through his committee to the floor of the house bill ford was there he has been there to guide to enactment vital civil rights measures to feed hungry school children to care for and about older americans and to provide food supplements for poor pregnant women and their children from his heart he has diligently supported collective bargaining and the right of workers to strike without being permanently replaced he has expanded education for the handicapped assured access to employment opportunities for all disabled americans supported public and college libraries and has labored long and hard on behalf of professional development opportunities for teachers he has sponsored many initiatives as a member of the education and labor committee that are too numerous to mention here i would be remiss not to mention mr fords chairmanship of the post office and civil service committee where his major achievement was the timely reform the civil service retirement system throughout his chairmanship of the committee he was dedicated to improving and enhancing the terms and conditions of employment for federal workers and for federal retirees i sincerely offer these words in tribute to representative bill ford of michigan i wish time would permit a fuller reiteration of his many contributions to this country let us then take this opportunity

provision of this act i whole or in part if such provision is determined to require importation of any mineral beyond that 90 percent number that we have that is what the amendment says there is

a congressional stamp of approval on the proabortion side of the debate it is designed not to prevent violence but to discourage prolife protests the bill is clearly discriminatory from the word go it

only prolifers in the sixties before passage of the civil rights act there were sitins prayins and protests all around the country some were peaceful some were not in some circles the civil rights movement was not very popular but congress did not pass special laws to discourage civil rights protests because of their motivation or because of their viewpoint supporters of this bill and some in the media have tried to convince us that people who oppose abortion are violent and will use any means to further their causeincluding murdering abortion doctors and bombing clinics this is not true

have a right to oppose abortion i know it is not politically correct but we still have that right accompanying that right is the right to organize and protest peacefully but the freedom of access act slashes those first amendment rights to ribbons for people who oppose abortion and them alone yes we should punish violence threats of violence and intimidation but this bill goes beyond that it would punish people engaged in nonviolent free speech it would create harsh new penalties for people who engage in nonviolent civil disobedience this bill makes no distinction between violent and nonviolent

was of course an amendment that was accepted readily on the floor it had very very little discussion even as a matter of fact i think i am the only person that rose in opposition to it but it does turn out that as the manufacturing industry has focused on this particular amendment that it is going to do a great deal of damage not only to the bill but if adopted could do a great deal of damage economically to the country that is my concern about this legislation we have included a number of items in the bill that have had detrimental impact on the economy as a whole we included some social policy items and some economic policy items that could very dramatically undermine our ability to compete in the future this whole bill was supposed to be about competitiveness yet we turned down amendments aimed at helping the middle class and small business to be more competitive and we have adopted amendments that will undermine the ability of the manufacturing community to deal effectively with foreign competition so there are a number of concerns several more concerns will be raised in amendments in the course of today hopefully we can finish up this bill today and as we are moving toward finishing the bill one of the things we need to focus on is the economic impact of it a number of the amendments that will come up today will focus on that how much are we willing to spend how much money is going to be put into some of these programs that will be deficit money and that is the real issue here how much money are we willing to add to the deficit how much money are we willing

trade organization is for you then gatt is for you meanwhile the international trade deficit is killing americas competitive position in the world the unitedstates trade deficit in july alone in i month reached 10 99 billion the second highest level in our countrys history we have done a good job the last 2 years getting the budget deficit down unfortunately the trade deficit is getting larger and larger the deficit with japan alone in july was 5 67 billion the deficit with china which uses slave labor and has all the human rights violations that people on this floor have talked about the deficit just last month with china was 2 67 billion for too many years we have allowed other countries to write our trade laws that trade deficit of over 100 billion this year kills american jobs balancing our international trade account would save approximately 160 000 jobs every month that is why fair trade is so important tp building a strong economic future for northeast ohio and building a strong economic future across this country that is why i will be voting against gatt next week"]]}
