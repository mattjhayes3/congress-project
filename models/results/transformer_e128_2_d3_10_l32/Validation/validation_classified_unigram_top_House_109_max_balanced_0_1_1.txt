from the great state of massachusetts mr bill delahunt i am so glad mr delahunt is here we were talking earlier i had to chuckle there for a minute because mr delahunt always takes the opportunity and the privilege to share with us the printed word and it is good to have him here mr ryan will be joining us a little later if i could just take a moment here to let the members know that the great debate took place here on this floor a number of amendments were proposed to make sure that we pass a budget that is just and fair for every american but i must bring to the members attention because i think members do not realize what is happening or if they do realize what is happening i want to make sure that it is in the record that they know we talk about debt a lot in our 30 something working group and talking about debt and doing something about debt are two different things the republican majority continues to spend in a recordbreaking way that is bankrupting this country and changing the philosophy of this country which is payasyougo democrats we are the only party in this house that can say that we balanced the budget we have actually done it we have actually had surpluses as far as the eye can see republicans can only talk about well we would like to cut it in half and we would like to cut it back a quarter or what have you but i just want to make sure that folks understand that there was an article written on tuesday of this week entitled another possible bump to the debt ceiling 2 7 trillion budget plan pending before the house would raise the federal debt ceiling by nearly 10 trillion less than 2 months after the congress last raised the federal debt borrowing limit the provision is buried on page 121 of a 151page blueprint it serves as the backdrop for congressional action this week i think it is important and i usually have my letters here from the secretary of the treasury but i think it is important that the american people and the members of this house understand that what they are doing to this country recordbreaking debt i just want to make sure before we start off and then i am going to be kind of quiet here tonight because i know that we have a lot to share it is almost too much to share but i just want to share this with the members one more time we are talking about who are we borrowing from we are borrowing from japan at 682 8 billion china 249 8 billion the uk 223 2 billion the caribbean 115 3 billion taiwan 71 3 billion opec nations including saudi arabia and a number of nations that we have issues with 67 8 billion germany 65 7 billion korea 66 5 billion canada 53 8 billion and climbing if we do not stop this republican majority from continuing to raise this debt ceiling and burying it within the federal budget on what they believe their members have to vote for and this budget vote has been postponed and postponed and postponed not because the republican majority did not have time to deal with it they just did not want to do to their constituents what the majority wants them to do as long as we are here and we have breath in our bodies we are going to share with the members of this house that we will not allow this to be a back room with the lights off in the middle of the night proposition for the american people that they do not have any choices in but the special interests do i just in closing again history making this is not the kendrick meek report debbie wasserman schultz bill delahunt or tim ryan report this is facts not fiction the unitedstates department of the treasury backs this up 1 01 trillion borrowed in 224 years since 1776 to the year 2000 versus 1 05 trillion that was borrowed from 2001 to 2005 and counting from the president and the republican majority congress we are saying that we want to pay as we go we are saying that we want to make sure that we are fiscally responsible and we are saying that we are not going to allow the republican majority to be able to have these countries look at america in a different way than they were prior to this administration and prior to this republican congress i yield to the gentlewoman from florida

democratic whip mr steny hoyer and also our chairman mr james clyburn and i think it is also mr larson who is our vice chpir and the rest of the ranking members and other members of the democratic caucus an hour ago we were talking about the issues of fiscal responsibility we were talking about trying to make sure that the american taxpayer gets what tfiey deserve out of this government this government that they have elected to cometo washington d c to represent them to make sure that they get the biggest bang for their tax dollar i think it is important to point out that we are having some real financial issues right now some may say on the majority side ahid i do respect the members on the majority side and i know that there are a few members on the majority side that feel the way we feel here on the minority side on the democratic side of the aisle that we have to get our fiscal house in order and we are not there yet i can say here boldly and honestly that we are not there there are a number of thirdparty validators that are talking about the fiscal irresponsibility on the majority side and by this president that has put this country in financial jeopardy you have individuals saying we want to cut the deficit in half but meanwhile back at the ranch they want to borrow from countries like china they want to borrow from countries like saudi arabia and give those countries a piece of the american pie i think it is important that in the last hour when we talked about innovation we talked about putting america first we talked about not cutting student loans to everyday americans we talked about assisting that next generation and the generations that we expect to be able to stand up and make this and continue to make this country free and put us ahead as it relates to inventions as it relates to innovation we are talking about on this side of the aisle that we embrace and we appreciate our troops and our veterans but meanwhile in the presidents budget it talks about cuts in veterans affairs it talks about higher copayments for veterans i must say i am a democrat but guess what i represent republicans indepenlents green party and democrats back in my district and they feel the way that i do r have not had one constituent say congressman i want you to go to washington d c and make sure that you borpow as much money as possible so that i can pay it back with interest congressman i want you to go to washington d c and be irresponsible with my tax dollars and make sure that we do not have accountability as it relates to unbid contracts congressman i want you to look the other way when it comes down to making surethat you have the proper oversight so that we do not have this culture of corruption cronyism and incompetence that we are seeing on the majority side and in the white house right now i think it is very very important the perception that the american people and the reality that they are seeing right now this is not the kendrick meek or the 30something or the tim ryan report this is what is being printed every day in the papers it is not that the congress is taking a bold step to make sure that the children of america have what they need making sure that we have the kinds of innovation that the president spoke about making sure that the veterans do not have to pay a higher copayment for health insurance that we promised them as a country we salute one flag right now not because of coincidence because individuals have died for that opportunity we have individuals that have served and served in many theaters to make sure that we can salute one flag and the bottom line is we should not turn our backs on those individuals what mr ryan and i are going to talk about in this 30something hour is the tax on corruption the corruption tax that the american people have to pay and the american children have to pay and men and women that have worn a uniform have to pay guess what it is not just democrats it is not just republicans it is not just independents it is the american people it is not just the folks that vote it is not just the folks that do not vote it is not the folks who are seeking status that have green cards in this country that are legally here it is happening right now mr speaker and mr ryan i just want to say before i yield i feel good about the fact that we were talking about the k street project 2 years ago night after night week after week we talked about it we were honest and upfront with the american people that something was fundamentally wrong when you have a k street project talk about it put a press release out about it about how we have this relationship with the special interests what about a relationship with the american people mr speaker so now we have a lobbyist here in this town that has admitted to guilt mr ryan that has said i have broken the law we do nothave to have a trial because the evidence is so strong we do not have to have a jury pool we do not have to have pedple come in and waste 6 months of their lives on a jury pool and a jury selection i will admit to guilt days after this particular lobbyist said i am guilty i am willing to help the government in seeking out those members that were part of this"], [0.006212711334228516, 0.9937872886657715, 1, "mr ryan i dont give the president total credit for all of this he couldnt do it by himself you have to have a rubber stamp congress to give you full power full power to be able to take the country down the track it has gone down and the bottom line is that a republican majority from the leadership on down to the newly elected member of the republican conference has to take credit for giving the president the kind of power that he has right now we are fighting wars abroad for democracy when here at home we dont celebrate that very democracy that so many people speak of we have individuals that are on their third and fourth deployment i am on the armed services committee so i get the reports i get the letters from my constituents saying my husband my wife my mother my dad my niece my uncle my nextdoor neighboris on his way back to iraq again abec se we went alone we didnt go with a true coalition so i think it would be hard if i was a part of the republican majority to try to muster up some talking points for the floor right now to be able to say well okay some of this stuff is not believable so lets try to attack some members of the democratic caucus lets try to muster up and embellisha record on possibly being weak on terrorism or being weak on national security thats where the republican majority is now they are gasping for political air right now but you know what is so important about this issue and this discussion about national security is that it is supposed to be nonpolitical and unfortunately it is and that is because the majority hasnt allowed bipartisanship in this house for so many years and so they can hang it around their neck and say it is our war it is our failure as it relates to national security and border security dont act like it is a crisis right now you allowed it to happen under your watch you have been the rubber stamp congress now mr ryan and ms wasserman schultz let me just tell you what the rubber stamp congress has accomplished borrowing 1 05 trillion from foreign nations in 4 years in more than 224 years of this countrys history with 42 presidents 1 01 trillion they were able to borrow in 4 years and this republican congress and the president has allowed that to happen these are the countries here that own a part of the american apple pie japan china the u k the caribbean taiwan germany and opec nations you know this whole oil thing that we will talk about in a minute korea and canada they all have their hands in the pockets of the unitedstates taxpayers not because of the unitedstates taxpayers but because of the republican majoritys outofcontrol spending oil companies oh wow at this time in history when they unearth what happened under this republican majority and this presidency they will see these record breaking profits there was a meeting in the white house i have the article to prove it and i talk about it all time it was a special meeting that took place in the white house and the vice presidents aides and all met and then the policymakers came here to the congress to the rubber stamp congress now let me set this up here because we believe in the 30something working group in thirdparty validators washington post wednesday november 16 2005 white house document shows that executives from big oil companies met with vice president cheneys energy task force in 2001 something long expected by environmentalists but denied as recently as last week by the white house last week industry officials testified before congress document obtained by the post on november 2005 shows that officials from exxon mobil phillips shell oil companies and bp of america met in the white house complex with cheney aides to develop a national energy policy parts of which became law and parts of which are still being debated in congress that was 2001 look what happened 2002 34 billion recordbreaking profits 2003 53 billion 2004 84 billion 2005 113 billion in profits for oil companies meanwhile average americans are spending through the nose and trying to make it to work and to drop their kids off look what happened here this is what happened under the republican majority and a rubber stamp congress so shall it be written and so shall it be done e85 we talk about alternative fuels flex vehicles every magazine i open talks about flex vehicles here is the bottom line the republican congress have allowed these oil companies to be able to do anything they want to do when they want to do it this is an actual pump here at an exxonmobil station it says you cannot use your mobil credit card to buy e85 meanwhile we can continue to feed off the saudi arabian middle east what got us in this thing in the first place policies you can use your oil card there you can buy a bag of chips you can buy a carton cigarettes but e85 that is produced in the midwest versus the middle east you cannot use your mobil credit card for that and on retirement packages and i dont know very much about lee raymond but the bottom line is he is a retired executive from exxonmobil with a 398 million retirement package and a 2 million tax break this is what happens with a republican majority again the republican majority rubber stamp dont worry about balancing the budget democrats we tried to balance the budget we have done it before we have tried to do it under this republican majority not one republican vote to balance the budget on rollcall vote 87 march 17 2005 ranking member spratt and the budget committee put it forth again failed not one republican vote on rollcall vote 91 in 2004 their will and desire is not there the american people deserve balance minimum wage yes there was some bill that came up before we left for the break to talk about minimum wage a bill that the republican majority knew that the senate would not take up and would never make it to the presidents desk but because we were hammering them on it they said lets pass this they added all kinds of stuff it is called the potomac twostep this chart the bottom line is these are not minimum wage increases these are increases for members of congress this is our pay this is what we make oh look at them since 1997 there hasnt been an increase in the minimum wage and you not a minimum wage worker right now and i am not talking to the members of congress i am talking to the american people the bottom line is if the minimum wage goes up and that means if you are a salaried worker then your wages will go up but the bottom line is that it is a fact that the republican congress has said not over our dead body we are going to get our increase but we are not going to give the american people a minimum wage increase it goes on and on and on i am going to close with this the prime minister of iraq and the president of iran mr delahunt brought this picture out last night i dont care whichever way you cut 300 billion of spending over 2 000 troops thousands and thousands of american troops injured here in washington d c stay the course no plan the secretary of defense says if you talk about or say anything about redeployment of troops or withdrawing from iraq you are fired no question from the congress no response from the congress the secretary of defense is not called to the hill immediately the republican congress what are they saying they are saying nothing so accountability is not there they are embracing and guess what this is a la the unitedstates taxpayer through the republican majority because of a lack of diplomacy and a lack of plan and going to a war of choice versus after osama bin laden in afghanistan andgiving those troops in afghanistan the support they need so ms wasserman schultz mr ryan i rest my case the bottom line is that was not a message for democrats or republicans it was not a message for independents or the green party or other party affiliations that is a message for americans the bottom line is whatever you may feel if you are a member of the republican executive committee or you have always voted republican or you always voted independent you have to have issues with what the facts are i yield to ms wasserman schultz"], [0.006226718425750732, 0.9937732815742493, 1, "it is an honor to come before the house once again as you know the 30something working group we come to floor if not every other day every day to not only share with the members but also the american people about many of the issues that we fight for for them here in this unitedstates house of representatives i must say that there are a number of things that we can talk about this evening but i just want to start off because i know that not only the democratic leader but also the entire democratic caucus is looking to hopefully put america in a new direction we want to make sure that we provide the leadership on behalf of all americans as you know i want to start off tonight but as you know we have been sharing it with the members so that hopefully it will have some sort of lift here in the house it has not had thus far but weare willing to provide the leadership even in the minority even though the majority is not willing to pick up the philosophy that we are pushing here on behalf of the american people making sure that we have more affordable health care this is on housedemocrats gov also lower gas prices to achieve energy independence which we have our energy plan on housedemocrats gov and our innovation plan that has been there for some time and filed legislation here in the house that has not been heard we want to talk about homeland security we have a real security plan also on that website that is there for the members they have to have the will and the desire to be able to take up these plans and these initiatives and if we were able to work in a bipartisan way these plans would already be passed not only in the appropriations act but also here on the floor the two other things that i want to mention as it relates to cutting the cost of college cost as you know the cost to go to college has gone up this republicanled congress last not helped in that area they have not helped the everyday average american to be able to meet the increases that they have been asked to pay and also in a new direction for america is making sure that we follow through with fiscal responsibility pay as we go not just on a credit card not just saying because we can give tax cuts to millionaires and we will just puv it off on future generations or we will go to foreign nations and borrow a record number of dollars these nations that i am holding up here they own a part of the american apple pie not because of what the american people have done it is what the republican congress has done and allow these countries to buy our debt because we are not fiscally responsible i think it is also important to make sure that we encourage working families people that are making minimum wage i just want to make this point then i am going to give it to my friend mr ryan from youngstown ohio as you know we have had time after time again three or four occasions in the 109th congress that we have asked the republican majority to join us in raising the minimum wage to make sure that the american workers are able to keep up with the costs of not only living but inflation but it has been well said and mr ryan will point it out with his chart that he has there in a moment that the republican congress is in no way and in no shape ready to give minimum wage workers an increase since 1997 they have not had an increase but here in the 30something working group we actuallytake time to find out the facts because we want to make sure that we are not telling the american people nor members of this house something that is inaccurate i must say that in 1998 members of congress received 3 100 in a pay increase and we are not minimumwage workers in 1998 minimum wage workers zero mr ryan in 2000 members of congress received a pay increase of 4 600 guess what same year minimumwage workers zero 2001 members of congress received 3 800 minimumwage workers zero in 2002 members of congress received another pay increase 4 900 almost 5 000 pay increase remember we just got one in 2002 i was not a member yet but it happened minimumwage workers zero 2003 members of congress 4 700 pay increase just got one last year getting another one in 2003 of course minimumwage workers zero punch in and punch out every day they work a 40hour work week catch the early bus trying to raise their children members of congress 2004 3 400 pay increase same year minimumwage workers zero mr ryan thanks to the republican majority 2005 it is great to be in congress too bad every american cannot be and minimumwage workers cannot be 2005 members of congress 4 000 tell you the republican majority takes care of their own and us too 2005 zero for minimumwage workers proposed increase for members of congress 3 100 and of course this year again 2006 zero for minimumwage workers"], [0.006337523460388184,

the printed word when it comes down to the budget that is handed out from the white house and when it comes down to what this republican majority does it is 2 000 from what the 911 commission called for and what we called for as house democrats versus the presidents proposal and you can look it up on line that only asks for 210 agents democrats fought for the funding on almost five different occasions again for the record ms wasserman schultz h r 1268 a motion to recommit and 2 000 vote number 160 and that happened on 5 5 05 also you look at house bill 2360 was blocked it was an obey amendment vote number 174 that was on 5 17 05 it failed 223 to 185 on a partisan vote h r 1817 a motion to recommit 2005 again vote number 188 again failed on partisan lines you start talking about on border security and closing the gaps on nine separate occasions over the last 5 years democrats put forth motions here on this floor because that is the only thing we can do being in the minority we are not able to bring the bills to the floor because the majority is blocking those bills from getting out of committee and they are noted right here and i am not going to go through that at this particular time but all of this is on line housedemocrats gov if anyone wants to go on and get this information also when you start talking about aviation security democrats offered a motion to require air cargo to be screened within 3 years the motion was rejected by republicans again 2005 vote number 188 5 18 05 democrats have spoken repeatedly on the issue of transit security making sure that we authorize including a 2 8 billion initiative to improve transit security and a 1 billion initiative to improve rail security substitute amendment defeated again so when you start look looking at the record and what the record says versus what is said here on the floor by the republican majority and the rubber stamp majority i wish the rubber stamp republican majority would stop fighting us and start saying to the president guess what we no longer want to rubber stamp everything that you send here i just wish the republican majority would just leader up and say hey mr president so you start reading the paper could someoneget me a newspaper please because i want to just have it as a prop because as americans start reading the paper they are reading about how republican members of the house and the senate the president flies into town they get on the plane and leave town some even get in their car and go i was on the other side of my district well let me tell you something if the president of the united states is in my district i think i would know i think it would be some sort of news flash or some sort of email that would come to me and say you know the president is coming in your district today will be in an elementary school maybe you want to be there he is the leader of the free world maybe you want to be there the reason why they are taking flights while the president is coming in the reason why they are finding something else to do while the president is in their town is the fact that they dont want to be caught in the same situation with the president of the united states because they have not stood up to the president and said no you cant put us in a financial situation as far as the eye can see as it relates to deficits and foreign countries running the world you cant pick up the paper today not talking about a republican running from the president of the united september 12 2006 co states and dont want to be around when the president is around or explaining why they are not there that is some excuse i hope i never get to the situation where i have the president of the united states coming into my district and i have to explain that i am somewhere else while the president is there and the bottom line is this people cannot face the music when it comes down to dealing with the policies of this administration and better yet you being in the position there is only 535 of us being in the position as i come in for a landing ms wasserman schultz to be able to bring about change on behalf of the american people to say this is not going to happen to say i know you want to start a war in iraq but we still got this business over here with al qaeda who had everything to do with 9 11 who trained the individuals that carried out the 9 11 plot but meanwhile while we are over therelooking for osama bin laden and we have him cornered i got this unfinished business the president said over here in iraq because i got a problem with this leader over here we got to take him out but what about the after player what is going to happen once you get to baghdad how are you going to bring stability who is going to be in the coalition calling up a couple of friends ill send 25 troops ill send 30 troops you are not allowed to talk about it everything is secret we have the then sitting attorney general comes to the unitedstates congress over on the senate side and tells the senate you are either with us or you are with the terrorists 0l 2340 what kind of mess is that so when it comes down to article i section 1 and if the american people want the kind of representation they need i am not talking as a democrat even though we were given an hour by the deqiocratic leader and we are all members of the democratic caucus this is america i guarantee you if the shoe was on the other foot ms wasserman schultz i cannot help but imagine the kind of chaos and protest and finger pointing and them and they and all of the things that will be said some of the stuff will have to be stricken from the record because the republican side will be carrying on about the democrats but they cannot say it they cant do it they cannot even kind of paint a picture because they have been in charge of the whole thing since it started so if the american people want a new direction if the american people want accountability if the american people want a house and a senate that will carry out article i section 1 of the unitedstates constitution and a lot of blood is on this constitution but if they want that then they will vote for a new direction in november i am done ladies and gentlemen with begging the republican majority to stand up on behalf of the american people because i am looking at what the oil companies are getting they are getting theirs i am looking at what these contractors are getting either it be katrina or the war in iraq they are getting theirs i am looking at the issue of health care and all of the people that are running to the bank with all of the dollars and all of the influence and all of the access into this congress they are getting theirs meanwhile we are sitting around here talking about the minimum wage and we cant even get a doggone bill passed off this floor to be able to provide the american people with a minimum wage meanwhile we are giving ourselves a nice fat pay raise every year 4 100 here 3 100 there oh we have the money for that but we dont have the money for the people who are punching in and punching out every day this has to come to an end and that is the reason why ms wasserman schultz that i believe there is a wind of change it may not be outside the hall of this chamber but it is out there in america it is in towns and it is in big cities and it is in emerging

break this down for the members because we want to make sure that members dont go back home in november and giving political speeches saying that oh well i didnt know we were doing that or i didnt know that we were breaking a record in borrowing from foreign nations we want to make sure that the congressional record reflects that those of us on this side of the aisle actually brought it to the floor in a form that a middle school or a fifth grader can understand and it is important that we break it down to this point so that no one can say that they misunderstood they didnt quite know what they were voting for i made a mistake or whatever the case may be because now in this day in this congress we are making history in all the wrong places and in all the wrong ways i think it is important that we point this out i want to make sure that i get that washington post article that talked about a special meeting at the white house the innovation agenda i want to make sure that the members go on housedemocrats gov and get a copy of the innovation agenda so that hopefully folks can be enlightened on what we have been talking about and promoting not just yesterday not just last month this has been around and the only reason why it is not implemented now is that the republican majority will not allow legislation to come to the floor outside of the original thoughts of president bush or the republican leaders i think it is important that we understand an innovation agenda we talk about education and creating the workforce for the future making sure that there is math and science education that we work on that and we provide the necessary dollars for it invest in research and also development that promotes publicprivate partnerships where many ceos you will see on housedemocrats gov have already become a part of what we are talking about and encouraging that to happen affordable guaranteed broadband access throughout the country need it be if you are in the heartland of america you are on the east coast you are on the west coast you are down south you are up north you should be able to have an opportunity at this broadband initiative that we have for all americans achieving energy independence we talked about that withir 10 years not maybe one day not counting on the oil companies to do it but the congress setting the stage this house setting the stage for that to happen providing small businesses with the tools that they need to be able to create jobs i am just going to take about 10 minutes here breaking this thing down if not shorter of talking about how we are making history in all the wrong ways the republican majority i must say has done an outstanding job on behalf of president bush you have got to hand it to them if there was an oscar an emmy or a grammy to give out the republican majority would get it as it relates to rubberstamping everything the administration hands down i hold here and this is no secret to many of the

borrowed 1 05 trillion from foreign nations we have the republican congress right under the presidents picture because he couldnt do it by himself fortytwo united states presidents 224 years were only able to borrow 1 01 trillion from foreign nations how could that be one may say how can you do this in 4 years 1 05 trillion from foreign nations in 224 years 200 years shy of what the president has been able to do 1 01 trillion let me tell you that is staggering that is not something that it happened in the forties or it happened in the thirties once upon a time calculate it fortytwo presidents 224 years we are not just here as the 30 something working group and dreaming up something those numbers are from the unitedstates department of treasury who do we owe who has their hands in the pockets of the american taxpayer i dont care if you are a republican independent you dont vote yet or whatever the case may be a democrat you have to have a problem with these nations owning a piece of the american apple pie japan like it or not i know it is painful for some of the members to hear this but this is the reality under a republican majority japan 682 8 billion that they own of the american apple pie thanks to the republican majority rubberstamping the bush policies china 249 8 billion of the american apple pie that they own right now not because of the american people lack of making the right fiscal decisions but it is because the republican majority has allowed it to happen with the american taxpayer dollar the u k 223 2 billion caribbean nations 115 3 billion taiwan 71 3 billion opec nations oh my goodness opec nations we cant do enough for them but they are buying our debt 67 8 billion germany 65 7 billion korea 66 5 billion and canada 53 8 billion the reason why you see the american flag in silhouette as it relates to the united states of america excluding alaska and hawaii and puerto rico and other unitedstates territories but just to show this silhouette of the mainland of the united states of amerida the reason why we have that if you want to do away with the debt elect a democratic majority because we have done it the republican majority they are saying well were going to cut it in half it is almost like if there is a cliff and you are in a vehicle and you have to stop the vehicle before it goes pver the cliff we are qaying st op you are saying gp at half speed you go at half speed you are going"], [0.006539463996887207, 0.9934605360031128, 1, "and in 2005 113 billion now i can tell you what is happening as it relates to whose side they are on now one may say ms jacksonlee and i am glad that those of us here in the 30something working group we do our homework before we come to the floor i cant say that about all members that come to the floor as it relates to having the facts because what is important here is the truth facts where people can follow up and not fiction and folks are not used to that out of this majority and not used to that here in washington dc and that is what we are saying we want to provide because nothing is better than the truth because no matter what party you are affiliated with we still salute one flag thanks to our men and women that were in uniform veterans and those that are in uniform now the least that we can do is be straight withthem and being straight with them is basically just saying just recently june 22 here on this floor democrats worked to raise the minimum wage and this was appealing to the rule of the chair by mr rangel in a motion to offer the minimum wage increase and he was ruled out of order and it was appealed and then the republicans voted against us from having it on the floor by 229 votes to 195 and that is rollcall vote 313 again june 27 which is a couple of days from the first time from that attempt that we moved to get the minimum wage up the science state justice commerce appropriations bill when it was here on this floor ms jacksonlee you were here that day i saw you the rule to block consideration of the obeyhoyermollohan amendment to increase the minimum wage rollcall vote 319 the rule was adopted but there was a procedural move to block us from getting this on the floor the house adopted a resolution to adjourn for the fourth of july recess without bringing up the bill to increase the minimum wage that is rollcall vote to adjourn which was rollcall vote 353 to adjourn and i think it is important that was 220 supermajority voted for it 197 voted against it it was only one republican that was on our side and saying that we shouldnt leave until we deal with it so ms jacksonlee i wouldnt get concerned about what they say because that is what speaker gingrich has said he has the chart and if staff can give me the chart that said they that they that is what he calls the republican majority that is what they called the republican majority you remember that mr ryan because he felt that they are no longer responsible in a way that he thought they should be when he was the father of giving case in point once again thirdparty validator this was the speaker of the house when the republicans took control of the house and this is what he has to say and this was in the knight ridder newspaper friday march 31 2006 they are seen by the country as being in charge of a government that cant function they he is talking about the republican majority they goodness gracious if speaker foley came and called us they i mean this would be a travesty this is newt gingrich this is not someone in some club somewhere or someone that doesnt have house credentials he was here on this floor he was the speaker he was the leader in the republican majority and he was the speaker he wasnt majority leader he wasnt a whip he wasnt over the conference he wasnt over a caucus he was the speaker he sat there on the speaker rostrum he was the man his picture hangs up back here in the speakers lobby i cant boil this down any further to say that it is substantial when a chief republican says they and so what we are talking about here ms jacksonlee and mr ryan is something that everyone should understand republicans have to have a problem republican voters and independent voters and democratic voters have to have a problem with a dysfunctional government that is making history in all the wrong ways and i am going to share that chart but i am going to yield to you i see mr ryan is here and i want to come back on our chart of irresponsibility that has taken place because i want to make sure if we have got to say it 1 000 times i that we have said it 1 001 times so that the american people when they are asked to make a decision in november"], [0.006553471088409424, 0.9934465289115906, 1, "it is an honor to address the house and we would like to also thank the democratic leadership for allowing us to have the time as you know the 30something working group we come to the floor daily to share not only with the members of the house but also the american people about plans we have that is in holding or in waiting not because of the fact that we are not willing to move forth on behalf of the american people it is because the republican majority has decided not to govern on the side of the american people i feel that this is very very hard core for everyday americans because they are in waiting not only inthe area of minimum wage but also affordable fuel prices and real solutions as relates to protecting our country and also making sure that our veterans who have allowed us to serve who have allowed us to salute one flag will be honored in the area of health care and other areas that we have promised them i am going to start off my comments and i am glad mr delahunt is here and i know others are on their way to the floor to at least talk about this minimum wage conversation that we are having here on the floor of the house of representatives i feel that we should take action we want to take action on this side of the aisle democrats united in making sure that some 6 millionplus americans are able to get a pay increase something that members of congress have enjoyed overa number of years but everyday working americans are not able to receive more minimum wage than what they are receiving right now they are right now making 5 and some change and i mean it is unconscionable for members of the house to be able to walk away with an increase costofliving increase meanwhile those individuals that are punching in and punching out every day are still making the same rate that they were making in 1997 it would be an uproar here in this house if members of congress had not received a pay raise since 1997 one thing that i can say here on this side of the aisle the democratic leadership and the democratic caucus has said we will not stand for an increase for members of congress to make more money if we are not going to raise the level of minimum wage for everyday americans and so again we come with thirdparty validators we come with the facts to share with the american people and we come to let the american people know and members on the majority side that we have the will and the desire to lead and we will if we have the opportunity after november i just wanted to share a few things because there are a lot of folks that are out there saying that they are fighting on behalf of the everyday american so i thought i would just bring a couple of visual aids and also some information this is the source of the college board 2005 as it relates to the census and what americans are dealing with i want to start with this next chart here i want to start with this chart minimum wage and this is real economic change under bush here you have the minimum wage that is at zero starting in 1997 to now since 1997 to now whole milk has gone up 24 percent bread has gone up 25 percent a 4year public college education has gone up 77 percent health care insurance has gone up 97 percent meanwhile americans are still making 5 and change regular gas has gone up 136 percent still no message from the republican majority for everyday working americans that punch in and punch out every day li 2310 here are some other statistics still from 1997 no increase in the minirhum wage for everyday working americans college tuition has gone up in private institutions 40 percent gas prices again as it relates to the middle class has gone up 47 percent and 55 percent for prescription drugs i think it is important that we look at those to go further i think it is important that we share this the facts are hard but they are true in 1998 a member of congress received a raise of 3 100 that was in 1998 in 1998 the minimum wage was zero again in 2000 members of congress received a 4 600 raise that is more money everyday working americans in 2000 minimum wage zero thanks to the republican majority i just said in 2000 mr delahunt members received a pretty substantial raise in 2001 members of congress received a 3 800 raise of course we are not minimumwage workers the american people in 2001 zero nothing the republican majority said they are not going to have it in 2002 again a 4 900 that is a lot of money increase for members of congress the american people in 2002 zero it pays to have a voting card in congress you can give yourself a raise but the folks that elect you just have to suck it up now this is like on a roll here in congress in 2003 a 4 700 increase in members of congress pay the american people guess what zero nothing at alr thanks to the republican majority in 2004 a 3 400 raise for members of congress guess what members american people minimum wage raises zero these are the facts i challenge any member on the republican side the majority to come down and challenge me on these facts in 2005 it continues a 4 000 raise once again you are a member of congress that comes up here who say they are representing you it is a wonderful thing get a raise in 2005 4 000 the american people zero in 2006 members of congress proposed raise 3 100 mr delahunt my 9yearold son and my 11yearold daughter can guess the american people to this date zero now i want to go back to this chart because i think it is very revealing and very accurate i have been in this business for 25 years and i never voted for an increase in the minimum wage and i am opposed to it and i think that a vast majority of our conference is opposed to it that is the leader of the republican congress that is the majority leader now mr delahunt there are members that come to this floor and say the democrats are just demagoguing there are people who come to this floor and say we are for you they are not for leading i think it is important mr delahunt that we come to the floor and share with the american people and the members of congress that we will not rest even though we are in the minority that we are still willing to fight for them now the difference between the republican majority and the democratic minority is the fact that the majority has the power to be able to make things happen here in this house on behalf of the american people as it relates to the minimum wage and it is fair play i went through this list pay increases year after year 4 000 here 4 700 there 3 100 here and zero since 1997 on behalf of the american people who punch in and punch out every day meanwhile health care cost is up meanwhile the cost of bread and milk is up meanwhile gas prices are up by 136 percent but back at the ranch and here in this house the members of congress are being taken care of the special interests are being taken care of but guess what the individuals who woke up early on a tuesday morning for representation are being left behind since 1997 and there are members on the majority side saying over their dead bodies literally will they receive an increase because they are so indebted mr delahunt to their special interests so all we can fight with here is the fact not fiction but fact that we have a republican majority that is willing to govern for the few for those individuals who have the opportunity to come to washington and to be able to gain access through the k street project and other programs that allow them to give politically and have gangs here in the house a former member of this house used to boast about the fact that if they were not on the list of contributors they couldnt come in and see them that is a former member of the house and if anybody wants to challenge me on it from the majority side i will be happy to reveal that former members name i think we all know and it was an active program in the house and i believe there are still some elements of that program now the fact that special interests do not want an individual making 5 and some change to receive a couple dollars increase is very unfortunate and mr delahunt i am very concerned about that let me just take 3 more minutes mr delahunt and then i am going to yield to you because you have some very interesting charts over there let us talk about who is getting what in the past you have heard me read this and i want to read it again because when it comes down to when their constituents want to know whose side they are on i want the members to be armed with the facts i am proud that i am trying to do everything i can do on behalf of my constituents back in the 17th congressional district in dade and broward county but by their sending me to congress and mr delahunt to congress they federalized us to represent the people of the united states of america and i think it is our obligation to share the facts members can follow me they can go on washingtonpost com this was an article november 16 2005 on the front page a white house document shows that executives from big oil companies met with vice president dick cheneys energy task force in 2001 something long suspected by environmentalists but denied as recently as a week ago by industry officials testifying before congress the document obtained this week by the washington post shows that officials from the exxonmobil corporation phillips shell oil company and bp america inc met in the white house complex with the cheney aids who were developing national energy policy parts of which became law and parts of which are still being debated here in the house this is an article it is not from the democratic caucus it is not from my office or mr delahunts office let us see what happened that meeting mr delahunt and members was in 2001 here are the profit margins of big oil companies since that meeting in 2002 i think that was a pretty good meeting to go to 34 billion in profits thanks to the republican majoritys passing policy that would allow oil companies to spend tle taxpayers dollars and to be able to have subsidies and make these profits in 2003 59 billion in profits i think that meeting was worth going to and whoever recommended and got them into the white house complex to meet with the cheney aides i think they got a promotion and possibly a bonus li 2320 in 2004 84 billion oil profits up guess who is paying for it the american people in 2005 113 billion in profits and the numbers are not even in from 2006 i know that these facts have to have some members who may be in their offices right now or sitting up in their beds feel uncomfortable but unfortunately that is not happening because it continues why is this man smiling here it is nothing against him i dont have anything personally against oil companies they are getting what the majority republican conference here in this house has allowed them to have it is one thing for someone to gay i will support you and your political endeavors it is another thing for you to say i am with you all the way even if it costs my constituents more at the pump here is a man that a lot of workers wish they had such a deal a 398 million retirement package and a 2 million tax break ala the republican majority an exxon former executive it is almost unfair someone may say that if i didnt have the thirdparty validators the congressional record and votes by the majority to back up what i am saying some folks would say that is unfair i wouldnt even be able to walk the halls of congress or talk to my colleagues on the republican side if i wasnt telling the truth i think it is important that everyone understands if you are a republican you have to have a problem with what i just presented you have to if you are a democrat you have to have a problem the information i am sharing with you that the republican majority is allowing to happen we on this side have called for an increase in the minimum wage we on this side have called for tough legislation on price gouging we on this side have talked about making ourselves energy independent not investing in the middle east but investing in the midwest as it relates to e85 so i think it is important that everyone understands when we are in the majority if the american people see fit we will put forth policy that will benefit all americans i think it is important if you are an independent you have to have a problem with the fact that members of congress have received thousands upon thousands of dollars of raises since 1997 and still no response from the republican majority as it relates to the minimum wage"],

that democracy is government of the people by the people and for the people repocracy is absolutely the opposite of that repocracy is a government where open debate is replaced by lockstep discipline and where the rewards of the few become the burdens carried on the backs of the many repocracy puts a price on american values and deals only in hard cash you only have to watch cspan to know what the real threat repocracy poses f6r the last 6 years the republican party has been a disciplined monotone political machine republicans live by one rule whatever the president wants the president gets war in iraq rubber stamp approval tax holidays for americas rich rubber stamp approval slashing student loans rubber stamp approval cutting programs for americas vulnerable children and disadvantaged families rubber stamp approval legislation written by financial institutions and big drug companies rubber stamp approval it was all so neat and tidy republican members of the house voted the way they were told and leaders would not end voting in the house until their predetermined outcome was achieved but that was last year what has changed the american people noticed the american people put a lot of faith and trust in their leaders for better or for worse most americans take the big picture approach trust elected officials until they betray that trust believe that elected officials will put americas interests ahead of political interests have faith that your leaders will change course when something is truly not working in other words trust but verify it is precisely because the american people focus on the big picture that republicans are doing everytbing possible to replace the image the american people see with a test pattern on television the presidents ratings are below sea level rbpublicans are counting the number of seats in the lifeboats it is simple arithmetic and the addition has republicans subtracting mathematics requires proof and there is plenty the president bequeaths to the future president any decision about iraq his plan takes form stay in iraq until it is somelbody elses problem invite the embattled president of italy to address a joint session of the unitedstates congress speaking in italian to use congress as a pqlitical campaign for a backdrop in an italian electioii charge the iraq war on credit and mask its real impact on the deficit by leaving it outside the annual budget the clearest sign of all is the recent change in the house of representatives to the 2minute vote call it government by stopwatch a mere 120 seconds to decide the faith of legislation affecting the lives of every american under repocracy legislation comes to the floor of the house only when its passage is guaranteed that is why we are going home today because they cant get the budget it is not guaranteed the 2minute drill forces blind allegiance and stiff arms democracy but that is the intent of repocracy math is math republicans are losing their stranglehold on power what is a party to do well republicans have concluded the best offense is a missing offense so republicans have substituted the business of the state for the business of reelection suddenly the house leaders feel an urgent need for recess after recess after recess we have never had a week off for saint patricks day it must be faithbased the republican mandated congressional schedule has nothing to do with the peoples business and everything to do with the republicans reelection business the thinking goes like this if members are not in washington d c the national press corps is taken out of the equation they cant trail 435 house members so news coverage goes dark with congress out of session americans cannot watch cspan to see for themselves what is happening or not on the floor of the house the curtain closes on the big picture mission accomplished the word congress comes from the latin con egresso which meam come together the idea was for an orderly and reasoned debate take out the stopwatch and clock 2 minutes then decide if you think america is governed by a functioning congress today repocracy is not merely a dereliction of duty it is an outright threat to democracy that is the big picture the one republicans dont want the american people to see but there is more than one channel and the american people are watching they would like to know why this is the donothing congress that will be in session less than the donothing congress of 1948 this will be the congress that spent the least time discussing our problems on the floor we are at war all over the place we are in debt worse tlian we have ever been in history we have no health care for 46 million people but where is the congress they have left they have gone home they have got to campaign if they were here the people could see they were doing nothing but repocracy says we only do it when we rubber stamp it for the president otherwise we are getting out of here now

quarterly financial report data are used by the treasury department in developing economic policy and by the private sector in planning for the future there are two important issues that were considered by our committee in reauthorizing this data collection first the quarterly financial report is a mandatory survey that means that businesses can be prosecuted if they do not provide the information the census bureau requests secondly like any survey the quarterly financial report imposes a certain burden on those who provide the information to the government the quarterly financial report is one of the few mandatory data collections authorized by congress the decennial census is mandatory and is required by our constitution the census bureau also conducts the american community survey as a mandatory survey telling respondents that they are required by law to provide the requested information that authority does not come from any explicit authorization by congress but rather through an interpretation of the law by the office of management and budget as representatives of the people congress should monitor closely any information collected that carries with it a penalty

quality of the information collected would seriously decline the quarterly financial report asks businesses to provide detailed information on financial transactions during the quarter in return the government and the private sector use this information to form sound economic policy according to the census bureau the basic form can take up to 10 hours to complete and the average is almost 4 hours i believe that is a fair balance of burden and benefit i am a strong supporter of a quarterly financial report through my work on the joint economic committee i have seen firsthand the importance of the data provided by this survey at the same time i take my responsibility as an authorizer seriously when we reauthorized this program in 1998 it was for 7 years i appreciate the chairmans willingness to make this authorization for 10 years rather than a permanent authorization i believe our committee should regularly review programs that place mandatory burdens on the public i urge my

all the members on his side for bringing to us this bipartisan legislation one of the most important parts of the bill is the reauthorization of appro iriations for the labor departments homeless veterans reintegration program hvrp through fiscal year 2009 with a maximum level of 50 million per year this program has proven to be very successful in providing job training and other services that help our nations veterans get back into productive lives together with the ranking member mr evans i convened a homeless veterans forum just last thursday may 18 we heard some very tough statistics hardtohear statistics about our nations veterans each night as many as 200 000 veterans are sleeping in a doorway under a bridge in an alley in a box in a barn or a car or homeless shelter in fact one out of every three homeless males is a veteran most of those from vietnam a hardtobelieve fact is that the number of homeless vietnamera veterans is greater than the number of servicemembers who died during that war this is almost unbelievable and congress must renew efforts to fight this plague women veterans unfortunately are also joining the ranks of the homeless according to the national coalition for homeless veterans a survey of their members revealed that the percentage of women among homeless vets rose from 2 percent in 1966 to 7 percent at the end of 2005 women who have served in the military are up to four times more likely to become homeless when compared with their peers in the general population these statistics demonstrate the importance of passing s 1235 at the forum last week we heard from a woman veteran formerly homeless her story is one of a courageous person who fought for years to overcome the problems that kept her homeless at the mary e walker house on the grounds of the va coatesville medical center in pennsylvania she finally was able to get the assistance she needed to reestablish her life regain her children and begin again while testifying tears came to her eyes she said they were tears of joy at what the va program had helped her accomplish we heard also about the success of the stand downs which began in my home town of san diego in 1988 and provide a onestop 3day event to provide all the services needed by homeless vets that is counseling clothing food medical and dental assistance with job applications we know how to help our vets we have to bring together all these services in one place and rather than have 3day stand downs around the country we ought to have these services available to our veterans everyday in addition the homeless court program which began a few years ago brings the court to homeless shelters to assist homeless defendants in resolving outstanding cases that prevent them from getting jobs and moving forward i would also like to call attention to another important successful program not in this bill before us today the va homeless grant and per diem program which directs funding to providers of housing and traditional services for homeless vets i believe this program should be given an authorized annual spending level of 130 million for the next 5 years this would mean that the funding level would increase each year to reach by increments the 130 million level our colleagues on the appropriations committee have authorized this program through september of 2007 i suggest our committee take steps to continue the authorization of this program through 2012 we have heard of other important components of this bill improvements in employment life and health insurance adapted housing and

civil rights legislation ever the act codifies and effectuates the 15th amendments permanent guarantee that throughout the nation no person shall be denied the right to vote on account of race or color in addition the act contains several special provisions that impose even more stringent requirements in certain jurisdictions throughout the country including the requirement to provide bilingual assistance to language minority voters this act marked the first successful federal oversight of changes to election procedures in jurisdictions that had a poor record of respecting minority voting rights in the past these special provisions are set to expire in 2007 therefore the voting rights act must pass in its entirety without amendment at this time when our country has staked much

one is an accountant as a contingent unfunded liability or a hypothetical unfunded liability but it will not be that way in the end because there are two choices that we face here today an easy choice
