wisdom in these remarkable times voted down the latta substitute for the first concurrent budget resolution a majority of our colleagues simply decided they could not swallow a dose that was too drastic punitive in prescription and unhealthy in its consequences undaunted by rejection the pharmacists who mixed that original mess went back to their mortars and pestles and retorts and have come up with another batch of their medicine the brewers of latta iii have succeeded beyond their own wildest dreams of stirring up a dose that is even worse than the original this house ought to rise up in righteous indignation and throw the whole pot out of the window and keep throwing it out until we have before us a budget resolution that is fair and equitable to all of the people i say it is a disgusting proceeding because we are deluding the american people and ourselves into thinking that the numbers that we come up with in whatever budget resolution is passed by the congress means something how meaningful are the numbers adopted by the congress in the final budget resolution last session for fiscal year 1982 while much of the debate has centered around fiscal year 1983 outlays appropriations and revenuesyes the size of the deficitwe have obscured the fact that title i of this budget resolution we are debating today is to revise those sacred numbers in the budget resolution passed last year in terms of what has actually happened to them in the last budget resolution passed by the congress for fiscal year 1982 we said that revenues were going to be 657 8 billion in reality they are going to be 30 billion less and under either version jones or latta these revenues are 627 to 628 billion dollars we said that the deficit was only going to be 37 65 billion in reality that deficit is in excess of 100 billion under either the jones or latta provision of the 1982 budget resolution we delude ourselves if we think that the budget resolution which we adopt or fail to adopt today or at some point during the session will have any effect or bear any resemblance on what will ultimately be revenues outlays or level of deficit an example of the wonderland nature of the numbers which we are playing with is revealed in considering the impact of say unemployment and interest rates on the deficit in standard budget parlance a 1percent increase in unemployment results in an additonal 25 billion in the deficit at the current level of interest rates the interest on the national debt is about 112 billion with 3month treasury bills estimated to average for the year about 14 percent in 1977 when 3month treasury bills were annually averaging 5 3 percent the interest on the national debt was only 23 billion if the congress is indeed serious about elimininating the deficit and balancing the budget it may give some thought to reinstituting the concept of usury and establishing a sound jobs training program to get people back to work our obsessions and concerns during the course of these proceedings have been with the size of the deficit why should this be the reagan administration apparently is not concerned the budget resolution that was submitted to the congress proposed a 132 billion deficit in fact i think it ought to be clear at this point that the administration is not concerned with the deficit in the short run its strategy has been through the enormous tax cuts and increases in military spending rammed through the congress last session to present to the congress a budget dilemma a budget dilemma in which the administration hopes that faced with the alternative of increasing taxes and reducing milltary spending or again drastically reducing spending for health nutrition job training education natural resource development and farm programs the congress will choose the latter i for one dont buy this but this is what the latta substitute would do let me illustrate the 1982 appropriation level for nondefense discretionary programs is 133 45 billion for 1983 latta would cut 28 billion from this level a 21percent reduction in domestic spending jones on the other hand would increase the 1983 level by only 7 65 billion considering inflation this is scarcely anything more than maintaining existing programs at their presently reduced level from domestic programs the latta substitute would cut more than 100 billion below what would be spent under current law after allowing for inflation those programs include those which are the mainstays of support for the poor the elderly the disabled the children and the jobless the mischief it does is so pervasive that days would be required to sort it out item by item and so today i want to limit myself largely to the mischief the latta proposal does to education in this country make no mistake this proposal is antleducation its passage could cause serious harm to the training of our countrys youth and adults and i believe it is provable that such harm would be permanent and thus cripple a large part of the younger generation in my judgment no friend of education can cast a vote forthe latta subsitute just 2 weeks ago this house voted 323 to 99 for the simon amendment which brought federal education programs up to an appropriations level needed to maintain current services that action would not have permitted growth but at least it would have kept education programs even that vote i believe reflects the judgment of this house that education is important in america and that the programs we have hammered out over the years are constructive and worthwhile but do you think the mixers and the stirrers and the sweeteners who wrote the formula for the latta substitute paid any attention to that they did not they simply cut out another 1 75 billionto reduce by that amount the funding education programs need simply to stand still backward into the hole that is the whole philosophy of the latta substitute as it applies to education this version preserves the severe cuts the house voted down 2 weeks ago and then it goes on to slash deeply into the guaranteed student loan program and the school breakfast program in the guaranteed student loan program the latta substitute cuts 500 million in outlays for fiscal year 1984 and more the 700 million in outlays in fiscal year 1985 these cuts are on top of the 31 million in outlay cutbacks the original lalta substitute proposed and which the new version incorporates these cutbacks will severely cripple the guaranteed student loan program and visit enormous hardship on young people and adults who want to pursue their education in an increasingly technological society beyond these guaranteed student loan reductions the latta substitute mandates that all other student aid programs be frozen at the fiscal year 1982 level for the next 3 years the poll grant program is already at an inadequate level and to freeze it there for 3 years compounds the injustice to poor students current legislation calls for a maximum pell grant of 1 800 but the latta substitute would cap it at 1 674 ninety percent of all the children in the school breakfast program are poor as a direct result of the gramlatta resolution last year 365 000 children have dropped out of the program two weeks ago the latta substitute sought further cuts the version before the house today goes beyond that and requires a block grant for the school breakfast and child care nrograms and a cutback in their funding of 25 percent passage of this version of the latta substitute would simply mean program elimination for many of the 3 000 000 poor children still receiving school breakfasts that in my judgment is unthinkable and i hope the members will bear that in mind when they vote on this measure it has been said over and over again that it is patently unfair to try to balance the federal budget on the backs of the poor if the domestic programs for the poor and the elderly and the jobless really made the difference between a budget in balance and one out of balance i think you would be surprised how many of them would say all right go ahead and well make the sacrifice but this latta substitute does not provide a balanced budget this year or next year or 5 years on down the road this budget proposal is still 100 billion out of balance sacrificing the poor barely helps at all

the prosident the next day and had it delivered to the white house and in the letter i said to the president if the gentleman has been quoted correctly and if he believes what he says fire him because in my judgment there is a direct relationship between deficits and inflation indeed i want to quote a short statement by beryl sprinkel under secretary of the treasury for monetary affairs who said as follows a policy of monetizing the debt designed to alleviate upward pressures or rises in interest rates ignores the fact that increased money growth must accompany federal reserve purchases of government debt such money growth generates inflation and inflationary expectations the reagan administration recognizes the connection among monetization of the deficit money growth and inflation i think in 1979 the nation had a very marked change in policy when the federal reserve board changed its method of dealing with the management of the nations money supply from one of attempting to adjust interest rates to one of controlling money growth as a result of that change in policy we have seen a marked decline in inflation since 1979 the figures on 1981 are around an annualized rate of say 8 percent i believe the figure for 1982 will be close to 6 percent but what does that cost we are moving down on inflation but we have exacerbated our problem because we have continued federal spending at an everincreasing rate and as a result the federal demand for credit is today absolutely awesome the figures that i have seen here indicate that in 1981 the federal demand of credit direct indirect and guaranteed loans totaled 78 8 percent of available credit in our money system of the nation that is an increase of 30 percentage points what is the answer i think that we in this congress could balance the budget of this country in 60 days by reducing spending not increasing taxes or as the gentleman in the well suggests he i think would prefer to increase some taxes perhaps my response would be to decrease spending but perhaps the combination of the two could achieve the result we all hope and work for namely balancing the budget by reducing the federal demand for credit as the gentleman from michigan pointed out a few minutes ago if we would do this we would see a marked decline in the interest rate the prime rate the banks set for all of us government and private sources combined of 4 to 6 points i think the gentleman said he did not say the period of time but what i have heard within 90 days we could experience a decline in the prime rate of up to 6 points if we would balance the budget what would that do that would make first trust deed money of 10 or 11 percent available people could buy cars at an interest rate of maybe 13 or 14 percent at their bank and that would revitalize those two industries and lay the foundation for economic recovery i just hope that this institution has the courage to make the necessary adjustments because as the gentleman

opposition to the procurement provisions of h r 3519 they have nothing to do with strengthening our national defense they have everything to do with allowing our bureaucracy to run free of congressional authority free of other oversight and free of efforts to make agencies operate more efficiently one of the most universally supported ideas for improvement in the dod acquisition process to emerge in recent months is the concept of multiyear contracting for weapon systems it is widely felt that multiyear contracting will provide the necessary incentive for the private sector to invest in new technologies facilities and equipment this it is felt will increase productivity provide stability and lead to efficiencies and savings to the gxovernment all of these claims may be true although i think as we discuss them we should put them in proper perspective i want to say at the outset that i am not opposed to multiyear contracting i served on the procurement commiission which incidentally was an outgrowth of the cost overruns in the c5a program we felt that there was a need to get a handle on the cost overruns of these major weapon systems and the way we decided to do it was to establish a procurement commission to study all phases of procurement as a result of that procurement study one of the recommendations was for multiyear contracting with certain safeguards that is why i think it is important that we keep this multiyear funding in proper perspective the issue of how to plan for and realize the massive savings which appear possible for multiyear contracting for weapon systems is a problem of considerable magnitude it necessitates program firmness mission stability definitiveness of quantitative needs for both the government and prospective contractors must be able to make comprehensive analysis of the most eff icient investments in plant and tooling to accomplish the longterm production programs vvhich may run 5 or more years multiyear contracting also requires iongrange work force planning and identification of the most economic methods of acquiring longleadtime components and materials the general accounting office has made it very clear that if such contracting is not conducted properly it could actually cost the government more money and produce no savings at ali the gao has expressed concern that we should proceed with great care lest multiyear contracting reduce our flexibility in adjusting weapon systems to meet changing threats and saddle the government with unnecessary costly program cancellation charges i want to stress this point because contrary to an impression that defense department officials have given the committee on armed services the gao does not support the armed services position on multiyear contracting as included in this bill my principle quarrel with the armed services provision however is not that its sponsors failed to inform us of the problems as well as the advantage of their proposal it is that the proposal gives the defense department a blank check to enter into untold numbers of very very large contracts for weapon systems without prior congressional approval i find it amazing that such a proposal should be before us now for more years than any of us can remember probably since the founding of the republic major military projects have required congressional authorization before they

cut program l this tax cut programs life depends upon this budget resolution we are going to adopt basically if we look at what we are hearing in the committee on ways and means i agree wholeheartily with the president of thie united states that we must have a responsible and substantive tax cut program to help solve our economic problems one of the real problems we are having today is that of productivity last year the productivity of the united states was almost dead last when compared to other major industrial nations and for the first time in recent history productivity in this country did not go up it actually declined in 1980 when you have declining productivity your efficiency is going down the ability to produce goods and services is going down in terms of competition with foreign count~ries and in terms of any kind of real growth in this country which means inflation as it costs more to produce something that is inflation as you produce less of something in comparison to foreign competition that is inflation an ople work less hard because there is no incentive because you are not taking home any more money because of high tax rates that is inflation so basically what we believe land strongly believe is that the only real way we can address this problem of productivity is to cut taxes in a meaningful way to cut taxes to make it possible to improve productivity now we do that in this fashion the reason we have to cut these taxes is to mak~e capital available i think everybody understands that the way you retool or modernize a factory the way you have a plant expand and the way to create jobs and the way you are able to keep up with japanese competition in steel and automobiles is to spend money or capital on these factories and these plants where does this capital come from you cannot expect businesses and individuals today to borrow money not at 15 percent and the prime rate continuing to climb as a matter of fact the amount of money american business is borrowing is unhealthy they ought to be generating that capital in aftertax income we oughtto be encouraging individuals to invest money and this is not true under the current tax situation we have in this country so basically if we cut tax rates we generate capital rm aing with the individual who can tnivest money received in a tax cut and put it back i the depository institutions in this country where we need it to lower interest rates we let business have additional profits after their taxes as they will be able to plow capital back into their businesses to retool and modernize there is a new wrinkle we ought to think about too as we reduce the individual tax burden we are letting the taxpayer see he has more after tax income than before and just maybe he will work a little bit harder how many people do we know now who take off a full days work because they are paying too much in taxes in my part of the country a lot of folks will take off for deer hunting season and not work for a month or two because it costs too much to werk they can make almost as much on food stamps and unemployment compensation as they can working and paying taxes as long as we h ave that kind of situation existing in this country we are going to have iflation and low productivity we have to make it possible for people to make more money and keep more of what they earn the same thing is true of the business community to be able to invest that capital to be able to retool modernize our industrial base to keep up with the japanese and germans and to also be able to have people see it pays more to work than it does to play so we have to have capital to solve our problems of productivity and productivity is one of the biggest solutions to our problem of inflation in the year 1980 according to an artide i read the other day in my home town newspaper taxes on a family making about 30 000 a year a family of four went up 25 percent by virtue of their federal tax burdensin 1 year 25 percent in 1965 only 7 percent of all of our taxpayers paid the marginal tax rate of more than 25 percent by 1977 that figure had grown from 7 percent to 30 percent of the american people who were paying more than this because of bracket creep and because of tax increase~s these dual perils are continuing to push more and miore of our taxpayers into higher tax brackets with no more real income to spend by virtue of inflation and these tax increases individuals need a tax break in this country they need it to be able to work harder they need it to be able to make ends meet and they need it out of a spirit of fairness but what i am contending goes beyond that we must have these tax cuts to actually make it possible for our economy to grow and to expand and to hire more people and take care of the people in this country who are less fortunate and have no opportuni ties as the gentleman spoke so eloquently about a mioment ago now if we look at what we have to vote on next tuesday and wednesd~ay in light of the need for tax cuts this might color our final decision first of all we have the substitute by the gentleman from the district of columbia"],

a vigorous new approach to the solutions of the problems confronting this nation and the world by their votes the people of this nation indicated they wanted a change in direction and this president offered a change he promised to try and reduce federal spending he promised to try to cut the destructive high inflation rate he promised to reduce the unwarranted and unnecessary federal interference in our daily lives with the help in some cases reluctant help of the 535 members of congress this president has made a new beginning he was not able to reduce federal spending but he did cut my more than half the request for increased federal spending he was not able to eliminate all the unnecessary redtape but he was able to reduce the number of pages of regulations printed in the federal register from 73 000 to 51 000 he was not able to end inflation but he did cut the rate which had been in double digit figures for most of the previous administration down to an annualized rate in the month of march of less than 4 percent for the past 5 or 6 months we have been provided with a consistent diet of bad news the morning newspaper headlines and the evening television news emphasize what they perceive to be wrong with the presidents program and ignore what many common folk perceive to be right with the presidents program nowhere has this consistent criticism of the reagan administration been more pernicious than it has been in the reports of central and latin america and particularly the reports from el salvador now i call your attention to some good news and to underscore the importance of this good news permit me to review in some detail what has been going on in el salvador mr speaker in land area this nation is about the size of your own state of massachusetts it is bordered by guatemala on the north honduras on the east and nicaragua on the southeast with about 135 miles of frontage on the pacific ocean about 5 million people live in el salvador el salvador became independent of spain in 1821 and of the central american federation in 1841 about 10 percent of the population is indian about 89 percent is of mixed spanish and indian blood and about 1 percent caucasian since achieving independence the salvadorans have in company with all of their neighbors struggled with a succession of authoritarian rulers and again like most of its neighbors there is both great wedlth and great poverty the political rulersclasping hands with the military or sometimes vise versahave attempted to maintain the status quo by preserving the privileges of the wealthy and preventing any upward mobility on the part of the poor but the thirst for freedom was not to be denied and in january 1931 in what most observers believe was a free election arturo araujo was elected president araujo had campaigned on a platform of better education better transportation and jobs for ordinary salvadorans and industrialization for the nation as a whole the new president had been educated at oxford he had seen the way in which class fluidity and mass prosperity had appeared in england after the industrial revolution he wanted to bring the benefits of an industrialized economy to his people the privileged class accustomed to using military power to protect their material possessions staged a coup led by the vice president gen maximiliano hernandez martinez the followers of hernandez sincerely believed the only way they could retain their riches was by keeping the majority of the people poor this quite naturally led to a belief on the part of the poor that the only way they could gain a better economic condition was to take the wealth from the rich neither side understood at all what arturo araujo had attempted to ac complish and quite naturally as they have in every other disturbed corner of the world the communists became active in el salvador their present leader is a man named shafik handal of palestinian ancestry in 1972 jose napoleon duarte was elected president defeating the candidate of the pcn partido de concilaclon nacional the political arm of el salvadors military this party had been ruling el salvador for about 40 years and they were not about to let a mere election change the course of events duarte was beaten and forced to flee the country in 1979 a group of young army officers ended the 45year rule of the pcn group deposed the present carlos humberto romero and duarteback from exilewas made president the government under duartes direction began to move toward land reform toward better economic and educational opportunities and toward a full democracy but of course their progress was not fast enough to please the marxists they wanted to rebuild salvadoran society on soviet and cuban models this then is the background of the struggle in el salvador john kurtwill a contributing editor of the national catholic register and editor of policy digest accuses the american press of romanticizing the guerilla forces and refusing to grant any credibility to the reforms attempted by president duarte it is estimated there are only about 5 000 leftist guerillas operating in el salvador guerillas who are receiving their arms from russia through cuba and nicaragua on the extreme right there are about 5 000 followers of the old regime this far right group would wipe out the land educational and economic programs of the duarte regime and return to the rigid military control of the past the far left wants to expropriate all the land nationalize all businesses and create a soviet state to accomplish this end they have waged relentless guerrilla warfare on the innocent people of el salvador one writer reviewing the salvadoran situation said the goal of terrorism all along has been to make the people cry out basta yaenough bring us peace no matter what you have to do would the establishment of a soviet model government in el salvador bring peace and dignity and opportunity to the salvadoran people what they aroidemanding is expropriation without right to indemnification of all properties in the hands of the oligarchy subsequent redistribution as collective communal or state properties management of the national economy on the basis of a system of national planning does this modus operandi of the soviet communists sound familiar we should keep in mind that such demands voiced by guerrillas in other lands have never brought peace justice or opportunity and if this is questioned we should solicit an answer from the poles from the afghans from the cubans and most recently from the nicaraguans now let us relate the good news the guerrillas called for and attempted to produce a nationwide strike this was to demonstrate to the leaders of el salvador that the guerrillas enjoyed the popular support of the people but the people refused to strikeeven though the guerrillas committed hideous acts such as murdering a businessman by mutilation who counseled his employees against striking the guerrillas are attempting to destroy what little economic strength remains in el salvador they wantonly destroy buses they blow up powerplants they dynamite roads is this to show their concern for the plight of the average salvadoran no it is not it is to intimidate the people but the good news is the people refused to be intimidated they did go to the polls they did vote they said we want a chance to determine our own destiny in a peaceful manner the elections in el salvador completely vindicated the policy of this administration we do not say the government in el salvador is perfect or not without fault but we do say and they helped to prove that the people of el salvador prefer ballots to bullets now let me direct your attention to those cassandras who have been pretending to see in el salvador a second vietnamridiculous consider the logistical differences vietnam was half the world away transport can reach el salvador by air in a few hours in vietnam the regulars of the north were a powerful disciplined military force easily supplied by the soviets through china the guerrillas in el salvador are small in number poorly trained and their supply routes could be easily interdicted i bring this up not to suggest that the united states should send troops to el salvador but to emphasize how ridiculous the claim that if we support the legitimate government in el salvadorthe only legitimate governmentit will lend to a prolonged 10year military involvement recently a resolution was offered it was suggested that the house of representatives urge the established government in el salvador to invite the guerrillas to join the government and to commerce negotiations for a political settlement this is essentially the same proposition being urged by mexico and france i voted against that proposal for the legitimate government of el salvadorparticularly now that it has been chosen in an open free electionto invite the leaders of the left to participate would be to legitimize the terrorists activity let those guerrillas who truly long for a betterment of conditions in el salvadoras individualsput down their arms and their bombs and go to work to improve the economy and to make democracy a reality i promised good news and there is good news in the american economy the reduction of the inflation rate is a remarkable accomplishment the presidents new and different attitude toward the role of the federal government in our everyday lives is a remarkable change we spent billions to create the great society and are we better off for all that public money spent the crime rate in evcry category is up we spent billions of public money in the war on poverty there is still great misery and poverty in this
