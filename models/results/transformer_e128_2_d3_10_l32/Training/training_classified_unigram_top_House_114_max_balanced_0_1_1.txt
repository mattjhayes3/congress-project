our colleagues and we support each other in times of need i just would like to also congratulate and acknowledge congressman hakeem jeffries the gentleman from new york who is also host of this special order i appreciate the opportunity to discuss an issue that is very personal to me before i begin i just want to say that my heart goes out to the families and friends of the victims of the horrible tragedy in orlando and i can only imagine what they are going through the other thing that is illuminating to me is that as we came here and stood up for a moment of silence after that moment of silence i believe members were given a 1minute opportunity to speak on any topic that they would like to on the floor as is customary and not one person from the other side of the aisle mentioned what happened in orlando so not only was it a moment of silence for the leadership in this house but it appears that it is going to be a moment that remains silent or a topic that remains silent from the other side of the aisle eliminating racialbased health disparities depends on our ability to advance access to affordable health care for all even in the 21st century health disparities are stark especially in the african american communities where life expectancies are lower and infant mortality rates are higher than among whites today despite improvement in overall health in the united states african americans and other minority populations lag behind in numerous health areas including access to quality care timelines of care and health outcomes for years the congressional black caucus has called on republicans to join us and other house democrats in developing a plan to eliminate racial health disparities a plan that addresses the causes of health disparities such as inequities in environmental social and economic conditions in our communities instead we get from them proposals like their socalled a better way poverty proposal a stale repackaging of failed policies presented under the guise of concern about americans trapped in poverty cutting job training programs food assistance and head start will push lowincome americans further into poverty making it even more difficult for them to access the affordable and quality health care needed to secure their wellbeing and the wellbeing of their families we need to instead use the government as a source of good every american deserves to live in a safe and healthy environment yet lowincome and minority communities are much more exposed to high levels of pollution resulting in serious health problems such as asthma heart problems and cancer this is a very real problem across america a very real problem in my district thirteen million people including 3 5 million children are concentrated in the vicinity of transportation facilities and are exposed to unhealthy levels of air pollution my district is home to the port newarkelizabeth marine terminal part of the port of new york and new jersey the third largest port in the country according to the epa 25 percent of children in newark suffer from asthmathree times the state average what we need are additional federal actions to reduce harmful air pollution from ports and congested components of the national freight transportation system the issue is critical to the lowincome and minority community who suffer the disproportionately adverse health effects of these environmental hazards now since i am on the topic of environmental justice i just want to remind everyone that the republicans continue to block any action to help the thousands of children facing lifelong damage from drinking poisoned water in flint including a vote to block the families of flint act emergency supplemental their radical refusal to address this health issue will have tragic consequences for american families and i think it is representative of their overall inadequate approach to health disparities in minority communities the way to eliminate racial health disparities is neither to downplay them nor to cut programs that will assist the most vulnerable it is to address the environmental social and economic conditions that exacerbate those disparities it is to expand access to quality health care that could eliminate or reduce the onset of many of these chronic illnesses and disproportionate health outcomes it is to maintain and strengthen our investments in healthcare access and resources for disadvantaged populations in closing i also want to stress that health education must also be a focus in any efforts to eliminate racialbased health disparities african americans and other communities are disproportionately affected by poor providerpatient communication and health literacy issues consequently they often do not have access to information that enables them to make the appropriate health decisions we have a responsibility to work with our healthcare institutions and community health centers to make it easier for people to find understand and use the information and services as cochair of the congressional mens health caucus i have hosted and participated in a number of outreach events in my district to engage directly with constituents about the importance of making positive health decisions and staying proactive about their health and wellbeing so i encourage everyone watching at home to get the information you need to make smart health decisions to get the security you and your family deserve and to get the health care that we all need"], [0.0015779733657836914,

caucus assessment during national minority health month it is no surprise that we are here today because certainly we have had many firsthand experiences to know the disparities that exist across all americans but more specifically across african american communities to you mr payne thank you for having the foresight to come tonight and to you congresswoman kelly thank you for taking a leadership position in helping us share with the nation the value and the importance of protecting all lives but giving information to the nation about the state of black health it is imperative that we continue to address health disparities that affect racial minorities and work together on the efforts to advance health equity since july 1971 the congressional black caucus has sponsored national conferences and held brain trusts on black health it is so timely that we have this discussion as we observe national minority health month tonight is a call to action a charge for all of us to unite towards a common goal of improving the health of our communities everyone in america should be able to live a healthy life regardless of the color of their skin the good news is the overall health of an american has improved over the past few decades this is in part due to the increased focus on preventive medicine and dynamic new advances in medical technology however not all americans have benefited equally from healthcare improvements since the enactment of the affordable care act millions of americans now have access to quality affordable coverage according to the american medical association recent studies have shown that despite the steady improvement in overall health of the united states racial and ethnic minorities experience a lower quality of health services and are less likely to receive routine medical procedures and have higher rates of morbidity and mortality than nonminorities disparities in health care exist even when controlling for gender condition age and socioeconomic status for example cardiovascular diseases account for the largest proportion of inequality in life expectancy between african americans and nonhispanic whites according to the american cancer society african american women have a 44 percent higher death rate from breast cancer despite having a mammography screening rate that is nearly the same rate for white women according to the centers for disease control the cdc the infant death rate among african americans is still more than double that of whites tonight you are going to hear my colleagues and i discuss much data and statistics because i am from the great state of ohio and ohio ranks 47th in the nation in infant mortality with black infants dying at twice the rate of white infants according to a 2015 study conducted by the kaiser family foundation in ohio on average 14 5 black infants die per every 1 000 live births while 6 3 white infants die ohio community leaders and the greater columbus infant mortality task force are working hard to lower franklin countys infant mortality rate and the infant mortality rate in all of ohio tonight i salute them for their research for their education and for their consistency to save lives the statistics are staggering and we can and must do more to lower and eliminate them the societal burden of healthcare disparities in america manifest in multiple and major ways for example a 2014 study by the joint center for political and economic studies concluded that the combined costs of health inequalities and premature death in the united states were 1 24 trillion that 1 24 trillion is the cost between 2003 and 2006 that is why on march 23 2010 when president barack obama signed the affordable care act it was a monumental step that has helped us address the overwhelming statistics and health disparities within our community i proudly supported the affordable care act because lives matter all lives matter black lives matter now we have comprehensive healthcare reform that improves access to affordable health coverage and guarantees that the most vulnerable in our communities have access to care by improving access to quality health care for all americans the affordable care act helps reduce health disparities how does the affordable care act do this this law invests in prevention and wellness gives individuals more control over their care and expands initiatives to increase racial and ethnic diversity in healthcare professions by strengthening cultural competency training for all healthcare providers and improving communications between providers and patients the affordable care act represents the most significant federal effort to reduce disparities in this countrys history congressman payne and congresswoman kelly again i salute you i am going to repeat that because it is so important for us to let the nation know that the affordable care act represents the most significant federal effort to reduce disparities in this countrys history the affordable care act also increases funding for community health centers which serve an estimated one in three lowincome people and one in four lowincome minority residents there are over 43 community health centers in ohio including many in my district columbus neighborhood health centers heart of ohio family health centers and lower lights christian health centers these community health centers provide outstanding primary care dental behavioral health and pharmacy services in our most underserved areas in 2013 community health centers provided care to over 550 000 ohioans and recorded over 2 million patient visits we have come a long way but there is still much more for us to do all people should have the opportunity to reach their fullest potential for health we must continue to move forward to combat health disparities build healthier communities and create a stronger country in order to have a successful nation i believe we must have a healthy nation let me leave you with something a national figure once said if you neglect to recharge a battery it dies if you run full speed ahead without stopping for water you lose momentum to

gentleman from the eighth congressional district of new york i say to the gentleman that i look forward to tonights special order hour congressman jeffries and i along with our colleagues from the congressional black caucus will have scholarly debate on how our democracy is in crises because of the assault on the right to vote in america as we just heard from mr jeffries and we will hear from others voting is the voice of the people the voting rights act of 1965 passed with bipartisan support established strong federal protections for the freedom to vote banning or limiting many of the discriminatory election policies and practices of the jim crow south combined with subsequent legislation such as the national voter registration act which requires state agencies to provide opportunities for voter registration the voting rights act has helped our nation make significant progress in boosting voting for african americans and other historically marginalized groups but we find ourselves today facing our first presidential election in 50 years without the full protection of the voting rights act as mr jeffries referenced in shelby the supreme court decision reversed over 50 years of progress made to expand access to the voting booth and opened a pathway to new voting laws that discriminate against african american voters as a result of shelby new voting restrictions have been put in place in 22 states 18 of them republicanled since 2010 making it harder for millions of americans to exercise their right to vote the way states have been able to reduce the voting power of minority communities and put in place new voting restrictions in an effort to make it harder for millions of americans to vote is appalling our democracy is in crisis our right to vote is under assault why would we want to make it harder for americans to vote i believe we should be making it easier for americans to have access to the ballot box but apparently some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle do not agree we need to put forth a vote on the voting rights act now new laws range from strict photo id requirements to early voting cutbacks to registration restriction among these 16 states with new voting restrictions is my home state of ohio in ohio in 2014 lawmakers cut 6 days of early voting and eliminated the golden week during which voters could register and cast a ballot all in one trip of course ohio is not alone in its efforts to make it harder for americans to vote the freedom to vote is one of americas most constitutionally guaranteed rights and it should be easily accessible to those who want to exercise it that is why i am honored this congress to serve as the deputy vice chair of the newly created congressional voting rights caucus a caucus dedicated to protecting our democracy by ensuring the fundamental right to vote is safeguarded for all americans however after a longstanding tradition of bipartisanship on voting protections house republicans now refuse to bring either bill to the floor for a vote this is unthinkable the voting rights act of 1965 has been reauthorized with bipartisan support five times congress has a duty to ensure elections are free and transparent so that all eligible voters feel comfortable and welcome i would echo president obamas february 13 2013 statement on the voting rights act and let me quote we must all do our part to make sure our godgiven rights are protected that includes one of the most fundamental right of a democracy the right to vote when any american no matter where they live or what their party are denied that right we are betraying our ideals there are 168 days until the presidential election and our democracy still has far too many missing voices particularly among those who are already at a disadvantage due to deeply rooted racial and class barriers in our society we must ensure that voter suppression is not the new normal in order to have a truly vibrant democracy the united states must take steps to ensure inclusive voting by reducing barriers to voting efforts to suppress voting turnout undermine democracy and those efforts are on the wrong side of history as i close the time is now i am calling on all people including our community and national leaders to join me in working to eliminate voter suppression and to restore what so many people fought for marched for died for that is the voting rights act human rights organizations like the naacp and the leadership conference on civil and human rights have been at the forefront

the national network to end domestic violence twenty years ago we worked with a bipartisan congress to pass the domestic violence offender gun ban it became law in 1996 it was known as the lautenberg amendment after the late senator frank lautenberg of new jersey since that time we have made a lot of progress in preventing domestic violence but sadly there are several mack trucksize loopholes that prevent the law from coming to its full effect in fact just last week in a fight against the gun lobby yet again over these last 20 years the supreme court upheld the domestic violence offender gun ban in a 62 decision as many know leaving an abusive relationship is the most dangerous time for a domestic violence victim and adding a firearm to that situation severely heightens the risk of injury or death in fact in america the majority of fatal domestic violence homicides are committed with firearms at least 52 percent of american women murdered with guns are killed by intimate partners or family members despite impressions from media coverage mass shootings in which at least four people are murdered with a gun are also typically acts of domestic or family violence an everytown usa analysis of every mass shooting between 2009 and 2015 found that 57 percent were committed by intimate partners or the family of victims research shows that commonsense gun laws have a marked effect on improving womens safety from gun violence in states that require background checks for all handgun sales 46 percent fewer women are murdered with a gun by an intimate partner and state laws ensuring that convicted abusers or those subject to domestic violence restraining orders are separated from their firearms are also associated with reductions in gun violence against women but because of loopholes in these laws and failures to enforce them they do little to curb the uniquely lethal american problem of guns and violence against women four gaps in the law are particularly harmful first federal law does nothing to keep guns out of the hands of abusive dating partners or convicted stalkers the federal law prohibits domestic abusers from buying or owning guns but doesnt apply to dangerous people convicted of misdemeanor stalking offenses or to dating partners even though more women in the unitedstates are killed by their dating partners than their spouses second in 35 states state law does not prohibit all people convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes and all people subject to restraining orders from buying or using guns third and importantly federal law allows domestic abusers and stalkers to easily evade gun prohibitions by purchasing guns from unlicensed private sellers that is the mack truck loophole federal law only requires background checks for gun sales at licensed dealers sixteen states require checks on all handgun sales but in the remaining states prohibited abusers seeking to avoid a background check have very little trouble purchasing a gun from an unlicensed dealer they meet online at a gun show or in a parking lot prohibited domestic abusers know about this loophole and they have taken advantage of it to deadly effect and in fact in a firstofitskind investigation of illegal gun sales mayors against illegal guns found that one in four prohibited purchasers seeking guns online had a domestic violence arrest finally 41 states do not require prohibited abusers to relinquish the guns they already own so i have joined in legislation to prohibit these guns from falling into the hands of domestic abusers we know that a proven way to help with people who are not eligible to purchase guns such as felons and domestic abusers is to expand and strengthen universal background checks on all firearms sales no matter where that sale takes place and very tragically our lax gun laws make it easier for abusers to acquire a firearm than it is in fact to purchase a box of sudafed so you ask why do we protest why did we take the dramatic action of taking to the floor of this house it is because we have had enough and we know that working together we can and must change the fact that women across this country lose their lives to gun violence by their domestic abusers nine american women are shot and killed by their husbands and intimate partners every single week we can do something about it lets close the gun show

they are bringing up a bill that was not only drafted by the gun lobby but that makes it nearly impossible to block gun sales to suspected terrorists that is shameful the american people deserve a congress that is willing to stand up to the gun lobby and do what it takes to help keep our communities safe congress has a responsibility to listen to the people who we are supposed to represent to put partisan politics aside and to bring up commonsense bipartisan legislation to keep guns away from those who shouldnt have them suspected terrorists criminals domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill and the american people want those bills brought up now more than 30 people are killed every day by someone using a gun we cant afford to allow more innocent lives to be lost to gun violence just a few weeks ago 49 innocent people were shot to death in the worst mass shooting our country has ever seen sadly this isnt an insulated case it has now been 31 2 years since the tragedy at sandy hook took the lives of 20 elementary school kids and six educators but for reasons that i will never understand that horrific tragedy wasnt enough to convince the republican leadership that somethingsomethingneeds to be done to prevent the next tragedy let me give you some numbers three and a half that is how many years it has been since sandy hook 34 000 that is the number of people who have been killed by someone using a gun since sandy hook 1 182 that is the number of mass shootings that have taken place since sandy hook 520 that is the number of days the house has been in session 30 the moments of silence that we have observed on this house floor because of gun violence most important zero zero that is the number of votes that this house has taken to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people what is the majority so afraid of is their fear greater than the fear of those young kids at sandy hook or those parishioners in charleston or those young people at the nightclub in orlando it is long past time for the house to give us a vote on meaningful legislation to make sure that terrorists criminals domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill dont have easy access to guns in our country there is bipartisan legislation that would prohibit those on the fbis terrorist watch list from being able to purchase firearms and i have authored legislation which has bipartisan support to require background checks for all commercial gun sales background checks are our first line of defense when it comes to stopping dangerous people from getting firearms they work every day more than 170 felons some 50 domestic abusers and nearly 20 fugitives are stopped from buying a gun because of background checks but in 34 states criminals domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill can bypass the background check by purchasing guns online at a gun show or through an ad in the paper this is a dangerous loophole that needs to be closed and it needs to be closed now the bill has 186 bipartisan coauthors bring our bill up for a vote there is absolutely no reason why anyone should oppose this background check bill not only is it bipartisan it respects the second amendment rights of lawabiding citizens i am a gun guy i own guns i support the second amendment if this bill did anything to violate those rights my name wouldnt be on it all this background check bill does is require that folks pass a background check before purchasing guns online at a gun show or through an ad plain and simple it does nothing to infringe on the second amendment right of lawabiding citizens to own firearms this debate on background checks isnt a choice between either protecting the second amendment or reducing gun violence it is about the willingness of a responsible majority to do both if there is one thing we should all be able to agree on it is that suspected terrorists criminals domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill shouldnt have guns give us a vote bring up h r 1076 bipartisan effective no fly no buy legislation and bring up h r 1217 bipartisan background check legislation mass shootings followed by moments of

state correct i thank the gentleman from new york and the gentlewoman from ohio for yielding and organizing tonights special order last week the house of representatives failed to pass a budget by the statutorily mandated date of april 15 this failure is unfortunate for our budget process but perhaps not unfortunate for the american people because no budget is better than the proposed republican budget that would have been brought to the floor our nations budget reflects priorities but the republican budget only highlights the wrong priorities the budget the house republicans wanted to bring to the floor would be even more devastating to students working families and seniors than their previous proposals the republican budget would end the medicare guarantee for seniors by converting medicare into a voucher payment that would not keep pace with medical inflation shifting billions of dollars in medical costs onto our senior citizens the republican budget would repeal the affordable care act and would jeopardize the health insurance for millions of americans even though the budget assumes all of the revenue collected by the affordable care act to pay for the affordable care act all of those taxes remain in the budget the republican budget includes a total of 6 5 trillion in spending cuts largely unspecified if this level of cuts were ever made it would devastate our investments and jobs education research and would essentially eliminate any new transportation projects on top of these devastating cuts to vital programs that support and uplift hardworking american families the republican budget calls for trillions of dollars in tax cuts that would primarily benefit millionaires and billionaires and then they claim the tax cuts would be revenue neutral suggesting that we are to believe that trillions of dollars in new taxes would be imposed to pay for those tax cuts for the wealthy but despite this the republican budget is not a credible plan are we really going to dismantle medicare are we really going to cut hundreds of billions of dollars out of education and job training and transportation are we really going to raise trillions of dollars in new taxes to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy i dont think so but the house leadership couldnt even secure enough votes for this budget proposal because a faction of their conference wanted even deeper unrealistic spending cuts budgeting is about making tough choices and the only choice the republicans seem to have made with the budget proposal is that we can only balance the budget on the backs of students workers seniors the disabled and vulnerable communities across the nation while cutting taxes for the wealthy the congressional black caucus knows that is not the right choice that is why as we have done for the last 30 years we have diligently prepared our own budget alternative to the republican budget which we would have offered as an amendment to the republican budget if they had brought up their proposal the cbc budget chooses to invest in programs that we know will grow our economy and ensure that every american family is able to prosper our budget proposes a comprehensive jobs program totaling 500 billion over 3 years that will accelerate our economic recovery and ensure that it reaches virtually every community in america while also investing in what will guarantee americas longterm economic competitiveness this jobs plan includes funding for direct jobs creation programs school modernization jobs for teachers and first responders immediate investments in our nations crumbling infrastructure assistance for neighborhoods and families still reeling from the housing crisis job training programs and summer jobs our budget calls for significant and sustained investmentsapproximately 300 billion over the next decadeabove the presidents request for programs that have been instrumental in lifting millions of americans out of poverty some of these proposals include restoration of cuts to the supplemental nutrition assistance program expanding access to affordable housing increasing access to quality and affordable education increasing funding for job training and trade adjustment assistance adjusting the earned income tax credit and child tax credit to inflation as well as decreasing the age where you can benefit for the earned income tax credit down to 21 years of age thanks to the leadership of congressman jim clyburn our budget also ensures that federal resources are targeted more efficiently toward eradicating poverty by targeting federal spending toward persistent areas of poverty through the 102030 formula our budget also includes more than 340 billion above the presidents request for education over the next decade this additional money will help make college more affordable by increasing the pell grant fully funding the presidents free community college program reducing interest rates on student loans and financing other proposals to ensure that no student graduates from college saddled with unmanageable debt the cbc budget also provides muchneeded funding for families of flint michigan to help address the shortterm and longterm cognitive and behavioral development of children exposed to high lead levels however the congressional black caucus appreciates unfortunately that flint is not the only community in america impacted by lead exposure this is why our budget includes funds to help not only flint but also other communities across the nation deal with the effects of lead exposure unlike the republican budget the cbc budget clearly shows how we pay for these additional investments our budget sets a new revenue target of 4 trillion over the next 10 years above the current revenue baseline to demonstrate how this is achievable and realistic our budget suggests several specific alternatives totaling 7 trillion that the house and senate committees can choose from to reach that target we ask for 4 trillion in new additional and specifically outline at least 7 trillion to choose from we do this by specifically talking about closing specific corporate loopholes treating capital gains and dividends as regular income a reasonable fee for financial transactions restoring the estate tax to levels paid over a few years ago specific items where you can choose from and in fact if we just cancel the bushera tax cuts we would have almost 4 trillion in new revenue right there at the end of the day our budget realistically reduces the deficit by approximately 3 2 trillion over the next decade compared to the congressional budget offices march 2016 baseline the cbc budget chooses investments in americas children and workers protects our most vulnerable communities and

more than 70 percent of those involved in schoolrelated arrests or referrals to law enforcement currently african americans make up twofifths and hispanics onefifth of confined youth today disparities

class life as african american students graduate with more debt than their white classmates the cuts to pell grants are threatening african american access to a better education without the pell grant

first line of defense against people who shouldnt be able to buy guns from buying guns who are these people criminals domestic abusers terrorists those who are dangerously mentally ill they should not be able to get their hands on a gun now can we stop it in every instance no but we know that background checks work we know that we can make a real difference every day every day in the united states of america 170 felons are stopped from buying guns because of the background check program every day in the united states of america 50 domestic abusers are stopped from buying a gun because of the background check system it works we know it works why wont we bring that bill up for a vote that woman stood on the steps of the capitol yesterday that was a courageous stand she took she lost her daughter she watched her daughter be murdered right in front of her eyes she herself was shot but she is out advocating for sensible prosecond amendment reasonable gun laws that will protect people that is brave what is brave about avoiding a vote on this bill a bipartisan bill a bill that supports the second amendment a bill that has both democrats and republicans as coauthors 186 coauthors a background check bill perfectly constitutional perfectly reasonable supported by gun owners both democrats and republicans supported by 90 percent of the american people ninety percent of the people that we collectively represent are asking us do something about this tragedy that is taking place over 30 times a day in the streets of america ninety percent that is unbelievable support and what has the republican leadership done nothing thirtyfour thousand deaths in the last 312 years that we have been trying to take up this bill 1 182 mass shootings since we have tried to take up this bill 30 moments of silence on the floor of this house zero zero votes to protect the people that we represent zero votes to do anything regarding responsible second amendment gun laws that will protect the people that we represent we are not asking for a lot we are asking for a vote we know that background checks work your side knows it and our side know it one of the previous speakers on the underlying bill today said it is time to put politics aside and look at the policy what in the world is going on with background checks the policy is solid they work one hundred and seventy felons a day are stopped from getting a gun because of background checks fifty domestic abusers a day are stopped from getting a gun because of background checks it sounds like pretty solid policy to me it must be the politics on the other side that are getting in the way and the american people do not want that to continue ninety percent of the people who we represent are with us they say that criminals terrorists domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill should not be able to get guns and that the men and women who they send to the congress of the united states of america should take responsible action to stop that from happening please give us a vote on the background check bill help keep our constituents safe"], [0.0016739964485168457, 0.9983260035514832, 1, "there is no doubt how much i appreciate the congressional black caucus and congresswoman beatty and congressman jeffries for always being timely in allowing us to give a message to our colleagues we hope maybe the american people will hear us but we accept that this body is the body to which and to whom we speak so i am thankful for that i want to pay tribute overall to the congressional black caucus because we are actually here speaking of health disparities because it was the caucus that triggered this debate through the years that we have been trying to get universal access to health care and was the moving force in the 2009 2008 and 2010 passage ultimately of the affordable care act where the work that we did joining congresswoman donna christianchristiansen at that time and frank pallone on the congressional health caucus but on the cbc we had the health disparities task to ensure that the language in the affordable care act addressed the issue of health disparities there was a large section on that that built on some of the work that some of us had already done creating the office of minority health that i had worked on in years past so it was the lightning bolt of the caucus and then working with the congressional asian pacific american caucus and then the congressional hispanic caucus that we raised the issue that no one was talking about i remember debating on the floor of the house on the issues of dealing with senior citizen african american men and how they access health care how do women access health care and how do women impacted by diabetes access health care these are some of the diseases that have a proclivity to the african american population we were finding out that we even had an issue where medical professionals didnt know how to ask the questions how do you address someone who needs to be diagnosed for prostate cancer or may be diagnosed for prostate cancer and is an african american male a senior citizen my father ultimately died from cancer that metastasized from the prostate to the lungs and the brain so we knew we had a serious issue so today i want to mention four points but i am going to focus on the last one obesitya question of access to health care and physical fitness many times we live in areas where there is no access to a pool or a tennis court mental healthif you lived your life in a segregated america if you were called boy and girl it is a different mental health situation than maybe others may have faced if you live in a situation of poverty of a single household maybethis is not across the boardthese issues will be impacted if you lived around gun violence if you saw your 15yearold friend being shot dead in the street there is a question of mental health that we need access to that care for us to be able to reach out or maybe counselors to be able to provide for children hiv aids is something that we have lived through i remember going to funerals of friends in the 1980s and into the 1990s particularly with hiv aids so we have worked in the congressional black caucus to massively talk about testing let me get to this point that i want to dwell just for a moment on and that is gun violence i was here on the floor earlier with my head held down and my heart heavy as my district today had a memorial they had one yesterday we will have one tomorrow and have one on wednesday i mourn with congresswoman corinne brown of florida we are offering legislation dealing with the assault weapons and to complement legislation already passed or already in place but it is important to note that this is a health issue because the centers for disease control can assess and study every health issue that faces america today but they are legislatively by law prohibited by my friends on other side of the aisle by republicans disallowed every year to give them permission to study gun violence gun violence is killing our children and killing our families in orlando it killed latinos who happened to be the attendees at the pulse club the lgbtq community was the dominant community and a hateful terroristic act using ar15s and glock guns killed them the incident was the deadliest mass shooting the next deadliest incidents in recent history were april 16 2007 virginia tech 32 killed 17 injured december 14 2012 sandy hook 26 killed 1 injured october 16 1991 killeen texas 23 killed 27 injured according to everytown index of mass shootings where four or more people are shot and killed the incident was the ninth mass shooting in the united states in 2016 and the 150th mass shooting in united states since january 1 2009 the mass shooting with guns impacts both the mental health the sanctity and the minority community it is shameful that we are not allowed to engage in the kind of research that a harvard professor talked about and that is the assessing of violence and the assessing of violence with guns the materials i have before me make it very clear that most of these violent acts are done with gunsdone with guns san bernardino chattanooga charleston garland oak creek and fort hood were all done with guns so i stand here today to challenge this issue of health disparities to say that the heavy brunt of killings singular killings are impacted by poverty lack of access to health care the proliferation of guns in our inner city communities and the failure of the united states congress to put real gun safety legislation closing the loophole the jim clyburn rule that says that if you dont get the review and approval by atf you do not get the gun you have to wait until you get the approval from atf which may be trying to determine whether this person with multiple problems mental health or background issues doesnt need to get a gun and then ultimately go kill their spouse their children their neighbors their family members or strangers so it is my belief today that this health disparities debate is crucial and we should come away from here recognizing that obesity the issues of mental health and hiv aids can be with great investment researched for cures or cancer that proliferates in our community triple negative breast cancer legislation that i have put forward and have gotten passed about that impact but it is the gun violence that we are doing absolutely nothing about the disparities and the impact on minority communities is atrocious i want to close simply by saying the word or the acronym lgbtq community i want to say it over and over again because i think it is shameful that in our debate in our recognition of the tragedy of orlando that we dont acknowledge the horrific hate crime and the hatefulness against that community as i stand here that community is diverse and there are african americans who are lgbtq so i would ask that as we move forward this week we will be reminded of this hatefulness and we will have a cure we will be reminded of this violence and we will have a cure that cure first of all will be to restrain the use of assault weapons and these weapons of wartype bullets that men and women in the united states military say have no business on the streets of america i believe congresswoman that health disparities are an important wall and division to overcome i thank the gentlewoman for having this special order to ensure that we will confront these issues and try to save lives racial disparities refer to the variation in rates of disease occurrence and disabilities between socioeconomic and or geographically defined population groups i want to focus on four areas of racial disparities in health that impact african americans that we can do something about 1 obesity 2 mental health 3 hiv aids and 4 gun violence african americans based on 2015 census data comprise 13 2 percent of the unitedstates population or about 42 million people socioeconomic status in turn is linked to mental health people who are impoverished homeless incarcerated or have substance abuse problems are at higher risk for poor mental health as the founder and chair of the congressional childrens caucus i am especially concerned about the childhood obesity epidemic among africanamerican youth more than 40 percent of african american teenagers are overweight and nearly 25 percent are obese the percentage of children aged 611 years in the united states who were obese increased from 7 percent in 1980 to nearly 18 percent in 2012 african american youth are consuming less nutritious foods such as fruits and vegetables and are not getting enough physical exercise this combination has led to an epidemic of obesity which directly contributes to numerous deadly or lifethreatening diseases or conditions including the following hypertension dyslipidemia high cholesterol or high triglyceride levels type 2 diabetes coronary heart disease stroke gallbladder disease osteoarthritis asthma bronchitis sleep apnea and other respiratory problems cancer breast colon and endometrial when ethnicity and income are considered the picture is even more troubling african american youngsters from lowincome families have a higher risk for obesity than those from higherincome families efforts such as the lets move campaign by the first lady are pivotal to ensuring that communities are able to provide healthy snacks and food and encourage healthier decisions since the mid1970s the prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased sharply for both adults and children nonhispanic blacks have the highest ageadjusted rates of obesity at 47 8 percent according to the cdc 37 6 percent of men and 56 9 percent of women twenty years and over are obese every year more than 40 million americans struggle with mental illness african american men are as likely as anyone else to have mental illness but they are less likely to get help racism continues to have an impact on the mental health of african americans negative stereotypes and attitudes of rejection have decreased but continue to occur with measurable adverse consequences historical and contemporary instances of negative treatment have led to a mistrust of authorities many of whom are not seen as having the best interests of african americans in mind according to the department of health and human services office of minority health adult blacks are 20 percent more likely to report serious psychological distress than adult whites adult blacks living below poverty are two to three times more likely to report serious psychological distress than those living above poverty adult blacks are more likely to have feelings of sadness hopelessness and worthlessness than are adult whites how african americans view mental health over generations is a major barrier to accessing mental health services and treatment in 1996 mha commissioned a national survey on clinical depression the survey explored the barriers preventing americans seeking treatment and gauged overall knowledge of and attitudes toward depression this survey revealed that 63 percent of african americans believe that depression is a personal weakness this is significantly higher than the overall survey average of 54 percent only 31 percent of african americans believed that depression was a health problem african americans were more likely to believe that depression was normal than the overall survey average 56 percent believed that depression was a normal part of aging 45 percent believed it was normal for a mother to feel depressed for at least two weeks after giving birth 40 percent believed it was normal for a husband or wife to feel depressed for more than a year after the death of a spouse many of these problems persist to this day as doctor william lawson of howard university and mhas district of columbia affiliate pointed out in an npr interview in 2012 many africanamericans have a lot of negative feelings about or not even aware of mental health services the mental health culture race and ethnicity supplement to the 1999 unitedstates surgeon generals report on mental health states the following africanamerican physicians are five times more likely than white physicians to treat africanamerican patients africanamerican patients who see africanamerican physicians rate their physicians styles of interaction as more participatory african americans seeking help for a mental health problem would have trouble finding african american mental health professionals in 1998 only 2 percent of psychiatrists 2 percent of psychologists and 4 percent of social workers said they were african americans the public mental health safety net of hospitals community health centers and local health departments are vital to many african americans especially to those in highneed populations african americans of all ages are underrepresented in outpatient treatment but overrepresented in inpatient treatment few africanamerican children receive treatment in privately funded psychiatric hospitals but many receive treatment in publicly funded residential treatment centers for emotionally disturbed youth in 2012 there were an estimated 356 268 inmates with severe mental illnesses in unitedstates prisons and jails there were only 35 000 mentally ill individuals in state psychiatric hospitals the report the treatment of persons with mental illness in prisons and jails jails in 44 of the 50 states and the district of columbia a prison or jail in that state holds more individuals with serious mental illness than the largest remaining state psychiatric hospital the report said african americans today are overrepresented in our jails and prisons people of color account for 60 percent of the prison population the stanford law school three strikes projects report stated that over the past 15 years the number of mentally ill people in prison in california has almost doubled in california 45 percent of state prison inmates have been treated for severe mental illness within the past year african americans also account for 14 percent of regular drug users but for 37 percent of drug arrests illicit drug use is frequently associated with selfmedication among people with mental illnesses in january 2014 the texas observer reported that of the 9 000 inmates in harris county jail more than 25 percent take medication for mental illness which means that the jail treats more psychiatric patients than all 10 of texas staterun public mental hospitals combined the passage of the affordable care act created access to health care for those who purchase health insurance and for the poor living in states that are participating in the medicaid component of the aca disparities can occur if physicians do not refer patients with signs of mental illness for proper treatment or if referred patients do not seek out treatment disparities in access to care and treatment for mental illnesses have also persisted over time as noted by the office of minority health only 8 7 percent of adult blacks versus 16 percent of adult whites received treatment for mental health concerns in 20072008 only 6 2 percent of adult blacks versus 13 9 percent of adult whites received medications for mental health concerns during 2008 while 68 7 percent of adult whites with a major depressive episode in 2009 received treatment only 53 2 percent of adult blacks did the affordable care act will have an impact on this gap by 2016 depression and other mental illness can be deadly if left untreated suicide is the third leading cause of death among african americans 15 to 24 years old untreated mental illness can also make african american men more vulnerable to substance abuse homelessness incarceration and homicide african americas are the racial ethnic group most affected by hiv in the united states according to the cdc 44 percent 19 540 of estimated new hiv diagnoses in the united states were among african americans who comprise 12 percent of the us population hiv aids are now the leading cause of death among

intravenous drug use hiv infections spread through sharing of needles has declined with needle programs while the std rates of infection among african americans has increased at rate higher than any other ethnic group have their hiv status checkednot once but annually know the hiv status of sexual partner if hiv positive know how to get on antiviral medication 2 small pills taken each day and

african americans the estimated rate of new hiv infections for african american men 103 6 100 000 population was 7 times that of white men twice that of latino men and nearly 3 times that of african american women in 2010 african american gay bisexual and other men who have sex with men represented an estimated 72 percent 10 600 of new infections among all african american men and 36 percent of an estimated 29 800 new hiv infections among all gay and bisexual men of those gay and bisexual men 39 percent 4 321 were young men aged 13 to 24 according to the cdc the numbers of new hiv diagnoses among african american women fell 42 percent between 2005 to 2014 but it is still high compared to women of other races ethnicities most new hiv infections among african american women 87 percent 5 300 are attributed to heterosexual contact in 2012 there were 72 010 texans living with hiv aids texas has the 10th highest number of hiv diagnoses in 2013 and ranks 18th for deaths from hiv currently 14 percent of the people living with hiv are undiagnosed and only 30 percent of the people with hiv are virally suppressed which means that 70 percent of the people who are ill are not on medication that can help limit their ability to infect others hiv is an unnecessarily disproportionate burden on the african american and latino community there is a wall of misinformation about the illness and an uncomfortable silence regarding the need to speak about the illness not only to the young but also the older persons when treatments were first developed in the 1990s they had lots of side effects that made patients very ill few talk about the advances in hiv treatment that now involve taking 2 small pills a day with the result leaving patients feeling healthy and able to engage in lifes normal activities the virus count for those who take their medication is so low that it often does not register in tests this does not mean that people are cured but it does mean that there is no reason not to get tested so that you know if you are in need of treatment anyone can become infectedso it is up to all of us to educate our families neighbors coworkers and friends about getting tested there are some insurance company practices that have a detrimental impact on the ability of people with hiv to enroll in qualified health insurance plans in states like texas that are not fully participating in the affordable care acts medicaid expansion this is especially problematic for hiv patients who are poor some states allow insurance carriers to post misleading or intentionally vague formularies on

hour bridging the divide a call to action by the congressional black caucus to eliminate racial health disparities tonight the congressional black caucus comes to the house floor to discuss our overarching goal of promoting equality for african americans across the healthcare spectrum it is well known that poverty socioeconomic status and health disparities are closely linked and latched together for example individuals with low incomes tend to have more restricted access to medical care and face greater financial barriers to affordable health care oftentimes contributing to health disparities last week the house republicans released their conferences poverty plan called a better way unfortunately but not unexpectedly this republican antipoverty proposal isnt a better way it isnt even a new way quite frankly it is the wrong way it uses the same trickledown discredited policies that house republicans have put forth in the past the house republicans poverty elimination proposal would repeal the affordable care act and undermine affordable quality health coverage that millions of americans are now enjoying it would also cut medicaid the childrens health insurance program that we refer to as chip and it would end the medicare guaranteeprograms with proven successes in reducing health disparities so this is in part why we are here tonight we know that health coverage is the first step in securing better healthcare outcomes and medicaid and chip play a vital role in opening the doorway to the needed health care especially for our children as we address the most pressing challenges in achieving health equity and equality for african americans i want hardworking american families to know that they have voices in congress that aim to protect their safety invest in their future and provide affordable health care for all with the affordable care act which every member of the congressional black caucus supported when it passed we have improved access we have improved affordability and quality of health care so tonight i want to thank president obama for moving the needle forward in helping american families and african american families across this great country and nation to have the financial and health security that comes with health care we cannot repeal the aca we must continue to improve and strengthen it and we will still have more work to do the congressional black caucus from its very inception has long been the voice for bridging the divide on racial healthcare disparities no we have been the voice for standing up for american people and especially individuals who are african american against all disparities we will not only come to this floor tonight we will continue our fight and we will continue to come to this floor tonight you are going to hear a lot of our members weave together our poverty plan you are going to have members talk about gun violence you are going to have members talk about all lives matter if we dont end the gun violence then we are not going to have a healthy nation tonight i want to applaud my good friend and colleague congresswoman robin kelly of the second district of illinois chair of our congressional black caucus health braintrust i want to commend her for her report the 2015 kelly report on health disparities in america the official congressional analysis of the state of african americans health in the united states and her work on the 40 under 40 leaders in health awards leaders under 40 who are physicians and medical professionals and lastly let me just thank her for her courage and her leadership for recognizing that all lives matter we cannot come to this house floor and talk about poverty programs and health care and education and about finance if we do not bridge the gap with gun violence i salute her for no longer standing up until we make a difference so tonight we are coming with a strong call to action for us to keep this wonderful america healthy you will hear from congresswoman kelly momentarily i yield to the gentleman from north carolina chairman of the congressional black caucus he is a chairman who has been a longtime advocate and voice for not

what our republican colleagues worked so hard to do was to take affordable health care away from 22 million americans at the same time we have heard all sorts of misinformation and distortions on this floor about planned parenthood which is an organization that provides women and their families with health care that provides cancer screenings and that provides family planning on national television when asked whether there was any evidence that planned parenthood had broken any law even republican chairman chaffetz of the committee on oversight and government reform who investigated planned parenthood said no im not suggesting that they broke the law in fact that was the finding of other committees here yet our republican colleagues have now set up a witch hunt special committee to go after planned parenthood ironically they claim to be doing an investigation but here on the floor they have obviously already reached a conclusion and have decided to defund an organization that helps provide health care to american women and families so rolled into one bill you have something that would deny access to health care to 22 million americans and at the same time deny important health services to millions of american women and their families when our republican colleagues pose this question and say that the president is going to be faced with a tough choice i can assure them it is not a tough choice for the president because it is not a tough choice when it comes to whether or not we take affordable health care away from 22 million americans that should be an easy choice for all of us we are not going to do it it also shouldnt be a tough choice as to whether or not we defund planned parenthood and the services they provide to american women and families that is not going to be a tough choice for the president the republican leader was absolutely right when he talked about the consequences of the 2016 elections because we are fortunate that today we have a president who will not sign that bill but who will instead veto that bill our colleagues are absolutely right if you had a different president including as far as i know all of them on the republican side they would be signing this bill so this is an important statement of what our republican colleagues think is the top priority on the first day of 2016 which is to get rid of affordable health care for 22 million americans lets talk about that with the american public because i believe that the american public wants to do what the gentleman from massachusetts said where we find problems and where we

million net new jobs americanborn citizens lost 127 000 jobs all job gains in americaand morewent to people born in foreign countries in 2012 51 percent of households headed by immigrants relied on welfare compared to 30 percent of households headed by someone born in america thus driving up americas deficits and driving down americas ability to pay for safety nets for americans this week i vote on paul ryans bid for house speaker while paul ryan has excellent communication skills is charismatic understands the economic risk of outofcontrol deficits and the like paul ryan and i have a major disagreement on border security last week on october 22 paul ryan i and others met about his candidacy border security was discussed thereafter i handdelivered to paul ryan on the house floor at roughly 4 a letter that states paul struggling american families have lost more than 8 million job opportunities to illegal aliens all lower and middle income american workers have suffered from suppressed wages caused by the surge in both illegal alien and lawful immigrant labor supply your past record and current stance on immigration conflicts with the values of the americans i represent and causes great concern to me and the americans i represent yesterday during discussions about the speaker race you made two representations about immigration that stood out they are 1 it is unwise or unproductive to bring up any immigration legislation so long as barack obama is president 2 as speaker you will not allow any immigration bill to reach the house floor for a vote unless the immigration bill is supported by a majority of the majority of republican house members although you talk faster than i can write your words down i believe the above statements properly reflect what you said i send this letter to confirm that i accurately portray your remarks and that i may rely on them when the house floor vote for speaker occurs next week if my portrayal of your words errs in any respect please deliver to me before the gop conference meeting next week in which we are to conduct speaker elections a written communication correcting my errors if i do not receive such a communication from you then i will infer that you concur that my portrayal of your remarks is accurate and that i and the rest of the gop conference and the american people may rely on your words as i have written them i need your assurance that you will not use the speakers position to advance your immigration policies except when in accord with the two above statements because there is a huge gap between your immigration position and the wishes of the american citizens i represent your words yesterday constitute the needed assurance if your assurances as i have portrayed them are accurate then i am much more comfortable voting for you for speaker on the house floor and will do so absent something startling coming to my attention between now and the election which i dont anticipate if however you would use the speakers chair to advance an immigration belief system that is unacceptable to the americans i represent it will be very difficult for me to vote for you for speaker on the house floor to be clear i intend to publicly share this letter and your responding letter if any to help explain to my constituents why i voted as i did on the house floor in the speakers election thank you for considering the contents of this letter at roughly 5 20 paul ryan called me and stated that my letter accurately portrayed his immigration representations paul ryan confirmed that he meant what he said and would keep his word based on paul ryans representations and my trust that paul ryan is a man of his word i will vote for paul ryan for house speaker on the house floor if he is

reform package will protect taxpayer dollars while reforming some of the most egregious portions of the affordable care act as a member of the house committee on education and the workforce i am proud to support language included in this bill that would repeal the harmful auto enrollment mandate of the aca this provision which would apply to companies with 200 or more employees would otherwise move employees into a preapproved governmentmanaged health insurance plan creating more red tape and mandates was never the solution to curb rising healthcare costs and to increase access to insurance markets i was a freshman member in congress in 2009 when many of the individuals speaking today took part in a 24hourlong markup of an earlier version of the aca some of these provisions lacked all common sense and that holds true today half a decade later the department of labor is still struggling to find a way to enforce auto enrollment say what you want about the affordable care act this is plain unworkable repealing this provision will save 1 billion and maintain flexibility for employers in structuring health insurance benefits for their employees my democratic colleagues on the other side of the aisle are just in denial since its passage the aca has been amended more than 50 times and the bulk of these were changes they supported and were signed into law by the president we should

too often washington tells the states exactly what they have to do this is one of those examples because this is not theoretical there are two states that have attempted to defund with their use of taxpayer dollars in their statesthese are not federal tax dollars they dont want their states taxpayers dollars to fund planned parenthood instead they want to fund other womens health services they should be allowed to do that why should the secretary of health and human services demand that one particular institution get funds lets talk about that institution the gentleman from florida says oh this is going to deny women health care let me tell you who is denying women health care in my district in rural lower eastern shore we had a planned parenthood in salisbury they closed up in april on their web site they said the center in easton will be open monday through friday you can just get your care there our planned parenthood center which is about 45 minutes up the road just go on your tablet device and see what the hours at the easton planned parenthood are that are supposed to develop this wonderful comprehensive health care to women in my district now if you want to go today you are out of luck they are closed now if you went yesterday they were open for 7 hours from 10 to 5 that is nice i guess they are bankers hours i guess we just assume that everybody is going to get their health care between 10 and 5 so monday they are open from 10 to 5 tuesday they are closed if one of the women in my lower shore want to go on wednesday they are out of luck they are closed if they want to go on thursday they are in luck they are open for 71 2 hours from 11 to 6 30 but if they want to go on friday saturday or sunday they are out of luck because planned parenthood is closed they are not delivering comprehensive services those days in fact as we know planned parenthood doesnt deliver comprehensive womens health services one of the most important services that you can deliver to a woman of childbearing age is mammograms not a single planned parenthood facility in this entire country has a mammography machine now how do you deliver a mammogram without a mammography machine it is an untruth planned parenthood doesnt do comprehensive cancer screening because one of the most important screening techniques is mammography and none of them can deliver it lets contrast what the woman who is seeking comprehensive womens health care on the lower eastern shore in marylandwhat her alternative is because the gentleman from florida mentions that our medicaid patients wont be able to be seen if we pass this bill the alternative is our federally qualified health center our community health center called three lower counties now if you go to three lower counties today you are actually in luck because they are open from 8 30 to 5 and they have a mammography machine as well as the entire range of comprehensive services with one exception they dont do abortions but then again the other planned parenthoods on the eastern shore of maryland dont do it either so in fact if a woman who is on medicaid really wants access to comprehensive health care in my district they have got to go past planned parenthood unlesswell that is not true i guess if monday and thursday they want their health care they can go to planned parenthood tuesday wednesday friday saturday they cant but they could go to one of those at my community health center in fact nationwide there are only a little over 500 planned parenthood facilities"], [0.00020825862884521484, 0.5002082586288452,
