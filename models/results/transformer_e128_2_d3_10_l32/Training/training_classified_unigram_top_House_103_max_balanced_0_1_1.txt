force c concept in february 1992 and he did have a wry smile on his face when we kept quoting back at him not only candidate clinton but kept quoting back his own wisdom which we were not completely in accord with but now looks so conservative and tough in comparison to the cuts that he is now being forced to spend as a former naval officer i will bet you kept your subscriptions ron to naval proceedings and navy league magazine and seapower and all that as i did in the air force association with air force and stuff but i also tried to take a look at marine gazette and leatherneck and all the army publications because most retired ncos petty officers and the officer corps that follows cspan and watches these defense debates on the house floor and it is not quite so lonely out here when we have three or four colleagues on the floor in a multiple discourse here but there is about a millionandahalf madam bentley of maryland our distinguished colleague from maryland thinks the audience is 3 million nobody takes any polls to know if there is a million people watching with the speakers permission i would just like to say that if you are a marine an airman or a sailor just listen for example to the army at the end of the 1991 force that would be september 30 1991 we had 16 active divisions 10 reserve and no hollow what they call cadre divisions we structured a base force to chop out four divisions they are all gone now and four reserve total divisions with all the guard units spread throughout the states we are down to 12 activeduty onehalf of that reserve and 2 hollow guard units i mean cadre units now les aspin set up as force a massive savage cuts just a year ago force b he set up another strawman of massive savage cuts then he came up with foice d where it was kind of giving the conservative republicans a position that was not necessarily ours but looks pretty good now and then he picked in the middle of a and b and d and the base force which we actually have now he picked the aspin force c here is what force d what he was saying you republicans would certainly buy this we were going to chop two more divisions get rid of the two hollow cadre divisions and leave the six reserve divisions aspin came down one more active division to nine active and six reserve no cadre now we are being told we have got to chop another several army divisions and chop the reserve forces maybe down to two divisions we will be closing national guard armories and reserve units all over this country now let us go to your service the navy boy it seems like yesterday only a year and a half ago that we had 528 ships we are already down to 450 under the force d level he wanted to give the republicans he figured we would be happy with 430 a chop of 20 but aspin under 4 c a year ago wanted to go down to 340 now we are talking about chopping this 340 another 40 50 60 80 fighting ships this is incredible and the carriers there are some people in the clinton administration who want to cut the 12 down to 6 carrierb we cannot project force anywhere when you have some of those carriers in slep service life extension programs maybe we get rid of the older ones so we would not have to face that for a couple of years but the submarines get these chops the ones with the big tubes in them the ones that have those nuclear weapons that really probably kept the peace and i say that as an air force pilot admirer of the strategic air command those boomers they say are what may have kept the peace from 1907 to 1990 lee aspin wanted to chop that in half a year ago down to 40 now we are talking about chopping the 40 down to 20 nuclear subs from 1m7 and my service as i will close on thiswe always talked about a 40wing air force 40 fighter wings we were driving toward that in reagans second and third years we did not even come close we got up to something like m4 35 now in 1901 september 30 end of fiscal 191 we had 22 wings we are now down to 15 seven air force fighter and combat wings and bomber wings are gone the force d that aspin wanted to attribute to us was 11 he wanted to go down to 10 now you heard in the discussion today they both agreed that we are going to have to take some serious hits in the six programs that we have ongoing the x to still a paper program the new longrange navy penetration fighterbomber to replace the a and replace the air force l11s they are talking about baving a skeletal air force structure then when i left at least i got asptn to come up with an finaginative plan where we would be like the xplane pngram at edwards air force base in the 150s and 1960s where we would build prototype f22s we would never cancel them we would at least have them flying and then go on to aa f24 f25 try a few of those and at least stay on the edge of technology but without building or filling out any units they will still be flying the older airplanes so the reserve wings we kad 12 a year and a half ago w are now down to 11 and the aspin chop was to come down to 8 10 actlveduty and 8 reserve we are now talking about decimating those numbers so we are talking about cutting into muscle going into the bone marrow sucking out some of the bone marrow of our defense and it is all in the name of not reducing the 4 trillion debt not really chopping the budget if you look at these things a little cynically it is to transfer this money from the defense sector men and women with families well trained jobs in both civilian and in the military to try to keep this world a stable place and we are going to transfer all that money to what our european friends call the dole boy we have got a fight on our hands here i can understand the euphoria on the majority side who have only held the white house 4 years out of the last 24 and scholars among them really thinking that that was a fluke because of the way watergate was so ghastly if not criminally mishandled that an annapolis graduate like yourself came along a good family man a submarine officer an engineer out of annapolis jimmy carter if they do not count those 4 yeas i guess this may be their last shot at holding the white house i will say that mr clintons roll of the dice on taxing and spending and gutting the militarylet us see what happens in 1996 because that is when the 325 billion heavy smash in the face of the military takes place i think it is incumbent upon us not to be cynical but do what we saw happen in this place for 2 years gridlock and a lot of smirking and say let them fall i think we have to save the majority party from itself when it comes

very interested in what is going to come out of those investigations the first vote that was taken in the committee was avote on the investigation into the former assistant white house counsel vincent fosters death and whether or not that should be discussed at these hearings the vote went along party lines ex actly and the democrat majority on the committee voted not to include any of the events surrounding mr fosters death in the hearings the reason they did that was because the report that was put out by mr fiske the special counsel indicated that mr fosters death was a suicide there was no doubt about that and that it was totally unrelated to the whitewater investigation tonight what i want to do is to ask some questions and go into some of the information that i have found over the past few weeks regarding vince fosters death and some of the questions that are not answered by the fiske report in my opinion the fiske report leaves glaring holes in the investigation and i think it is totally inaccurate in many ways first of all on july 20 1993 vincent foster left his white house office at i oclock he was later found dead by a confidential witness a gentleman driving a white van who stopped at the park and wandered through and came upon his body near a cannon he discovered the body of vince foster at 5 45 emergency medical service personnel discovered the body shortly after they were informed there was a body in the park by park personnel that had been informed of mr fosters body being there and his death by the gentleman called the confidential witness driving the white van now the confidential witness on march 27 of this year because he read some misinformation in the newspapers and heard it on television and the radio called g gordon liddy because he thought mr liddy was a person that he could trust and he called mr liddy and he met with mr liddy at his home and they talked over the kitchen table and went into the entire story of how he found mr fosters body and what happened out there that day and what he saw after i read mr liddys report and heard about it on the radio we started checking into the death of vince foster and we found a lot of inconsistencies as i said in mr fiskes report and what actually we believe happened mr liddy i talked to him several times and he finally agreed to try to set up an appointment with me with the confidential witness the only people that had talked to this person who found the body was mr liddy and later the fbi between march 27 when he was interviewed by mr liddy and july 21 when i interviewed him at his home the fbi met with him and went into a discussion with him for about 2 to 3 days the onfidential witness told me and mr liddy that he came to within 30 inches 2 feet of the body he said he leaned right over and looked right down into mr fosters face he was not on a berm some feet away he was directly over mr fosters body he stated very specifically that when he looked at mr fosters body his head was looking straight up facing straight up and that the hands were at his side with the palms up and there was no gun visible in either hand now the fiske report this report quotes the confidential witness as saying that he may have been mistaken that there may have been a gun in mr fosters hand that he did not see because of the dense foliage and the position of the hand now when i went out to his home and talked to him about this this is what the confidential witness told me he said the fbi agents pressed him on the issue of the gun asking him as many as 20 or 25 times if he was sure there was no gun in the hand according to the confidential witness the fbi said what if the trigger guard was around the thumb and the thumb was obscured by foliage and the rest of the gun was obscured by the foliage and mr fosters hand the confidential witness responded he told me he said well i suppose that if the only thing was the trigger guard around his hand and i suppose if it was lying like that with a leaf over it i might not have seen that and the gun might have been underneath the back of his hand and some foliage on part of it there is a possibility that i wouldnt have seen it because i didnt count the fingers but the palms were up and the head was straight up now when i talked to him about this he restated that and he had not seen a copy of the picture of the crime scene or the picture of mr fosters hand so there was a picture that we took from abc news that i showed to this gentleman and when he saw it he became visibly angry and he told me that that was not what he saw at the crime scene because the picture shows the gun in the hand underneath the hand with the palm down and the gun partially obscured by mr fosters body he said time and time again to me that couldnt be that way that was not the way it was because both of the palms were up there is no question about that i saw no gun and the head was straight up he also told me that at the bottom of the body the vegetation had been trampled down like somebody had been walking or messing around that area for some time he also told me that there was a wine cooler bottle near mr fosters body and that was never mentioned in the fiske report now why was there no mention of this in the report and why did the fbi and mr fiske go to such lengths to say maybe the gun was obscured by some leaves or something the gentleman that saw the body said very very clearly there was no gun inthe hand the palms were up and the head was up and in that situation the body had to have been moved by somebody now regarding the head mr fiske said that when the emergency personnel got there to investigate the crime scene they must have moved the head the fact of the matter is the head was moved before they even got there because the confidential witness said that he saw the head facing straight up now there was a blood stain on the victims cheek and a blood stain on his shoulder and the report of the forensic expert said that the head had to be against the shoulder it could not have been straight up so how did his head get straight up because dead people do not move their heads somebody had to move that body somebody had to move the hands and somebody had to move the head in addition in the report mr fiske said that maybe one of the emergency personnel moved the body but he did not ask any of the emergency personnel if they touched the body nobody admitted to touching it everybody said they didnt so how does mr fiske in the report say that somebody moved the head come to that conclusion when the confidential witness the first person on the scene said it was straight up now the fbi did not find the bullet or skull fragments at the park on july 20th 1993 the park police conducted a search for the bullet that killed vince foster using one metal detector and walking around that area of the park they didnt find anything they didnt find one bullet they didnt find one mini ball they didnt find one belt buckle one year later 9 months later the fbi went out there with 16 experts and they used modefn day technology and they found not one not two but 12 bullets none of which were mr fosters the bullet that killed mr foster and they found all kinds of other things including civil war mini balls why is it that for 9 months nobody found any of this evidence the park police said they looked for it with metal detectors but they didnt find anything in addition the fbi 9 months later searched around the body dug to a depth of 18 inches and found no bullet or bone fragments now why wasnt the bullet that killed vince foster found in that park i talked to some forensic experts and ballistic experts in california they told me that the maximum distance that bullet could have traveled after it left his skull was no more than 12 to 1 600 feet with all the technology that they had and all the time they spent out there they should have been able to find that bullet here is an interesting thing he had the gun in his hand but there were no fingerprints on the gun how in the world can a person commit suicide using a gun and there be no fingerprints on the gun now the argument is used by the special counsel that the heat of the day caused the fingerprints to melt off of the gun that the sun and the heat caused extreme heat and that caused the fingerprints to be melted off i went out there i walked all over that site that site is completely covered by trees there is all kinds of foliage above where the body was found it was found in a fairly cool area of the park those fingerprints could melt off that gun i also talked to other forensic experts that said even if that were the case there still would have been some residue that could have been picked up some fingerprints that could have been picked up by good forensic technology and experts even if you went along with there not being any fingerprints on the gun they found an alleged suicide note in his briefcase torn into 27 pieces there were no fingerprints on any of the 27 pieces it was not out in the sun this suicide note or alleged suicide note how did the fingerprints get off of that they said there was no dirt on the shoes yet he walked over 200 yards from the parking lot into the park when fosters clothing was examined by the fbi lab it said it did not contain any coherent soil but they did find some particles of mica like off of leaves on his clothing and his shoes july 26 1994 which is consistent with the mica in the park at fort marcy park the fiske report states that it was a dry day on which he died and that the foliage leading up to and around fosters body was dense it concludes that it was unlikely there was a great deal of exposed moist soil in the park that soiled his shoes he would have had to walk a long way from his car to that second cannon it is the furtherest cannon in the park on a dry day his shoes would have been stained either by grass or dirt so why was there no dirt or grass found on either one of his shoes there was a blond or light brown hair blond and light brown hairs on his chest on his tshirt they did not match mr fosters hair i in response to a question from robert novak a noted columnist mr fiske said that while we have not concluded where the blond hair came from there is no evidence to suggest that it provides any evidence of circumstances connected to the death how does he know that how does he know that because of these conclusions that they jumped to in this report there were also carpet fibers all over the body on all parts of his clothing there was carpet fibers on his jacket his tie his shirt his shorts his pants his belt socks and shoes the fbi made no effort to trace the origin of the hair or the red wool fibers found on mr fosters clothes why did not mr fiske attempt to find out who the hair belonged to and where these carpet fibers came from and why would mr fiske assume that this evidence was not relevant to the investigation without first investigating it almost every homicide detective or department in the country will tell you when you go to a crime scene like this you assume it is a murder a homicide until you prove otherwise you do not assume it is a suicide and then try to prove it is a homicide you assume it is a homicide or a murder and you try to prove otherwise let me talk to you about the forensic experts this is a very important part of mr fiskes report he devotes 730 pages to the credentials of the forensic experts he does not devote any appreciable space to the coroner the only person that saw the body the forensic experts the four of them that signed this report they based their conclusions almost entirely on the coroners report 9 months earlier they never saw the body never visited the crime scene all they did was read the information provided by the coroner to come to their conclusions and they looked at some of the blood samples and other things now the coroner was a man named dr james beyer and on two previous occasions one in 1989 and one in 1991 he declared two deaths suicides i want to tellyou about those two deaths according to the washington times dr beyer overlooked critical evidence in the 1989 timothy easley stabbing and supported a police finding that the death was suicide the death was later changed to amurder homicide after an outside expert another forensic expert dr harry bonnell noted that dr beyers original report contained glaring errors including a missing stab wound he missed a stab wound in the victims hand and getting the color of his hair wrong this gentleman that did the report on mr foster said when he did this autopsy on this tim easley he said that tim hadgray hair when his hair was dark brown regarding the stab wound in the hand dr bonnell the second forensic expert said i cannot understand how any competent forensic pathologist could miss it dr beyer the man that did the autopsy on this fellow and did it on vince foster later said the cut on easleys right hand was consistent with a needle mark though in his report he did not even make mention of the cut or a needle mark forensic pathologists are supposed to make notes of everything that they see on the body dr bonnell also said it was doubtful that the easley stab wound into the chest had been selfinflicted because of the angle a good coroner would have caught that eventually it was later found that easleys girlfriend candy wharton was the killer and she admitted stabbing easley but he had declared this a suicide and the autopsy report was completely wrong and it took a second expert to go in there and point out the glaring mistakes made by mr beyer dr beyer now in december 1991 another autopsy dr beyer ruled the death of thomas burkett jr as consistent with a selfinflicted wound it was a gunshot wound just like vince fosters into the mouth he said this was a suicide according to the new york post this second autopsy conducted there was a second autopsy on this body conducted by a dr erik mitchell that detailed serious omissions in dr beyers autopsy this second autopsy came after the family complained about things they saw at the funeral and the body was taken out of the ground they exhumed it it noted trauma and discoloration to this gentlemans right ear which could indicate he was beaten before a shot was fired into his mouth burketts family noted that the ear was so disfigured and bloody they thought he had been shot there dr beyer never noted there was any problem with the ear dr beyer also failed to identify a fractured jaw which could also indicate that the man was beaten before he was shot the second autopsy also noted that burketts lungs had not been dissected during the autopsy but dr beyer said he had opened up the mans chest cavity and looked at the chest he lied he did not do that thisis the man that did vince fosters autopsy the second autopsy also found no trace of gunpowder in the mouth dr beyer left blank the section for powder burns on gunshot wound chart so why did mr fiskes pathologists in the vince foster case base so much if not all of theii ffidifngs ifi their report on the conclusions of a medical examiner who has been challenged not once but twice in the last 3 years for flawed autopsies and flawed reports why did mr fiskes pathologists base so much of their report on an autopsy of a medical examiner who has a history of omitting important evidence from his autopsy reports the fact of the matter is this report has so many holes in it you could drive a truck through it and it is not worth much of the paper that it is written on yet the media of this country has said this is a very thorough reportit eliminates any doubt that mr foster was killed someplace else and it proves that it was a suicide let us go back over this real quick there were no fingerprints on the gun nobody explained whose hair was on his body they never found the bullet the man who found the body said that the head was straight up the hands were palms up and no gun was visible when he saw the picture that was on abc news he said that couldnt be that way they have misrepresented what i saw they misrepresented what i saw the fiske report states that dr beyer was unable to take xrays of mr fosters head because his xray machine was broken yet in the park police report he says that determining if there are bullet fragments in the skull he said in the park report he says that xrays of mr foster indicated there was no evidence of bullet fragments in the head so he says that he took an xray in the park police report but in mr fiskes report it says there was no xray now who is right i do not know but we ought to find out determining if there are bullet fragments in the skull is very important to determining how far the bullet would travel did dr beyer take xrays of vince fosters head or did he not if mr fiskes report is wrong is that the case or is it the park police report that is wrong regarding the sound there was a couple in that park probably 100 or 200 yards away across the street from the site where the crime was comniitted is the saudi embassy residence he has five security guards in the yard at all times for security purposes five not one two three four but five one is in a little guard house one is in a mobile van and the other three roam around they watch that park all the time in fact on occasion they go into the park when they think there is something suspicious going on that residence is about 300 feet or 100 yards from the crime scene they did not hear a bullet sound that day nobody reported hearing a bullet sound the couple that was there reported not july 26 1994 co hearing any sound they said the reason for that is because when he put the gun in his mouth and pulled the trigg er it prp6ably muffled it but i talked to some experts in homicide who deal with this on a regular basis and they say there would definitely have been a report or a sound from that kind of a gunshot wound because of the revolvers cylinders that are outside of the barrel of the gun we did an experiment yesterday morning i had a homicide expert come out to my home we built up something that was similar to a head and we put a 4inch barrel of a gun a 38 the same kind of weapon we are talking about into the mouth of this headlike thing we created we had people stand 100 yards away the same distance as it is from the saudi arabian ambassadors home you could hear the bullet veryclearly you could hear the gunshot very clearly why did none of the five people that were on duty that day guarding the ambassadors residence not hear a bullet sound the shot why did the two people in the park not hear the shot it could very well be because it did not happen there the gentleman that found the body said that he believes the body was moved because it was lying so straight the people who came out the emergency unit that came oat to investigate the body said that it did not look like anything they had every seen before because the body was so straight and laid so perfectly there was very little blood around the head usually when there is a gunshot wound to the head there is blood and bone fragments all over the place there was none of that the fiske report writes this off as a result of noise from traffic and construction machinery operating around the residence i might add that when we did this experiment yesterday morning there was earthmoving equipment all arouyd the place making all kinds of racket and you still could hear the gunshot very clearly if vince foster shot himself at fort marcy park why didnt any of these guards hear the shot in addition to that he took a pager with him when he left the white house if you are going to commit suicide why would you take a pager with you why were there no fingerprints on the gun why did they not find the bullet if the hand was in the position that the fbi said it was in we put a gun on our finger on a thumb just like that and the butt of the gun would have been sticking up there is no way the confidential witness could noti have seen it we did that at this house he said i would have seen it there is a question there was no gun on that hand the hand was not in that position and he was visibly angry the question is why did mr fiske say there is no connection between vince fosters death and the whitewater investigation there are a"], [0.40588507056236267, 0.40588507056236267, 0, "i thank the gentleman from new york my friend for yielding and i thank him for taking this special order i want to say that i am very proud of the people that spoke here this afternoon i do not think we have heard more eloquent debate on this floor ever than we have heard today because i think it has been heartfelt this morning in the speeches and also this afternoon and i think people are opening up their hearts to this problem because they can see that it is going to create more and more pain for our country in the future i say to the gentleman from new york fmr slomoen a little while ago you had mentioned and i appreciate your demeanor you had mentioned that this is really a bipartisan issue i dont quite see it that way if you forgive me for saying that although i respect your opinion very much the reason i say that is this is that when you look at all the evidence the people speaking out against our policy in somalis are all republicans i dont see any of the democrats when i see who wants to stay in somalia i talk with all of our republicans i did not find a single republican today that said he wants to stay in somalia not a single one but yet the president wants to stay the president said that we are going to put more troops into somalia and we are not going to widen the effort secretary of state christopher stated that no one should even think about getting out of somalia he is democrat secretary of our committee on foreign affairs the gentleman from indiana said it would be a serious mistake to pack up and come home because it would harm unitedstates and u n credibility now he is a democrat we have secretary aspin say that we have to stay now he is a democrat all these people right down the line who want to stay are all democrats i have been going around this chamber today as my colleagues know i did not find a single republican that said he wanted to stay therefore my conclusion is that the democrats want to we have done our share its time to come out every one of the replblicans that i talked to say the same thing the united states cannot be the 911 for every trouble spot in the world it is unfair tc our soldiers it is unfair to our troops unfair to our taxpayers as my colleagues know last night i had a chance to see the movie gettysburg and my colleagues here today probably had a chance to go down and see it too it is an interesting metaphor for what is going on in our country today as general lee knew once you commit yourself it is almost impossible to get out of a situation and so on the first day when general meade came to gettysburg and engaged the union army after that they were locked in they could not retreat as my colleagues know that is the same thing that happens in bosnia that is going to happen if we allow troops in bosnia we already have troops in macedonia it happened in somalia i remember when we put our troops into somalia in december i called the white house and i asked when are we going to get out of somalia do my colleagues know what they told me we are going to be out by inauguration day that is january 20 well january 20 came and went and i went down to the white house after the new administration came in and i said when are we going to leave somalia they said by the springtime we will be gone what happened in the springtime in the springtime we had a resolution on this floor saying that we are going to be in somalia for a year but if my colleagues read the fine print it was a year or longer if we republicans do not take the initiative we are going to be in somalia at the turn of the century and we are going to lose hundreds and hundreds of soldiers and it is not fair to them the americans do not realize today that we had 4 000 troops in somalia today we have got 5 700 and they are some of our elite troops and the president wants to put more troops into somalia this is a real quagmire and we have got to have the stamina and the courage to say no somebody has got to speak up for the american people and that is where the gentleman from new york imr solomon he and some of our other friends that spoke here this afternoon have to come in we have got to take the leadership if the president does not speak for the american people if the secretary of state the secretary of defense do not then we in this congress have the obligation to speak up for our people because after all they put their trust and confidence n as and that is why i stay in somalia and the republicans say to my colleagues im proud of are saying hey we have done enough you gentleman for taking this special order today because if no one else does it then by golly we are going to do it we have got to do that for our people we owe it to the people who put their trust and confidence in us i thank the gentleman from new york for having yielded to me on this very very crucial issue and i hope when the president and the administration come down here and they ask us to put troops into bosnia i hope this is a real object lesson for us because they always say that is the one thing we learn from history is that we never learn from history let us for once say we are going to learn a historical lesson barbara tuchman in her great book guns of august which is really a classic of how the world slipped into world war i and i know all of you have read it there is an interesting example where the british general says to the french general foch how many troops do you want general and the french general said just send me one and after you send me one you will send me all you have got that is something we have to remember when we debate these issues here on

increase in the history of the united states that has been proposed by president clinton in fact it is notjust the largest tax increase in the history of the united states it is more than double more than double the largest tax increase in the history of the united states in fact the tax increase that president clinton has proposed totals over 400 billion when we take that kind of money out of the collective pockets of the people of this country we hurt the economy dramatically if we do not buy 400 billion dollars worth of products they do not produce 400 billion dollars worth of products if the people of this country do not spend the 400 billion that they are going to pay in taxes to the government they do not buy 400 billion dollars worth of products cars refrigerators clothes and other products if those products are not purchased they are not going to be manufactured because the manufacturers of cars and refrigerators and clothes and other products will not manufacture products that are not going to be sold when we stop producing products and we start cutting back on employment because the assembly lines are not going to be going full tilt if they are not selling those products that is what has always happened whenever we have had massive tax increases two years ago 3 years ago when we had the budget summit agreement of 1990 it had one of the largest tax increases in unitedstates history 184 billion what did that lead us to it led us to an economic recession we saw unemployment go up we saw production go down we saw us lose in the trade war with our friends across the world and that is the same thing that is going to happen again only it will be worse in addition to just having a tax increase the kinds of tax increases president clinton is talking about are very onerous ones the btu tax the energy tax he is talking about we call it the big time unemployment tax the btu tax is going to add about 15 cents a gallon to jet fuel the airline industries tell us that will put many of them out of business they are on the borderline right now unitedstates air recently merged with british airways or had a contractual deal with them in addition to the airlines that may go out of business because of this huge increase in jet fuels i have had many people come to me who are farmers who tell me that the cost of agriculture is going to be huge and it is going to put a lot of them out of business we have had foundries come to us and tell us it is going to put the foundry industry in a very difficult situation they are already experiencing very difficult trade problems right now from competitors overseas many of them will go out of business the trucking industry is going to pay another 10 to 15 cents a gallon for fuel and that will be added to the cost of refrigerators and cars and clothes that are transported around this country that means that we are going to have an inflationary pressure on those products we buy that is not the problem that i want to talk about tonight the problem that we want to talk about here tonight is that with all these huge tax increases we are going to continue to see the national debt go up and up and up and up president clinton has told us he is going to cut spending but when we look at the proposals he sent to the congress of the united states we find that domestic spending is going to increase by about 94 billion over the next 5 years not go down it is going to go up 94 billion he is raising taxes over 400 billion and domestic spending is going to go up the only area he is going to be cutting is defense and he is going to be cutting defense to the tune of about 127 billion that will cut into the muscle and bone of our defense capability at a time when there is a lot of uncertainty in the world in former yugoslavia in russia in the former soviet union the place we should be very careful about cutting we can make cuts in defense but we must not cut into the muscle and bone that is the only place that president clinton is making major cuts huge tax increases huge increases in domestic spending and the only place he is going to cut is in the area of defense what are we going to be faced with the projections are that thedeficit instead of going down is going to go up over the next 4 to 5 years maybe not as rapidly as it would have otherwise but it is still going to go up in the next week we are going to be asked in this body to increase the debt ceiling by a quarter of a trillion dollars and that is not for a very long period of time in fact we are going to increase the debt ceiling for 6 months by increasing the debt by 250 billion that is intolerable what we need to do if we are going to be talking about any change in our debt structure is to put a cap on government spending and to get a balanced budget amendment that will control the spending in this body and the other body and to get a lineitem veto so that the president will be able to line out those items which are wastefulw"], [0.4119929373264313, 0.4119929373264313, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume well i guess i come to the floor today i do not know just i guess stunned shocked i guess i should not be though i have been in the house long enough that i should not be that way i want first of all to say that in many respects the gentleman from minnesota was successful in the negotiations in other words he got the senate to move partially our way well let me tell you what we have in this budget deal we have higher taxes coming out of the conference than we had coming out of the house it is hard to believe is it not that the house passed this bill that had 2 times as many taxes as there were spending cuts and we come back and we have got more taxes now let us talk about spending we know we have 182 billion in new spending programs offered by the majority as investment programs you decide whether more government spending is investment or not i think more government spending is just that more government spending more debt but we come back from conference with more spending than we had when we left the house now if you wonder about why this chart is in such bad shape it is because of the time we had to put this thing together i would have liked it to have been a little more professional but this reflects the amount of time we have had on this but let me tell you what the bottom line is the deficit under this plan goes up as opposed to the plan that left the house it goes up by 1 090 000 000 000 so we hear talk about the fact that we have a great deficit reduction plan and you know what the bottom line is you know what the rubber is when it meets the road you know what happens when you get under the hooa and start to look at what is going on you get over 1 090 000 000 000 more in deficit and added on top of it a big fat tax increase and more government spending and we won in conference in a matter of speaking we pulled it our way and we still went up in every single one of these categories so when members go home they have got to talk about taxing the american people in order to have more spending in order to have a 1 090 000 000 000 deficit increase do you know what i am going to tell members now that that aint going to sell you know i do not know what kind of mail members are getting but i can state the kind of mail i am getting says cut spending first if you are going to have any taxes use them to reduce the deficit and get government spending down what we have got here is a 1 090 000 000 000 increase in the federal deficit accompanied with those big fat taxes let me tell you about the conference i have been to a lot of conferences i have been on the conference committee now about seven or eight times with the committee on armed services we get in there we have a meeting we get together and negotiate let me tell you about the budget conference you are going to hear a lot about this budget conference we show up to a photo session we sit around a table and everybody makes their speeches about what they think ought to be done then the chairman of the conference adjourns the conference then the democrats go behind closed doors write the bill and then we findout what it is so there is no negotiating there is no discussion there is no back and forth maybe in a sense this is good because the republicans have made every single effort in the house of representatives we have made every effort possible to try to improve the package to try to reduce government spending to try to lower the taxes on the american people and every single one of those proposals was rejected on party line vote every single one of those proposals that was taken up there to the committee on rules to try to reduce the taxes in specific ways was rejected by the committee on rules it is not our package we tried we tried to reduce spending we tried to reduce taxes we tried to reduce the debt and we were roadblocked every single step of the way we the republicans over here do you know what we were subjected to gridlock there is a picture lii sports illustrated of a guy with a tennis shoe stamped on the side of his face and that is what happened to us we may be defeated in this package but we are not beaten let me tell you you are going to have to come in here over the next several months and we are going to have pictures of your economic program we are going to take a look at the revenues and we are going to take a look at the cuts and we are going to take a look at the deficit and we are going to take a look at the performance of this economy let me tell you the difference could not be more stark the analysis will not be more clear the said thing though is when this economy does not work like it should when you cannot make the cuts in defense because they are not responsible when your taxes go up when your deficits go up unfortunately we are going to have to tell you that we told you so but do you know what the real tragedy is there will be no solace whatsoever in having to tell you that because it will be the country that will be hurt and maybe this debate is good democrats feel the majority party feels that the central government the king kong government that is big that is tall that is powerful that is a bully is the way to solve americas problems we do not happen to believe that we think that an absence of government that limited government is the answer we are polarized we are going to find out over the next couple of years whether king kong government works whether a powerful central government trying to run america is the answer to americas problems i do not think we will find that it is i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.4214509129524231, 0.4214509129524231, 0, "aye

"over the past several weeks there has been a lot of questions about the death of vince foster and the connection of his death to the whitewater investigation and i have had nine people on my staff at the republican study committee and my personal staff and some outside sources investigating this because the committee on banking finance and urban affairs here in the house that is doing the whitewater investigation on a party line vote has limited the scope of the investigation to such a degree that one member said that if the same principles had been applied to the o j simpson case the one thing you could ask o j simpson is how was your trip to chicago you couldnt ask any other questions that is how limited the investigation is there is a deliberate attempt to minimize the investigation and i think to cover up a lot of the facts on the senate side we have a similar problem it is not quite as bad over there but nevertheless a lot of the information that must come out regarding vince fosters death and his connection to the whitewater matter needs to be explored so tonight even though i have been castigated by a lot of the people in the media even though some members of the senate committee and the house banking committee have indicated that we have made some comments that are not very understanding as far as mr fosters family is concerned i feel compelled to go through this tonight one more time with oneaddition because we have been taken to task because of things i have said on the floor i went out and found the confidential witness the man that found vince fosters body and i got a sworn statement he swore before god the things that i am going to read to you tonight are factual so i am going to go into the entire litany the entire chronology of vince fosters death and the connection to whitewater then i will read to you excerpts very important excerpts i would read the whole thing to you but we would be here all night because it is a 50page sworn statement but i will read to you excerpts that verify everything i have been saying before this body on july 20 1993 vince foster left his white house office at 1 he was later found dead by a confidential witness at fort marcy park the confidential witness is the person that gave this sworn testimony to me nobody knows who he is except two fbi agents gordon liddy and myself emergency medical service personnel discovered the body shortly after they arrived at the park at 6 09 the confidential witness was interviewed by g gordon liddy on march 27 he was interviewed by me on july 21st and in between he was interviewed by the fbi agents who mr liddy urged him to talk to the confidential witness told mr liddy and me that he approached to within 2 to three feet of vince fosters head and he leaned over and looked directly down into mr fosterseyes he stated very specifically that the head was looking straight up and that the hands were at his side palms up with no gun in either hand the fiske report quotes the confidential witness as saying that he may have been mistaken and that there may have been a gun in fosters hands that he did not see because of the dense foliage and the position of the hand the confidential witness told me that the fbi agents pressed him on the issue of the gun asking him as many as 20 to 25 times if he was sure there was no gun and according to the con fidential witness the fbi said what if the trigger guard was around the thumb and the thumb was obscured by foliage and the rest of the gun was obscured by the foliage and the hand in other words the trigger guard would be around the thumb the gun would be underneath the thumb and a leaf would be over that and you would not see it the confidential witness after being asked about 20 to 25 times said if what you described were the case then i suppose it could be possible because i did not count his fingers but i am sure that the palms were definitely opened and facing up at this point the confidential witness still had not seen a copy of the photograph of fosters hand that was shown on abc news the photo showed the right hand palm down with the thumb trapped in the trigger guard he had not seen that when i went to see this gentleman i showed him the photo he was sitting at his kitchen table and he stood up and walked around the table twice saying that is not the way it was that is not the way it was those hands that hand was moved why did he get so angry when he saw the photo he told me not only that the hand had been moved but some of the things he told the fbi were not mentioned in the report for instance the vegetation at the bottom of the body had been trampled like somebody had been walking around there why was no mention of the trampled vegetation in the fiske report the confidential witness also reported that he saw a wine cooler bottle near mr fosters body such a bottle was not noted in the fiske report we are going to talk about these wine cooler bottles a little later there was in the fiske report there was a blood stain on the right side of mr fosters face mr fiskes report noted that the blood stains on fosters right cheek and his right shoulder were inconsistent with the head being upright in other words if the head was sitting up how did the blood get on the cheek and the right shoulder so somebody had to move the head but the problem is before the police or anybody got there the head was already straight up so who moved the head the report describes the stain on his cheek as a contact stain typical of having been caused by a blotting action such as would happen with a blood soaked object brought in contact with the side of the face and taken away so at sometime his face had to be in contact with his shoulder according to the report mr flskes report assumes that one of the early emergency personnel that came to the park moved the head but the confidential witness said the head was already moved and he was the first person to see the body before anybody got there in addition mr fiske after interviewing all the people at the scene fails to identify anybody that admits to touching the body and moving the head so he assumes it was moved by somebody after the body was found but he does not know who it was yet the confidential witness that found the body said it was already straight up why did not mr fiske assume that one of the persons who arrived after the confidential witness moved his head when the confidential witness was the first person to find fosters body he said the head was facing straight up at the time now the fbi did not find the bullet or skull fragments at the park on july 20 1993 the park police conducted a search for the bullet that killed foster using only one metal detector and they found nothing at all after lengthy search why did they only use one metal detector this is one of the highest ranking people in the clinton white house they had one metal detector running around through the woods there and this did not find anything then 9 months later on april 4 1994 16 fbi agents and experts searched fort marcy for the bullet and they found 12 not one not two but 12 modern day bullets but they did not find the one that killed vince foster the fbi searched immediately beneath where fosters body was found by digging and hand sifting the soil and other debris they excavated down a foot and half they found no bullet and no bone fragments in the search for the bullet the fbi personnel marked out a grid of the most likely area for the bullet to be found after passing through fosters skull the area was searched using a metal detector once against 12 modern day bullets were found but the fbi lab determined that none were the ones that shot vince foster or came out of his gun now i contacted a ballistics expert in california who stated that after passing through a mans skull a 38 caliber bullet should travel no more than 1 2g0 to 1 600 feet or about 300 to 500 yards the fbi should have been able to find that bullet with all the people that were out there and all the expertise they had if the bullet was in the park so why was it not found get this once again this is very important there were no fingerprints on the gun and there were no fingerprints on 27 separate pieces of the suicidenote can you imagine a suicide note torn into 27 pieces without a fingerprint on it you would have to wear surgical gloves here is how he explained that the fbi found no fingerprints on the 38 caliber colt revolver the fiske report states the latent fingerprints can be destroyed due to exposure to heat so if it was a real hot day they are saying the fingerprints could have melted off the gun yet they do not explain why when they took the trigger guard off the gun there was a fingerprint on it that had been on there probably for years but the fingerprints of that vince foster allegedly put on the gun were melted off i went out to the site and walked all over that area there is no sun that hits the place where they found his body the sun could not have done that even on a hot day it is very doubtful according to forensic experts i talked to that there would be no sign of any fingerprints on the gun but it was completely smooth no fingerprints on the gun except a little bit on the trigger guard where they found his thumb i do not know how you could hold a gun with one or both hands and not leave one fingerprint in addition the note that was found in fosters briefcase was torn as i said in 27 pieces and had no prints it was not exposed to the heat so why were there no fingerprints found on either the gun or the note makes no sense there was no dirt on his shoes there was a little bit of mica but there was no dirt on his shoes when mr fosters clothing was examined by the fbi lab it did not contain any coherent soil they did find small parcels of mica which is off of leaves on much of fosters clothing including his shoes which is consistent with the soil in fort marcy park the fiske report states it was dry on the day that foster died and that foliage leading up to and around fosters body was dense it concludes that it was unlikely that there was a great deal of exposed moist soil in the park that would have soiled fosters shoes foster would have had to walk a long way from his car to the second cannon i walked all the way from the parking lot up to that second cannon and it was a dry day and i had dust all over my shoes it is about 300 yards for them to say there was no dirt on his shoes does not make any sense unless possible he had been moved to that position even on a dry day his shoes would have been stained by either grass or dirt or at least dust why was no dirt or dust or grass found on his shoes now there was blond to light brown hair that did not match mr fosters hair found on his tee shirt pants belt and socks and shoes in response to a question from robert novak mr fiske said while we have not concluded where the blond hair came from there is no evidence to suggest that it provides any evidence of circumstances connected to his death how does he come to that kind of a conclusion carpet fibers of various colors were found on his jacket tie shirt shorts pants belt socks and shoes did they check his office to see if the carpet fibers were off of his office carpet did they check his home to see if the carpet fibers were out of his home and if they were not from either one of those places where did those carpet fibers come from it is not mentioned in the report you just forget about that yet everybody the media and everybody is accepting this report at face value even through the confidential witness that found that body said the hands were moved and so was the head why didnt mr fiske attempt to find out who the blond hair belonged to why didnt mr fiske attempt to determine where the carpet fibers and wool fibers found on fosters body came from why would mr fiske assume that this evidence was not relevant without investigating it first then 70 pages of the report are devoted to the credentials of the four forensic experts that wrote the report on mr fosters death they had four experts that wrote a report saying it was a suicide at fort marcy park but they based their conclusions probably 90 percent of them on the coroners report now if the coroner made a mistake and he screwed up the report then their report has to be questioned as well let us check on the coroner he testified 2 days ago before the senate fiske goes to great length to highlight the credentials of the four pathologists as i just mentioned their resumes take up 70 pages of the report yet none of these people ever saw fosters body because he had been dead and buried for 9 months before they wrote the report their findings were wholly reliant on dr james beyer northern virginias deputy medical examiner he said that vince fosters death was consistent with a selfinflicted wound but according to the washington times dr beyer the coroner overlooked critical evidence in the 1989 timothy easley stabbing and supported a police finding that the death was a suicide the death was later changed to a murder a homicide after an outside expert dr harry bonnell noted that dr beyers original report contained glaring errors including a missing stab wound in the victims hand where he was defending himself and getting the color of his hair wrong the coroner did not even get the color of his hair right this is the guy on which they are basing the entire forensic report of vince foster the autopsy report said tim easleys hair was gray when his hair was dark brown regarding the stab wound in his hand dr bonnell said i cannot understand how any competent forensic pathologist would miss a stab wound in the hand dr beyer later said the cut on easleys right hand was consistent with a needle mark though he noted no such mark on his report forensic pathologists are supposed to make note of everything in their reports dr bonnell also said that it was doubtful that the easley stab wound to the chest could have been selfinfiicted he said it could not have been selfinflicted and yet the coroner said it was eventually it was found out that easleys girlfriend candy wharton was the killer and she admitted stabbing easley to death so he missed it he made a terrible mistake and he missed very important things that any forensic expert would have found according to dr bonnell any competent expert then in december 1991 in another autopsy dr beyer ruled the death of thomas burkett jr as consistent with a selfinflicted wound and this was a gunshot to the mouth much like vincefosters according to the new york post a second autopsy conducted by a dr erik mitchell detailed serious omissions in the beyer autopsy this second autopsy came after the family had the body exhumed they dug him up it noted trauma and discoloration to this gentlemans right ear which could indicate he was beaten to death before the shot was fired into his mouth his ear had been all smashed up and at the funeral they noticed it and they thought he had been shot in the ear but he was not he had been shot in the mouth burketts family noted that the ear was so disfigured and bloody they thought he had been shot there dr beyer never even mentioned the trauma to the mans ear in the report dr beyer also failed to identify a fractured lower jaw his jaw was broken he did not mention that in the report which could also indicate a beating the second autopsy also noted that burketts lungs had not been dissected although the report said they had been he said he did a complete autopsy cut open the mans chest checked his lungs when they exhumed the body and did the second autopsy they found he lied he did not even do that this is the man on whom they based their findings in the vince foster case the second autopsy in this case also found no trace of gunpowder in the mouth and dr beyer said he inadvertently left the section for powder burns off of the gunshot wound chart so why did mr fiskes pathologists base so much if not all of their report on the conclusions of a medical examiner who has been challenged in the past for flawed and erroneous autopsies why did mr fiskes pathologists base so much of their report on the autopsy of a medical examiner who has a history of omitting important evidence from his autopsy reports the fiske report states that dr beyer was unable to take x rays of mr fosters head because his xray machine was broken however the park police report which was submitted last summer quotes dr beyer as stating that the x rays of mr fosters head indicated there was no evidence of bullet fragments in his skull determining if there are bullet fragments in the skull is very important to determining how far the bullet would have traveled did beyer take x rays of vince fosters head or didnt he at the senate the other day he said he did not so why did he tell the park police he did i dont know the security guards directly about 100 yards away from the place they found vince fosters body across chain bridge road there is the saudi arabian ambassadors residence there are five trained security guards there all the time there are three that roam around one in a van and one in a little security guardhouse there there people were there all the time they even checked that park across the street occasionally because they are concerned about somebody trying to get to the saudi arabian ambassador and they said that day they heard no gunshot the fiske report says that as result of traffic out there and construction traffic and becausewith a gun in the mouth in that position there would not have been a lot of noise we at my house with a homicide detective tried to recreate a head and fired a 38 inch barrel into that to see if the sound could be heard from 100 yards away even though there was an earth mover moving around in the background making all kinds of racket you could hear the bullet clearly now this is the information that i have used in the past i went out to see the confidential witness and when i showed him the picture he was upset he told me that rather than me writing down a statement for him to sign he wanted to give me a statement in his own words i let him dictate a statement to me in his own words and he signed it i came back to this body and i gave my colleagues this signed statement i did not give his name because i promised i would keep his confidence however i read into the record what he said and i sent it out to many people in the media some people said we dont know if burton is credible or not we do not know if he is making this up so they started questioning whether or not i was just once again beating a dead horse what did i do i called the confidential witness there to get his sworn statement so last thursday night on july 28 i took two other congressmen congressman dana rohrabacher of california and congressman john mica of florida with me and we took a court reporter from the block court reporting services and we recorded 50 pages 49 pages of statements from the confidential witness so tonight i want to read into the record excerpts from that which will verify everything that i have said this man was sworn and he took an oath before god that what he is saying is absolutely correct so we started off i said why dont we start off by reading into the record what you said here is the confidential witness reading into the record involving the statement about the gun in vince fosters hand i made it very clear that the palms of his hands were facing up and at his sides the agents investigating stated that the gun was hooked on his thumb and partially obscured by theback of his hand based on their explanation of how the gun was being held i conceded that all that was visiblethat if all that was visible was the trigger guard on his thumb and the dense foliage that i could have missed seeing it i again stated that i saw both of the mans palms but did not count his fingers after having seen the photo of the hand and the gun i am sure i am sure the hand had been moved because the palms were both face up when i saw mr fosters body then i started questioning him as well as did congressman rohrabacher and congressman mica would you tell us how close you were to the body and how close you got to his face his hands and everything else the confidential witness said i stood directly over the top of his head at the head of the berm my right foot im sure that it was my right foot was somewhere between 24 to 30 inches from the top of his head no closer at that point learning over with my left foot extended behind me i looked directly down into his eyes from about 3 foot to 4 foot maximum above his face my face from his i said you were directly above him he said directly above him looking straight down the body the mans head was facing straight up if it was tilted it was tilted very slightly because i looked into both eyes i was questioned numerous times by the agents about are you sure the head wasnt tilted and i kept telling no i looked straight down into both eyes do you want me to go on and explain what i say i said yeah go ahead tell us what you saw he said i saw blood traces on his nose and around his lips there was not streams of blood on the side of his face there was not trickles of blood as indicated in the foster report i was looking straight down into the mans face and saw the blood on his mouth and nose congressman mica said was there a gun in the hands the confidential witness says there was no gun in his hand hisboth palms were face up thumbs out to the side congressman mica you did not see a gun he said i did not see a gun next to the body congressman mica did you touch the body or did you shake him the confidential witness said oh god no i wouldnt touch him for no amount i mean no way would i disturb any evidence period then i said i want you to look at this picture because you say you saw no gun in the hands and i showed him once again the hand that was on abc news the picture he said i also when i saw nothing in his hands i leaned to both sides of his head and to the back of his head to see if he had been hit in the head and saw nothing visible congessman mica said did you look at his hands again he says i did not look back at his hands again because i clearly saw his hands were empty and he had no signs that he had was defending himself or something then i said now you saidwhat did you see beside the body he said there was a wine cooler bottle laying i would say 24 to 30 inches to the right between his shoulder and his elbow laying on the berm held up by some twigs not on the berm but on the down side of the hill being held up by some twigs because its a very steep grade then i said was it sitting straight up or just laying on its side he says laying sideways still probably one quarter of its contents in the bottle then congressman mica said did you seeyou said the palms were out and the confidential witness said once again the palms were face up i said both both palms he said right beside him neatly just like that and he showed us just like that he said so that they were not in this position congressman mica rolled his hands over he said it was not in that position at all then i said tell me about the picture youthe fbiyou asked the fbi what about the picture and the head the confidential witness said numerous times i said what did you ask them about the head and he said if you will show me the picture this is what he said to the fbi agents he said if you will show me the picture of the head and the picture of his hands that you said there was no gun inthat i said there was no gun in and you said there was then i could tell you point blank if somebody had tampered with it with mr fosters body then i said what did they say when you asked them to see the pictures and this is what he said the fbi people said well it will jeopardize our investigation i cannot show it to you at this time we will be more than glad to show it to you when all this investigation is over and that was the common answer i got from the fbi every time then i said over how long a period of timehow many times did they say that to you he said 4 5 times i directly inquired let me see the picture they never let him see the picture of the hands congressman mica said you have never seen this picture before the confidential witness said i had never seen that picture until the congressman that is me handed it to me mr liddy had told me that that picture had been published somewhere but i had never saw it or i would have probably beeni know i would have been screaming then i said so you were no more than 2 feet 3 feet above his head he said i would say 2 to 3 feet i had said 24 to 30 inches my face was from his face then he went on to say that he thought he had been there for a while because his clothes were very tight there was a stain just about like that he showed me where the stain was on his shoulder congressman rohrabacher said what color congressman mica said you are pointing to your shoulder he said on his right shoulder it was athe stain on his shoulder was congressman rohrabacher said was it red or was it blood the confidential witness said no it was very light purple almost identical color of the wine cooler i said so you dont think it was blood he said i do not think it was blood in the very center ofit looked like he had thrown up on his right shoulder in the very center there was one small speck area probably no larger than a silver dollar that was black that could have been blood in the very center of it the reason im skipping through is there is a lot of repetition here because we kept asking the questions over to make sure we had it correct congressman roerabacher said hold on lets make this point very clear the fbi when they were talking to you and when they kept going onthis question referred to the palm being up and the gun being underneath the palm the confidential witness says he the fbi agent demonstrated with his hand like this with his palm up and he showed the palm to us like this and said that the trigger guard was on the thumb and the gun could have been obscured underneath the hand and that leaves might have been covering the thumb so he would not have seen the trigger guard congressman rohrabacher said so the questionwhen they claim that you had in some way conceded that well maybe perhaps you didnt see it if indeed it was below the palm that was based on a description by the fbi that the palm was up and that the gun was underneath the back of the hand then i said but its not possible look at this because i had a gun and i put it on my thumb to show congressman rohrabacher said no but thats not what this picture shows the confidential witness said exactly then i said but if the thumb is in there look at this you cant then mr rohrabacher said the more important part is that the fbi was describing something to him that was not the confidential witness said exactly right then i asked him but in the report they say you believed that the palms were up but you say there is no doubt he said i never saidi said i believe it i mean i know it he said i never said i believe it i know it that the palms were up congressman rohrabacher said okay then the confidential witness says and he said the confidential witness believes it and thats as straight as they can be"], [0.42513588070869446, 0.42513588070869446, 0, "i thank my friend from florida for yielding time to me i want to encourage all of my colleagues to vote no on this rule i want to say that i believe this is a case study in three things bringing this up is a case study in how the democratic liberal leadership manipulates and manages the house bringing this up is a case study in why the american people are sick of democratic control of the house after 40 years of monopoly bringing this up is a case study in bad policy and how you can bring a dumb idea to the floor without having any context and without having any hearings and without understanding what you are doing so for three reasons we should defeat it let me goback through them let us be clear that this rule and this resolution is a case study in how the liberal democratic leadership manipulates the house the gentleman from new hampshire mr bill zeliff working with some democrats developed an idea called the atoz spending cuts it in volved real cuts it involved a real law that involved really eliminating some pork barrel under the new open discharge petition rule which the gentleman from oklahoma developed we were actually on the verge of getting enough votes that we could actually bring the atoz spending cuts to the floor and spend a week actually cutting spending at that point the liberal democratic leadership went in overdrive and they began to say to their members do not sign the discharge petition for real spending cuts and we will give you a smoke screen to go home and claim you accomplished something this bill on the floor today is in effect a reward for not having voted for and signed up on the discharge petition it is a classic example of how the liberal democratic leadership picks off one element of their party at a time to maintain control of the house against the will of the american people but now let us look at the substance of today it is the sense of congress that current trends in entitlement spending are not sustainable let me tell members the baby boomers are too old to be taken in by this anymore this used to work in the early 1980s when tony coelho was here and when just saying anything would work and people actually still believed politicians but given the clinton administration record of not meaning what it says and given the democratic control of congress for 40 years if any member goes back home and stands up in the next 5 weeks and says i voted for a sense of congress in the first place people do not believe there is any sense in the congress in the second place the idea that instead of real cuts instead of real changes instead of real effort what we are going to have is one more phony campaign press release disguised as a vote on the floor so that when it was a kasich budget that was real cuts do not vote for that when it was the pennykasich spending cuts so that was real do not vote for that but now do youwant a press release that has no binding law oh that is terrific vote yes but i mean no person who is selfrespectingly serious about cutting spending ought to vote for this thing just on the principle that it is embarrassing but then there is the last point now maybe my friends want to vote to cut social security i know the white house attacked us just 2 days ago ard so we have an acidtest opportunity today because as i understand it this would cut the colas the costofliving increases for people on social security there will be an amendment offered to give every member a chance without having hearings without an overall strategy to cut spending without doing anything about welfare without cutting out porkbarrel spending without doing anything about all the other entitlements there will be an effort to come in here and cut costofliving increases for most americans well my democratic friends may want to go ahead in a moment of foolishness and vote to cut social security i think it is a bad idea i think it breaks our contract with the american people it is the one thing we republicans said we were going to take off budget and we would not touch as part of our balancedbudget amendment it is the one thing we said we would protect i know that four senior democrats last week jumped up and said you have got to cut social security including the former chairman of the committee on ways and means i know that a lot of democrats are itching to cut social security i know the clinton administration raised taxes on social security recipients retired americans i know there is some passion in the democratic party right now to punish senior citizens i know the clinton health plan was going to be paid for by 400 billion in cuts in medicare but i do not see why any member should get up and vote for a social security cut that has had no hearings been in no committee been reported by no subcommittee been reported by no full committee and sprang fullblown from the brow of one member this is almost as bad as the secret white house clinton task force on health one member on their own invented their magic solution they convinced their leadership to make it in order for the leaderships political purposes they now want the house to walk the plank to make them look good i urge a no vote n the rule i urge a no vote on the amendments i urge a no vote on the resolution let us be honest with the american people let us pass a constitutional amendment that will require a balanced budget and let us pass a kasich budget that cuts spending let us pass real welfare reform let us pass real cuts in pork let us pass real downsizing of the bureaucracy but let us do it in law not in some kind of public relations campaign"], [0.42594030499458313, 0.42594030499458313, 0, "well i am not quoting general montgomery but probably what he was thinking well here is my worst fear this is the sixth or seventh ranger raid all the press knows that that is not classified and he said and here is the time that i wanted the armor now i dont have it so ive got to go to these other commands even though im the no 2 in command turkish general is giving me full bore to go here i cant solve the problems of language of night vision to get this thing going by the time they cranked it up and reached donovan bliley and cliffs site the first crew it was 7 hours by the time 9 hours excuse me 9 hours the rangers had formed a perimeter around the first crash by the time they reached durants helicopter he was gone the other five men were gone we saw their bodies the next evening on american television being beaten desecrated handcuffed cut off dragged around the streets all five of those men we miraculously got back why two sets of remains we did not get back from the september 25 crash and i have really stuck it to the army hard pushing them and pushing them and they have satisfied this member that we lost many young men wounded not dead thank god trying to get to those remains the men went into that white hot helicopter almost climbed up in the tall which was separated from the explosion could not find any remains but one set badly burned which they got back by the way the rangers knew that from september 25 that is why they did not want to leave one of the pilots of the first downed helicopter in the wreckage they knew that that pilot would be dragged around the next day dead and desecrated and it happened didnt it from donovans helicopter the very next few hours with five men some of whom may have been beaten to death by the crowd so that is why they stayed and took killed in action and more wounded not to desert that helicopter it says in this article that i will put in that they finally got a humvee one of these fragile little fourwheel humvees that arnold schwarzenegger made famous by buying a commercial red one that is how they ripped the helicopter apart to get donovan or cliffs body out if they had had a tank there they not only would have had armored positions from four directions but a tank in an instant could have torn the broken h60 apart and gotten those bodies out hours earlier so it is 9 hours to crash site one and 11 hours to crash site two and 4 more hours of fireflight through the morning and something that i have read in no paper an absolute running of an iroquois gauntlet back to the base with their wounded no more prisoners they had gotten them out early and their dead and donovan or cliffs body to get back to the main u n compound or the airport an unbelievable 15hour firefight let me go over the rest of the slides here is the crash site of the september 25 helicopter let me hold this very steady and point to the helicopter you can see that it is almost melted my argument with the army these guys that i dearly respect was if we can spend millions and i mean millions of dollars and have 50 or 60 people on full payroll at the pentagon looking for a tooth in vietnam and that is important i do not say that in a demeaning way i have seen a casket with nothing but a tooth in it i said do the parents know yes sir we learned the hard way do they accept it yes sir here is the dental records and a spectrograph look at that gold inlay that matches i said it sure satisfies me no wonder the parents agree and they would bury that respectfully in some cemetery around middle america if they can get a tooth i said why can you not go into this crash site right here and get those remains and a twostar general who has the responsibility on this said to me congressman i am convinced by good men who i trust including a classmate of mine thomas montgomery that we will get in one hell of a firefight i said you mean on the perimeter where you allowed me to fly over yes sir we cant even go near the olympic hotel and the two helicopters shot down on the third the third one being destroyed at newport because we know that is a death trap but even on the perimeter if we were to land and try to show you that helicopters remains or this humvee in the middle of the street where four men died and i just got off the phone 30 minutes ago with jody pearson and she said to correct something the army did not tell her that they buried that humvee out of respect to the four mps that died there she said a soldier who went over after her husband who knew her husband keith he told her it had been buried so i have to apologize anything i indicated last week that the army should not have given that information out if it was not true the army did not do it a sergeant probably saw the humvee buried from january another one from july where men were wounded and one died they maybe got to those before this thing heated up and buried those out of respect by the way i thought my overhead shot might be a shadow of the burned debris and burned tires but then i took it from an angle and this shows you that that is the full humvee you cannot get there with a flatbed and 10 m1 tanks without the danger of taking more casualties and yet i call it an evil fountain or memorial in the middle of a major intersection downtown and the hand of this young door gunner i am sorry i did not get his name he was the first air on the ground he called it he landed right in front of all these burned out trucks by the way there are pillboxes on all these buildings around he landed right there jumped out of his helicopter

television on cspan and i saw the empty seats and i thought well i am never going to do that and now here i am but i want to explain to people that first of all there are people in the gallery i am talking to you all too because we are all citizens here but this thing is that important what we have as an opportunity tomorrow is going to be monumental as far as the people of america are concerned as it relates to spending cuts i get in my office tons and tons of communications on spending cuts first taxes later we cannot have a replay of what we had in 1990 there is no reason for us to think that we can tax our way into prosperity no nation has ever done it i get that time and time again now what has come before us in this house or what might come before us depending on this rules decision is the oppo tunity for us to take leadership in this body among the committees and in our personal office operations to cut expenses by 25 percent now when you hear that being said what we are talking about is we take what was last years expenses and we just knock 25 percent off we are not doing it all the way across the board which was my approach at first but we have kind of gotten a bunch of people together and we are doing it selectively so we are fixing those things that are duplication services and are not necessary and we are saying zero to those and others we are keeping at 100 percent but the bottom line is 25 percent would be cut from this budget from the budget of the house of representatives for the coming year now what this means is a certain amount of dollars and you have heard people mention that but more than that it is going to be an element of leadership i want to tell a little story from a man in arkansas about a man named sam walton he built the largest most successful retail operation in the world on the basis that he did it first that he did everything that there was he fixed bicycles he waited on customers he put the inventory in his shop and he learned it and his employees knew that mr sam would do it if they did not do it now what we do in this congress is we sit up here and we say okay we are going to have some cuts because that is what you all want but we are going to have it cut from every other area except our own we cannot answer the question as to why in the world we are not cutting our own expenses when we face the american people we can answer it around here when we are talking to colleagues and we are talking this fraternity talk that goes on here and we can say that is not wise but when someone says we cannot cut the expenses up here in congress by 25 percent ask them why they may say well it is better that we cut 14 percent it is better that we cut 5 percent ask them for whom is it better and that is what we have now mr sams example do it yourself first and that is leadership if we are going to have shared sacrifice let us do it from the top down and that is what is behind this rules bill that is going to come up if we vote on it tomorrow it is going to be a great day that is why i take this time here to talk to an empty chamber but i know it is not empty out there in america because you all are crying for us to do what is right i want to say the legislative branch has in its greed increased its spending by 5 percent every year for 15 years so if we do nothing we are going to be increasing because of the appetite that is here it is like a carnivorous plant it just keeps growing and building and growing and building and because of it we have so many excesses our president my former governor and now our president supports efforts to make meaningful congressional spending reductions that is what he says and i think we can follow that we need to do this as i said so that we can say to the american people yes we will sacrifice and yes we will give the leadership what i am not convinced of is that these people here who are voting against this bill or who might vote against it think there id a life after spending cuts i cannot imagine what we would do if our nation operated like we operate here where we have got this fear or neurosis about spending cuts and what might follow so what i am saying is i am looking forward to the debate tomorrow if we can have it if we cannot have the debate the debate on whether or not the american people will get the 25percent cut leadership out of this

i was just going to point out that is going to do any good i do not know as i understand it the debate that has what it is going to cost gone on here we are trying to stop the i have those same concerns on the sins of the past there is no question other side i also feel that the real we asked for a huge amount of infor problem needs to be solved at the bormation from school districts today der not in the field of education school lunch programs and others we i have a real hard time with it but are also working overtime with school as was discussed a minute ago govdistricts to try to reduce that paper ernor wilson has asked for 3 7 billion work to reduce those costs so we can because of the illegal immigration imtake that money and put it into pact it is a federal mandate we manlunches or services or teaching date on the states that they pay for it we cannot just say because we are just like we are trying to legislate that already doing that we can just add a we mandate apayment to cover the little bit more i think that is the pur cost of this paperwork pose of the debate that is going on the problem is 3 7 billion a year if here we can stop illegal immigration we do from this reauthorization which has not have to worry about doing it here been 5 years since we have done it if in the field of education we can take members do not want unfunded man 3 7 billion and apply it to those areas dates then they have to come up with into education and law enforcement ways to provide that funding we can and rest of it by stopping it at the bornot just say this is additive we are der i think that is the real area that we need to take a look at i want to stop all illegal immigration coming in whether it is the chinese boat people whether it is the irish which i am a member of or whether it is across the border of mexico the only way to do that i think is to stop totally those services but that should not rest in the education field however all the other areas law enforcement where we have as the gentleman from indiana said about 25 percent it is actually about 132 percent of our felons are illegal aliens but we do not fund that we know that number it is a hard number and we can ask the government for funds in the field of afdc we know that number and we can do it but in the field of education when the state asks for help because of the impact just like impact aid in military when the state asks for the numbers of illegals so that we can get the funding out of the federal government for that impact on the states we cannot give them an accurate number my problem with the rohrabacher amendment one it is an unfunded mandate which i would like to see it funded but we cannot appropriate it unless we authorize it first or they will call for a point of order later on so it is darned if you do and darned if you dont the whole point is my wife is a principal we take a birth certificate we take an address and we take a phone number and we do not ask the kids the parents fill that out when the parent fills that out you put block no 4 on there are you a legal resident of the united states that does not take a whole lot of paperwork or a whole lot of dollars to do you cannot use that information by law with the ins so you cannot verify it i do not know if it is going to do any good or not that is what my problem is on both sides of this trying to weigh in my own mind whether it is a good thing to do i do not know if we are going to get accurate funds but i think we need to stand up in all the committees and make a point first of all we are dealing with illegal immigrationillegal immigration that impacts us 2 billion across the united states we can do a lot with that money if we stop that type of immigration we are going to not only help taxpayers but we are going to help the programs that we are so deficient in the money in education in law enforcement in health care and the rest of it the perfecting amendment i would hope that the members would support the gentleman from california has 600 new border patrolmen at the border they have lights they have roads that is where we need to stop illegal immigration my friend the gentleman from california and i will sit down and talk they will support those kinds of initiatives do we do it in education the second amendment of the gentleman from california i oppose why because he is going to ask that the federal government not give the schools money but yet the school counts it by the number of faces there and if they do not get the number of faces there they cannot get the money again governor wilson is going to have to pay for it and he does not have the money to do that so i would oppose the second amendment of the gentleman from california mr"],

suddenly for this bill with all this gray hair i remember back even when we had this bill up before this was not a good idea so that is the first part but now i walk in on this debate where they are attacking the other gentleman from texas as being soft on congress the gentleman from texas is the one who in both cloakrooms usually 24 hours on day everybody is beating up on because i know johnny bryant if there is one thing he is not it is soft on congress this is the man who has been leading all sorts of reforms out there that members love to hate sometimes but to accuse him of being soft on congress in this bill it is really bard to keep from giggling as i hear it it doesnt pass the giggle test i guess is what i am trying to say now let us talk about some of these things yes indeed the bryant amendment puts members of congress explicitly under the independent counsel law it does that unfortunately there is no truth in political debate we have got the truth in advertising so one can say things about toothpaste and they better be true or one can sue but on political debate one can say anything about a bill and it does not have to be true but let me say the bryant amendment and anybody who knows his background knows that this would not be an oversight he allows the attorney general to invoke the independent counsel law this is appropriate discretion there are unitedstates attorneys all over america that can move out and go after members of congress in a vigorous way and have done so if there have been unitedstates attorneys that have been shy in doing this i want to know who they are i cannot think of any that have been intimidated by this nor can i think of any attorney generals that have been intimidated by this i really see this as kind of a delaying tactic there are different rules sometimes for congress unfortunately that came out of the constitution there are many of us trying to change that separate branches of government are not allowed to police the other branch we cannot go over to the court across the street and start telling them how to run their personnel system and they are not supposed to come over here and we are not supposed to go to the executive branch and they are not pupposed to come over there so we have toset up our own policing systems and we have been trying to do that and we have got to put more and more teeth in it believe me their is no one around here that wants more teeth in these things than i do excongresswoman lynn martin and i used to run around with a bill here all the time trying to get members on it trying to get them moving on house fair employment practices and other such things members would always run for the door a lot of the members who give speeches i must say as i have been listening to this debate i have found it a little humorous i think the real trick is to look at the bill and why it is needed i salute the gentleman from texas and how hard he has worked on this if members look at watergate and i an old enough and have been around here long enough to remember watergate this got started because archibald cox got interfered with he had all of that turbulence all of that commotion i am pleased the other side now agrees that we need this even though we let it run out because we could not get the votes in the last house session oh goodness it looks like we are going to get the votes now but let us move on and let us get this going let us get this independent counsel out there so that there can be these investigations members are covered yes we can also be covered by the unitedstates attorneys yes we are covered by the unitedstates house committee on standards of official conduct which has not been shy either and the house committee on standards of official conduct cannot try the supreme court and it cannot try members of the executive and they have their ethics and they do not try us that is they there are different things now i know we are not under osha we are bringing in every dead cat we can think of we are not under osha we are not under this we are not under that well we should be i agree we should be but that is not the issue here the issue here is how does the independent counsel bill work visavis members of congress it gives many many bites out of the apple i think it says that members of congress are going to be as vigorously pursued as anybody else and probably much more so and believe me if somebody had some real concrete ideas to be even more so i am sure the gentleman from texas would take them because the one thing he has been in the forefront of is trying to make this place absolutely squeeky clean and to rebuild this institution and to rebuild the trust and dignity that he thinks members should give it and i do too i

be able to cosign and come to the well and recognize all al has done everything said about him of course including the great stone face is true i can say as one who served with al 4 years i was the nominally the chair and al was nominally the ranking member of our subcommittee on government operations government information justice and agriculture but i think we ran it as a team and i got to know al very very well what i appreciate about al is al was really the only one crazy enough to go to the upper huallaga valley in peru not once but twice with me when we decided to go and see how some of our efforts to interdict drugs and to stop the growing of coca were going we really had not had too many i think we took them by surprise they had not had too many members show up in that particular area and so what i appreciated about al was the first thing i think it is the former marine as we flew over the andes in an old plane and then flew up into the upper huallaga valley al noticed the condition of the equipment which was pretty bad and he got pretty upset about that and when he returned to the united states al personally made it his personal mission to get the equipment upgraded including the helicopters the communications equipment and some of the other stuff which was pretty shabby and not only with the peruvians military using it and the peruvian police but our own drug enforcement agents as well as other united states employees and so al succeeded when we went back a year later that equipment was significantly updated i think a lot of the tribute goes to al mccandless al and i were an incredible team we went into bolivia on one of our missions and the dea and the bolivian army had saved up all the coca paste that they had been able to get in their raids for i think at least several weeks it was pretty impressive they packed it together they called all the worlds press together they were going to give al and me the opportunity to set this ablaze to show what coordination could do well we coordinated very well i forget whether we had one torch or two the torch was soaked in gasoline and other flammable fuel as was the interdicted contraband the only thing we managed to set ablaze was ourselves the entire footage for cnn and the bolivian national television is al and i trying to run out of this ring of flame that we had set all around ourselves they actually had soldiers come in to get the rest of it going that was the kind of teamwork al and i put together we made two trips that was something else that impressed me so much about al just for the record because it is so important that the record shows that some people think these were junkets we flew 12 hours in the hold of a c130 the only person i could talk into going again was al mccandless knowing the conditions and all but al went we landed we went to peru twice that way and flew back twice that way i like to sayand i hope gail understandsthat al and i used to dine by candlelight because in lima the shining path guerillas had a custom a routine they always blew the electric pylons up early in the morning usually about 5 30 or 6 00 and again in the evening just like clockwork you could count on losing electric power i remember several breakfasts and dinners that al and i had by candlelight as a tribute to the shining path guerillas effectiveness there are a couple of things that i do want to call specific attention to concerning al i think he knows this but if not i really want him to what impressed me about al was he called it straight about everybody we one time had a situation with one ofthe government agencies under the previous administration under the republican administration we thought we had caught them doing less than they should i forgot the details of it i do remember that there were some glaring errors so rather thanwe thought it would be best al and i agreed that it would be best to invite the administrator of that particular division in to talk with them and see what could be worked out to be honest with you i thought well this would be kind of a dicey thing i wonder if some punches would get pulled on the minority side when the guy walked out he asked who was the democrat and who was the republican because it was al mccandless who had held him to account in tougher language that i had been using what i said was there is something wrong here al made sure it was addressed that is what gained al i know on our side of the aisle the affection the true affection and loyalty of the staff and members alike i saw that repeated time after time whether it was trips to peru in hearings or in questions asked whether it was in dealing with administration officials finally in closing i would say i do not know anyone who worked harder to make things right no matter where the chips fell i can remember another situation a tragedy in als district where a death was caused by a highspeed chase of some federal officials al pulled no punches he wanted to get to the bottom of it more importantly he wanted7 to make sure that kind of thing did not happen again i consider the 4 years that i had working with al some of the highlights of my time in the house i will miss the opportunity very very much to work with him i wish al and gall the very best i just want to say to the gentleman from california that i thank"],

people need to consider as they look at this reconciliation bill that the president has brought forward i think what the gentleman said about the necessity of deficit reduction is absolutely correct in my view the deficit is a dagger pointed at the economic heart of this country and after 12 years of inaction on the deficit it is now time that we have to take the responsibility for dealing with the deficit in my view we had institutional irresponsibility for 12 years that produced a 4 trillion debt we now have the chance and we are at the crossroads where we have to take the responsibility and lead toward a conclusion which will bring this deficit under control a lot of people are saying that there are not enough spending cuts in the plan i think i may be wrong but i think this is the largest spending cut proposal that we have ever seen the gentleman set out the kind of cuts we are looking at agricultural entitlement cuts 3 billion federal workers 11 billion as the gentleman said there are 30 specific cuts in medicare and medicaid that reduce the deficit by 556 billion 11 billion in federal administrative costs 2 2 billion streamlining education programs 1 billion out of highway demonstration projects and 53 billion in veterans program cuts nobody likes to talk about cuts one of my problems in discussing this bill is that everybody is for cuts in general but nobody wants to talk about cuts in specific that has been our problem for the last 12 years people want to talk about a balanced budget amendment or they want to talk about a cap on entitlements or they want to talk about some other process gimmick the grammrudman or grammlatta or some other gizmo that is going to solve our problems the truth is there is no solution to the budget problem unless there are specific suggestions of cuts and that is what president clinton has had the courage to do and what the committees of the congress here have brought to the floor are specific recommendations for cuts nobody likes taxes i hate taxes i wish we did not have to have one tax but if we are going to have taxes as part of the solution and i think we must because the cuts are deep indeed then the taxes that have been presented are the fairest taxes we have seen for over 12 years as the gentlemans chart shows the taxes are taxes on the wealthiest people in the country this is not soaktherich we are not after rich people we do not want to do anything to harm rich people we want more rich people in this country but the wealthy like everybody else have to pay their fair share and the chart the gentleman shows right next to him shows that under the 1990 budget agreement that we negotiated with george bush the poorest people in the country were bearing the worst part of the burden and the richest people the lowest part of the burden under the clinton plan on top it is the highest people that are taking the highest burden the chart to my right shows again 66 percent share of the taxes for people over 200 000 75 percent of the taxes come from people over 100 000 a lot of people are saying well they do not like this tax or that tax or the other tax fine we have said tell us the alternative in spending cuts that will take care of that tax people want to get very general then they do not want to be specific we have got to be specific about the spending cuts we have an alternative in the other body where members republicans and democrats have come up with an alternative the problem i see with the alternative is that it is more of the same from the past it is another budget from the past it is a budget that says let us not tax the people who are the wealthiest in the country so much let us give them a capitalgains break it says let us lower the taxation for medicare on those folks who make over 100 000 a year let us do other things that will help people at the very top and let us increase taxes on people at the bottom by lowering the earnedincome credit which is the most important thing for progressivity in the clinton budget that is in this reconciliation bill and yes let us cut social security cola let us cut medicare and let us cut medicaid again i am not for that and i think if you put that alternative on the floor you would not get many votes for it on either side of the aisle if you it in the other body i suspect it might be the same we have problems in this country today with being specific about what we want to do president clinton has been specific he has put a concrete proposal in front of us and our committees have brought that proposal forward it is a good proposal we are at crossroads in the country either we deal with this problem that is eating us alive or we do not now people say gee i am against that btu tax it is going to cost me in the third year and remember it is phased in but in the third year for an average family of four it is going to cost us 15 or 17 a month what they are not looking at is that if we can get this proposal through interest rates will be held down over the next 3 years to an extent where they will get much more benefit than the costs of the btu tax jobs will be created the recovery will go forward we will not fall back into another recession we will begin to get economic growth in this society we do not do a deficitreduction plan as an academic exercise it is not to make somebody in a university feel good who studies economics it is to get concrete results in the economy in the country we are trying to create jobs we are trying to hold inflation down we are trying to hold interest rates down and we are trying to stay out of another recession that we have been in now for 3 years i was at home the other day with the unemployment people and a fellow who has been in the unemployment office for 30 years said he has never seen recovery like this he said congressman there are no jobs he said i can get minimumwage jobs people who want to work at mcdonalds we have got plenty of those what we do not have are good jobs i do not know how we get good jobs created in this society unless we do something real about the deficit unless we stand up finally and say here is a program that will get the deficit down over the next 5 years not smoke and mirrors not another gimmick not another gizmo not another promise and not another illusion something that works and is real that is what we are talking about with this plan and i believe it is fair i believe it is balanced and i think we have to show the leadership and the responsibility to go forward and pass this plan get it through the senate put it on the presidents desk as quickly as possible and move this country and this economy in a positive direction"], [0.5370343327522278, 0.4629656672477722, 1, "i thank the gentleman for yielding this time to me this is a nonpartisan debate i want to emphasize that it can be very useful in throwing light on the circumstances surrounding the liberation of haiti the debate can make an immeasurable contribution to the making of foreign policy for this hemisphere in the future it is not partisan because there are democrats who disagree with the actions being taken in haiti as well as republicans we would like the american people to listen very seriously to the principlesiinvolved here to the comparison of this particular action in haiti with other actions that have been taken in this hemisphere grenada panama it is very important because if we want to decide suddenly it is wrong to do it this way it was wrong to do it that way in grenada panama and maybe we will set some standards for the future that all presidents will follow in setting those standards i think we should consider very seriously the following this is not an invasion of haiti this is a liberation of the people of haiti it is not even an intervention because the head of state of haiti the democraticallyelected president of haiti has been here in washington for the last 2 to 3 years we took back and are taking back the government that was elected by thepeople of haiti the democraticallyelected government that is not an invasion that does not compare to grenada grenada is a little island with 100 000 people at that time we moved in there overnight with something like 17 000 troops for an island of 100 000 people you know there was no discussion there were no negotiations with the leaders of grenada whether you like them or not at least there should have been some kind of negotiations there was no consultation with the united nations that is totally different from what happened in the case of haiti for 3 years for 3 years negotiations have gone on deliberations with respect to haiti the use of force was undertaken only after all other efforts had failed it was only as a last resort this is a liberation not an invasion not an intervention this is military assistance for a democratic ally in this hemisphere when we liberated paris we did not call that an invasion when we liberated france we did not call that an invasion they were being held captive an allied occupied nation the greatest riskiest undertaking was the landing at normandy and that was undertaken to liberate a continent to liberate europe as my colleagues know we did that because it was necessary to save democracy in europe because it had a bearing on our own nation a liberation of an occupied allied nation this is a hostage rescue operation we had hostages seven million people in haiti were being held hostage by an armed forces of 7 000 but that armed forces had all the guns they had all the armor they had all the equipment that armed forces had been trained listen it was trained by the united states of america most of the officers were trained at fort benning ga the haitian army is a creation of the united states of america general powell said in a debriefing at the white house after the negotiations that on the walls of the military compound in haiti there are the pictures of all the commanders of the haitian armed forces and the first two people on that wall are american marines white american marines who commanded the first armies of haiti they established the army we cannot say that haiti does not matter to us we created the armed forces we have dominated haiti commercially politically militarily since haiti came into existence that has been the history as we have always been concerned about any nations in this hemisphere suddenly we cannot become unconcerned we have to be concerned about haiti also because of the large number of refugees that have come from haiti in an attempt to get into this country we cannot turn our back on refugees we are party to international conventions we have a long history of accepting refugees we have done things to the haitians that were never done to anybody else especially laws that have been erected in order to keep the haitians out in order to stop our country from behaving in a most inhumane way in a totalitarian way it was necessary to resolve the conflict in haiti and allow a situation to exist in haiti where the people of haiti would want to stay at home and those who were outside would go back home as they will now they will go back home this is not an invasion and i say you can look at your television sets and see that its not an invasion were not an occupying army we are a liberating army the people have welcomed this liberating army they are jubilant that they can again breathe free as human beings who are not under the domination of a set of military criminals there wasnt an invasion not a declaration of war the action in haiti must not be compared to korea or vietnam or world war ii it must be compared to grenada to panama nicaragua we have a tremendous amount of military assistance we gave to the contras in nicaragua actions taken by the united states in this western hemisphere is what we are talking about let us decide how we are going to behave are we going to go it mlone in this hemisphere and not be concerned about all the other nations and to what extent shall we be concerned if criminals took over puerto rico tomorrow and puerto rico is a part of the united states but if criminals took over any island close to the united states tomorrow are we just going to turn our backs and say the criminals can have the island if they axe using the island for the transshipment of drugs axe we going to turn our back and say that they can continue to transship drugs into this country the great rationale for the invasion of panama was the transshipment of drugs into our big cities going through panama we have not even talked about the extent to which they have gone through haiti and the griminals who control haiti how they enrich themselves through the drug transshipment industry president clinton has acted with the noblest of motivations there was no political gain from going into a situation to liberate a people who can do nothing for him politically to liberate a people when the polls showed that they were not in favor of it to liberate a people when most of the members of congress were against it there was no political motivation here it was the noblest of motivation the kind of motivation that abraham lincoln had when he set the slaves free he had nothing to gain politically he was criticized around it everybody else opposed it when abraham lincoln acted to set the slaves free it was the right thing to do a great nation like the united states should use its power use its prestige to help the least of the nations among us and haiti is the least represents the least of the nations among us we have done the right thing in saving haiti from a group of military thugs who are holding the people of haiti hostage in order to set a good example for what we do in the future it ought to be an example which will guide foreign policy in the future we have more to fear from criminals now than we have to fear from communists or any other people or ideologists criminals are a major force throughout the world they are selling nuclear weapons into all kinds of activities and who knows when they will next take over a nation somewhere near us and we will have to act so let us proceed with a debate with the understanding that this is a new world order we have an armed forces that is already there what do they do in their spare time you know are the forces utilized here doing something they would not be doing on a training exercise this is like a huge training exercise not a single soldier has been killed yet not a serious casualty yet"],

tips funeral it was an incredibly moving experience to hear him and tips son i got to know tip in a very strange way i would like to share that with my colleagues if i could for just a second when i got here in 19761977 tip had just become speaker i was advised that a good way to learn how this place worked would be to go the whip meetingsdown in congressman brademus office which is my office now and i felt as a new freshman really uncomfortable and out of place and wondering what this place was all about i would wander down there and i would bring a newspaper and kind of sit in the corner and tip would be sitting up front and he would also be reading the newspaper he had that big stogie in his mouth and it occurred to him at one point that we were reading the same part of the newspaper we were both reading the sports section eventually he figured out that i was reading the same part of the sport section he was reading and that was what the spreads were on the football games that were coming up on saturday so we got to talking about whether bc was favored or whether iowa was favored or michigan was favored or who do you like in this game who do you like in that game we developed a relationship based on something that was very common but satisfying to both of us after about a year of this i got up enough nerve to ask tip to come to my district to do a little bit of campaigning for me he agreed to do it so when he flew in i did not know how to meet him because i did not have a big car my father did not have a big car and so we had this big debate on how to pick tip oneill up at the airport so my father said to me why dont you just get stan shultz to pick him up i said okay stan shultz is the undertaker in town he buried my father and my family good friends sure enough stan shows up with the hearse big cadillac and we picked tip up he actually got a big kick out of that on the way to the fundraiser my dad who loves sports and is as fond of the ponies as tip was occasionally got to talking about horse racing and i was sitting in the back seat with my father tip was in the front seat withstan and they were reminiscing about politics and horse racing and all of a sudden tip was trying to remember the name of this great horse that won the kentucky derby in 1970something 1972 he said it was a canadian horse i do not know horses from beans but for some reason the name of northern dancer popped into my head and i said it was northern dancer mr speaker and he turned around in the front seat of the car and he looked at me as if to say you are on the right track young man and we had a wonderful close relationship for all these many years i think to me the story that best sums up what tip oneill was all about comes from frank minelli back in his boston neighborhood frank minelli was also known as frank the barber and he is the guy who cut tips big white mop for over 40 years one time tip invited frank and his wife to come to washington to visit and he would take them around on a tour as they were touring the capitol and walking around a colleague of tips came up to him and said tip i have got this important big city mayor waiting in my office i would like you to come and meet him tip looked at the congressman then he looked at frank and his wife and he turned back to the congressman with the big city mayor waiting and said not now i have got more important people that story i think says just about all one needs to say about tip as so many members have so eloquently said before me this afternoon because to tip oneill ordinary people ordinary citizens were the most important part of his life of his constituency he as the gentleman from massachusetts has pointed out and as the gentleman from massachusetts and others he was not there to fight for the rich and the powerful they have got enough friends around here to do that for them he figures they could pretty well fend for themselves tip was here to fight for the frank minellis of the world he paid attention to ordinary people he listened to them he worked for them and he gave them a voice when they had no other tip called his book man of the house but i have always thought that a more accurate title would have been man of the people because he dedicated his life to leaving that ladder of opportunity up for all americans to climb and he was so proud to talk about how he was present and active in government when the american middie class was made when we think about it he was quite an incredible part of the history and the dynamics of modern history to have been present in this society particularly when the middle class was created not with his finger in the wind but with his feet planted firmly in stone he never wavered on those basic principles for ordinary folks in the months ahead as we head into this nations difficult times crime welfare health care job creation i hope we can all carry on where our tip oneill left off and dedicate ourselves to improving security in the lives of all americans if we do that in the end that will be our highest tribute that we can pay"], [0.5369144678115845, 0.4630855321884155, 1, "first i want to respond to one thing the gentleman from new york said that i am sure even he would admit was mistaken if he thinks about it when he said this was mary poppins paternalism if it was anything it would have had to have been mary poppins maternalism i am sure the gentleman from new york on sober reflection would agree with me i want to talk about this terrible procedure we just heard about where an amendment that is the base text of the bill is offered why that is such an outrageous procedure that the last time i heard of it it was in the armed services bill on the question of gays in the military and it was supported by the republicans that we do it that way that was the amendment offered by the gentleman from missouri the fact is that this republican preference for open rules is the most occasional burning passion i have ever seen i have rarely seen people so intermittently zealously committed to a principle which they are prepared to abandon on alternate days of the week because i will tell you that during the past 12 years that i have been here i have fought against republicans time and again because i wanted amendments to tax bills and trade bills when we dealt with the question of fast track on nafta one of the great issues that drove this issue and the gentleman from michigan had an amendment that he wanted to make in order dealing with the terms under which nafta was debated the committee on rules would not let it happen and the overwhelming majority of the republicans were there voting with the committee on rules voting on the committee on rules to keep it out if people wanted a rule that we are always going to have open rules ok but let us not have this inc6nsistency masking itself as burning principle second let us talk about what would have happened if we had an open rule first of all i think the amendment offered by the gentleman from pennsylvania would have been out of order we have two arguments on the republican side first you are spending too much money on the independentcoun sel issue and second you are not spending nearly enough money on the independentcounsel issue because right now about 60 people are automatically covered because they are that close to the president than it is inconceivable to think that there would be objectivity with members of congress we said there may be a problem and there may not be and we will leave it up to the attorney general they would increase by a factor of 1 000 percent the number of people covered automatically it would go from 60 to 600 there are 60 of them and then there would be 550 of us let us assume that we are twice as honest as they are that would cost five times more if you assume we are half as honest as they are that would cost 20 times more because when you go from 60 covered people to 600 covered people you diamatically increase the cost i do not believe my friend from pennsylvania bad cbo score this i think he is in violation of the paygo because this will inevitably cost more money unless you are prepared to vouch for the insistence that no member of congress will ever again be investigated and i do no think so iwish but i do not think so so the fact is that we are talking about a rule which presents every important issue and i have been dealing with the independentcounsel statute as a member of the committee since i got here every important issue will be before the floor of the house why is it not a totally open rule in addition to trying to help out our friend the gentleman from pennsylvania you heard it here 10 amendments are in order 3 of them noncontroversial en bloc from the chairman 7 other amendments of some controversy and then they said 2 were turned down by this one and 2 from this one 7 from this one and 1 from that one there were 27 amendments offered take 27 amendments debate each one of them for a couple of hours have a rollcall and you do not get a bill in time and that might suit some people because on the whole the republican party has been trying to slow this bill down in fact in the senate 14 republicans including the assistant leader of the republicans in the senate the gentleman from wyoming voted to keep member coverage the way it is in the bryant amendment and the justification for having the bryant amendment and the gekas amendment this way is this it is to prevent the distortion that might come from people who would say people voting for the bryant position were against member coverage members are covered here there have been four republicans to be attorney general since the independentcounsel statute was adopted adopted by the way by democrats under a democratic president not ed meese not william french smith not richard thornburgh and not william barr no republican attorney general not one of the four republican attorneys general that served under the independentcounsel bill have used his unquestioned unchallenged authority to appoint an independent counsel any one of the four of them anytime a member of congress was accused of something could have invoked the independentcounsel provision they indicted republicans they indicted democrats they were not holding back that i can see after four republican attorneys general under two republican presidents consistently said we do not need the independentcounsel statute for members of congress i am hard pressed to believe wholly in the importance of making that drastic expensive change right now"], [0.5367168486118317, 0.46328315138816833, 1, "my friends and colleagues it is more difficult to get more partisan than i am as a democrat but there comes a time when our nation is facing a serious problem that it just shatters the walls of party labels i do not know when it happened or where i was when it happened but somehow the crisis as it relates to drug addiction and the problems that occur when we ignore it it seems as though somewhere the war has been won or it has gone away or that certainly no part of the congress is prepared to deal with it oh we talk about violence we talk about crime we talk about our health bill but if you talk about all of those things why do you not stop and think why are we having so much crime seventy percent of the people in those jails are there because of drug addiction wlby are we having so much hemorrhage in our health bills because most of the people that are in these hospitals are in there with gunshot wounds addiction children being born addicted to drugs paying 5 000 to 7 000 a day for each and every one of these cases yet when someone comes and says can we help do something about it and they come to the congress you see what we have done some of us republicans and democrats have worked around the clock working with this administration and not just this one whether it was nixon or whether it was carter or whether it was ford or whether it was reagan we tried to work together not as democrats and not as republicans but if we are having a war against crime why are we cutting back on the fbi and the drug enforcement administration why is it every time we turn around to fight the war we cannot get the bullets and the ammunition now all of a sudden we are asking for 152 million we are asking for it because if there is anyone that has been involved in the war against drugs it has been our friends in colombia the days are over now when they used to point their fingers at us and say the reason why the cocaine is thriving the reason why the opium crops are thriving the reason why marijuana is thriving is because of american demand no it is more serious than that now as an effort of the partnerships that the united states has made with the organization of american states they have seen that drug addiction and drug trafficking have threatened the fragile democracies that we have in this hemisphere and at a time when things are beginning to work at a time when they are asking us to continue to assist them so that we cannot just depend on the elimination of the crops that will never never happen unless we reduce consumption but we have to fight it in education and you cannot name one program that is designed in education to prevent our kids from going on drugs we have to do something about rehabilitation and not one of you know of a federal program that supports it that can effectively say they rehabilitate our kids we have to do something about crime and what do we do three strikes and you are out mandatory sentences executions is that stopping crime is that stopping drug addiction there is no border between burma and thailand as we see the heroin pouring into these united states and what are they doing in districts throughout this country they are giving away the heroin on the street so our children will become addicted to it and what are they asking for 152 million what do we lose every year as a result of doing nothing with drugs 500 billion when you take into consideration how many people we lock up how many people we keep in the hospitals how much we lose in productivity i am not saying that we can win this war but if you ask for 152 million for the international narcotic force in the state department it was not republicans who asked for it it was not democrats who asked for it it was the president of these united states asking that our credibility abroad be kept intact and where do we ask to take it away from we ask to take it away from the soviet union now i do not know how any of you feel about communists and maybe you forget quickly but i fought against the communists and i have to say if they can redeem themselves for 52 million why not give the 52 million to the communities that never were communist in the first place they are asking for the same hopes the same aspirations as the former soviet union they are out of work they are out of hope they are relying on drugs why can we not say america first it is a simple thing to me now i know that as a democrat i am going against the rules we are not supposed to ever defeat the previous question but then i have to decide what is more important the previous question the democratic tradition or the millions of kids that can honestly say that this country and this congress has not done a darn thing to allow them to believe that we ever can do it right i ask my democratic friends to look at this when the previous question is defeated we are not turning the bill over to the republicans we are just asking for one amendment this is not breaking any budget if some of your constituents are supporting the soviet union and it is going to defeat you at the polls then believe me you are excused but if on the other hand you believe that the money is better spent keeping these drugs out of your districts i ask you to defeat the previous question let the rule come back with this one sole amendment and let us get on with the peoples business"], [0.5356771945953369, 0.4643228054046631, 1,

of ef the american people i will vote to forts to reduce nonauthorizedand ear make in order the freshman true linemarked spending sometimes referred item veto and to do what the public to as pork barrel sometimes erro sent us here to do make a change and neously but that is the kind of spend change this place ing that folks want us to address so i ask members to vote no on this this bill is a genuine effort to focus rule it does not represent a true lineon making our spending decisions more item veto and it does not represent prudent i disagree with the speaker i change think this is a profound change in the mr derrick for purway we have done business here poses of debate only i yield 3 minutes there are some problems in this bill to the gentleman from texas opposes this rule today

has wanted and i have bill may not be perfect but it is good wanted but now we find that he opit is good enough that we should pass it poses the rule today and let the american people my good friend and colleague the know that we are serious about making gentleman from south carolina andi have added to the origiture nal legislation which i introduced several perfecting amendments on our amendment i consistently argue for rules which allow open debate on issues and an opportunity for the house of representatives to honestly work its will there have been a number of times in fact once very recently when i have been disappointed that the rules have not allowed a full airing of legislation of opinions and an opportunity to cast votes on leading alternative approaches therefore i appeared before the rules committee yesterday and asked that they make all germane amendments requested in order and they did today we are going to debate the issue of lineitem veto and those who want lineitem veto will have an opportunity to vote on that issue today the issue of lineitem veto authority has been debated for manyyears and i have always opposed a straight lineitem veto based on my belief that it creates an imbalance in the balance of powers between the legislative and the executive branches i have found very appealing enhanced rescission authority which is what we bring today in the sprattstenholm amendment i believe that two issues and there are other issues are now getting mixed up the contract authority i think has appeal i think the taxing issue has appeal the gentleman from illinois will be able to offer his amendment to this issue today and we can debate it i believe that these issues belong in the debate and that is what we will do today my visceral reaction is that these issues should be included in rescission order but i have not yet explored nor have most of our colleagues on either side explored the pros and cons of addlng these issues today i am eager to hear others with greater constitutional and institutional expertise than i debate the nuances of including tax expenditures and contract authority in rescission authority i think it is highly likely that 2 years from now when we consider renewing this contract on this legislation that i will be prepared to vote for rescissions of this sort at this point however i do not believe the debate has matured to the point where we should be attaching these unexplored ideas to legislation which is likely to be signed into law many were rightfully concerned about minimal committee debate about this issue before it comes up today therefore when we look at the issue before us at this very moment the rule how can anyone say that it is not a fair and open rule when we get to debate the issue that is before us today and that is lineitem veto as proposed by the other side and the modified rescission order as proposed by those of us who have believed that that is the proper way to go vote for the

time by republicans and democrats in this house and in the other body under republican presidents and democratic presidents is posturing puff and rhetoric every member of this house has a speech that he or she goes home and gives to the rotary club or to the chamber of commerce or to local high school graduations about the danger of the deficit everyone here is against the deficit in theory and very very few people here are willing to go home and say they are ready to vote to take dollars out of their own district and their own state it is hard to do but our constituents want it done and tomorrow we have a chance to do that the other proposition that the american public understands very well if tonight we were to go to a fire hall or a diner or a restaurant or a senior citizens home across this country urban rural or suburban and ask this question i think we know what the answer would be the question is do you think the federal government could get along t10638 just fine with 95 cents of every dollar that it is spending right now do you think that we could just take 95 cents out of your pocket instead of a dollar and still make the trains run on time and still defend the borders and still inspect the meat and still light the washington monument at night people know there would be some sacrifice they know there would be some real change they understand that it is not all 500 toilet seats and mohair subsidies but they understand it could be done it has been done by city governments across america by corporations by churches by universities by synagogues by institutions across this country people have understood that they can make do with just a little less now the proposal offered by my friends mr kasich and mr penny does not do that it does not do

this plan says let us try to spend just 1 percent less than that over the next 5 years what a radical earthshaking unbelievable idea that is one penny one percent off of that and do you know what this plan does mr speaker it starts with us it says let us cut the funding for the president by 5 percent let us cut the funding for this congress by 7 5 percent let us cut the franking privilege the rule that says that we can send free mail to our constituents by 20 percent let us start here it cancels weapons systems it gets the government out of businesses it should not be in it terminates 11 boards and commissions it is just a start it is just a start and we are so close to accomplishing what it is that we want to accomplish before i finish tonight i would ask each of our colleagues to think about the thought process they went through last august as the whole country watched this chamber and the presidents economic plan teetered on the brink one vote away from success or failure our colleagues should ask themselves tomorrow or tomorrow in the middle of the night when i suspect that we will be voting on this proposal they should ask themselves this how many of our colleagues said i voted with president clintons plan for president clintons plan because it is a good start to cut the deficit but we must do more how many people went home to the rotary club or the high school graduation or the chamber of commerce or the editorial board and said that we must do more then how many people are like me who stood up and said i dont think raising taxes is the solution to our problem i think it is our problem and we should cut spending first how many of us said that before we cast a no vote last august i would submit to all of our colleagues if they made either of those arguments tomorrow is the time to stand and deliver tomorrow is the time to move beyond the happy rhetoric at the rotary club about balanced budget amendments and reducing spending and it is the time to act it is the time to do what city governments and churches and synagogues and small businesses and universities and hospitals across this country have done look in the mirror look at the bottom line and make some hard decisions we are very close to passing this bill very very close and its future hangs in the balance and it sits in the hands of those who are willing to be consistent and principled about their rhetoric if in august a member said i am with the president but we have to go further then tomorrow go further if a member said in august i am not with the president because i

about they say that yesterday was tax day and today is spend day that is not true because they lost yesterday because of the distortions that they tried to use they distorted it by saying this was the largest tax bill in history we can see it in the newspapers we can see it everywhere that the largest tax bill was under their hero ronald reagan in the early 1980s they talked about how terrible it was for retroactivity i agree i did not like it but i was in business in 1986 when we tried to use the irvestment tax credit that was passed then it was taken away 4 months later after we bought our assets and we could not find out about it the accountant said you do not have an investment tax credit even though you bought it in april they took it away in october so i am sorry you cannot use it this year in fact even the original income tax passed in 1917 was retroactive from the time it was passed we do not like retroactivity but they distorted every argument yesterday i can see they are

1992 tennessees exports to mexico totaled nearly 414 million making mexico the states second most important foreign market under nafta tennessees textile exports to mexico will be able to grow faster and most importantly strict rules of origin ensure that mexico will not be used as an import platform for asian textiles and fabrics president clinton has personally assured me that the administration will increase the customs budget by 15 million in order to enforce trade laws on textiles and apparel the administration also pledged to negotiate a 15yeal phaseout on textile quotas in the final talks of the uruguay round of the gatti in coming to a decision i also considered the serious consequences the defeat of nafta will have for unitedstates national interests the cold war is over and america cannot remain an economic superpower if it turns down the opportunity to develop the largest common market in the world the united states will be left with no effective responses to the regional trade strategies europe and japan are successfully employing to bolster their competitiveness unitedstates workers will be competing with one arm tied behind their back rejection of nafta could delay or lead to the collapse of the uruguay round of gatt trade talks the united states has the most to gain from the gat agreement but our main trading partners may refuse to offer politically difficult concessions if there is any doubt of congressional approval collapse of the round could spark a new round of world protectionism and a worldwide recession that would place millions of unitedstates jobs at risk a defeat of nafta will send disturbing messages to mexico and other latin american countries which have made political and economic reforms in recent years mexicos president salinas has taken important steps toward creating a freemarket economy over the past 5 years including a significant reduction in tariffs the united states has benefited from this through skyrocketing

not have any hope of getting electricity and later that mission was extended to cover telephone service as well the rea has been a tremendous unqualified success there is virtually no one in america today who does not have electricity and does not have telephone service yet the rea continues to live on the rea in 1944 began a program of making loans to telephone companies and electric cooperatives at what was then the treasury rate of interest which was believe it or not 2 percent per year that is a sobering thought to those of us who think we have reached nirvana at a 7percent treasury bond rate but the rea continues in 1993 to lend money at 2 percent and at 5 percent and at other rates that are well below the market rate for loans many of the borrowers of these loans are companies that simply do not need a taxpayer subsidy they are the utilities that serve vale and aspin and hilton head sc they are subsidiaries of major tele phone corporations that are listed on the new york stock exchange the program has simply gone on too long and the subsidies are simply unjustified now i recognize that in the process of drafting the reconciliation bill this year the agriculture committee has made a valiant effort to try to rationalize and modernize this program but it hasnot gone even as far as president clinton has asked president clinton made a special point of mentioning the rea in his budget address he pointed out that as a resident of arkansas he knew the importance of the rea but even in arkansas they had to make some sacrifices the president proposed that the most generous loan subsidy program of the rea be reduced to 25 million a year for 5percent loans to electric cooperatives another 25 million a year this year for loans to telephone companies 25 million and 25 million the bill before us has increased those loan levels by 100 million each so there is 125 million in the current legislation for 5percent loans to electric cooperatives and 125 million for subsidized loans at 5 percent to telephone companies my legislation would simply reduce those amounts to what the president asked for there are many of us who believe the rea has outlived its usefulness and should be abolished but this bill would not go anywhere near abolishing the rea it would not decapitate the rea it would not even give it a haircut it would just give it a light trim i think putting it in line with what the president asked is the least that we can do i believe that with the 25 million loan ceiling we would give an incentive for the rea to make sure that those

mexico and i said well they do have cars in mexico and their particular version of reality is wrong and i am just looking at this survey it was in the new york times yesterday out of 5 000 people and it was a survey in 42 unitedstates cities 53 percent of the households had a car 83 percent of them had color television 53 percent had phones 63 percent had vcrs 24 percent had compact disk players the problem we have faced in nafta is that our vision of mexico is greatly outdated in fact we have got an economy there to sell to they buy cars they buy vcrs and it is about time we started selling to them it is a fact that i think ought not to be lost and why it is important for us to sell it to themi thought maybe i could just share with my colleagues the facts i received from the tutt hill corp in tacoma wa and i just want to paraphrase it it is a fax for me it describes a joint venture of this cable craft vision they have a joint venture in mexico since 1976 and they entered into an agreement then and they had some operations not because mexican labor rates are low it was because it was the only way to get their goods into market and i just want to read to my colleagues one paragraph from keith clino i have never met mr clino about his business i got this unsolicited this gentleman is not even from my district he says if you pas nafta and eliminate the restrictions at the border we will sell our joint venture and ship completed products from our south carolina facility the results will be more consistent quality at a lower price for our mexican customers plus more
