the republican budget includes a deficit for 2006 of 372 billion and a deficit for 2007 of 348 billion these deficiti mean that under republican policies the five largest deficits in history will have occurred in five consecutive years over the next five years 20072011 the budget resolution calls for deficits totaling 1 1 trillion since this administration took office it has requested and the congress has provided four increases in the statutory debt ceiling totaling 3 trillion under this budget by 2011 the statutory debt will increase by another 2 3 trillion for a total increase of 5 3 trillion it will leave the statutory debt at a record level of 11 3 trillion the presidents reckless economic policies have doubled our nations debt further i am concerned by the amount of the debt that has been accumulated by foreign bank individuals and governments in 1980 17 percent of the federal debt held by the public was in foreign hands by 2006 45 percent of the debt held by the public was ovned overseas unfortunately this trend seems to be increasing rapidly during the past year approximately 90 percent of the debt we have accumulated has been purchased by foreign banks individuals and governments i support the representative john spratts alternative budget which would reach balance in 2012 the spraft budget also has smaller deficits than the republican budget and accumulates less debt by contrast the republican budget never returns to balance and even refuses to show how big its deficits will be after 2011 the spratt budget backs the twosided payasyougo paygo budget enforcement rules that require that the cost of any new mandatory spending or revenue legislation be fully offset during the 1990s twosided paygo rules played a critical role in turning record deficits to record surpluses the spratt budget also requires a separate vote to increase the debt limit and prohibits using fasttrack reconciliation procedures to make the deficit worse the republican budget cuts appropriations for domestic services by 9 4 billion relative to current services and by 3 2 billion below the level passed by republicans in the senate meanwhile the budget continues medicare subsidies close to 60 billion for managed care providers of medicare even though they are supposed to save medicare money not cost more the resolution also includes 228 billion over five years for additional tax cuts part of a 3 trillion tenyear republican tax cut agenda the republican resolution cuts appropriated funding for education and related programs below current services providing the same inadequate level as provided by the president for 2007 that repub ican level cuts funding for the department of education by 2 2 billion below last years comparable level and eliminates 42 education programs the spratt budget provides 4 6 billion more than the republican budget for education appropriations and over five years provides 45 3 billion more than the republican resolution the spratt budget rejects the deep cuts proposed by the republican budget and preserves programs such as vocational education perkins loans safe and drugfree schools state grants and the gearup college readiness program the spratt budget also makes a down payment on college affordability by cutting student loan interest rates after a temporary one year gain the republican budget after five years cuts funding for veterans health care by 6 0 billion below current services the spratt budget includes 6 0 billion more than the republican budget over five years for veterans health care the spratt budget also rejects the increase on health care fees on military retirees who are enrolled in tricare the republican budget asks additional sacrifices from those who have served and sacrificed for our country the spratt budget rejects the misguided republican policies and keeps our commitment to our veterans the republican budget cuts funding for health by 18 1 billion below current services over five years the same insufficient level provided by the president the republican level means cuts to priorities such as the centers for disease control 18 of 19 institutes at the national institutes of health and rural health activities the spratt budget provides 18 billion more over five years to fund health priorities cut by the republican budget including medical research at nih and graduate medical education for childrens hospitals the spraft budget also takes steps to address the problems with theimplementation of the medicare prescription drug benefit including extending the may 15 signup period through the end of year and protecting seniors from any enrollment penalties the spratt budget also takes steps to help the uninsured and creates a reserve fund to increase medicare payments to physicians which are currently scheduled to be cut for the environment and natural resources this republican budget imposes a 25 0 billion cut relative to current services over the next five years and imposes a 2 9 billion cut for next year alone this is the same level as the presidents budget which cuts funding for the environmental protection agency including the clean water state revolving fund the army corps of engineers and the national park service the house republican budget resolution actually makes the deficit worse offers no plan to bring the budget back to balance and adds to the growing burden of the national debt meanwhile the republican budget makes harmful cuts to critical services for the american people including education veterans services health and environmental protection i ask my colleagues to oppose this budget and support the spratt alternative budget"], [0.005264341831207275, 0.9947356581687927, 1, "thank you sir the bottom line is that we have a republican majority that rubber stamps everything that the administration hands to them they cant even put the paper on the desk fast enough before they rubber stamp it when you start talking about the fact that by the constitution we are supposed to carry out oversight that is not a value of the republican majority li 1915 oversight of what no see they are too busy taking care of the special interests you would think that some members were more concerned with trying to make sure that special interests got what they needed because we do not want to forget the k street project where you pay to play and you get access into this republican majority house so when you look at the rubberstamping of what has happened here i cannot help but have this stamp here because that is how we got here but what is very very unfortunate is the fact that we have ourselves in a situation in a fiscal situation that is going to take a generation almost to recover from we have ourselves in a situation in iraq we do not know how many years it may take for us to recover from that and i am using the presidents words now we have ourselves in a situation where the white house now wants to invite members over to have tea and cookies right now and trying to be niceynice to say we want to hear from you now but we have men and women caught in the crossfire and we have millions and billions of dollars that have been wasted and stolen in iraq i am going to say stolen because of the rubberstamp republican majority anything that the administration sends down how can we rubberstamp it matter of fact i think the republican majority walks around with a little mini rubber stamp in their pocket saying oversight this is the way you want it and how you want it the american people have to send a very strong message to this republican majority here in the congress that we have three branches of government for a reason not two branches of government that deals with legislation and policy but three branches we have the judicial branch that is separate and aside but when you look at the legislative branch we are supposed to carry out oversight only a couple of members of the republican majority actually gets that and tries to practice it but they are in a superminority and so the reason why we come to the floor is to shed light on the lack of oversight when it was a democratic house and a democratic white house there was oversight cajl bill clinton up and ask him i think we know that republican majority the reason why you are going to see people around here scratching and fighting and begging and trying to do anything and throwing out the sods and trying to get press releases out because the white house is very very concerned that they will no longer be able to send legislation to the unitedstates house of representatives and that it passes through committees that may have a half a meeting on it and come to the floor not allowing democrats to do anything to improve the legislation because they are too busy rubberstamping the process and it will disrupt that it is all about power and influence and i can tell you right now the republican majority has gone too far with this because that is the reason why we are in the situation we are in now and they are known they have to shake it and they know it and they deserve the rubber stamp because that is what they have been doing since the president has been in the white house i am coming to ms jacksonlee i just want to give you a perfect example of what happens in a rubberstamp congress exhibit a how can you borrow 1 05 trillion in 4 years i do not even know how that can be achieved in 4 years the republican majority has handed president bush he cannot do it on his own we have the republican congress right under him from 2001 to 2005 1 05 trillion now here is the other kicker that comes in and with interest fortytwo presidents 224 years 224 years 42 presidents were only able to borrow 1 01 trillion i rest my case on that i rest my case on the fact that the republican majority has given the bush white house everything they wanted on the backs of the american people the special interests got what they wanted the billionaires got what they wanted"], [0.005289196968078613, 0.9947108030319214, 1, "a track record a pattern of those who have made youthful indiscretions in their lives need it be on credit need it be some sort of criminal activity you can no longer have access you used to have the capital if you do not have a good credit record am i right let me just tell you something right now as it relates to the united states i am looking at japan you can put japan in the state of florida and the state of florida will swallow geographically japan but better yet look what they are holding of the unitedstates apple pie the bottom line is this is about the incompetence cronyism and in some cases corruption of these individuals being able to get access into this institution and into the executive branch to be able to get what they want i want to drive the point on here i want to make sure this is crystal clear it has to be crystal the bottom line is the only way that we will be able to have a paradigm shift not only in thinking but in policy and action on behalf of the american people and unless the american people like you say the majority they do not have to be the majority the american people can make that change they can say that we are willing to allow the democrats to lead so that we can hopefully start taking care of some of these issues that we have to take care of here at home with our troops in iraq and afghanistan and throughout the world so that we can get the respect of not only the world but our country our own country veterans they signed up for all the right reasons allowing us to salute one flag as we see it now are being asked to do more financially meanwhile 1 5 trillion in tax cuts for the wealthy while we have individuals while we are having veterans affairs centers closing in rural america and in urban america they are closing some of them are only open on wednesday now but meanwhile we have individuals we have the president every time he gets a chance he is talking about let us make the tax cuts permanent for people who are not even asking for it so this is very simple this speech on what the majority republicans say well trust us we know what we are doing we showed the letter from secretary snow i think we already know this we did not write this letter the guy has said the fifth time the secretary is saying we will not be able to operate the government that is one letter here is the other one here fortytwo presidents this president and republican majority has borrowed 1 05 trillion but better yet saying let us make a bad idea permanent let us drive this number up let us put a two here instead of a one it does not make sense only the american people can stop this crowd

country and the american people have to save this country and we have to get the word out to them that all of the rhetoric all of the big money machine and look here is another one this stuff is just here it is almost too much to share we do not have enough time to share what the members and the american people clients reward keeping k street lobbyists thriving i never blame the special interests for what happens here but i am going to tell you right now they have a tax shelter right now where 100 billion in unitedstates taxpayer dollars are not going into the coffers because they have an offshore deal with this administration and with this majority meanwhile we are sitting around here trying to figure out how our veterans are going to get health care meanwhile we are trying to figure how small businesses will be able to afford health care for everyday americans to be able to buy into and meanwhile we have troops still without body armor and the things they need to be able to fight on behalf of this country so we ask everyday americans to go out there and suck it up meanwhile the majority the republican majority based on incompetence some may say corruption in some cases as it relates to the white house i mean every day i am sorry every day we turn on the television what is new what is going on at the white house what is being held back from the american people what is being held back from the congress who came to the hill today and conflicted a story that they told just months ago about the fiscal outlook on the country meanwhile you have members that come up to this well on the majority side and say we are doing fine i do not know what these democrats are talking about but it goes against logic we have letters from their very own administration that are saying we have got to raise the debt limit because of our irresponsible policies"], [0.00532001256942749, 0.9946799874305725, 1, "let me just say what mr delahunt is saying makes so much sense but i can tell him the reasonwhy we have reams and reams o f paper about how government is not working now is the fact that we are governing under a culture of corruption cronyism and incompetence one cannot operate a business under a culture of corruption cronyism and incompetence they cad just not do it they cannot do it it is impossible to achieve and it is wrong so when we have historic levels of corruption incompetence and cronyism it is just hard for us to govern in that way people are wondering why am i picking up my newspaper not only seeing indictments but seeing plea agreements by the very people that are elected to come up here to govern on behalf of the american people so why is it even shocking to some members why we have so much corruption in the federal system and we come in here as though let me grab a cup of coffee or a latte like it is another day at the office it is not another day at the office it is not another day here in congress we are concerned but maybe the majority could also get a little concerned about what is g6ing on let me just mention something because mr delahunt just hit a couple of points and i just want to mention something because here in the 30something working group as my colleagues know and others and i am so glad that mr ryan claimed this hour the bottom line is this we have a white house where members of the white house have been indicted or previous members who resigned the day before they were indicted and serious national security breaches in the white house this is not hearsay this is fact we have federal investigators now they are not talking about someone who took a trip somewhere on the governments credit card they are not talking about that you know someone went to lunch with someone and you know the bill was 3 000 and they had eight lobsters they are not talking about that they are talking about outing cia agents they are talking about information being leaked out that is jeopardizing national security they are also talking about issues as it relates to you know the influence of the private sector and corruption and not possible cronyism but cronyism and incompetence that is what is going on here now and even here in the congress unprecedented investigations inquires not by the congress but by other agencies that are policing us so when people start saying well why is all of this happening it is happening because we are not well the congress the majority is not governing the way that they should govern and policing themselves i think it is important as we look at this culture of corruption and cronyism and incompetence that we put it in the right perspective we know that a lot of this is allegations we will just say allegations i want to make sure that we say that but i want to also make sure that members know exactly what is going on this is not regular business in the congress the 109th congress historians will reflect and in the present will say this has never happened before in the historyof the republic so when folks start talking about well you know i do not know what you are talking about i am going to tell you another thing they are coming to the floor the majority tomorrow to pass tax cuts on behalf of billionaires and millionaires meanwhile just before we left here they cut student loans cut medicaid cut child support enforcement somebody please tell me this is a misprint but it is not and going after deadbeat dads so i wonder how the state attorneys and sheriffs are going to feel about that they cut many programs that we need in this country meanwhile back at the ranch we are going to turn our back on what is going on in iraq and what is going on here in washington d c as though it is not a big deal so i think the gentleman from massachusetts is in order when he talks about some of the decisions that are being made and one of any colleagues on this side said just because the republican leadership says it is true does not mean that it is true we were here on this floor late one night in the 108th congress and even in this congress but in the 108th congress on the prescription drug bill and the gentleman from ohio"], [0.005411624908447266,

florida and also ms wasserman schultz from florida we have been coming here now for a couple of years talking about the condition of the united states our fiscal situation our investment situation or lack of investment in the united states of america and also what we believe is the democraticf caucus and leader peloij and steny hoyer and the issues that we are trying to put forward it has been a very interesting week here for the democratic caucus we had a wonderful guest george lucas the famous writer director producer of the great star wars movies and he was here to talk about the innovation agenda that the democratiq party is beginning to put forward and we have an innovation agenda to keep america competitive in the 21st century as we look at what has been happening here in the united states this kind of breaks down into two or three separate categories one if we want to be a strong country we have got to start here at home and we got to start making the investments here in the united statep research and development education health care alternative energy technologies must start here and we must begin to grow our economy here if we are going to be of any good to anyone else here in the world unfortunately our friends across the aisle on the republican side have failed miserably in their attempt to try to balance the budget here in the united states of america we have as citizens of this country regardless of what political party you belong to we have as a country an 8 2 trillion national debt 8 2 trillion dollars each citizen in this country owes 27 000 to our national debt if a baby is born today that baby owes 27 000 to the united states government to help us pay our debt if you are a senior citizen you owe 27 000 to the united states government and if we keep going down the path that we have been on and here it is 8 2 trillion as of valentines day 2006 and your share of the national debt is 27 500 we have a real situation in the united states of america so not only do we owe this not only does each person owe that what do we do so if we are running a 400 billion annual deficit or 300 billion what do we do to fund business in the united states of america we have got to go out and borrow the money and this president in the first 4 years of his term borrowed more money from foreign interests than every single administration prior to his in the last 224 years this president borrowed 1 05 trillion from foreign interests in 4 years more than every other president before him is that making america stronger mr speaker i do not think it is i think it weakens our country and here it is this president in a republican house and a republican senate has borrowed 1 05 trillion from 2001 to 2005 and all of these presidents did not borrow as much from foreign interests as this one has and that puts us that puts us at a position of weakness because guess who we are borrowing the money from to pay the bills we borrow some from unitedstates interests but this is a chart that outlines who else we are borrowing this money from 682 billion we have borrowed from japan 249 billion we have borrowed from china 67 8 billion from opec are you kidding me we are borrowing money from opec to help fund and plug the hole in our annual deficits here meanwhile they are making money hand over fist this is a very dangerous situation that we are in because here is the end result here is where the rubber meets the road as we all take out loans to pay for our homes or our cars or our kids education unfortunately you cannot just borrow the money at zero percent interest you have got to pay interest on the money you borrow so the interest on 8 2 trillion is a lot of money so what does that mean for our annual payments that we have to make just on the interest this chart is the 2007 budget in billions of dollars this big red bar that gets up to 230 billion is what we are going to pay in the 2007 budget projected on interest on the debt just the interest we are not paying it down we are just paying the interest on it and this nice lavender bar that barely gets up over 50 billion is what we are going to spend on education and then homeland security and then veterans the irresponsible policies of this administration put our fiscal house in disorder because we are spending so much money on just paying the interest on the money we owe the chinese and the japanese and the opec countries that is a great deal for those countries great deal for them but what about us a stronger america starts here at home so until we fix this problem there is no issue we can go on addressing because it straps our hands behind our back because we want to make investments in education research and development pell grants to lower the cost of college tuition put research money into figuring out an alternatie energy source so we are not dependent on some of these opec countries but check this out this is the interest on the debt that i just showed this is what we could spend every day in this country if we did not have to pay all this interest on the debt we could invest 1 million a day into every congressional district i represent a district in northeast ohio youngstown ohio akron ohio niles ohio warren ohio portage county kent state university is in my district this is an older area in the northeast of the great state of ohio the great buckeye state 365 million i could have to go back to this area and invest in the schools head start all kinds of other different things just from my district and every other member in here would get 365 million a tremendous difference give it to the chinese banks the chiinese government give it to the japanese banks the japanese government give it to opec or give it to the kids who are trying to go to school in youngstown ohio of which 80 percentlive in poverty that go to youngstown city schools i know what i would like to choose some other things here we could provide health care to 79 925 more veterans if we would not have to pay the interest on the debt like in the late 1990s when we made the very difficult decision here and i am glad the gentleman from florida is joining us for this point a very difficult decision in 1993 when president clinton got into office we were running budget deficit after budget deficit every year and our democratic house and a democratic senate with a democratic president balanced the budget in 1993 without one republican vote i am hot saying some republicans would not vote for it now but at that time when the heat was on without one republican vote and it led to balanced budgets surpluses as far as the eye could see investments into education hope scholarship the whole nine yards and the greatest 6conomic expansion in the history of this country more important the private sector because interest rates were low the private sector was able to go out and create over 20 million new jobs we cannot create jobs here in government that is not our duty that is not our responsibility this is the chart reagan reagan reagan bush bush bush all in the red and clinton in the late 1990s after the 1993 budget was im plemented we started having surpluses in the late 1990s projected out as far as the eye could see because of fiscal discipline that is what our job is here balance the budget keep interest rates low invest in the education and research like this country has always done and the private sector will join and take over some other things if we did not have to pay the interest on the debt we could enroll 60 000 kids into head start you want to talk about being compassionate you want to talk about if you practice the christian faith being a christian i think somewhere that means making sure we can invest into those poor districts those poor children and i am so glad that mr meek is joining us because we started out here and that we being me talking about the impact of the budget deficit and the fiscal situation that we are in right now and the damage that it is causing to the american economy and the lack of investment because we are paying the interest on the debt to many of these countries overseas so thank you

me say mr ryan and i were talking a little earlier and it is like mr ryan telling his constituents well i know we have to have an education strategy but that is not my job that is up to the next congressman that represents youngstown the reason why the president is saying whatever he wants to say when he wants to sayit is because this republican congress has allowed him to say it and get away with it qur job is not the daytoday operation of the war in iraq it is our job to bring in this presidency making sure that we are accountable to those troops that are on the ground and our mission the bottom line is what is our mission i mean these are the individuals that gave this congress bad information and then the minute that they gave the congress bad information got away with it there were weapons of mass destruction thefn apologize well we got bad information on weapons of mass destruction i am sorry you know hey it happens but individuals have died now we have iraqi troops that are now being downgraded they cannot even fight without unitedstates troops backing them up then the secretary says well you know there may be acivil war there is a civil war going on in iraq let us just say it let usput it out there the coalition you do not hear anything about the coalition getting bigger and greater no it is not getting bigger and greater matter of fact the brits are leaving this year and a number of other countries have said hey you know i am willing to take the training wheels off the iraqi army let me just say this because i think that mr ryan laid it out so that everyone can understand a new member ofcongresscould understand what you just set out the bottom line is that trying is not good enough we need the american people to chime in and make their member of congress stand up on behalf of the american people mr ryan said correctly and backed it up with the congressional record the fact that we have a republican majority that is more loyal to an individual riding around here making 1 billion or 1 million a year or record profits or whatever their industry is than they are committed to container security it is not just what kendrick meek is saying that is the fact and mr ryan laid it out and yes we do have a level of frustration folks say you seem like you are upset well we should be upset and i do not care if it is democrat independent or republican mr delahunt said it earlier as far as ports containers come into a port guess what there are trucks that they go on the back of and trains that they go on the back of they go throughout america and next thing you know this issue makes it to the heartland or sioux city iowa or whatever the case the people may say well that is a coastal issue that is not a coastal issue it is an american issue e 2320 and they have been allowed to do whatever they want to do whenever they want to do it because this congress hasnt reined them in i am going to close in 1 second but i just want to also point out madam speaker since we are pointing out a few things here that we have turned on the lights here in the chamber this whole dubai thing and the republicans marching around we stopped that from happening we blocked that deal well guess what there were a couple of votes before that where theytried to block it but procedurally they blocked the democrats from doing that it is not who blocked it it is about how we got there how did an under secretary level individual make this kind of decision the outsourcing of american security it happens every day ms wasserman schultz and i can tell you this we are standing up to the president no you are not standing up to the president but guess what when all of america is standing on this side of the line and saying are you representing us or who are you representing are we standing upfor dubai what did the president say i got a little confused there members i am sorry the president said well we have got to keep our word what about keeping our word to the american people on security and health care and all those things hetalked about during the canpaign and all the republican members won the majority because they said trust us on security trust us on fiscal responsibility dont get me started on fiscal responsibility it is almost like the guy running from the back of the class who is an f student who says i want to be the valedictorian of the class because i say that i am did not work did not study did not do the things that he needed to do to be the top person in the class but better yet because they say it that makes it right what does this mean mr delahunt this means if the american people see fit that the democrats are in charge of the congress that the white house will not be making statements and saying well we have said it publicly so that means you cant do anything about it republican congress and if folks want to talk about a democratic plan in iraq it is accountability it is making sure we take these nobid contracts and put them on top of the table and really get down to the treason why we are still in iraq i am just talking about what i am talking about mr delahunt i am not saying there are some shady deals but there are a number of articles that are out that ire pointing to this every day this stuff is coming out and i think it is very very important that we focus in on that"],

important that we understand that the american people have awakened all of the polls show it the american people are glued in to what is happening here in washington and right they should be i want to start off by saying that so that individuals who are tuning in who would like to know just what are the blue dogs more than anything else we pride ourselves on being first and foremost good stewards of the taxpayers dollars we provide the sterling leadership in the democratic party for responsible fiscal responsibility for 5 years we in the blue dog coalition have been begging and pleading that this congress develop a plan to pay as you go mr speaker 5 years ago when the clinton administration left office we had a surplus billions and billions and billions of dollars were left in surplus now 5 years later under the bush administration we are trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars in debt make no mistake about it our debt and our deficit is the number one problem and issue facing the survival and the future of our democracy and we are concerned about this national debt but at a time when we are expressly concerned about it and pushing forward for responsible measures onthe democratic side it is the height of hypocrisy it is the height of being insensitive it is the height of indeed smoke and mirrors for this republicanled congress and this republican president to under the guise of giving a tax cut for billionaires and millionaires across this country say he wants to cut spending cut spending of the most vital services the most important needs in this country as a matter of fact in the history of this country in this 20th century we have just been hit with the worst hurricane season in modern times katrina was the worst that anybody can remember billions and billions and billions of dollars worth of damage an entire city entire region almost totally destroyed over 250 000 american citizens without homes we all remember those pictures down in new orleans in the flood our hearts went out to those people well our hearts must continue to go out to those people and the reason it is the height of hypocrisy is here is the president of the united states and this republican controlled congress who says that they want to offset a 70 billion tax cut for the wealthiest people in this country on the backs of those poor victims of this hurricane on the front page of the washington post this morning the answer from fema is to throw 150 000 american citizens who have become homeless on the street the answer from the white house and the answer from this congress has been to cut the very programs that will help these victims the most the most effective programs that have helped them has been the food stamp program and under this budget this republican held congress and this president proposes to cut food stamps by 850 million not only at a time when we have people who are homeless without jobs without hope but according to the agriculture department just this year alone we have added 2 million more citizens to the hunger roles the republicans answer cut the very program that has been designed to help them by 850 billion medicaid under this budget planned by the republicans and president bush they want to cut medicaid by 12 billion when 45 million americans mostly senior elderly citizens are going without any kind of health insurance and our farmers cut them by 2 billion farmers who have been devastated by the flood who have been hurt by the flood now is not the time to cut the farmers and our veterans 3 billion lord knows we have not been doing right by our veterans we have cut them we have cut them we have cut them and the presidents answer is cut the veterans this republican congresss is to cut the veterans is that not a reason why they have had difficulty in getting the votes why they have had to pull the bill last week and the american people need to wake up and understand and put the calls in to your republican congressman to let them know that america does not want to cut the basic services for the needy while trying to add a 70 billion tax cut for the millionaires and the billionaires they do not need the money but the children do this budget will cut childrens nutrition by 2 billion and 5 billion in child support heating oil is cut at a time when the oil companies are getting record profits and their execputives are sitting fast student loans 14 billion at a time when going to college costs so much there will be tens of thousands of american children who will not go to college if this republican budget reconciliation bill passes that is why this is so important that is why it is important listen to me america and if you know other people tell them to tune in we are here to tell you the facts this blue dog coalition is one of the most influential groups on capitol hill and the reason why is because people trust us we have earned that we have earned that distinction folks like charlie stenholm john tanner they have pioneered and set the curve respect across party lines respect across this country the blue dog coalition we are speaking the truth tonight william shakespeare said it well when he wrote that great play julius caesar when he said et tu brutus yours is the meanest cut of all and that is what these republicans are doing in this bill it is mean it is cold and it is wrong and the american people deserve better and we are going to give them better so mr ross and my fellow blue dogs we are here tonight to speak the truth we are here tonight to let the american people know and we hope and we pray that we will be successful in stopping this budget reconciliation bill from being devastating to the american people"], [0.005917608737945557,

night and talked about what the republicans would do if they were able to take control of the house he talked about all of the things that you know he was talking about that just good government all right ow what is newt gingrich saying they talking about the republican majority are seen by the country as being in charge of a government that cannot function they not my republican colleagues not my good friends in congress they here is a major republican that served as speaker the first speaker in a number of years to serve as the speaker of this house calling his former colleagues and the people that he worked with and his office is right down the hall they because if newt gingrich is saying that this republican congress cannot function cannot run the country like it is supposed to be run cannot oversee the finances cannot make sure that americans have health care and small businesses are able to provide health care cannot give guidance and oversight to the department of defense and secretary rumsfeld cannot make sure that we let oil companies know that we are here to represent the american people and not their special interests not their profits and not their ceos that will retire to a pension making 150 000 a day not because they are that great it is because we have taken the taxpayers money and we have given it to them and now we have republican leaders saying well maybe we need to take the tax cuts back you just gave them and then you read something else no we should not take that tax cuts back because guess what the oil companies have representation in the republican majority period as i said last night a black man with a conspiracy theory but mr ryan i believe and i know and it is documented that the vide president and others sat down vith these oil companies and put this in motion long ago so members walking around here were having press conferences talking down this i do not know what happened i do not i did not see it coming what do you mean you cannot enforce prices it is just insane mr ryan for us to be the country that we are and for the federal trade commission to say well you know we think we have power we do not have the teeth that we need to really find out what is going on with those oil companies but i will tell you this i believe that these oil companiles have been a part of writing this legislation in the way to where that is hard to prosecute them and it is hard to get to the bottom line of who is doing what and guess what when there are no penalties it is h1most like having a house full of kids saying there is no time out there is no discipline whatsoever do as you may and everything in the house will be broken and every picture will be ripped off the wall that is what these oil companies are doing now i do not fault them i fault the republican majbrity and like i said last night mr ryan i am not going to ask them to lead anymore if they want to work in a bipartisan way we are ready to go we have been ready to go and if the american people see fit for us to be the majority party in the 110th congress and they will see an opportunity we will be able to work in a bipartisan way there will be a number of republicans that i do know some of my friends mr ryan and we do know them a very small number on the other side of the aisle see things the way we see it and the way the american people see it i know the reason why the poll numbers are what they are right now the president is not running again but the congress and this house every 2 years we go before the voters like i said last night mr ryan i do not care if it is a local republican committee chairman he or she has to have a problem with the borrowing that has been going on in this republican majority congress he or she must have a problem with the fact that no one can answer the questions on intelligence and the outing of cia agents he or she must have a problem if there are republican committee persons at the local level and on the state level with the fact that the k street project was allowed to operate under this dome by individuals that wore congressional pins that say yes we do have a k street project and yes if you are not on this list you dont get access to this government guess what that was okay we talked about it mr ryan the good thing is it is almost like showing up somewhere at the scene of an accident and saying time and time again we went to the police department we went to the city hall and said we needed a stop light here now look at this fatality i used to be a state trooper i can see it all the time report after report we didnt get the traffic light out there in time and people died because of it well guess what the people were beat down by this republican majority as it relates to good government because not what i am seeing and not what you are seeing mr ryan here is what members on the republican side of this house have said yes we have a k street project then we have a gentleman who admitted you dont have to call the jury you do not even have to assign a courtroom i am guilty i did it that is what this republican lobbyist said not only did i do it but i am going to help you go after some members of congress that were part of it i am going to help you identify other lobbyists that were a part of this great operation the k street project then the republican majority after he said what he said and the federal prosecutors did what they did said we denounce no longer k street project we dont know what you are talking about we will no longer condone it the k street project well mr ryan it sounds like when the president says well i dont know quite what we can do about gas prices but i do know that americans are addicted to oil come on the president and the vice president were part of putting this thing into motion the republican congress rubberstamped mr ryan everything that this administration said they wanted mr president you want tax cuts that you cannot afford so that we can put ourselves in debt and allow foreign countries to own more of america fine mr president the intelligence on iraq is kind of shaky but we hava to do what you want aid anyone who goes against you or says anything against you is unpatriotic and we will have congressional hearings to humiliate those individuals mr president payasyougo i know the democrats are there talking about maybe we need to pay as we go right now since we are in so much debt you want to continue to borrow and spend we got your back mr president because we are the republican congress and we are going to allow you to continue to drive this country in the way that special interests want to drive it because you know something when all the resources are gone and when all the opportunities are gone and when it is american taxpayers that are in debt where will the special interests be that is the question will they help bail this country out of the debt that this republican congress has delivered to them no that is the reason why that members if they are in their offices or they are walking around this building and if they are at home right now they need to sit up in bed and say you know something i need to go to work tomorrow with a new attitude i need to make sure that i fight on behalf of my constituents i need to have the same kind of drive that i had the night that i was elected doing all of those things i said i would do all of those things all of those plans everything i talked about in the campaign about representing whatever district they may be running from in my case the 17th congressional district they call that being born again mr ryan and a baptist term being born again to public service i am excited by the fact that the american people they are not getting it

the nations debt how did we do it we have tried to fight two wars with four tax cuts and this congress has served as an atm to the special interests showering them with billions in tax breaks and

talking about cutting education health care areas of environment and energy for the rest of america 50 billion and all the while we are trying to do that this congress under a republican majority wants to shower the wealthiest 1 percent those who earn over 200 000 with more tax cuts and more debt yet what are we saying to the rest of america you are going to get cuts in education health care environment energy national security areas homeland in the area of police yet the interesting thing while all of this is happening here in the united states we are trying to turn ourselves into a

families and the communities of new orleans mississippi and alabama the choice shouldnot be cutting pell grants and college loans cutting student nutrition programs cutting health care for our elderly

legislation this piece of legislation is a hardfought compromise between the house and the senate the required give and take in this case is a tremendous example of the dedication that members of both bodies of congress and both political parties have when it comes to supporting our troops in the field mt speaker many said we could not be at this point today many expected compromise could not be reached i am pleased to say this has not been the case furthermore the underlying legislation also provides the continuing resolution for the government to remain in operation until november 17 this represents a great compromise and maintains the lower funding levels from either the house or senate from the previous year or the fiscal year 2006 current rates h r 5631 in short represents good bipartisan bicameral work the primary purpose of the underlying legislation is to secure and improve the defense of our country to that end the underlying legislation provides for several critical needs for our forces first its overall level of funding provides 377 6 billion plus 70 billion in the fiscal year 2007 bridge for operations in iraq and af ghanistan additionally a full 17 1 billion is provided for the army for the purpose of resetting and refurbishing the force this is particularly critical at a time when the army clearly requires and deserves additional funds to fulfill the many complex and dangerous missions it has been called upon to undertake other critical expenditures in this legislation includes significant dollars for the armys future combat systems the navys shipbuilding program and aircraft research and development and procurement by the air force rather than focusing on the specific numbers however i want to address the fundamental reasons for the underlying legislation and the challenges that it attempts to address today we are at war in both iraq and afghanistan and are embarked upon the greatest military rebuilding effort in a generation while our forces are stretched they are doing a magnificent job there is no doubt of their dedication professionalism and commitment to the missions we have asked t hem to fulfill frankly we ask more of them than anyone should have to give yet when we do they always exceed our expectation our combatant commanders and the administration have been very open during the multiple oversight hearings about the challenges they foresee in what they refer to as the long war it is not a war that can be fought and won by force alone it is one that requires military action but also reconstruction stabilization and the fostering of democratic concepts and structures of government in areas and among peoples who have been subjected to dictators and totalitarian regimes for decades this task is neither simple nor easy however it is necessary for the security of our country when the american people are asked to support our troops in the field they always respond with the generosity and commitment required of them historically however congress and the president have not always funded the military in peacetime at levels necessary to adequately protect us from future threats i believe that many of the challenges we face today come from underfunding our military during the 1990s today we may hear that the force is stressed we may hear that we dont have enough troops we may hear about excessive deployment rates we may hear about increasing levels of stress on military personnel and their families in large measure i accept these assertions as true but they are issues that have grown out of an historical reluctance to see the world for what it is a very dangerous place at the end of the first bush administration in 1992 we were left with a military that was much larger and could have sustained operations in the h7404current environment for a much longer period of time during the 1990s many of the forces we wish we had today were rifed disassembled retired and transferred in pursuit of the socalled peace dividend if there is one thing we should learn from this experience it is that the military is like life insurance it is expensive and no one wants to pay for it but it is there for a specific purpose and to be used when the situation ret quires we have clearly seen what the misguided decision to reduce our forces from 15 divisions and then down to 10 divisions has meant for the army it has resulted in a force that is burdened strained and stretched by our historically naive decisions the road out of this situation is not easily traveled it is one that will require the sustained commitment and support of the administration and both houses and both parties in congress this bill is a step in that direction it is a step toward achieving our objective in afghanistan and iraq it is a step toward building a future for us that can meet americas changing security needs this is an ongoing process however some today may try to make the underlying legislation out to be more comprehensive than any bill can possibly be they will argue it should be the final answer a cure for all problems this is not and indeed this can never be the defense of our country requires a constant vigilance born of necessity and the funding sizing and transformation of our military forces is by necessity an evolutionary process one appropriations bill will not meet all of the challenges or solve all of the security needs of our country however this bill is a real substantive and incremental step in securing our future the appropriators have

we are fortunate to take the first step of what i see as a twostep process and that ispassage of this cord blood bill which as i said we passed last may in this house by an overwhelming vote the second step of course will be when the other body passes h r 810 which also passed last may and when that bill is finally signed into law the two bills working together will greatly expand availability of research and of cures for americans who suffer not just from bloodrelated diseases but from diseases like alzheimers parkinsons nerve damage and so many other diseases that cannot be reached simply by cord blood that is the day that a true dawning of a new scientific era will occur in this country this is a good bill today and i urge all of my colleagues to support it and i want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their cosponsorship but let us be clear exactly what this bill does it authorizes a new granted program to provide subsidies to cord blood stem cell banks to expand the inventory of high quality cord blood units it sets up a registry for cord blood which will in some cases take the place of bone marrow transplants which it is beginning to supersede this will be enormously important particularly for sickle cell patients who will be helped the bill also authorizes research on the clinical outcomes of patients who are recipients of a stem cell therapeutics product from biologically related and unrelated donors that is what this bill does this bill does not set up any cures for any diseases nor does it do anything to put ethical controls onto stem cell research and other types of research that are scientifically being explored now and need the oversight of the national institutes of health so this is a good start i commend all my colleagues it is going to make us all feel good to go home for the holidays knowing that certain classes of patients will be helped but i would say to my friends on both sides of the aisle let us not stop there in the second session of this congress let us take the bold scientific step necessary to provide cures for diseases that affect tens of millions of americans and citizens around the

has been developed in a very bipartisan fanner the purpose of this legislation is to help fill in the gaps between existing maritime pollution laws such as the act to prevent pollution from ships our oceans are becoming the garbage pit for the world each year tons of marine debris such as plastics and garbage from vessels is discarded into the oceans its killing the animals in our oceans and with it the oceans themselves the coastlines of islands in the middle of the pacific ocean are littered with debris that washes up including massive fishing nets that are lost each year september 27 2006 cc s 362 introduced by senator inouye will help address these problems this legislation requires the administrator of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration to map debris fields to assess the impact of this debris on the living marine resources and navigational safety and to develop strategies to prevent and remove marine debris from the navigable waters of the united states and our 200mile exclusive economic zone s 362 also requires the commandant of the coast guard to take actions to reduce violations of and improve implementation of marpol annex v and the act to prevent pollution from ships under the bill the coast guard will also have to develop and implement a plan to improve shipboard waste management and to make sure that unitedstates ports and terminals maintain and monitor the adequacy of receptacles for the disposal of plastics and other garbage that are brought into our ports each year on ships the oceans are our lifelines we cannot let human activity kill them s 362 will help to prevent thousands of tons of debris from entering the ocean each year from vessels i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting s 362 the marine debris research prevention and

forced israel to defend itself and its citizens and will have a damaging effect on the prospect of peace in the middle east if someone attacked across our borders and sent rockets into the united states and had killed or captured our own soldiers you had better believe we would want to defend ourselves israel has the right to respond just like we would israel fully withdrew from southern lebanon in may of 2000 and from gaza earlier this year only to suffer hundreds of unprovoked attacks from both areas since then this is not the first time hezbollah has taken action against israeli soldiers it also kidnapped and killed three soldiers in october of 2000 these attacks are an attempt by hezbollah to open a second front so to speak after the kidnappings in gaza and their attack on israels sovereignty hezbollahs actions require israel to defend itself and israels actions to take out terrorist camps along its borders to prevent this from happening again are warranted and justified israel has to defend itself from these terrorist organizations that want to go back to pre1948 before there was israel they dont want israel on the map these countries with influence over
