the veto because i oppose estatetax relief for familyowned ranches and farms or other small businesses in fact i definitely think we should act to make it easier for their owners to pass them on to future generations this is important for the whole country or course but it is particularly important for coloradans who want to help keep ranch lands in open undeveloped condition by reducing the pressure to sell them to pay estate taxes but there is a better way to do it than by enacting this republican bill that is why i voted for the democratic alternative when the house originally considered this bill that democratic alternative bill would have provided real effective relief without the excesses of the republican bill it would have raised the estate taxs special exclusion to 4 million for a couple owning a farm or small business so under that alternative a married couple owning a family farm or ranch or a small business worth up to 4 million could pass it on intact with no estate tax whatsoever also the democratic alternative actually would have provided more immediate relief to small business and farm owners unlike the republican billwhich is phased in over 10 yearsthe democratic alternative would have taken effect immediately that means a couple passing on their farm or small business in the near future would avoid more tax under the democratic plan than under the republican bill they would not have to hope to live long enough to see the benefits in addition by increasing the general exclusion from 675 000 to 1 1 million next year the democratic alternative would have allowed parents to pass on millionaire status to their children without a penny of estate tax burden and the democratic alternative also would have lowered estate tax rates by 20 across the board so the democratic alternativewhich i voted for which deserved adoption and which would not have been vetoedwould have provided important relief from the estate tax and would have done so in a real effective and prompt way furthermore the democratic alternative would have provided this relief in a fiscally responsible way that would not jeopardize our ability to do what is needed to maintain and strengthen social security and medicare provide a prescription drug benefit for seniors and pay down the public debt by contrast it is precisely the fiscal overkill of the republican bill that made me most reluctant to vote for it and that leads me to vote to sustain the presidents veto as the rocky mountain news put it in a september 3rd editorial the republican tax cut is a gamble that the present economic boom isnt going to slow and is fiscally irre mr lantos i will vote today sponsible to uphold the presidents veto of the estate once fully phased in the republican bill tax elimination act would forgo nearly 50 billion a year in rev when this legislation was first considered in enue with no guarantee that this revenue loss the house in june i strongly supported and will not harm social security and medicare in voted for the democratic alternative which was future years presented by congressman rangel of new the bills sponsors say it will cost 28 2 bil york that proposal called for a significant relion over 5 years and 104 5 billion over 10 duction in the rate of taxation of estates and years but that is far from the whole story be a 50 percent increase in the small business cause of the way the bill is phased in its true exclusion the rangel proposal was a cost is cleverly hidden and does not show up thoughtful and reasonable effort to deal with until after the 10year budget window the legitimate concerns of small businesses that means the full effects of the repub and family farms but it did not have the problican bill will come just at the time when we lems of the legislation which was being urged will have to face budget pressures because by the republican majority my own baby boom generation is starting to when the rangel substitute was defeated retire and if we feel we need to phase in by the house i nevertheless voted for the h r 8 because we cannot afford the full re adoption of h r 8 in order to continue the legpeal now how are we ever going to afford it islative process initial senate action was 10 years from now much closer to the rangel substitute and i we do not need to engage in this fiscal expected a housesenate

bill just as we invest in the future of space programs we need to make sure that we invest in our future because children are our future we need additional programs for math and science we should not

change all kids should have an opportunity cuts in afterschool programs the republican plan cuts afterschool programs by over 400 million or 40 percent of the presidents proposal it will throw children out into our streets instead of having them safely in schools they will be placed as a burden on our churches to care for our young people school counselors it eliminates funding for over 100 000 school counselors so the kids will not know which classes to take i was a counselor and i know the importance of having counselors that can direct our children and tell them what classes they need to take to make sure that they are prepared academically not only to graduate from high school but at the same time to go on to a community college a state college or to a university class size reduction the republican plan will result in larger class sizes it rejects the presidents plan to hire additional 100 000 new teachers in california alone we have implemented the class reductions that have been very effective in the state of california where the grades have begun to increase for a lot of our children we had small classes we owe the same opportunity to our children we can remember that when most of us were baby boomers or going to school our classes were small and we were able to learn in that kind of environment this presents a very difficult environment for a lot of our children that will have 35 students in a classroom to 45 students in the classrooms we need further reduction in classes teacher quality it will cut incentives for hiring good teachers by 1 billion

extensive repairs or replacement of buildings republicans rejected 1 3 billion for urgent safety and health repairs at 5 000 schools our children will be in classes with unsafe wiring roofs could fall

fewer than a dozen estatetax returns were comprised primarily of small businesses ranches or farms of course those numbers only relate to the cases in which an estate tax was actually paid clearly in

said the democratic alternative would have provided real effective and immediate estatetax relief to the owners of small businesses including farms and ranches and would have done so in a fiscally

businesses but instead are very wealthy families with very large assets over the past two decades income and wealth disparities have increased the republican bill while it does have some positive aspects would increase those wealth disparities i find this troubling and it adds to my reluctance to support the bill however i will vote for the bill because the republican leadership has made it clear that it is this bill or no estatetax relief bill at least for now here in the house that being the case i have decided that the republican billalthough very flawed and excessive is just acceptable enough for me to vote for today i do so in the hope and expectation that the bills faults can be corrected as it proceeds through the legislative process and that ultimately it can be

that she has taken on this issue especially urging and demanding an accurate count on the 2000 census this is not about political wedges this is about improving the quality of life that is what this issue is about it is not about political wedges it is about improving the quality of life this issue affects all americans this issue affects every man in america this issue affects every woman in america this issue affects every child in america during the census of 1990 nearly 18 000 residents of my congressional district were not couited i state 18 000 residents of my congressional district were not counted the undercount resulted in a loss of federal dollars and funds that would have benefited nearly 50 million in revenue that would have gone over the past 10 years because we failed to do an accurate count we lost 50 million over the last 10 years 50 million could have gone a long ways in providing much needed resources to my congressional district 50 million would have brought the inland empire roads and infrastructure 50 million could have brought the inland empire housing programs and projects and educational services law enforcement for cities parks and recreation senior citizen services youth centers educational services overall the state of california has lost out on more than 2 2 billion federal dollars and i state overall the state of california has lost out on more than 2 2 billion federal dollars due to the 1990 census undercount last week the lieutenant governor of california cruz bustamante warned that our state could lose 5 billion and i state 5 billion in federal funding if the undercount this year is similar to the 1990 undercount that is why i commend our colleague from new york for urging for an accurate count and demanding an accurate count not only what it means to my state but what it means to many other states across the nation as lieutenant governor cruz bustamante said we will have less than we deserve and i state we will have less than what we deserve this is not just a matter of loss of federal dollars people are being overlooked millions of americans are being overlooked it is a shame that california will not get its fair share of dollars if we do not do an accurate count that is why it is important that we do an accurate count not only for california but for others ten years ago millions of americans were not included in the census count a count that would have placed them equally alongside each and every other american in 1990 2 7 percent of people of california were not counted 2 7 percent 2 7 percent that means one out of every 37 people in california were not counted yet our population continues to grow we have 34 million people or more in the state of california it would be a shame if california did not have an accurate count and it did not receive its fair share of dollars back into our state the census undercount does not affect all americans in the same way again during the 1990 census 7 6 percent of the black population was overlooked in that counting i state 7 6 percent that means one out of every 13 black residents of california were not being counted also during the 1990 census 4 9 percent of hispanic residents of california were not counted that is 4 9 percent that means 4 9 roughly one out of every 20 latinos in california were not being counted imagine what it is going to be like this year if we do not do an accurate count it is a shame if we do not do that it is a shame that the leadership on the other side does not want to do an accurate count i am appalled that governor bush does not want to do an accurate count i think it is important that we all do it in the state of california that we do it in every state i am truly appalled 4 9 percent equals nearly 400 000 latinos in california not counted the last 10 years 400 000 is more than the population of fresno california 400 000 is more than the population of sacramento it is more than the population of oakland 400 000 people not being counted is 400 000 too many however it is not just a matter of blacks and latinos not being counted millions of children also were overlooked over the last 10 years nationwide more than 2 million children were not counted 10 years ago in california alone 342 000 children were not counted in the 1990 census that is 342 000 children imagine the services that could have gone back to our schools to our communities to our state this represents 4 2 percent of the children of california not being counted in 1990 this represents nearly one of every 24 children in california not being counted i join my colleagues here on the floor this evening in urging all americans to stand up and be counted this year i join with those who have been undercounted in the past in stressing the importance of being counted during the year 2000 census all americans should be counted this year if we do not do an accurate count the federal dollars do not come in and the taxpayers will have to pay for the services that we want and deserve i urge all of us to stand up and be counted whether we are white or whether we are american indians african americans hispanic asian americans we should all stand up together and be counted we are one nation a great nation and we are one people together unified and inclusive and i state inclusive and that is important that we are all included in this process and that every one of us is counted filling out the forms and mailing them back is important as the chair indicated that april 1 everyone has received it we urge everyone to return those back

reform i bemoan the fact that that is the case i think that this legislation and the need to address the issue of hmo reform is really the preeminent issue that needs to be addressed in this house in this congress in this session of congress i have to say that the republican leadership since the beginning of the year has made many promises with regard to the patients bill of rights and the whole issue of hmo reform first the speaker said that we would follow the normal committee process and an hmo reform bill would have hearings in the relevant committees and have a markup in committee and come to the floor in the normal way but that has not happened then as members know in the other body basically the democrats forced the issue forced the other body to bring up hmo reform unfortunately the bill that was finally passed was not real reform was ineffective was a sham but the impetus if you will that at least some sort of hmo reform would be brought up in the senate caused the speaker and the republican leadership just a few weeks ago after the senate took action and had a hearing and had a markup on the floor basically forced the speaker to say that a bill would come to the floor an hmo reform bill would come to the floor in the house of representatives sometime before the august recess well the august recess begins probably this friday and democrats have basically been pushing to achieve action here on the floor for the patients bill of rights our democratic hmo reform we actually had members come to the floor over here in the well and sign a discharge petition that would force the republican leadership to bring up our patients bill of rights one hundred eightythree members signed that discharge petition but now ultimately to no avail the speaker the republican speaker just announced that no action will be taken on the bill before the august recess i ask why the answer i think is very simple that is because the republican leadership here in the house as well as in the senate is a captive of the insurance industry the insurance industry does not want a true hmo reform a true comprehensive bill to come to the floor of the house because unlike the other body they realize that if it does it will pass some of my colleagues a handful of my colleagues on the other side who are health care professionals doctors dentists have made the point that they will vote for a strong hmo reform bill something akin to the democrats patients bill of rights when they made that statement and basically indicated to the republican leadership that they would join with the democrats in passing a bill well all of a sudden this week we find that the speaker and the republican leadership say no no were not going to bring a bill to the floor we can wait until the fall well have further discussions no action will be taken now i just want to commend the republicans on the other side of the aisle those few all of whom i think who have been most outspoken are health care professionals doctors because they have stood up and said that we need a strong hmo reform bill and they refuse to saythat the action taken by the other body meets that need in fact it does not meet that need if i could i hope that during the august break and when we come back in september that we will see a bipartisan coalition of the democrats all of whom support the patients bill of rights and enough republicans on the other side that will come together in a bipartisan way to demand action on something like the patients bill of rights so we can have true comprehensive hmo reform come to the floor when we return in september if the house leadership is not willing to bring it up i think we will simply have to get every democrat to sign the discharge petition and join with some of the republicans who are willing to sign it to force the issue to make sure that the patients bill of rights or some strong comprehensive reform like it comes to the floor as my colleagues know i just wanted to point out that increasingly we are seeing every comprehensive report every study that is being done around the country about what the american people want what the health professionals want what people see basically as common sense reform with regard to hmos that we need some kind of action taken there were two reports that came out just in the last week that i wanted to mention tonight one of them was basically a report if you will where various doctors and health care professionals were interviewed it was a survey that found nearly nine in 10 doctors and more than one in four consumers are having trouble receiving the medical care and services they need within the context of hmos managed care and as a result between onethird and twothirds of the doctors said the service denial resulted in adverse health consequences for the patient the types of problems that we are seeing that myself and others have documented on the floor about people who have had abusive situations with managed care and with hmos this is becoming commonplace and both consumers patients as well as doctors are decrying the situation and i say to my colleagues and i guess to the american people as well why is it that the republican leadership will not allow us to take action when the majority of us in a bipartisan way would like to see comprehensive hmo reform and it always comes back to the same thing and that is the money spent by the insurance industry against this type of comprehensive hmo reform the second survey that came out in the last week or so basically said that last year 1 4 to 2 billion was paid to lobbyists to influence politicians and policy a 13 percent increase from 1997 and for the second year in a row the insurance industry topped the list in lobbying costs nearly 203 million last year alone the republicans basically on the leadership or amongst the republican leadership are bowing to the insurance industry which is spending millions of dollars once again trying to defeat true hmo reform i just wanted to if i could make reference to a new york times editorial that was in the new york times on july 16 of this year and it just kind of sums up what is happening out there and why we cannot see action on the house floor and i quote it says there is no mystery here campaign money is dictating medical policy in the senate the political system and especially the republican party is awash in money from the health care industry as president clinton said yesterday and this was back on july 16 gop senators could not support the patients bill of rights because the health insurers will not let them do so that is the bottom line mr speaker if i could just use a couple minutes of my time to talk about some of the comparisons between the patients bill of rights the bill that the democrats and some of the republicans want to bring to the floor versus the bill that passed the senate and the one that would have been considered i believe on the floor pursuant to the republican leadership if they thought that they could get the votes to pass it there is a real contrast if you will between that republican senate bill and the democratic patients bill of rights and let me just go through a few highlights of it if i could this evening the republican bill and i refer to the senate bill leaves more than 100 million americans uncovered because most substantive protections in the bill apply only to individuals enrolled in private employerbased selffunded insurance plans and selffunded coverage is typically offered only by large companies only 48 million people are enrolled in such plans and of those 48 million only a small number at most 10 percent are in hmos so the senate republican bill really does not help effectively anyone does not provide patient protections really to almost anyone what the democrats insist on in the patients bill of rights and the republicans that support us have said is that all all 161 million privately insured americans have to be covered by the bill by the patient protections let me just give my colleagues some of the other examples that i think are important in the democratic bill we have talked about the prudent layperson standard in the situation where you go to an emergency room this is so important so many people come up to me and say if i have under my hmo if i want to go to the local emergency room i cannot i have to go to one maybe 20 miles away 30 miles away 50 miles away and when a person is in extremis or has a problem and has to go to an emergency room they do not want to have to travel 20 or 30 miles away when the emergency room for the local hospital is maybe only within a mile distance from where they ai e well under the democratic bill what we say is that an individual who has symptoms that meet a prudent lay person what the average person would think is the need to go to the emergency room under given certain circumstances that that standard should allow them to go to the local emergency room the closest one without preauthorization and the insurance plan must cover the visit the plan may not impose additional charges for use of nonnetwork facilities it is unclear in the republican senate bill whether that kind of standard would apply there really is not any prudent lay person standard if you will in the republican bill most important in the democratic bill is that we provide for adequate specialty care it provides the right in our patients bill of rights to specialty care if specialty care is medically indicated it ensures no extra charge for use of nonnetwork specialists if the hmo has no specialist in the network that is appropriate to treat the condition i just wanted to mention a couple other things that i think that are really crucial in terms of the differences between the democratic bill and what the republicans passed in the senate and one of those most important distinctions is on the issue of medical necessity the issue of medical necessity is basically whether or not a particular type of care operation equipment length of stay in the hospital will be provided in a given circumstance if you get sick and basically the republican senate bill allows hmos to define what is medically necessary no matter how narrow or unfair to patients the hmos definition is their definition controls in any coverage situation including decisions by an independent thirdparty reviewer the democratic bill by contrast codifies a traditional definition of medically necessary or appropriate means of service or benefit consistent with generally accepted principles of professional medical practice in other words what we are saying in the patients bill of rights is that the doctor and the patient have to decide based on standards that are used for most physicians in a given circumstance it is an independent standard if you will not defined by the hmo most important also the distinction on the issue of external appeals the republican senate bill allows the hmo to choose and pay the appeal entity that decides the case it also allows the hmo or insured to define medical necessity tying the hands of the independent review entity and forcing them to defer to the hmos definition it does not provide the republican bill an appeal when most rights under the bill are denied for example when emergency care is denied or access to a specialist is denied no appeal is allowed the democratic patients bill of rights by contrast ensures the state or federal agency controls the process for choosing the independent appeal entity not the insurer it ensures a de novo review a fresh look at the facts it ensures the reviewers decision is based on a statutory definition of medical necessity not the insurers plans definition and the review of best available medical evidence and all denials of care are appealable finally the most important distinction between the democratic patients bill of rights and the republican senate bill is the ability to hold hmos accountable under the republican bill it maintains existing federal law that basically preempts state remedies and the only remedy under erisa which is the federally covered plans is recovery of the cost of the denied benefit for example if a patient is denied a mammogram and dies of breast cancer as a result the only remedy under the republican bill available to the family is the recovery of the costs of the mammogram not the damages that result including the death of the patient under the democratic bill by contrast the erisa presumption of state remedies the ability to go to state court only exists when the actions of an hmo have killedwell essentially what we are saying is that that erisa preemption is repealed and you can go to state court and you can seek damages and you can recover for the damage that the hmo has inflicted just like you would in any normal tort action i think that there are crucial differences here and i think that ultimately what it comes down to is money it is a very sad day but what we are seeing is the insurers increasingly spending a lot of money on tv trying to get the word out that somehow what we are trying to do with the patients bill of rights is not going to work that it is going to cost more money that it is not going to achieve the desired result the fact of the matter is that the american people are crying out for comprehensive hmo reform they want to see something like the patients bill of rights passed again i want to commend some of my republican colleagues particularly the physicians on the other side of the aisle who are saying you know we are practicing doctors we see what happens we know there are abuses and we want strong hmo reform passed something like the democratic bill and we will work together with the democrats to achieve a bipartisan proposal if i could just conclude tonight i always like to talk when i come to the floor about local people in my part of new jersey who have had problems with hmos because that is really what it is all about we are talking a little bit in the abstract here about what needs to be done but the bottom line is it is our own constituents coming to us and saying we need hmo reform we need something done because of what is happening to them if i could just conclude tonight with a letter that was in the asbury park press which is the largest circulation daily in my district in monmouth county new jersey and this was in the asbury park press a letter to the editor on thursday july 15 from jack moriarty of dover township i am going to read part of it because i think it is so telling he says each time i must deal with my health maintenance organization on any matter other than the routine and the basic problems continue this is a system designed and managed to restrict our access to medical care and to place roadblock after roadblock in our way as we attempt to circumvent that design feature on july 6th i sustained an eye injury while swimming when a thumb with sharpened fingernail found its way into my eye i stopped the bleeding applied ice and went to bed this morning there was blood on the pillowcase the pain had intensified and my vision was blurred i reasoned this required an objective medical evaluation to ensure there was no permanent damage thus began my hassle for the day what followed was more than a dozen telephone calls to various medical professionals and administrators to get permission to go to the doctor and secure the required referral for them to be paid i knew what had to be done but what is the justification for wasting my time and causing me anxiety and aggravation as a professional if i am not working i am not being paid consequently the very real financial loss i endure by sitting in a waiting room makes me choose the medical visit option only as a last resort that day i wasted additional time and resources playing phone tag all around the state trying to get some paperworkpushing clerk to give me permission to do what i knew to be right and by the way we pay for this which is what truly amazes me what should we do i suggest we all write to our state and federal elected officials demanding that they return the right of selfdetermination in health matters to us by passing the patients bill of rights and similar state statutes it is no wonder the doctors are unionizing perhaps the patients should too he was talking about an eye injury but we just know that with the case of eye injury or so many other serious problems that people face the same reality all i am really saying tonight because this may be the last opportunity we get to talk about this before the august break is let us bring up the patients bill of rights let us bring up hmo reform let those democrats and those republicans and i see my colleague is going to come after me the gentleman from iowa let us put together a bill i think that is very close to the patients bill of rights that really provides comprehensive hmo reform this is what the public wants this is what we keep hearing every day from our constituents and i know that i am going to use the time during this august break to go out and explain to the public why we need to bring this up on the floor of the house when we come back in september i am confident when i see people like my colleague the gentleman from iowa and others on the republican side that are demanding that we take action that when we come back in september either through the means of a discharge petition or because the republican leadership finally sees they have to do something that we will see comprehensive hmo reform but i am not going to rest and i know the gentleman from iowa and a lot of us are not going to rest until that happens"], [0.001241922378540039, 0.99875807762146, 1, "in the dark of night the republican majoritys committee on rules voted for nothing for american seniors however i refuse today to add to their farce by voting again for nothing i will not vote for this republican bill that provides no prescription drug benefit for the seniors in my district i will not support the continuance of the travesty of seniors having money only to pay for rent and food and dying because they cannot pay for their needed prescription drugs the democrats have a plan that has no deductible a plan that will allow a minimum premium of 25 and cover 2 000 of costs in my own community hmos and health coverage insurance companies have jumped up and run out of town or simply shut down i will not condemn my seniors to dialing a phone number to some insurance company and there is a busy signal because that insurance company refuses to cover the costs of the prescription drugs this republican bill is a sham vote it down and get on with the work we should do provide a guaranteed drug prescription plan for americas seniors as the democrats plan provides i rise to respond to this newest attempt by the majority to mislead this nations seniors into the belief that they are truly concemed about prescription drug coverage what the majority is proposing today fails as a legitimate response to the democrats longstanding position that americas seniors need a comprehensive drug benefit today the elderly constitute 13 percent of the population yet account for more than onethird of the nations annual drug expenditures since 1968 the percentage of seniors expenditures on prescription drugs has risen from 64 annually to 848 annually which amounts to 4 1 percent of their incomes additionally despite the fact that 65 percent of the 39 million beneficiaries have some private or public coverage many still do not have adequate supplemental coverage for drug costs to address this gap in medical coverage for our nations elderly president clinton proposed a medicare reform plan but at that time the republicans felt that addressing this issue was not politically expedient yet in light of the hotly debated presidential and congressional races it appears that the republicans have suddenly gotten religion this latest revelation by the majority is not even that in fact this bill is merely a revelation that the polls indicate it is politically necessary for republicans to at least address the issue of prescription drug benefits even if their bill is void of any real relief for this nations seniors senior and consumer advocates groups alike oppose the majoritys prescription drug bill because it is fundamentally at odds with any meaningful prescription drug bill groups like the national council of senior citizens the national committee to preserve social security and medicare and families usa the national senior citizens law center and the american association of people with disabilities oppose the majoritys plan we must pay attention to this nations seniors when they tell us that the majoritys rx 2000 act risks the health and well being of not only seniors but also people with disabilities it is particularly enlightening when the head of the health insurance association of america even admits that the republicans concept of a socalled drugonly private insurance simply would not work in practice the seniors living in the 18th congressional district of texas located in the city of houston want real relief from the high price of prescription drugs they have always told me that you have to watch what someone does not what they say in order to know what kind of person you are dealing with let me tell you what you are dealing with under the republican plan because to hear it from their mouths one would believe that all this nations seniors and the disabled would be provided with the prescription drug coverage they need however that is not the case the democratic prescription drug plan is secure because it is part of the medicare system however the republican scheme relies on private insurance the democratic plan provides comprehensive coverage through the medicare program while the republican scheme hopes the private insurers will provide these benefits can we really trust such a scheme that is based on the profit of big insurance companies that are in the business to make money without regard to affordability or reliability the biggest issue in the debate on a medicare drug plan is how much will seniors be required to pay out of pocket in order to receive this benefit under the democratic plan there is no deductible while the republicans want our nations elderly to pay 250 a year if the household were two elderly people than they would be expected to pay 500 a year in medical prescriptions before they earn their benefit to prescription medicines under the democratic plan medicare will pay half the costs of medicines up to 2000 and by the year 2009 medicare will pay half of all prescription expenses for seniors up to 5000 the republicans will only pay half the cost of medicines up to 2100 increasing at the rate of inflation in drug prices under the democratic plan you can see that the real meaning of catastrophic is understood to be a great often sudden calamity which ordinary people could not possibly plan to overcome without assistance for this reason the democratic plan has a catastrophic benefit limit of 4 000 after which medicare pays all costs unfortunately the republicans have a total life time limit of 6 000 i am disappointed that the needs of seniors is not at the top of the houses legislative agenda for consideration of a bill that should have addressed the life and death issue of affordable prescription medication especially for our nations elderly poor therefore i ask that my colleagues on both sides of the isle use reason and right mindedness to find the best road to a real prescription for what is ailing our nations medicare system which every american knows is affordable prescription medication for our nations seniors our nations elderly have given to this nation the opportunity to successfully compete in todays everchanging worid which has lead to great economic prosperity for all of us now that our economy and our nations people are in a position to reap benefits that are far in a excess of our current needs we should not hesitate to provide those benefits which are needed by our nations disabled and senior citizens this is a small investment for our nation so that our society can benefit from a healthier senior population which happens to be a vital and growing sector of our nations economy it is a fact that the baby boomer generation who will be retiring over the next decade will be the wealthiest group of seniors in our nations history for this reason their long health and active participation as consumers in our nations economy makes great economic sense i urge my colleagues to oppose this critically flawed semblance of a prescription drug plan offered by the majority and support meaningful prescription drug plans to improve the health of our nations elderiy"], [0.0012532472610473633, 0.9987467527389526, 1, "i am very happy to join the distinguished group of members from new jersey and new york and michigan who have been here speaking about these issues and to bring a massachusetts point of view to some of what is being said here we are we are almost finished with the 1999 congressional session we have five major budgets yet to go we are only 5 weeks late some of the states have been later than that but we are very likely going to be done in a couple of weeks and maybe even some are saying within one week yet this has been really a strange session legislative bodies usually try to do the things that meet the popular will but the republican leadership of this congress in 1999 does not even try to deal with issues that the largest number of americans say again and again that they want done for the first time in 30 years we have the prospect for modest and growing surpluses we have the money to do those most important things that people really want done and yet the republican leadership has refused to bring forward a bill that would extend the social security system so that the next generation would have the same opportunity to have the social security system for them that my generation has andwill have secure for them the same leadership the same republican leadership has refused to extend the life of the overall medicare program that has been such a boon for our senior citizens in making certain that they could have quality health care that they can afford it is clear as has already been said from the way they have set up the conference committee on the patients bill of rights that they really do not intend to pass a patients bill of rights that would take the medical treatment decisions for every american family away from insurance executives and accountants and give those treatment decisions back to doctors where they belong the same republican leadership has refused to add even a modest prescription drug benefit to the medicare program we have millions of senior citizens who are paying 200 or 300 for prescription drugs well maybe not millions but we have a lot of senior citizens who are paying 200 and 300 a month for their prescription drugs and they really cannot afford it by the way we have seen the spectacle of this house passing a campaign finance reform bill in a matter of just a few weeks with the votes of dozens of republican members who courageously refused to follow their leadership in weakening that legislation only to see the bill killed in the other body in the senate there simply is not going to be any campaign finance reform this year or in this 106th congress and very likely in this century along the way why well just as an example it should not surprise anybody out here in the watching audience that drug companies steadfastly oppose the creation of a prescription drug benefit to the medicare system because they are making great profits off drug prescriptions for senior citizens and those end up substantially being paid by the government they are making great profits and oh by the way it should not surprise people that of the 10 largest corporate contributors to republican leadership political action committees that a majority of those are themselves the drug companies so then we have among those other things that have not been done this year there is a proposal to increase the minimum wage by 1 over 2 years we have had an unprecedented good economy growth in our economy over an 8year period we havethe lowest unemployment rate in decades we have people working at minimum wage who deserve to see some benefit for their work and only get to see that benefit if there is an increase in the minimum wage by the way 80 percent of americans favored an increase in the minimum wage just as similar numbers favor a patients bill of rights and favor the prescription drug benefit for senior citizens to be added to our medicare program and favor the extension of our overall medicare program so that the life of that program will go beyond the year 2015 which is now the time when it will go bankrupt well the extension of the social security system for the next generation all of those things are favored by 75 percent or 80 percent of americans and even 67 percent of republicans favor the minimum wage bill a bill that we could pass in a clean way in a day the republican leadership is going to allow to come to this floor only a bill only a bill that carries with it about 70 billion of tax breaks for the 1 percent of americans who make over 300 000 a year now they are going to hold a simple minimum wage increase a 1 wage increase for the lowest income workers in this country they are going to hold that bill hostage to a huge tax reduction for the wealthiest 1 percent of americans who are the people who contribute mostly to political campaigns to their own political pac campaigns and such so all of these things are interconnected many people do understand how interconnected why we get the legislation that we get why we do not get the bills that the gentleman has shown so graphically the rest in pieces the campaign finance is a pretty critical question in these the influence of money in the passage of legislation in what legislation comes up before us and what is allowed to be debated and what ends up being passed by this congress inathis 106th congress is a critically important matter until we can get campaign finance reform to pass through here and not be juggled between the two branches and killed by the one branch and maybe next year it will end up being killed by this branch and it is passed by the senate or something it is critical that we do something about campaign finance reform or we are going to continue to see this musical chairs process by which those bills that the americans by the largest numbers say they want us to do because those are important to them in their daily lives those bills are not going to be handled this year or next year and the second year of this session so i am very happy to join with the gentlemen that have been here tonight the gentleman from new jersey has shown such leadership in bringing to the attention of the american people these kinds of ironies in how we are functioning what we are not doing what we should be doing what the american people want us to do that is not getting done i am very happy to add a massachusetts viewto what has already been said"], [0.0012552738189697266, 0.9987447261810303, 1, "it is very important that we keep up the pressure in this house to pass hmo reform despite the overwhelming support among the american people for hmo or managed care reform the republican leadership continues to let the issue languish we still have no indication when or even if they will allow the patients bill of rights to come to the house floor for a vote the reason for this activity is the same asit was last year the republican leadership cannot figure out how they can pass a good managed care bill without alienating the insurance agency so instead of doing what is right and best for the american people they are once again appeasing the insurance industry and hoping an answer to this problem will magically fall from out of the sky unfortunately as the leadership sits and waits and does nothing the shortcomings of the system continue to forever change the lives of countless americans we need only to turn on the tv or open the newspaper to see this i would like to use one example here tonight and that is the issue of emergency room care earlier this month usa today ran an editorial on this issue it was called early last year starts the editorial it mentions that a seattle woman began suffering chest pains and numbness while driving the pain was so severe that she pulled into a fire station seeking help only to be whisked to the nearest hospital where she was promptly admitted to most that would seem a prudent course of action but not to her health plan it denied payment because she did not call the plan first to get preauthorized according to an investigation by the washington state insurance commissioner i mentioned this editorial as an example of the problems people have with their hmos in terms of access and paying to for emergency room care let me just go on to talk about this editorial again the editorial says that this incident is typical of the enumerable bureaucratic hassles patients confront as hmos and other managed care companies attempt to control costs but denial of payment for emergency care presents a particularly dangerous doublewhammy patients facing emergencies might feel they have to choose between putting their health at risk and paying a huge bill they may not be able to afford the editorial in usa today goes on to suggest a solution to the problem noting that a national prudent layperson standard law covering all health plans would help fill in the gaps left by the current patchwork of state and federal laws democrats have been basically making this point about managed care for a long time we know that people have had problems with their hmos if they need to use an emergency room either because they are told to go to a hospital emergency room a lot further away from where they live or where the accident occurred or as in this case that i just mentioned the actual payment afterwards is denied because they did not seek preauthorization which seems nonsensical certainly in the context of emergency room care one only goes to an emergency room if it is an emergency if one has to get preauthorization for it it really is not an emergency that is the dilemma that more and more americans face that their hmo plan does not cover emergency room care the democrats in response to this have introduced a bill called the patients bill of rights basically what we do in the patients bill of rights is say that the prudent laypersons standard applies in other words if the average person the average prudent person if you will decided that they had chest pains or they had a problem that necessitated going to the local emergency room then they can go to the emergency room that is closest by and the hmo has to pay has to compensate for that care has to pay for that emergency room care in the last congress we the democrats tried to bring up the patients bill of rights the patients bill of rights provides a number of patient protections not just the emergency room care but access to specialists it basically applies the principle that says if particular care is necessary medically necessary and in the opinion of ones doctor is medically necessary then it is covered and the hmo has to cover that particular type of care in the last congress the republican leadership did not hold a single hearing on the patients bill of rights or even on an alternative managed care bill that they had proposed so what we had to do basically was to seek what we call a discharge petition we had to have a number of our colleagues come down to the well here and sign a discharge petition that said that the patients bill of rights should be allowed to come to the floor as we reached the magical number that was necessary in order to bring the patients bill of rights to the floor the republican leadership finally decided that they would bring their own managed care reform bill to the floor in the context of that we were allowed to bring up the patients bill of rights i think we are going to have to be forced to do that again basically in this session of congress even though the patients bill of rights have been reintroduced and even though there are some republican managed care reform proposals so far the republican leadership has refused to bring up hmo reform either their bill which is not as good or the patients bill of rights the democratic bill so what we have had to do again and starting tomorrow is to file a rule allowing for a discharge petition to be brought up and have as many members of congress come down to the well again in a couple of weeks and sign this discharge petition in order to force the republican leadership to bring the patients bill of rights to the floor it should not be that way it should not be necessary that in order to achieve hmo reform that we have to sign a petition as members of congress to bring it up it simply should be brought up in committee there should be hearings it should be voted on in committee to come to the floor but so far we have nothing but stalling tactics from the republican leadership i mentioned the example of emergency room care but there are a lot of other examples that we can mention about why we need patient protections why we need the patients bill of rights let me just give my colleagues another example though we have a democratic task force on health care which basically put together the patients bill of rights we had some hearings on the patients bill of rights in the context of our democratic health care task force because we could not get hearings in the regular committees of the house because of the opposition from the republican leadership i just wanted to mention another example because i think it is one of the most egregious that came before us when we had this hearing we invited a dr charlotte yeh who is a practicing emergency physician at the new england medical center in boston to the hearing that we had she provided a number of examples of the effects that the managed care industries approach to emergency room care is having on patients including one from boston she told our task force about a boy whose leg was seriously injured in an auto accident at a nearby hospital in boston emergency room doctors told the parents he would need vascular surgery to save his leg and that a surgeon was ready at that hospital to perform the operation unfortunately for this young man his insurer insisted he be transferred to an innetwork hospital for the surgery his parents were told if they allowed the operation to be done anywhere else they would be responsible to the bill they agreed to the move surgery was performed 3 hours after the accident by then it was too late to save the boys leg dr yeh went on to express her very strong support to making the prudent laypersons standard the national standard for emergency room care as i said before basically the prudent laypersons standard says if one does go to the emergency room to seek treatment under conditions that would prompt any reasonable person to go there ones hmo would pay for it but in addition to the prudent laypersons standard dr yeh also emphasized the need to eliminate restrictive prior authorization requirements and the establishment of poststabilization services between emergency physicians and managed care plans the patients bill of rights includes all of these types of provisions if i could for a minute just run through some of the protections that are included in the patients bill of rights it guarantees access to needed health care specialists very important it provides as i said access to emergency room services when and where the need arise it provides continuity of care protections to assure patient care if a patients health care provider is dropped it gives access to a timely internal and independent external appeals process let me mention that for a minute if one is denied care right now because ones hmos decides that they will not pay for it one of the things that my constituents complain to me about is that they have no way to appeal that decision other than internally within the hmo so if the hmo decides for example that a particular type of treatment is not medically necessary or that one does not have to stay in the hospital a couple more days even though ones doctor thinks that one should be staying there or a number of other things that they consider not medically necessary well most of the times under current law there is no appeal other than to the hmo itself and they of course routinely deny the appeal because for them it is largely a cost issue what we are saying in the patients bill of rights is that that person should be able to go to an external appeal someone outside the hmo or a panel outside the hmo that would review the case and decide whether or not that care should be provided and paid for by the hmo in addition what we say is that if one has been damaged for some reason god forbid that one needed some kind of procedure or one needed to stay in the hospital a few more days and the hmo refused to allow that and as a result one suffered injury and damage then one should be able to bring suit in a court of law and recover for those damages most people do not realize that option does not exist today for a lot of people who are in hmo plans because the federal government has said that in the case of people covered by a federal plan or where the federal government has usurped or preempted the state law for those who are mostly selfinsured by their employer that there is no recourse to seek damages in a court of law that is not right it is not right someone should be able to sue for damages and sue the hmo if they have been denied care and if they have been hurt or damaged as a result of that just to mention a couple more things we also have in the patients bill of rights we assure that doctors and patients can openly discuss treatment options because oftentimes hmos tell the doctors they cannot tell about treatment options that are not covered the socalled gag rule we assure that women have direct access to an ob gyn as i said we provide an enforcement mechanism that ensures recourse for patients who have been maimed or die as a result of health plan actions there are a lot more things that we can go into and we will tonight but i yield to the gentlewoman from texas"], [0.0012578368186950684, 0.9987421631813049, 1, "we will be taking this hour i will be joined by many of my fellow democrats blue dogs and perhaps several others today to talk about the budget to talk about debt reduction and as paul harvey says quite often to talk about the rest of the story that which we are not hearing in much of the rhetoric that is going on today the first point i want to make is that through august 31 2000 there has been no surplus other than trust fund surpluses you would not believe that with the carriedaway rhetoric that all of us have been guilty of using of late the 4 6 trillion projected surplus over the next 10 years remember that is projected but more important remember that as of august 31 of this year there still has been no surplus other than trust funds and therefore that is why many of us on this side of the aisle have been arguing that before we spend these projected surpluses that we ought to fix social security and medicare first that we ought to be doing the nations business today instead of adjourning at 3 oclock in the afternoon or completing business at 2 15 we ought to be dealing in the respective committees with how do we fix medicare and the tremendous needs of rural health care why have we been on the floor for the last several weeks talking about tax cuts of 1 3 trillion when you add them all up again spending projected surpluses before we fix social security and medicare again let us calm ourselves and acknowledge the fact that as of august 31 there is no surplus other than trust fund surpluses that is why today the blue dog democrats reiterated the plan that we were talking about at the beginning of this session of congress the same plan that we brought to the floor of the house that got if memory serves me correct 177 votes 144 democrats and i believe 37 republicans joined with us that would be 181 not quite a majority but there was a significant bipartisan group that recognized that you needed a plan if you were going to accomplish all of the rhetoric that both sides take part in from time to time today we come to the floor to discuss in quite some detail the plan that the blue dogs put forward months ago that we reiterate today the blue dog outline demonstrates that it is still possible to reach an agreement on a fiscally responsible budget plan that pays off the debt maintains fiscal discipline and provides substantial tax relief including estate tax relief and marriage penalty repeal the blue dogs have been advocating debt reduction since surplus projections first materialized 2 years ago the republican leadership has adopted blue dog rhetoric in the last few days on debt reduction but only for 1 year and the question we ask today of the leadership of this house is why only 1 year if debt reduction is truly something that we all agree on in a bipartisan way why not do it over a 10year period the blue dogs believe that to be meaningful a commitment to debt reduction must be longterm that is why we are calling on the leadership of this house to extend the principles of their debt reduction lockbox for 10 years under the blue dog framework 3 65 trillion 80 percent of the unified surplus would be devoted to debt reduction over 10 years this would put us on the path to eliminate the publicly held debt by 2010 that is what we say we are for why do we not have policies on this floor that do that which we say why do we continue on having political rallies talking about debt reduction when we really do not mean it except for 1 year that is a question we ask and hopefully someone will come to the floor and answer that question it would be nice to have some simple discussions of these points instead of just one side talking to the other in the absence of the other we will be here by contrast the debt reduction lockbox passed last week would only reserve 60 percent of the unified surplus for debt reduction over the next 10 years blue dogs say 80 republican leadership says 60 and still says we are doing a better job we do not understand that the blue dog framework would result in the budget being balanced without counting any trust funds beginning in 2001 the gentleman from mississippi has been the one that continues to bring the record from treasury source monthly statement of the public debt that anyone can pick up which is what i was talking about when i started my comments today there is no surplus except trust fund surpluses if we are conservative in our approach we can begin paying off the debt without using any of the trust fund surpluses beginning in 2001 if we can only reach an agreement on a 10year debt reduction plan it will establish a foundation that will make it much easier to reach an agreement on significant tax cuts including estate tax relief and repeal of the marriage penalty without jeopardizing fiscal discipline the blue dogs are prepared to work within the 90 10 framework for fiscal year 2001 to balance competing priorities ironically where we have been talking about 50 25 25 for 10 years 90 10 fitg almost exactly with where we believe we ought to be in the year 2001 the blue dogs believe that it is important that congress and the president look beyond the shortterm cost of legislation and keep in mind the longterm impact of budget decisions we make today before agreeing on any tax cuts or new spending programs we need to know how all of these proposals add up over the next 5 to 10 years even if they fit within the 90 10 framework for next year it is important that this congress consider the 10year costs of any tax cuts and new spending initiatives not just the cost in fiscal 2001 likewise once congress and the president agree on the level of discretionary spending for next year and this is what is being fought out it bothered me considerably when i see on the front page of the washington post this morning that members of the other body in the other party are talking about spending is going to go out of the window it should not all we have to do is agree on a framework of what spending should be this year in a bipartisan way working with the white house i believe that is achievable that is the blue dog plan we have looked at the presidents proposals we have looked at the republican budget and we have said somewhere in between is where we need to be close to the middle i think if all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle would look at this proposal we hope they would find the same degree of enthusiasm for it that we bring to the floor today once we get through the 90 10 for 2001 let us talk about the 10 percent how do we propose spending that 10 percent of the projected surplus remember there is no surplus as yet it is projected but we do believe if we stay fiscally conservative with our spending and our taxcutting euphoria that what i am saying today can be achieved we have a projected surplus of 268 billion for fiscal year 2001 ten percent of that is 26 8 billion and that is to be divided between tax cuts and spending divided equally between medicare provider restorations and discretionary spending and tax cuts the blue dog framework would allow a tax cut of 8 5 billion in 2001 and 377 billion over the next 10years this will allow for estate tax and marriage tax penalty relief with room for other tax cuts of 4 4 billion in 2001 and approximately 200 billion over the next 10 years why should we be considering today going home without dealing responsibly with the marriage tax penalty why should we be going home in a few weeks or days without dealing responsibly with the death tax when everyone in this body knows there is a good sound conservative middle ground that would be very appealing to every single small businessman and woman in the united states and give significant relief to everyone above 4 million in estates why would we go home without completing our work devoting an additional 8 5 billion for discretionary spending will provide room to increase spending in the appropriation bills to fund agricultural disaster relief increase funding levels for education health care veterans and military retiree health care all of which have bipartisan agreement that we do need to make some increases in those areas we also provide for 8 5 billion in 2001 to address problems facing health care providers as a result of the reductions of the 1997 balanced budget agreement the kind that our rural hospitals are clamoring praying for the relief so that they do not have to close all of this can be achieved within the framework of debt reduction sincere debt reduction recognizing also that the surpluses that everybody talks about are projected one of the fundamental questions this body should be concerned a little bit about is when we look at this debt that we are talking about onethird of it is owned by foreign interests and the question that we all want to answer i think sooner than later how much longer can our economy continue to grow at the unprecedented rate that it has for the last 8 years how much longer can we go in the longest sustained peacetime economic expansion in the history of our country can we go another 2 months 3 months 6 months 1 year 2 years no one knows the answer to that question but the blue dogs believe that the most conservative thing we can do right now is spend our time discussing how we fix social security and medicare for the future and until we do that let us pay down the debt and let us be very fiscally prudent with the expenditure of our taxpayer dollars that is our message at this point i

the health care problems that they face and with the hospitals and the nursing homes and the home health agencies that are trying to provide quality health care then after that i would like to get into the three major issues that most of my constituents and most americans talk to members of congress about and that is trying to reform hmos trying to provide a prescription drug benefit for seniors and trying to deal with the 42 million americans who now have no health insurance let me start with this tax bill that was voted on and that the republican leadership brought up because they suggested i think inaccurately that what they were trying to accomplish was to deal with some of the problems that occurred with the balanced budget act which was passed a few years ago which cut back significantly on the money that was going to hospitals to home health care agencies to nursing homes and to hmos and that the reimbursement rate from the federal government from medicare medicaid and some of the other federal programs that provide funding to these facilities or to these programs that provide health care services needed to be readdressed that there was too little of a reimbursement rate under medicare and medicaid and that more money needed to go back to these programs or facilities if they were going to provide a quality health care the problem though was that in making these adjustments in this tax bill the republican leadership essentially gave most of the money to hmos in a fashion that i find totally objectionable because the hmos were not only getting huge amounts of money back from the federal government but were really not caused to do anything for the average american in order to receive those funds i said today in a press conference that we had outside on the lawn of the capitol with some of my democratic colleagues that the reason this was happening the reason why the tax bill was so favorable to the hmos is because basically the republican leadership has bought into the hmos and the special interests that are associated with the hmos and supports them because of the special interest funding that is made available what we see the hmos doing is that the hmos are leading the battle against the medicare prescription drug benefit and leading the battle against hmo reform the democrats and some republicans have tried to pass a bill called the patients bill of rights we know it as the norwooddingell bill it is bipartisan but it is opposed by the republican leadership the norwooddingell bill would make significant reforms to address the abuses of the hmos but the hmos are fighting that tooth and nail as well as the prescription drug benefit so i think that basically what happened here is the republican leadership sides with the hmos because they are basically against the medicare prescription drug benefit and against the patients bill of rights we also see that the hmos are spending a lot of money funding negative ads against those individuals democrats and against some republicans who support the patients bill of rights who support hmo reform who support having a prescription drug benefit under medicare so this is the sort of unholy alliance here that manifested itself yesterday with this tax bill to give more money back to the hmos now let me talk a little bit about this bill because i just want to show how unfair it was and how little it would accomplish in terms of addressing the health care needs that americans face today first of all and just to give my colleagues some figureg about the amount of money that was going to the hmos the republican plan this tax bill increases payments to medicare hmos by over 10 billion over 5 years and over 30 billion over 10 years despite the fact that only 16 percent of medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in hmos right now we know that what the hmos have been doing is they have been dropping senior citizens left and right as of july 1 i think there are over 700 000 seniors across the country that have been dropped by hmos to provide their medicare benefits over the last few years so a lot of these hmos got into the medicare program and then they dropped the seniors yet over onethird of the allocation in this tax bill over onethird of the allocation for health care that goes back to health care providers goes to hmos only 16 percent of medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in hmos my colleagues get some idea there of the inequity here now in addition to that we know that a lot of these hmos have dropped out of medicare so one might say to oneself well if they are making an argument they need more money to stay in medicare then why when we give them this windfall these billions of dollars this 30 percent of this overall budget then why do we not require that they come back into medicare and provide certain benefits well that makes sense but that is not what the republican leadership did there was no guarantee that these hmo plans will not drop out of communities or medicare altogether when it is no longer in their interest to remain as many of them have there is no guarantee that they will put new money towards maintaining benefits rather than shoring up their bottom line so we could have said okay we will give hmos all this money in the tax bill but they have to sign a contract saying they are going to stay in medicare for 2 years or 3 years or even 1 year we could have said okay we will give them this money but they have to make sure that they provide at least a level of benefits and prescription drugs for these 16 percent of seniors that are on medicare that they are providing now but we do not have that in the bill nothing like that just give them the money and that is fine they can continue to drop out of the program if they want to it is blatantly unfair it is just basically pandering to special interests now let me go beyond that to the next issue why is it that so much of this money is going to hmos again when so few seniors are in hmos that are in medicare we know that we have greater needs in a lot of other areas the hospitals do not get that much hospitals many have closed i had one in my district in south amboy that closed within the last year or so nursing homes many nursing homes are bankrupt i visited with some i went to a nursing home last week one of the days and talked to some of the residents i found out from the operators that there are i do not know what the percentage is but a significant percentage of the nursing homes in the state of new jersey are now bankrupt and some of them are closing home health care agencies very little money under this tax bill these are the providers remember the hmo is an insurance company they are getting this money now from this windfall from this republcan tax bill and they are going to go out and they are going to pay the hospitals or they are going to pay the nursing homes or they are going to pay the providers of health care services they are not providing the services but yet we shortchange the providers we do not give the money to the hospitals some of which are closing we do not give the money to the nursing homes some of which are closing we do not give the money to the home health care providers who are directly providing services it makes no sense it makes no sense at all unless one looks at it from the point of view that the hmos are special interests that are doing the republican leadership a favor and that are railing against hmo reform and a medicare prescription drug benefit now let me go to the last thing then i am going to get off the issue of this tax bill but i do think it is important and that is that the republican leadership said well one of the things we are going to do in this tax bill is we are going to try to address the problems of the uninsured by giving what we call an aboveline deduction for health insurance a tax deduction okay well we know that there are 42 million or so americans now that do not have health insurance now these are working people because if one is really poor and one is not working one is eligible for medicaid and the federal government pays for ones health insurance but if one is in a lowincome bracket but one is working or even middleincome bracket it depends and one is working a lot of times ones employer will not provide one with health insurance because maybe i is costing him too much or whatever the reason and one has to go and try to buy ones health insurance on the private market or maybe the employer has some kind of a plan but it is very expensive whatever the reasons these 42 million people are pretty much working people that do not have health insurance on the job or cannot afford to buy it in the private market so what the democrats have been saying what vice president gore and president clinton have been saying let us gradually try to address some of the groups that make up this uninsured we know the largest group is the children we know the second largest group is near elderly people between 55 and 65 that are not eligible for medicare yet these are some of the groups what the democrats have been doing and we actually did get the support of the republicans eventually we had to drag them along on this but we eventually did get the support of the republicans to pass a kids health initiative a couple years ago that gradually has been getting to the point where we think about half of the children that are uninsured will have some sort of insurance with money paid for by the federal government well what vice president gore has been saying is that he wants to increase the income eligibility so that right now if one is say 200 percent of poverty and one is eligible for this kids care program we will raise it to 250 percent of poverty or 300 percent of poverty and try to get more of these lower middle class people who are working and their kids into this chip or kids care program well we found of course that the republican leadership does not want to do that that would have been the logical thing to do in this tax bill would be to expand eligibility for the kid care program or another thing that we could have done and this is another thing that vicepresident gore has proposed and the democrats here in the house is to enroll the parents of those kids in the health insurance program because we know that those parents if they cannot get health insurance for the kids other than through the federal government they are not able to get it for themselves in this tax bill we could have put a provision there for the near elderly what the democrats have been saying is they would like to see the people between 55 and 65 be able to buy into medicare at their own expense they would buy into medicare but no the republican leadership does not want to do any of those things this is what they said they said we are going to give you an aboveline tax deduction i am not going to get into all the details of that but basically that has two problems first of all very few of the people who are now without health insurance who are sort of lower middle class category very few of them will be able to take advantage of this deduction and go out and buy health insurance first of all because most of them do not have incomes where that deduction is significant enough to be able to use it to buy a health insurance policy which in the private market may be 3 000 to 4 000 a year secondly what we find with this aboveline deduction is that it creates a disincentive for employers to provide health insurance as a consequence a lot more employers may decide not to provide health insurance and instead actually increase the ranks of the uninsured the only people that really are able to take advantage of this are people that already have health insurance that are making a decent income and can take advantage of the deduction but if one is trying to increase the number of insured people and take the uninsured off the rolls this accomplishes virtually nothing it just helps people who are in a higher income bracket and who already have health insurance again it sounds so critical the republican leadership brought up this bill yesterday or the day beforewhen they brought it out here and they said we are going to try to do all these things we want to address some of the health care concerns of the american public with this bill but whether it is the question of the uninsured it is ineffective whether it is the question of addressing the prescription drug prices it is ineffective because it does not provide any guarantees one is going to get prescription drugs under any kind of hmo plan certainly it does not even address the effort to reform the hmos with the patients bill of rights that the democrats have been talking about so i just want to say once again we see the republican leadership aligned with the special interests the drug companies the hmos the health insurance companies not doing anything that is going to help the average american now i wanted to talk a little bit because i think it is important i mentioned before earlier that there are three major health care issues that are not being addressed by this congress we only have a few more days every one of these issues could have been addressed and could have come to the floor the democrats have been pushing for them for these issues and for legislation to address these concerns to come to the floor it appears in the dying days of this congress that these issues are simply not going to be addressed they should be it is not fair it does not address the concerns of the average american now the first one i want to talk about is the patients bill of rights hmo reform we know from our own constituents i can certainly say for my constituents that one of the biggest problems people face is if they are in an hmo oftentimes they are denied access to the care that they need that their physician says that they need now that may be the individual who goes to the hospital and finds that the doctor says to them that they need to stay a couple extra days in the hospital after recuperating from a particular operation or it may be the individual who has the need for a particular operation and the hmo says they are not going to pay for it they are not going to cover it there are so many situations there are situations where people their hmo plans say that they cannot go to the local hospital they have to go to a hospital 50 miles away they may be in a situation where they want to go to the local emergency room and they have to go to the one 50 miles away otherwise it is not covered these are the kinds of abuses that we see not every day but on a fairly regular basis a lot of people come to my office and complain about these things now what the democrats said is well we want to address these abuses generally the plan that the democrats put forth with some republicans the patients bill of rights the norwooddingell bill has two major ways of correcting the abuses in sort of an overall sense one is that it provides that if a decision has to be made about what kind of care one is going to get that that decision rather than being made by the insurance company is made by the physician and the patient the definition if you will of what ismedically necessary the hospital stay the particular operation of what is medically necessary is made by the physician and the patient and not by the insurance company the second thing it does in a broad sense is the patients bill of rights says that if one is denied care because the insurance company says one cannot have that operation for example then one has to have an ability to redress that grievance the patients bill of rights does it in essentially two ways one it siys that one can go to a board outside the jurisdiction or outside of the umbrella of the hmo an independent review board that will look at the case and decide whether the hmo made the wrong decision in denying one that care absent that or sort of an appeal from the review board is that one can go to court and one can bring suit these are really very simple things basically what happened here is that the democratic leadership the vice president the president got together and we were able to get some republicans on the other side initiated by republicans that were physicians the gentleman from georgia the gentleman from iowa and some others to join us and put together the patients bill of rights the norwooddingell bill the republican leadership opposed it the republican leadership did not want to bring it to the floor we went out and got a discharge petition which is a way of coming up to the well here october 27 2000 and getting almost a majority of the members to sign a petition saying we want it brought to the floor the republican leadership eventually brought it to the floor it passed with almost every democrat and maybe a third of the republicans it went over to the senate where it was killed by the senators who will not even let it come out of conference between the two houses but again this is an important piece of legislation just as important as a prescription drug benefit under medicare just as important as trying to address the problems of the uninsured and we find that the republican leadership in this house of representatives simply will not let any of these good measures move forward they have stopped them and they are still stopping them in the waning hours of this congress i see i have been joined this evening by two of my colleagues who have been out front on all of these issues over the last 2 years and even bey ond that and i am very pleased to see them here i will first yield to my colleague from texas who has done so many things but i think probably the best example i saw was the period of time in his district where he spoke to the different senior groups and had them bring in their prescription drugs and tell him about the problems that they faced with prescription drugs and actually brought the pill bottles down here and suggested the rest of us do the same and we very dramatically showed along with the gentleman from texas about what kind of problems the average senior faces in texas and in all of our districts so i yield to the gentleman from texas at this point"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.9979896545410156, 0.9979896545410156, 0, "i want to recognize two members on the house floor tonight the gentleman from california who is chairman of the house committee on rules has been a tireless advocate on behalf of the hightech industry i do not know of anyone who has worked harder invested more time and energy or is more responsible for the bill that we are considering tonight being on the house floor and i would like to congratulate him in advance on the expected passage of this bill second of all the gentleman from utah who just yielded me the time is an active member of the subcommittee on immigration and claims and he too has been a steadfast advocate of the hightech industry the gentleman from utah himself is an entrepreneur and he understands firsthand the needs of the hightech industry although there is still no objective credible study that documents the shortage of american hightech workers the ins said recently that the demand for highly skilled foreign workers is running at least 50 000 ahead of last year such a demand can indicate an actual shortage of american workers a spot shortage a preference for cheap labor or replacement workers or something else but because of the importance of the hightech industry to our economy i think we should give the industry the benefit of the doubt but giving hightech companies the benefit of the doubt is not without risk unless we safeguard american workers we need to recognize the opposition of the american people to an hlb visa increase two major polls demonstrate that the vast majority of americans do not want to see the number of hightech visas increased so much and worry that it will hurt american workers a peter hart poll conducted in march found that 73 percent of americans do not want to see immigration law changed to allow the entry of more foreign hightech workers only 20 percent wanted more foreign workers a harris poll released in september 1998 found that 82 percent of americans do not want to see the hlb quota increased the poll found that 77 percent of americans believe that an increase in hlb visas reduces employment opportunities for american workers and 86 percent of americans believe that unitedstates companies should train unitedstates workers to perform jobs in technical fields even if it is faster and less expensive to fill the jobs with foreign workers to satisfy the concerns of the american people we need to protect american workers from being undercut by foreign workers in the hlb program s 2045 contains no significant provisions to protect these american workers it does not require most companies to make a goodfaith effort to recruit unitedstates workers before hiring foreign workers it allows all but a small handful of firms to lay off american workers and replace the american workers with foreign workers why would anyone oppose these common sense safeguards what amazes me is that in all the discussions i have had with representatives of hightech companies not a single one has expressed any concern about the impact of this legislation on american workers how could anyone oppose a safeguard that says american workers could not be fired and replaced by a foreign worker how could anyone not agree to advertise for american workers before hiring from abroad how could anyone oppose paying foreign workers what the average beginning salary is for american college graduates unless they want to undercut american wages the committee on the judiciary passed a bill h r 4227 that contains an additional crucial safeguard for american workers the committee on the judiciary passed a bill that set a floor on wages for these workers 40 000 per year this wage is a good starting point for any hightech professional it is a salary that american students fresh out of college are making this crucial safeguard would prevent unitedstates companies from hiring foreign workers to undercut the wages of american workers strong antifraud measures are also necessary to address known abuses an article in last thursdays san francisco chronicle says it all federal authorities have started nationwide investigations into the hiring of foreign hightech workers including charges of visa fraud and allegations that the practice is riddled with abuse the chronicle quotes bill yates of the ins as stating but are we catching most of the fraud the truthful answer is that we are not if it is the intention of the employee or the employer to defraud the government you may not be able to ferret it out a justreleased government accounting office report states there is not sufficient assurance that ins reviews are adequate for detecting program noncompliance or abuse the program is vulnerable to abuse both by employers who do not have bona fide jobs to fill or do not meet required labor conditions and by potential workers who present false credentials the goals of preventing abuse of the program and providing efficient services to employers and workers are not being achieved evidence suggests that program noncompliance or abuse by employers may be more prevalent than under other laws any hlb bill should contain effective antifraud measures as are contained in the committee on the judiciarypassed h r 4227 s 2045 contains no such antifraud measures in return for giving hightech companies hundreds of thousands of more foreign workers all we ask on behalf of american workers is some minimal basic common sense safeguards to ensure that businesses do not want to hire cheap foreign workers at the expense of american workers while this bill has taken significant steps to alleviate the presumed shortage with more training for american workers such provisions will not yield benefits for many years supplying future workers is a different issue altogether from shielding todays american workers from the consequences of admitting so many workers from other countries congress should not turn its back on american workers again i appreciate and recognize the work done by the gentleman from california and by the gentleman from utah and congratulate them"],

very bluntly would be perverse this language would put land in newly created national monuments in a state of limbo the lands would remain national monuments but the design the planning and management necessary to fully protect the lands and to make them accessible could not be accomplished who could possibly gain from keeping lands in this sort of halfwayhouse condition nobody not those who want to preserve the environmental value of the lands the prohibition in this rider would block the planning and management needed to protect the environmental and cultural values that prompted the monumental designation not those who want recreational access to the lands the prohibition in this rider would prevent the development of programs or centers to enable the public to take greater advantage of the lands not even those who have mineral or other economic interests in these lands the prohibition in this rider would prevent the development of rules and policies that would determine how to handle their claims so why would anyone propose a rider that cannot help anyone concerned about national monuments and a rider that would cause this entire bill to be vetoed to boot the reason is that the proponents of this rider want to signal their opposition to the 1906 antiquities act itself and with the particular monument designations that have been made this year but they have plenty of other ways to do that directly the congress could amend the antiquities act the congress could override any particular monument designation the congress could reject any particular management plan for a mofiument congress has all the direct authority it needs to have a full debate about lands policy but they do not want to do that because congress has repeatedly shown its unwillingness to significantly alter with monument authority or designation so instead we have a rider to try to do it in an indirect and inartful way through the appropriations process which could not be done through direct congressional action namely derail efforts to protect federal lands through the use of the antiquities act that is a misuse of the appropriations process and it is especially misguided in this case because the direct impact of the language is so counterproductive so i urge my colleagues not to turn the discussions on this rider into a debate over the legitimacy of the antiquities act or the wisdom of any particular monument designation if congress wants to weigh in on these matters it can and should do so directly in any event the rider leaves the act and all recent proclamations entirely intact this debate should be about the specific language in the rider which will leave the status of the land in an uncertain state which would hobble efforts to protect federal lands and

ministerial meeting which will be hosted by the united states in seattle washington from november 30 until the purpose of this meeting is to prepare an agenda for a new round of multilateral trade negotiations aimed at expanding and liberalizing world trade in the wake of the uruguay round of negotiations which ended in 1994 as chairman of the congressional steel caucus i recently convened two days of briefings by unitedstates steel industry executives and the president of the steelworkers of america in addition to discussing the continued threat of lowpriced imports the industry and steelworker representatives also provided the caucus with advice on what should and should not be included ii the agenda which is being drafted in seattle there is general support for this new round of negotiations because liberalized trade has a great potential benefit for the unitedstates economy as long as that liberalized trade is fair and i emphasize the word fair is rulesbased and is market economy based the caucus heard that any future negotiations under the auspices of the world trade organization must in no way weaken unitedstates trade laws particularly our antidumping and countervailing duty laws these laws provide essential remedies against unfair foreign imports i am pleased that we have been repeatedly assured by ambassador barshefsky secretary daley and other administration officials that antidumping and countervailing duty statutes will not be reopened in seattle or in any new round of negotiations to follow but we have also heard repeatedly from several of our trading partners that they will seek to reopen discussions on these laws my particular concern arises from an addendum to the wto general council chairman mchurnos draft ministeril declaration for the seattle meeting which he drafted on his own responsibility the proposals in this addendum would seriously weaken the unitedstates antidumping and countervailing duty laws as they stand today although this addendum is not official it indicates that there will be substantial pressure on the unitedstates delegation to include discussions of changes to the antidumping and countervailing duty laws in the new round of negotiations the proposed changes would allow the dumping of goods into the united states and would allow goods to be subsidized by foreign governments these changes in turn would jeopardize united states jobs i will mention just a few of the 24 changes that have been proposed in the mchumo addendum one once an antidumping investigation under unitedstates law is concluded no new petition involving the same product could be initiated for at least a year this means dumping of that product could resume and continue for a year before any remedy could be pursued two if a penalty duty lower than the calculated margin of dumping were thought to be sufficient to reduce the injury then that lower duty would be mandatory even if dumping continues three countervailing duties would be imposed not in the full amount but only in the amount by which the subsidy exceeds the applicable de minimis level four developing countries would suddenly be exempted altogether from the present prohibition on export subsidies and import substitution subsidies these proposed changes sound technical but they would have a dramatic impact on unitedstates jobs in the manufacturing sector and in other important sensitive sectors these changes would mean job losses for many americans and therefore these changes must be resisted i support the viscloskyney resolution stating that the antidumping and antisubsidies code of the wto should not be reopened in seattle i will be part of a delegation travelling to seattle in november as part of the speakers advisory group on the wto

legislation that could not possibly pass if it were considered as a freestanding bill now the house in recent years has kept its riders to a minimum and i know that that restraint will continue under the speaker hastert but the other body has not always felt so reluctant and riders have continued to appear in conference reports i think the new point of order provided by the waxman amendment will help leadership achieve its goals of keeping riders off spending bills i urge my colleagues to support this defense of the environment amendment it will correct the imbalance in h r 350 it will end the use of riders to weaken environmental protections it will ensure that the house has open and thorough debate on measures that would weaken laws and rules that protect the public"],

amendment but i have to say quite clearly i was rather taken aback at a statement made by a dear dear friend of mine from california and the statement was made that somehow that we have got to be aware that when we vote against or for women we are voting for or against 50 percent of the voters and i think that really really is the kind of statement that americans want to see less of from this house i say this sincerely because when we vote against or for women and or girls in this house we are voting for or against our daughters our mothers our sisters and our grandmothers not voters back and forth we are here to serve as my colleagues know the people out there in the real world and the political jargon i think people are really really tired of bringing it up and i am sure that my dear colleague from california did not mean for it to come out the way he said as if this was a political ball to be used in this amendment now i feel very sympathetic to this amendment and i do see that we want equity and i want to strongly make sure that when we implement our education strategies that we have equity i have daughters and i have sons and i would hope as a parent that every parent feels the way i do that we want our children no matter what their gender to have access to quality education to be able to achieve academically now frankly in my family it is the boys that have the problem academically and i hope that when they have trouble that there will be the resources there to make sure that they get through but my daughters happen to have the ability right now to be able to achieve but madam chairman i just want to say clearly that i think that this is a wellintentioned amendment i am not speaking in opposition to it but i am speaking to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that when we start using terminology here let us remember that we are all working for our daughters and our sons and our granddaughters and our grandsons and try to bring it together and i look forward to working with the sponsors of this amendment who are dear friends of mine at making sure that we implement a fair and equitable educational system in this country to make sure that our

rise in strong opposition to h r 2436 and in strong support of the substitute bill h r 2436 would make it a federal crime to knowingly damage a fertilized egg during an assault against a pregnant mother i now i absolutely agree that it is a tragedy for a woman to lose a pregnancy during a crime and i strongly support the approach that many states have taken to toughen penalties for an assault against a pregnant woman and that is in fact the approach that my colleague is taking in her substitute however h r 2436 would do nothing to protect the woman further but instead would create for the first time a legal definition that a fertilized egg is entitled to protection under the law as a person this bill is indeed breathtaking in its scope while the examples used are drawn from criminal assaults of women in advanced stages of pregnancy its real concern reaches to the impact of the violence on the embryo roe v wade makes a distinction between the embryo in the first trimester and the post viability embryo and that is the distinction that state laws honor this bill makes no such distinction because it deals with the fertilized eggs at all stages of development and therefore it opens the opportunity that if a woman is assaulted in sort of a routine assault and battery case and 3 weeks later has a miscarriage that miscarriage can up the assault and battery charges to murder though she did not know she was pregnant at the time and neither did the assaultant so this bill goes way beyond what it appears to do and while i certainly think that a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy who is assaulted and the fetus killed that assaultant deserves a punishment that is far more severe than if he had not been attacking a pregnant woman i think this bill goes way beyond that by dealing with a fertilized egg and opening up the kinds of possibilities i cite and the next step which is not contained in this bill but it is the only logical next step is to disregard the intent of the assaultant why if it is a criminal assault should it be seen as a crime when it is simply the destruction of the fetus it should not be seen as a crime that is why those of us who support a womans right to abortion are deeply concerned about this legislation it does clearly in its language exclude abortion but the only difference between an abortion and a criminal attack is the criminality of the attacker and the criminal intent but the effect on the fetus is the same and all my colleagues focus on in this bill is the fetal effect and they define fetus as fertilized egg even before the woman knows she is pregnant so i urge opposition to the bill and support for the substitute"]], "top_unsure": [[1.3828277587890625e-05, 0.5000138282775879, 1, "it has come to my attention

carpentry with my friends the amish i worked in their maple sugar camps i understand their way of life because i lived it with them i know that there is no danger i also know that if they do not employ their children it does not mean that they are going to employ someone else it means they are going to work that much longer and that much harder themselves or they are not going to make that much more money they are going to in fact have to live with less in my district now the 4th district of pennsylvania in lawrence county the amish live there they are quiet people they do not drive cars they do not listen to radio or watch tv but what they do is when their children are finished with school at the eighth grade they teach their children how to make a living they in essence are the trade school themselves if the family business is carpentry if it is a sawmill if it is a maple sugar camp in the spring if it is farming they teach their children to do this if the children have
