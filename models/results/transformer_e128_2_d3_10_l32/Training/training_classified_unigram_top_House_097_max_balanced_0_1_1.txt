protect the right of the individual from institutional abuses dominated his legislative career from its earliest days and continued to characterize his legislative service thoughout his 25 terms in

congressional career he had conducted investigations into such varied companies as the steel industry organized baseball and insurance companies always combining principled dedication with political finesse as early as 1938 mr celler opposed the methods of the house unamerican activities committee sensing potential danger to constitutional liberties and in 1966 he was 1 of 24 house members who

meeting between prime minister begin and president sadat had given new momentum to the arabisraeli peace initiative suddenly the raid seemingly disrupted these delicate processes and from this

willingness of france and italy to be nuclear merchants to violent regimes virtually guaranteed that iraq would have soon had a nuclear weapons capability and even sooner the osirak facility would have become hotand it would have been too late to strike without heavy civilian casualties there can be no doubt that iraq given the cap~acity to manufacture nuclear weapons would have used them to

resolution 194 the foreign affairs committee has so far been the focal point of tile houses consideration of the administrations proposal to sell five airbornle warning and control systems awacs aircraft and the f15 enhancements to saudi arabia over the course of the past few weeks committee members have been privy to intelligence briefings as well as testimony by members of congress the department of state the department of defense the general accounting office and concerned private citizens one thing that proponents and opponents agree to is the following principle we must do what is in the best national security interests of the united states in my over 32 years in congress that is what has always been my bottom line to support legislation that is in the unitedstates national security interests that position as far as i am concerned remains so in this particular case accordingly i would like to explain how this proposed air defense package serves a variety of major unitedstates national security interests it enhances the defense of saudi arabia the major source of the worlds oil exports in the persian gulf saudi arabia alone accounts for nearly twothirds of the total gulf production denial of access to saudi oil by hostile powers would undermine unitedstates security as well as those of our closest allies in western europe japan and yes israel this sale complements our foreign policy objective of assisting friendly nations and some of the proponents of this concurrent resolution have just confirmed that saudi arabia is a friend of the united states the qjuestion occurs to me are we a friend of saudi arabia most recently the soviet invasion of afghanistan the continued instability in revolutionary iran the iranianiraqi war and the growing soviet military support activities in south yemen ethiopia syria and libya have posed security threats to our friends and allies in the region all we have to do is look at a map of the middle east and the persian gulf and we certainly can immediately underh 72 13 stand that the soviets are encircling that area and what are we going to do about it leave those countries who are being encircled defenseless this sale reaffirms the unitedstates governments commitment to the pursuit of a comprehensive peace in the middle east and recognizes the constructive role saudi arabia has and can continue to play in this regard illustrative of this is the indispensible role played by saudia arabia in achieving the current cease fire in lebanon we must build upon not abandon this reality how are we rewarding saudi arabia for its role in lebanon in bringing a cease fire there by denying it assistance for its own defenses is that reward this sale contributes to israels security by increasing saudi defense capabilities against direct or indirect soviet threats while preserving israels significant military edge over all its arab neighbors this fact was confirmed by prior speakers the sale enhances the prospects for continued saudi cooperation in being a price moderator within opec as weli as maintaining significantly higher oil production than its preferred level this was seen most recently in saudi arabias response to world oil supply shortages caused by the iraniraq war one of the main concerns of those who have expressed reservations about this proposed air defense package revolves about the issue of control of the awacs it has been suggested that the united states should pursue a formal agreement with saudi arabia for joint control of this defensive aircraft i believq that such an arrangement is unnecessary the united states indeed will both practically and legally retain effective control over the operation and maintenance of the awacs aircraft practical unitedstates control over the awacs is assured by the following realities in saudi arabia unitedstates participation in the 17man crew of each awacs plane will be necessary until at least january 1990 for saudi arabia to be able to maximize the air defense capabilities of awacs unitedstates participation in the crew will be necessary even after 1990 unitedstates personnel will be required for both effective operation and maintenance of the aircraft until the year 2000 throughout the entire life of the system and without unitedstates support personnel the saudis would have a capability to operate the awacs on their own for only a maximum of 1 week de facto unitedstates control over the awacs will be established in written understandings between the united states and saudi arabia regarding the transfer to third countries of awacs equipment and data which would be prohibited the exchange of mutually beneficial defense information stringent security for the protection of awacs and the geographic area in which the saudi awacs will operate which can be conducted only within the geographic area of saudi arabia i am convinced that these controls will provide the united states with sufficient control and influence over both the operation and maintenance of the awacs aircraft throughout the life of the system during the course of our intelligence briefings and hearings on the proposed awacs sale many of us repeatedly raised a question of fundamental concern would unitedstates national security be adversely affected if sensitive awacs technology fell into hostile hands o ur expert witnesses concurred that such a concern is not wellfounded and that the control we will have siioul allay any concerns for example if the computer software that integrates the awacs systemthe most sensitive portion of the technology and which remains unitedstates government propertywere to fall into hostile hands it could be reporgramed within a week thus reducing any probability of enemy exploitation on the other hand if an enemy power were to attain access to the awacs aircraft it would required a massive effort over several years for them to be able to unscramble the computer software portion of the system earlier i alluded to a point that needs further clarification that is why it is in the interest of both saudi arabia and the united states that we sell the saudis these awacs aircraft quite simply saudi and persian gulf air defense systems are currently inadequate to insure the survivability of the oil fields and facilities without the awacs saudi arabia has an inadequate capability in defending the oil fields from an attack across the gulf"], [0.4999932050704956, 0.5000067949295044, 1, "1 say again this is both a national problem and one for my

education and labor committee and the subcommittee on human resources for thleir leadership in bringing this important measure to the floor the older americans act has enjoyed strong bipartis n support since congress enactcd this landmark legislation in 1965 the value and worth of the older americans act for the elderly and our nation have been amply demonstrated time and time again i think that there is a tendency sometimes to believe that all of our work is done and that we canl now relax our concern for the care and wellbeing of the elderly the fact is however that although legislation adopted since the 1930s starting with the social security act and uip through the adoption of the older americans act have played a very important role in improving the situation the battle is by no means permanently won for example while the 20year period between 1959 and 1978 showed a reduction of that sector of the elderly community that is below the poverty level from some 39 percent to about 14 percent yet in the years between 1978 through 1980 we began to backslide in those 2 years an additional 700 000 older americans slid below the poverty level for the first time clearly this is not the time to relax and to rest on our laurels and to believe that all of the work has been done we must be aware of both the physical and psychological concerns of older americans they listen to all of the publicity about the cutbacks they rely on the programs which this congress has adopted over the years to help see them through the remaining years of their lives and when the newspapers and radio and tv are filled with news of cutbacks in social security or medicare or medicaid or food stamps they are affected very seriously because it places their very lives in uncertainty and perhaps in jeopardy so i would hope that what we would be doing by the adoption of the older americans act amendments of 1981 is to provide a sense of reassurance to older citizens and to demonstrate to them that in spite of all of the damage that has been done to the socalled safety net in spite of all of the purported attacks on the programs that the elderly desperately need the members of this house will not stand by and let those attacks continue we will make sure that the elderly continue ti eceive the benefits which this con6 ss and the american people have promised them today many older persons are able to live independently in their own homes because of the services they receive from the administration on aging network home health homemaker chore friendly visitor telephone reassurance calls and other vital services have not only helped older persons psychologically but have also enabled them to remain in their own homes instead of being placed in a nursing home at a much higher public coqt another major achievement is the nutrition program for the elderly it not only delivers nutritious meals for older persons but provides an opportunity for the aged to meet and talk with others this socialization function can be as important as the meal itself especially for lonely shutins the nutrition program now provides meals for about 611 000 older persons on a daily basis more than 528 000 are served in senior centers schools churches and other nonprofit settings nearly 83 000 homebound elderly receive homedelivered meals each day the older americans act also responds to one of the most critical problems in the field of aging the need for more trained personnel to deliver services to the elderly during the 197778 academic year for example about 14 200 students took courses in aging and 1 000 received degrees title iv demonstrations have produced many innovative developments under the older americans act including the nutrition program foster grandparents the retired senior volunteer program rsvp area agencies on aging the nursing home ombudsman program and others the title v senior community service employment program scsep provides jobs

support the conference agreements and urge you to do likewise there are several items in true disagreement and i will speak to one or two of those items in a moment but first i want to outline the conference agreements on several matters of general interest the conferees recommend a 2percent spending cut which applies pro portionally to all programs projects and activities funded by the continuing resolution in seven appropriation bills district of columbia energy and water development housing and urban development interior labor health and human services and education military construction trensury and postal service individual reductions were made in three billsagriculture commercejusticestatejudiciary and transportation these cuts equaled or exceeded the cuts that would have been made under the 2percent formula a 2percent cut was made in the defense bill to be applied to procurement and research and development after the end of this session of congress the rate for the defense bill will be the conference agreement if we have one by that time and if not the level will be the lower of the house or senate figure we excluded entitlements general revenue sharing the food stamp program and veterans medical care and we provided that the 2percent cut could not be used to terminate any project or activity the 2percent cut applies only to funds made available by the continuing resolution and therefore stops if and when the appropriation bill for fiscal 1982 is enacted into law it is important that the house understand that although the language of the 2percent cut appears to app~ly to defense and the statement of managers refers to a cut in defense 3 9 billion in fact the amendment is worded so that the cut could operate at most until sine die adjournment and the actual cut would be insignificant and to his credit the chairinls estimates of the 2percent cut do not include any cut in defense the expiration date of the continuing resolution is july 15 1982 tile chairman and i fought and argued for the house date of september 30 1982 which would have provided continuing appropriations for the full fiscal year we finally had to compromise with the senate which had voted overwhelmingly for a termination date of march 30 1982 although i was willing to compromise i am still convinced that an extension for a full year would have been in the best interests of the congress and the appropriations process members of the other body argued that a continuing resolutilon for a fuli year made a mockery of the appropriations process what nonsensewith only one bill enacted they were saying in effect that a continuing resoiution for 9 months is all right but that a continuing resolution for an additionai 3 months is a mockery a continuing resolution for a full year does not in any way precludi the congress from final action on any of the 1982 appropriation bills in fact by extending the resolution only through july 15 we have guaranteed ourselves the ordeal of another extension which will interfere with our work on the 1983 budget and make it more difficult for us to enact appropriation bills for 1983 and require an extensive continuing resolution for 1983 to put it bluntly the members of the other body who fought so hard for a shorter extension in the namne of the appropriations process have made it more difficult for us to operate thlat1 process in a timely and responsible manner next year we estimate that budget authority provided by the conference agreement totals 427 9 billion which is 530 million under the amount that would have been available based on the provisions of the senate continuing resolution and 764 million uinder the president s september budget est~i mates i wish i could tell you that we have cut enough so

health programs we are not talking about tile budget margin or growth rate for these programs but rather whether they will continue to operate at all after the next few days i hope the administration will not roll the dice for outlay estimates when the stakes are this high we are 764 million under the presidents septeynber estimates in budget authority and while i am sure that some of those cuts will not produce corresponding cuts in outlays i am also sure that the differences cannot possibly justify a confrontation over the continued operation of virtually the entire federal government

rejected by a majority of people in el salvador because they tend toward the conquest of power for its own sake third do you agree or disagree with the el salvadoran governments practice of land

in support of the amendment of my colleague from pennsylvania mr fool ewpa it has come to my attention in my congressional district that many longtime employees at the great lakes naval training center and at the veterans administration hospital in north chicago are threatended with loss of their jobs by reason of a proposal to contract out the duties which they now perform services relating to base security fire protection and dietary facilities now operated inhouse have resulted in a high level of proficiency and individual benefit to the military and veteran personnel at these federal facilitiee in my congressional district i do not claim to have all of the information upon which relative costs of such services could be determined however from my meetings with both service and supervisory personnel i am convinced that excellent services are now being rendered by career civilian personnel who serve under the direction of the base commander or the hospital director i feel that the precipitate dismissal of career civilian personnel and the substitution of unknown persons who might be engaged by some outside independent contractors would be a mistake it might not lead to net savings and it could indeed result in elimination of vital services to which our military and veteran citizens are entitled it seems to me a very modest step to defer any such contracting out programs for a period of 1 year such as the amendment of my colleague from pennsylvania would accomplish i am going to support this amendment and will hope that it is adopted while this amendment
