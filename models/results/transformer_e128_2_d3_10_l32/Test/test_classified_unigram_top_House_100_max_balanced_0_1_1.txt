cornmonly known as the pittmanroberston act in honor of its 50thi anniversary this act was signed int law on september 2 1937 and today it is regarded as a unique model o effectiveness and efficiency among programs under which federal grants are provided to the states what is unique about the p r program is that it is financed soley through an excise tax that is placed on the manufacturers and buyers of sporting arms and ammunitibnj archery equipment andi handguns to date june 22 1987 h 5326 pr has generated more than 1 75 billion for wildlife restoration without any cost to the general taxpayer in fiscal year 1986 alone hunters and shooters provided over 109 million toward this effort in addition state wildlife restoration projects have benefited from more than 500 million raised in matching funds through the collection of hunting license fees together these funds have helped numerous wildlife species including antelope wood duck whitetailed deer elk black bear and wild turkey the pr program has also assisted in purchasing more than 6 400 square miles of land for wildlife management purposes the program has provided the finances to support hunter education programs which instruct more than 700 000 people each year on firearms safety and outdoor ethics the pr program continues to provide the revenues to assist wildlife research programs to increase our scientific knowledge for managing wildlife populations finally through the pr program over 10 000 technical articles on wildlife and associated subjects have been published representing a substantial proportion of the worlds total knowledge on the subject of wildlife management and conservation house concurrent resolution 130 provides deserved recognition of the fine accomplishments that the federal aid in

and urge my colleagues to vote against this bill passage of this bill would be a very unwise move particularly at this time and in any event this is not the kind of a bill that should be brought to the house floor with the very limited debate time available under suspension of the rules this bill deserves and merits fullfledged consideration by the house fada was chartered in late 1985 like any new business startup problems were evident salaries were too high and productivity was not as good as expected but let us look at why fada was created it was needed to case the burden on fslic most of the assets that fada has assumed are among the most difficult to sell fadas task was difficult from the start while exorbitant salaries are not justified certainly competitive salaries were needed to attract qualified individuals into this field fada is now under new leadership and its performance has improved dramatically the fact are as follows fada is making a profit now 3 7 million in the first 8 months of 1988 gerald carmen the president of ceo has cut salaries and staff has been reduced from 400 to 356 carmen has consolidated offices which will save over 1 million a year fada provided to the fslic approximately 356 million from property sales loan payoffs asset restructures and settlements in the first none months of 1988 fadas total asset dispositions since receiving its first assets in 1986 now total 935 million and are expected to top 1 billion by tile end of this year with all of this taking place one must wonder what still motivates ihose who want to abolish this agency my position is that we ought to be doing what is best for the fsiic does it really make sense to fold fada within 60 days does it make sense to put 2 500 assets worth 4 billion back into the fslic allowing them to hire only 200 employees to continue fadas job i dont think it is a wise move at this time particularly when this congress is concerned with the progress and pace of shutting down insolvent institutions a constitient of mine don shackleford chairman of ohio state savings bank is now heading a task force to evaluate future options for fada i know don shackleford very wellhe is among the best and the brightest in this industry and runs one of ohios most successful s ls while his task force has not yet reached a conclusion lie believes that at some point fada should be completely privatizedand that at the very least the process will take 1 year to complete that certainly is an option that ought to be explored under this bill however as amended by the committee fada could not be sold to the private sector the bottom line is that the home loan bank board wont even have available what could be the least costly option of dissolving fada there is no need for unwise haste in this decision its implications could cost the fslic hundreds of millions of dollars as the cbo stated in its letter of august 4 to the banking committee and i quote the proposal to abolish the federal asset disposition association is likely to create temporary delays in resolving claims from receiverships thus reducing income to the federal savings and loan insurance corporation by perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars in 1989 we would not expect this loss of collections to have a budget impact because the fslic would have spent this income rather the agency would have fewer resources to handle case resolutions until an orderly transition to new asset management is in place again i oppose this bill and i will vote against this bill todayand hope that the congress can consider this issue with a greater concern for the health of the fslic the industry and the taxpayer"], [0.49995625019073486, 0.49995625019073486, 0, "1 yield myself such time as i may consume mr

to the man we commemorate here today congressman edward patrick boland from the second congressional district of massachusetts its been a great honor for me to serve alongside eddie during the last 30 years in the congress i can say without hesitation that ive never known a more trustworthy and reasonable man than eddie he has anchored this institution to the fundamental virtues of good government

generation americanborn to irish immigrants he w s raised in hungry hill a working class neighborhood in springfield he graduated from boston college he served in the state house and hes a good catholic but eddie didnt fit the mold he helped cast the mold eddies accomplishments here in the congress are remarkable he has emerged as one of the most hardworking and responsible members of the house appropriations committee as chairman of the hudindependent agencies subcommittee during the last 17 years eddie has been confronted with the most challenging and difficult questions offered by any chairmanship in the congress he must balance national housing priorities with the growing space program ie must balance this nations sacred commitment to its veterans with our commitment to the environment and he must balance community development goals with hazardous waste management at a time of record budget deficits eddie has been put in an unenviable position yet his accomplishments are many when millions of americans watched the space shuttle discovery go up last week and land this morning they were watching the fruits of eddie bolands labor eddie has guided the space program to new highs and he has also provided guidance during the programs most profound lows and while he plans for our future in space eddie places a strong emphasis on the importance of this nations past as a member of the smithsonian institutions board of regents during eddies tenure in the congress he has witnessed the national sorrow over the death of one president and the scandal caused by the resignation of another he served during the racial tensions of the sixties and during the war in vietnam he has worked to implement the human needs programs of the great society and to nurture the economic growth of the eighties eddie boland has a deep understanding and respect for the history of this great nation and im delighted that hell continue to serve with me at the smithsonian nowhere

all the people of massachusetts and especially those from the second congressional district will miss eddie boland hes been the dean of the delegation hes provided leadership at every level and

highly classified air force intelligence report the colunm concluded that the soviets are actively moving toward deployment of a nationwide antimissile system and a complete breakout of the abm treaty all members of congressregardless of which side of the aisle they sit on regardless of their approach to achieving true arms reductionsshould be troubled by these findings troubled not only by the assessment about soviet abm activity but the way they learned about those findings referring to the abm findings in the tightly held intelligence report the wall street journal wrote our seismographs have been recording a major explosion or earthquake this week in the unitedstates intelligence community someone in congress ought to conduct an onsite inspection the journals findings bear out an earlier statement by robert gates deputy director of the cia who said we are very concerned that the soviets continuing development efforts give them the potential for widespread abm deployments well in excess of the abm limits it is our job to prepare the national defense authorization that means determining sdi spending levels and helping shape strategic defense policies we also seem to be increasingly involved in shaping arms control policy if were going to do our job right we should get to the bottom of these findings as the wsj editorial says perhaps our reports or for that matter the air force itself may be overly alarmist but senators about to vote on another arms treaty should be warned to inquire for themselves if the house is going to make rational informed decisions about the unitedstates nuclear force and sdi and it is going to insist on involving itself in arms control policy then it has an equal responsibility to learn more about the air force inteiligence findings it is critical that we fully understand soviet strategic defense activities for that reason i have offered an amendment included in the chairmans en bloc amendment which will require the secretary of dod to provide a classified and unclassified report on soviet abm and abmrelated activities unfortunately the house did not have access to a full brief on this matter in time for this years authorization but with adoption of my amendment we will have this information to guide us next year i know that my colleagues share my desire to have a better understanding of soviet strategic defense actions intentions and capabilities and i urge their support for this amendment i include the following article from the wall street journal of february 25 1988 breakout our seismographs have been recording a major explosion or earthquake this week in the unitedstates intelligence community someone in congress ought t conduct an onsite inspection we hear that air force intelligence has officially concluded the soviets have rolled production lines to break out of the abm treaty and deploy a nationwide antimissile system which possibly could be in place by next year that maj gen schuyler bissel head of air force intelligence briefed the cia on this conclusion late last week and that the finding is based on two new pieces of evidence first the soviets are internetting their earlywarning radars with interceptorguidance radars they have conducted handoff exercises in which the large phasedarray radars like the controversial one at krasnoyarsk pick up targets and alert the flat twin and pawn shop mobile radars that guide their sh04 and sii08 antimissile interceptors this is the key battle management function of an antimissile system second the soviets are mass producing the flat twin and pawn shop radars though the abm treaty limits them to two locations similarly they are mass producing the s1108 a relatively new supersonic missile that intercepts warheads within the atmosphere with 500 such missiles already produced and 3 000 ultimately projected the abm treaty limits each side to only 100 interceptors of all types and the soviets also have the si104 which intercepts above the atmosphere as well as other interceptors with both antiaircraft and antimissile capability while rich in detail our reports admittedly have not been from direct participants in these briefings we now find that the new york tribune the unification church paper in new york published substantially the same reports on monday quoting a senior military intelligence official an official conclusion that the soviets are breaking out of the abm treaty to be sure only would put an official stamp on what has been apparent all along the soviets have taken full advantage of treaty provisions allowing large radars at one abm site at missile test ranges and on the periphery of the nation to finish the job they simply ignored these restrictions to build at krasnoyarsk see map adapted from the pentagons soviet military power the administration has cited the krasnoyarsk radar as an outright violation and both houses of congress have voted their agreement the administration also has protested the deployment of flat twin and pawn shop radars at gomel beyond the sites permitted at the sary shagan and kamchatka test ranges in his compliance report to congress in december president reagan said the absence of soviet dismantlement of the krasnoyarsk radar the new violation in the deployment of the flat twin and pawn shop observed at gomel and the totality of soviet abmrelated activities in 1987 and previous years suggest that the ussr may be preparing an abm defense of its national territory these are the words of course of the same administration that currently has a new inf treaty before the senate and has just had its secretary of state in moscow pushing a new strategic arms treaty in time for the impending moscow summit a breakout finding would be of monumental importance to these enterprises on arms control in general the prospect of a soviet abm breakout raises once again the question of why we are negotiating new treaties with them when they are breaking the old ones on the proposed 50 reduction in offensive arms in particular the soviet abm technology is not star wars it is groundbased and many analysts think each interceptor carries a nuclear warhead so that highly accurate guidance is not needed but with our offensive weapons limited by treaty and with no defense of our own against a soviet first strike our deterrent could be significantly degraded even by this 1970s technology perhaps our reports or for that matter the air force itself may be overly alarmist but senators about to vote on another arms treaty should be

before this house began its debate yesterday there was a young lady in my district who goes by the name of monique who through the courtesy of a direct mail firm has flooded my constituents homes with postcards and harassed them with blatant telephone calls soliciting her services of telephone pornography in recent months this has not only been true in my district but in others as well these kinds of direct exploitation that offend so many of us on this floor have indeed also been found to be offensive to tens of thousands of our constituents in homes all across the united states it is absolutely imperative from my perspective that we act quickly to suppress this kind of sleazy solicitation the kind of solicitations that we find offensive and that jeopardize the standards that we strive to have within our own homes even more unfortunately we find that through the facilities of the postal service and directdial computeraided telephone services these sordid solicitations work their way into our homes without any kind of parental review i am deeply concerned about this telephone pornography threatens and very much undermines parental authority within the home dialaporn

circumstances frighten me even more there is the story of a 12yearold boy who sexually assaulted a 4yearold girl after hearing these telephone messages a 4yearold girl in my own district as reported

wildlife restoration projects have benefited from more than 500 million raised in matching funds through the collection of hunting license fees together these funds have helped numerous wildlife species including antelope wood duck whitetailed deer elk black bear and wild turkey the pr program has also assisted in purchasing more than 6 400 square miles of land for wildlife management purposes the program has provided the finances to support hunter education programs which instruct more than 700 000 people each year on firearms safety and outdoor ethics the pr program continues to

particularly at this time and in any event this is not the kind of a bill that should be brought to the house floor with the very limited debate time available under suspension of the rules this bill deserves and merits fullfledged consideration by the house fada was chartered in late 1985 like any new business startup problems were evident salaries were too high and productivity was not as good as expected but let us look at why fada was created it was needed to case the burden on fslic most of the assets that fada has assumed are among the most difficult to sell fadas task was difficult from the start while exorbitant salaries are not justified certainly competitive salaries were needed to attract qualified individuals into this field fada is now under new leadership and its performance has improved dramatically the fact are as follows fada is making a profit now 3 7 million in the first 8 months of 1988 gerald carmen the president of ceo has cut salaries and staff has been reduced from 400 to 356 carmen has consolidated offices which will save over 1 million a year fada provided to the fslic approximately 356 million from property sales loan payoffs asset restructures and settlements in the first none months of 1988 fadas total asset dispositions since receiving its first assets in 1986 now total 935 million and are expected to top 1 billion by tile end of this year with all of this taking place one must wonder what still motivates ihose who want to abolish this agency my position is that we ought to be doing what is best for the fsiic does it really make sense to fold fada within 60 days does it make sense to put 2 500 assets worth 4 billion back into the fslic allowing them to hire only 200 employees to continue fadas job i dont think it is a wise move at this time particularly when this congress is concerned with the progress and pace of shutting down insolvent institutions a constitient of mine don shackleford chairman of ohio state savings bank is now heading a task force to evaluate future options for fada i know don shackleford very wellhe is among the best and the brightest in this industry and runs one of ohios most successful s ls while his task force has not yet reached a conclusion lie believes that at some point fada should be completely privatizedand that at the very least the process will take 1 year to complete that certainly is an option that ought to be explored under this bill however as amended by the committee fada could not be sold to the private sector the bottom line is that the home loan bank board wont even have available what could be the least costly option of dissolving fada there is no need for unwise haste in this decision its implications could cost the fslic hundreds of millions of dollars as the cbo stated in its letter of august 4 to the banking committee and i quote the proposal to abolish the federal asset disposition association is likely to create temporary delays in resolving claims from receiverships thus reducing income to the federal savings and loan insurance corporation by perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars in 1989 we would not expect this loss of collections to have a budget impact because the fslic would have spent this income rather the agency would have fewer resources to handle case resolutions until an orderly transition to new

from the second congressional district of massachusetts its been a great honor for me to serve alongside eddie during the last 30 years in the congress i can say without hesitation that ive never known a more trustworthy and reasonable man than eddie he has anchored this institution to the fundamental virtues of good government and i am proud to have served with him in the house i am even more proud to have counted him as a good good friend eddies life story is a very familiar one in massachusetts politics hes a first generation americanborn to irish immigrants he w s raised in hungry hill a working class neighborhood in springfield he graduated from boston college he served in the state house and hes a good catholic but eddie didnt fit the mold he helped cast the mold eddies accomplishments here in the congress are remarkable he has emerged as one of the most hardworking and responsible members of the house appropriations committee as chairman of the hudindependent agencies subcommittee during the last 17 years eddie has been confronted with the most challenging and difficult questions offered by any chairmanship in the congress he must balance national housing priorities with the growing space program ie must balance this nations sacred commitment to its veterans with our commitment to the environment and he must balance community development goals with hazardous waste management at a time of record budget deficits eddie has been put in an unenviable position yet his accomplishments are many when millions of americans watched the space shuttle discovery go up last week and land this morning they were watching the fruits of eddie bolands labor eddie has guided the space program to new highs and he has also provided guidance during the programs most profound lows and while he plans for our future in space eddie places a strong emphasis on the importance of this nations past as a member of the smithsonian institutions board of regents during eddies tenure in the congress he has witnessed the national sorrow over the death of one president and the scandal caused by the resignation of another he served during the racial tensions of the sixties and during the war in vietnam he has worked to implement the human needs programs of the great society and to nurture the economic growth of the eighties eddie boland has a deep understanding and respect for the history of this great nation and im delighted that hell continue to serve with me at the smithsonian nowhere are eddies accomplishments more remarkable than in

which side of the aisle they sit on regardless of their approach to achieving true arms reductionsshould be troubled by these findings troubled not only by the assessment about soviet abm activity but the way they learned about those findings referring to the abm findings in the tightly held intelligence report the wall street journal wrote our seismographs have been recording a major explosion or earthquake this week in the unitedstates intelligence community someone in congress ought to conduct an onsite inspection the journals findings bear out an earlier statement by robert gates deputy director of the cia who said we are very concerned that the soviets continuing development efforts give them the potential for widespread abm deployments well in excess of the abm limits it is our job to prepare the national defense authorization that means determining sdi spending levels and helping shape strategic defense policies we also seem to be increasingly involved in shaping arms control policy if were going to do our job right we should get to the bottom of these findings as the wsj editorial says perhaps our reports or for that matter the air force itself may be overly alarmist but senators about to vote on another arms treaty should be warned to inquire for themselves if the house is going to make rational informed decisions about the unitedstates nuclear force and sdi and it is going to insist on involving itself in arms control policy then it has an equal responsibility to learn more about the air force inteiligence findings it is critical that we fully understand soviet strategic defense activities for that reason i have offered an amendment included in the chairmans en bloc amendment which will require the secretary of dod to provide a classified and unclassified report on soviet abm and abmrelated activities unfortunately the house did not have access to a full brief on this matter in time for this years authorization but with adoption of my amendment we will have this information to guide us next year i know that my colleagues share my desire to have a better understanding of soviet strategic defense actions intentions and capabilities and i urge their support for this amendment i include the following article from the wall street journal of february 25 1988 breakout our seismographs have been recording a major explosion or earthquake this week in the unitedstates intelligence community someone in congress ought t conduct an onsite inspection we hear that air force intelligence has officially concluded the soviets have rolled production lines to break out of the abm treaty and deploy a nationwide antimissile system which possibly could be in place by next year that maj gen schuyler bissel head of air force intelligence briefed the cia on this conclusion late last week and that the finding is based on two new pieces of evidence first the soviets are internetting their earlywarning radars with interceptorguidance radars they have conducted handoff exercises in which the large phasedarray radars like the controversial one at krasnoyarsk pick up targets and alert the flat twin and pawn shop mobile radars that guide their sh04 and sii08 antimissile interceptors this is the key battle management function of an antimissile system second the soviets are mass producing the flat twin and pawn shop radars though the abm treaty limits them to two locations similarly they are mass producing the s1108 a relatively new supersonic missile that intercepts warheads within the atmosphere with 500 such missiles already produced and 3 000 ultimately projected the abm treaty limits each side to only 100 interceptors of all types and the soviets also have the si104 which intercepts above the atmosphere as well as other interceptors with both antiaircraft and antimissile capability while rich in detail our reports admittedly have not been from direct participants in these briefings we now find that the new york tribune the unification church paper in new york published substantially the same reports on monday quoting a senior military intelligence official an official conclusion that the soviets are breaking out of the abm treaty to be sure only would put an official stamp on what has been apparent all along the soviets have taken full advantage of treaty provisions allowing large radars at one abm site at missile test ranges and on the periphery of the nation to finish the job they simply ignored these restrictions to build at krasnoyarsk see map adapted from the pentagons soviet military power the administration has cited the krasnoyarsk radar as an outright violation and both houses of congress have voted their agreement the administration also has protested the deployment of flat twin and pawn shop radars at gomel beyond the sites permitted at the sary shagan and kamchatka test ranges in his compliance report to congress in december president reagan said the absence of soviet dismantlement of the krasnoyarsk radar the new violation in the deployment of the flat twin and pawn shop observed at gomel and the totality of soviet abmrelated activities in 1987 and previous years suggest that the ussr may be preparing an abm defense of its national territory these are the words of course of the same administration that currently has a new inf treaty before the senate and has just had its secretary of state in moscow pushing a new strategic arms treaty in time for the impending moscow summit a breakout finding would be of monumental importance to these enterprises on arms control in general the prospect of a soviet abm breakout raises once again the question of why we are negotiating new treaties with them when they are breaking the old ones on the proposed 50 reduction in offensive arms in particular the soviet abm technology is not star wars it is groundbased and many analysts think each interceptor carries a nuclear warhead so that highly accurate guidance is not needed but with our offensive weapons limited by treaty and with no defense of our own against a soviet first strike our deterrent could be significantly degraded even by this 1970s technology perhaps our reports or for that matter the air force itself may be overly alarmist but senators about to vote on another arms treaty should be warned to inquire for themselves certainly
