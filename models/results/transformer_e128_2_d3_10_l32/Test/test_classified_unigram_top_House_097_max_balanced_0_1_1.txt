financial return for the taxpayers dollars i would not consider changing some land development in a project and let it become useless and stop it if we go ahead and build this project with the additional 30 percent to make it so the water will flow through we can ship barges and receive a financial return for the taxpayers i have seeh six barges tied together going down the lower part of the river i have personally investigated the project i have been down there and got ticks and chiggers on me i can say from firsthand personal inspection we can not just quit this project i ask my

stringent that standards should be relaxed they attempt to weaken the heart of the voting rights act section 5 and they will attempt to weaken if not repeal entirely thle bilingual provisions of the voting rights act but their opposition is met with the facts and figures that should remind all of us that voting discrimination in the united states is a present problem not an historical relic their opposition is met with my commitment and the commitment of a majority of my distinguished colleagues that there can be no compromise no halfway measures when it comes to the right of all americans to vote the voting rights act has indeed brought the right to vote to millions of american citizens it has outlawed literacy tests poll taxes englishonly elections and intimidation and harrassment of minority voters the act has been responsible for not only increasing minority participation but for increasing minority representation in 1965 there were about 100 black elected officials from the deep south today there are over 3 000 this is clearly a sign of success but let us look more closely at these figures in the house of representatives there is only one black from a covered state our colleague mickey leland from texas there is not a single black representative from south caroina georgia alabama mississippl there is not a single black who holds a statewide office in the united states in 1981 many of the 3 000 black elected officials were elected from towns where the black population makes up 80 percent of the total population of about 1 000 there are only a few blacks who hold serious pol icymaking positions in the covered jurisdictions the figures seem impressive in many respects they are impressive but we are a long way from finished in the struggle which this congress began so valiantly in 1965 members of the house and senate oppose the voting rights act because they say it singles out the south but what happened several weeks ago in my own city of new york reminded all of us that the voting rights act is there to protect minorities wherever the violation when the voting rights act was passed in 1965 it was designed to address the problems of blacks who had becn systematically often violently disenfranchised in 1975 congress recognized that language minority citizens had also been disenfranchised by many of the same subtle and blatant forms of discrimination that hampered black voting strength congress recognized also that certain citizens had an additional burden in votingmany of them could not speak english and so we enacted bilingual elections for hispanics american indians asian americans and eskimos critics of bilingual elections are fond of saying if they want to come here why dont they learn english but can we really ask that question of navajos in arizona of eskimos in alaska of mexican americans in new mexico who were here before the mayflower landed on our shores can we ask it of puerto ricans who are unitedstates citizens one and all i think not the bilingual election provisions do not expire until 1985 because of a legislative drafting error that occurred in 1975 critics of bilingual elections have suggested that we wait until 1965 to review the bilingual provisions let us be frank what they are really saying is let us wait until 1985 to repeal these provisions i have been vastly impressed by the broad support for the voting rights act from individuals and organizations throughout the country the bill including the bilingual election provisions is supported by civil rights organizations the

of land is three times as much in the corn belt as it is in the dry area that raises much of the wheat in wheat it can work because they use relatively cheap fragile land much of which will produce twice as much the following year if they fallow it so they have a way to offset the land cost for idle land but the wheat people are going to bury themselves if they take the attitude they have been taking in the last 4 years for a couple of reasons one is that the double cropping area of this country has increased tremendously and with the advent of sunflowers and better short season follow on crops which are coming on strong that double cropping area is moving right up into the corn belt so we are going to have a lot of land which will go to double cropping of wheat and sunflower in lieu of planting in the feed grains when we have the loan rates for wheat out of proportion to what it is for feed grains it just will not work in the next 4 years also there are some new varieties of wheatthey are not bread wheat they are for feed grainsthey can produce down in north carolina and parts of the southern corn belt go bushels an acre when they can raise 90 bushels an acre of wheat and follow that with a shortterm soybean or sunflower they will do that instead of idling acres without payment in order to secure a relatively lower loan under the mismatched support rates in this bill in 4 years time there is going to be deep trouble as far as wheat is concernedeven more than they got into in the last 4 years one reason they got into trouble last year is because they had a loan and

that resolution that it would not tolerate budget reductions in the medicare program today i am introducing legislation which will asture the solvency of the medicare trust fund by injecting general revenues into that fund these general revenues would be generated by repeal of some of the most outrageous provisions of the internal revenue codethose relating to tax preferences for oil producers and royalty owners we have a moral commitment to the health of our nations older citizens and medicare is perhaps the most significant and important federal pro gram helping to fulfill that commitment today 26 million older persons and 3 million disabled persons depend on medicare to help meet their health care costs sixty percent of these beneficiaries are older women as important as medicare is it only meets between 33 to 40 percent of the health needs of older americans clearly significant reductions or added outofpocket costs for beneficiaries would be a tragedy for many of our neediest elderly and disabled citizens i believe it is the height of folly to look to reductions in medicare benefits in order to cut federal expenditures when at the same time we have wholesale giveaways to oil companies existing in our tax code there are a number of provisions some of which passed last year as part of the economic recovery tax act that have little if any economic justification and which should be repealed i am proposing that the revenue collected by closing these loopholes be specifically earmarked and directed to the federal hospital trust fund from which medicare is financed last year i joined the gentleman from new york peter peyser and 74 of my colleagues in proposing to repeal those sections of erta which amended the windfall profit tax act by exempting 2 barrels of oil per day3 starting in 1985for royalty owners reducing the tax on newly discovered oil from 30 to 15 percent over 5 years and exempting stripper oil by independent producers altogether from the windfall profit tax these three provisions will cost the treasury 1 962 billion in 1983 2 333 billion in 1984 and 2 995 billion in 1985 for a 3 year total of 7 29 billion the bill i am introducing today would also repeal these provisions these massive unjustified exemptions for royalty owners and producers were motivated by nothing more than pure political gamemanship certainly not by economics or sound energy policy in addition to the repeal of the erta provisions i am also proposing significant changes in two other provisions of the codethe percentage depletion allowance and the expensing of intangible drilling costs under percentage depletion independent producers and royalty owners are given an option accorded to no other taxpayers in our country they may choose cost depletion which is essentially like straight line depreciation available to all taxpayers holding capital assets or percentage depletion which allows a deduction of 18 percent of gross oil related iricome with certain restrictions since percentage depletion can be used for whatever number of years the oil well continues to produce we are left with the outrageous result that total deductions can far exceed the taxpayers investment if it could be demonstrated that percentage depletion led to greatly increased production of oil perhaps it could be justified however economists question whether percentage depletion has any stimulative effect at all on the production of oil even worse the drain on the treasury is tremendous 1 5 billion each year in 1983 and 1984 and 2 2 billion in 1985 for a 3year total of 4 2 billion another preference accorded the oil industry is the allowance of expensing for intangible drilling costs idcs include drilling shooting and cleaning the well draining road making stirveying and geological work in preparation for drilling construction of derricks tank pipelines necessary for drilling and preparatiop of the well for production in any other context costs like these would be treated as capital expenditures and depreciated over the useful life of the asset or perhaps some other reasonable fixed period of time which bears some relation to its useful life however idcs can be expensed in the first year which results in a tremendous tax deferral opportunity for the oil industry although the 1976 tax reform act restricted the use of idc expensing the tax preference is still very much in existence analysis by the joint economic committee has concluded that the major oil companies who comprise 70 to 75 percent of those using this device can absorb the increased tax without a shortage of capital if the expensing option were eliminated the cost to the treasury due to idc expensing is staggering 3 5 billion in 1983 7 7 billion in 1984 and 8 4 billion in 1985 for a 3year cost of 19 6 billion the total in foregone revenue represented by these provisions equals 6 962 billion in 1983 11 533 billion in 1984 and 13 595 billion in 1985 for a 3year grand total 32 09 billion all the figures i have cited were generated by the joint committee on taxation we have a very simple choice we can continue to waste over 32 billion over the next 3 years on tax breaks for the oil industry provisions which do little to stimulate oil production or energy independence or we can take that sum of money and invest it in our nations elderly and disabled helping

only 23 percent felt that the cuts had gone too far these polls bear out what i believe to be overwhelming recognition by the american people that we must cut back the size and cost of the federal government that for all its good intentions too much has been spent on too little so that too few can run the lives of too many too often we have heard in this chamber the wails of anguish because of harried calls from those affected by the cutbacks it is quite normal and to be expected to hear from those special interests whose spending schemes are upset but what about the vast majority of taxpayers we never hear from what do they want it is a general rule of thumb that we are likely to hear from those people with a complaint we seldom if ever hear from those wvho are satisfied even if only moderately so these and similar guages of public opinion across the countryfrom gainesville ga to middletown ohio and a variety of other places which have been checkedtell us repeatedly that we are on the right track and that we have to keep going this is not the time to pull back or veer off in another direction even though many of our citizens may be adversely affected by some of these budget cuts they realize that certain sacrifices must be made to put our fiscal house in order and our nations economy back on its feet most importantly they are willing to make those sacrifices after all many people forego buying a new car if prices are too high manyall too many these daysgo without homes because interest rates are too high many will simply avoid items necessities and luxuries alike because they cannot afford them if the american people are willing toand in many cases they are forced tomake those sacrifices then congress ought to be willing to face the same reality we can no longer spend what we do not have the members will recall that over the course of the last several weeks i have taken a few moments at the close of the session for the purpose of bringing to the attention of the members possible cuts that were listed on a work product of the republican research committees economic task force budget study subcommittee listing some 272 items totaling some 62 billion which indicate where this congress can find places where we can further cut federal borrowing and spending in fiscal year 1982 if we have the courage to do so when these items are mentioned i have asked and i will again ask this afternoon for the members to ask themselves this question when these proposed cuts are specified will they impact adversely on the poor the downtrodden the handicapped or the deprived of our society i think in most instances the answer is that they will not they are an effort to skin some of the fat out of our bureaucracy from the excess layers of government commissions bureaus and whathaveyou that have grown over the years in fact in most instances over a generation there really has not been a concerted effort to trim these programs many of which have outlived their usefulness indeed if they ever had one again beginning this afternoon with the category headed independent agencies i would like to share with the members this afternooon a few of the suggested cuts that are in this category the first item relates to the small business administration business loan and investment fund the proposal is to cut 10 percent from the 1980 program as reported by investigative agencies it has exhibited fraudulent and silly funding for such things for example as massage parlors i question if the federal taxpayers should be subsidizing the building and managing of massage parlors in this country the focus of this program was to be ozr legitimate small business and was designed to fill a need to deal with the economic problems of our country it we would cut 10 percent from the 1980 figures it would save 64 814 700 again on sba the gao has recommended correcting audit procedures that would save 192 000 then we go to the smithsonian institution here in washington d c they have a special foreign currency program and in our assessment we question as to whether we need to spend money on programs such as teaching kids in india about whistling ducks we do not believe this right to be in the purview of the smithsonian institution this cut if implemented would save 3 578 000 on the smithsonian institution construction costs we are proposing to fund in 1982 a new quadrangle which is designed to house african art now nobody in this chamber this member included is going to run down or deprecate the importance of art in our country and in our civilization but as we wonder through the smithsonian we learn that we already have a few museums that exhibit art today and wve question whether this kind of unessential spending makes sense just to build another museum in washington d c at a cost of 3 million on the smithsonian institution the general accounting office has recommended correcting audit procedures which if implemented would save 141 000 next we have the temporary study commissions believe it or not we have a motor carrier ratemaking study at a cost of nearly 840 000 in 1982 and we question whether it is necessary to have a study on motor carrier ratemaking then on the national commission on student financial assistance we believe that this even through meritorious must come under scrutiny at this time of budget uncertainty and heavy federal borrowing we have an education department for this if it is eliminated we would save 1 million then we have a temporary study commission on navajo and hopi relocation we wonder why this is in the federal budget at all we do not believe it is necessary and if it is eliminated it would save 12 814 000 then temporary study commissionspresidents commission for the study of ethical problems in medicine it mp y come as a surprise to some members in this chamber to find that we have such a commission but it is there in the budget for the next fiscal year if it continues in existence it will spend 1 690 000 i seriously question whether we need it or can afford it even if we need it temporary study commissionspresidents commission on pension policy that is only going to spend 100 000 but we question whether or not this expenditure for a separate commission is necessary i am not suggesting that it is unnecessary to study the issue i am just suggesting that i question whether or not it deserves a special commission for that purpose on tva the general accounting office has recommended that by correcting audit procedures we can save 900 000 in fiscal year 1982 then we have the unitedstates holocaust memorial council this council proposes to expend some 900 000 for fiscal year 1982 i am not suggesting that it is inappropriate to have a memorial for this purpose we also have refugees and victims of genocide in cambodia and in other portions of southeast asia are we to erect a memorial in washington d c for all of them maybe the answer is yes but i question at a time when the federal government is going to borrow from 70 billion to 809 billion in fiscal year 1982 whether we should be expending 900 000 for this purpose this year then we have the unitedstates metric board we have this operation in the federal government proposed to expend 3 100 000 i question whether or not we should have a government agency promoting conversion from the system that we have in this country to the metric system if that change is to be madeand the metric system certainly has much to be said in its favor by way of needs for measurementi question whether or not the federal government should be subsidizing that if the change is to be made at all it should be the marketplace which determines when and how that is the way it should happen if we would implement this suggestion and eliminate this board we would save 3 100 000 finally we should understand that if we implement the cuts as presented in this study and reduce spending and borrowing in fiscal year 1982 by some 52 billion as this proposal suggests we could reduce the interest costs on carrying the national debt by at least 2 5 billion that is a substantial sum we should be aware as members of this house that the third highest expenditure in our federal budget for 1982 will be in the form of debt service on the outstanding debt to the extent that the federal government reduces its borrowing in the next fiscal year this will reduce the cost of ref inancing the existing debt it is calculated that this would save some 2 5 billion this is the list that i have read through over the course of the past several weeks broken down into some 22 categories and comprising some 272 items each of us serving in this house should understand that if we are to bring down the cost of credit wvhich every american must pay when purchasing a home buying an automobile running a business or just maintaining a standard of living then the federal government must get its heavy hands out of the credit market last year the federal government borrowed some 90 billion of new debt this next fiscal year it is estimated that the federal government will borrow another 60 billion to 70 billion in order to finance the debt of the unitedstates government i mention this again but i think it needs mentioning time and time again that in the current fiscal year it is estimated that this government will borrow 38 percent of the available credit in the credit markets of the country t6n years ago it was almost half that when you add what the federal government would borrow in the next fiscal year with what state and local governments will borrow another 12 percent it means that the governments of this country are barrowing about 50 percent of the available credit that is available in the credit markets of the nation if any of us wonder why we must pay so much for credit when we go to our bank or to our savings and loan or wherever we borrow our money it is because our government our friendly government is there with such ax overbearing presence that it is driving up the cost of the credit that we americans must pay the answer i think is obvious that if we want to drive down the cost of the prime rate from its current high of 19 percent to what business needs in order to survive which is closer to 10 percent the federal government which is the cause of this excessive rate of interest must reduce its demand for borrowing the way to do that is to reduce some of the budget expenditures for fiscal year 1982 for those members who do not like any of the 272 items that are on this list my sincere challenge to each of them is what are your suggestions what would you cut in federal spending over the next fiscal year the people of this country in poll after poll have indicated that they want this house to get its fiscal house in order i think for those of us that are privileged to serve here we should accept the mandate of the people to bring this

house decided by nearly a 100vote margin to increase the funding for the environmental protection agencys research program to last years appropriations level at that time it was made clear that such an increase was modest indeed given the epas new responsibilities with regard to toxic wastes and given the magnitude of the cuts in epas budget between 1981 and 1982 if we want to reaffirm the commitment we made 1 month ago to the epa budget and environmental protection we must vote today to bring the appropriations for epas research closer to the fiscal year 1982 appropriations level when we debated this issue previously i think we made obvious a contradiction in epa research policy on the one hand the agency is committed to improving the quality of scientific research that it uses to support our environmental standards that is a goal that all of us can enthusiastically endorse at the same time however the agency is cutting exactly those longterm research projects that keep the epa in the forefront of environmental science the point is obvious if the agency is going to focus its entire environmental program on shortterm regulatory needs the quality of its science will inevitably deteriorate that point has been underscored by the american chemical society which represents 125 000 chemists and engineers and which has enthusiastically endorsed the amendment to restore appropriations for epa research let me quote directly from the societys letter the scheuer amendment would increase funding for extramural research an area slated for drastic cuts by administration thereby allowing the agency to draw upon qualified creative experts outside epa who can assist in solving environmental problems the extramural program is critical because it is open to the entire scientific community including many of the best environmental scientists some of whom have become discouraged by their inability to have their work supported by funding through the epa laboratories the proposed additional funds will allow epa to increase its longrange research on emerging environmental problems it would be shortsighted to wait until such problems reach crisis proportions before attempting to develop the information that is needed for appropriate policies and regulations a lack of fundamental information is a major reason the agency has failed to meet some of the regulatory deadlines established by congress in summary the american chemical society believes that the house would be wise to accept the scheuer amendment i include the full text of the american chemical
