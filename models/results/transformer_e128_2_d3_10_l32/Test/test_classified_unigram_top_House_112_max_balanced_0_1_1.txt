epa regulatory relief act of 2011 and h r 2681 the cement sector regulatory relief act of 2011 im proud to sponsor this rule which provides for a modified open amendment process with a preprinting requirement this modified open rule means that any member republican or democrat with any germane amendment that complies with the other rules of the house will have the opportunity to debate that issue its another example of the republican majoritys continued commitment to openness and transparency since coming to this body back in january my priority has been to create an environment where american workers can prosper in my home district unemployment hovers around 13 percent i dont doubt this sad statistic is part of the reason why vice president biden is in my district today talking up the presidents socalled american jobs act unfortunately for thousands of people looking for work in floridas fifth congressional district they cant afford for the president and vice president to just keep talking about it they need action not promises they need to actually break down the barriers that are preventing job creators and employers from creating new jobs every week when i go home i meet with small business owners to get their input on what they need to start hiring again they always tell me the same three things we need demand from customers loans arent as easy to come by as they were prior to the recession and they have no idea what to expect from washington as it relates to regulation and taxes washington cant directly control the first two things but can absolutely take care of the third when we had a balanced budget amendment rally in dade city one of the small business owners stood up and said what we need is certainty from the federal government we need certainty what our taxes are going to be and what regulations are going to be he talked about the fact that regulations change on a moments notice based upon whims of the government he used to plan 3 to 5 years out in regards to what their business plan was going to do what their hiring process was going to be today theyre lucky if they can plan 90 days based upon the uncertainty and so long as twothirds of americans in this country think that were on the wrong track theyre going to stay hunkered down waiting for signs that things are improving the american people need to believe that were putting this economy back on track back towards growth and prosperity and you do that through leadership there are currently 219 regulations under consideration each of those regulations separately will cost us 100 million thats 21 9 billion in increased regulations on businesses today that are already crushed because they cant compete whats more there are 4 226 new regulations in the hopper with that many regulations costing that much money hanging over their heads how on earth can we expect small businesses to actually create jobs today in the house we have the ability to address some of these executive rules all promulgated by the epa those rules collectively known as boiler mact and cement mact put thousands of jobs in my district in jeopardy for the life of me i cant understand how the vice president can stand up in front of the citizens of land 0 lakes florida talking about job creation with a straight face when the obama administration is actively pursuing regulations like boiler mact and cement mact in my district alone the cement mact rule could cost up to 200 cement manufacturing jobs not adding into the total of jobs that are going to be lost on the associated industries that move it sell it and use it additionally numerous groups and industries have made it clear that boiler mact regulations will cost them hundreds of millions of dollars and will put many of their employees in the unemployment line and yet our president ignores these regulations and keeps talking about doubling down with a second stimulus following the failed first stimulus package well here we are today doing something to actually save jobs not just talking about it one of the very first actions i took as a member of congress was to invite the epa to come to my office and explain to me their finalized rules in respect to the portland cement manufacturing that goes on in my district they said to me we understand its not without challenge to the industry i may not have been here long but i know washington doublespeak when i hear well its not without additional challenges to that industry its not just the cement mact rule thats not without challenge my colleague mr hastings wrote a letter to the epa about 2 months ago and i commend him for this letter in it he says the boiler mact rule alone could impose tens of billions of dollars in capital costs at thousands of facilities across the country my colleague from florida asked the epa to consider a more flexible approach that could prevent severe job losses and billions of dollars in unnecessary regulatory costs in florida alone boiler mact will affect at least 43 boilers requiring 530 million in retrofits i just heard from the florida sugar industry who estimates boiler mact for their compliance alone will cost 350 million and cost untold jobs ive heard from the pulp and paper workers who may need to lay off 87 000 workers if the boiler mact regulations go into place ive heard from timber producers in my district that have recently been hurt because unitedstates plywood producers have had to close because of lack of demand and now theyre fearful they may have to deal with the double whammy that boiler mact is going to do in regards to putting businesses out of work and close them down it could crush one of the last outlets for their timber products representative hastings in his letter to the epa said this i believe that regulations can be crafted in a balanced way that sustains both the environment and jobs i believe these bills h r 2250 and h r 2681 meet that balance and makes that balancing possible these bills dont completely eliminate clean air emissions regulations for boilers incinerators or cement kilns but what they do is require the agency to create regulations that actually take achievable science into account they give the affected industry time to comply in sum they make the epa think about the american workforce and in an environment where job creation is key i dont see how we cant support that with that i encourage my colleagues to vote yes on the rule and i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.001644994248636067, 0.001644994248636067, 0, "i appreciate the gentleman from colorado for yielding your time i was listening to the comments from the gentleman from illinois discussing the unemployment rate being over 8 percent now for some time in fact its been over 8 percent for 32 months which is the longest period of unemployment this high since the great depression i mean the things were doing in washington d c frankly havent been working and so its time to start pushing the types of bills that the house has been pushing this year to try to get this economy back on track im happy to join my colleagues tonight im also happy to be a strong supporter of the forgotten 15 and the new seven bills and dozens of bills that are passing the house throughout this session that will help the economy recover and help small businesses create jobs now americans are frustrated with what they see going on in congress with what they see going on in washington d c and theres a reason because they see the policies that have failed in this town over the past few years and they dont believe that washington can function and they can do things to help the economy recover thats because weve been doing all the wrong things whether it was the bailout stimulus bills cash for clunkers the health care takeover capandtrade card check you couldnt think of a more antibusiness set of legislation that this congress passed over the last few years than those bills and what they did is theyve held down the recovery and theyve stopped small business owners theyve stopped entrepreneurs from growing and creating jobs frankly we know that jobs are not going to be created in washington d c theyre going to be created back home in places like illinois and in colorado and in kansas and in alabama and yes even wisconsinall across the countryby innovators and job creators and entrepreneurs the people that built this country and that create the jobs theyre not going to come from big washington programs and thats what has caused the problems in this country these big washington bailouts run up national debt all of it has not worked and so its time we changed course its time we start pushing legislation that will promote small business that will promote the free enterprise system and frankly these things are common sense the american people want congress to pass commonsense legislation the point about these commonsense bills that the house is pushing these probusiness projobcreating bills that the house has been pushing and sending over to the senate is that they focus on the very things that built this country in the first place this nation was not built because we had the highest tax rates in the world because we had more regulations than any country in the world because we had national debt in the trillions thats not what built this country it was the hard work and determination the sweat equity of the american peoplewho had no guaranteeswho built this country brick by brick the commonsense things that congress doesnt do that theyve been doing the wrong way for yearslook tax increases tax increases dont create jobs borrowing and spending doesnt create wealth doesnt create jobs regulations dont create jobs and so every day in washington were putting more barriers in the way of these small business owners that we want to have create jobs and its making things worse in fact just looking at the regulations that are coming out every week out of washington its unbelievable this is just a stack of the regulations that have come out just this week in washington d c monday a new set of regulations tuesday a new set of regulations wednesday a new set of regulations that one was pretty thick there thursday another set of regulations just this week these regulations they just dont stop it just keeps coming and coming and hitting our small business owners and stopping the economy from recovering let me just give you an example of what these regulations have on wednesday alone 188 pages of new regulations dealing with the health care takeover is that what the economy needs is that what you hear from your small business owners at home is that what americans are crying out for 188 new pages of regulations dealing with health care its got to stop and yes to the president we can wait on having new regulations we can wait on the presidents big tax increases we can wait on this stuff we dont need 188 new pages of obamacare regulations we dont need this new stack of regulations this week its not helping the economy recover its making it more difficult thats why im proud to stand with my colleagues today on the house floor and fight for the american people and fight for the prosperity of this country that we all believe in we know we can restore it but weve got to stop doing the stuff in

americans children families and individuals i have heard my republican colleagues mention cost throughout this day well make no mistake there would also be a cost in leaving tens of millions of americans uninsured according to a recent study published by the american journal of public health uninsured working age americans have a 40 percent higher risk of death than their privately insured counterparts the study estimates that lack of health insurance causes over 44 000 excess deaths annually that works out to about one death every 12 minutes from lack of health insurance my colleagues let us not forget to count those lives as a very real and continuing cost over 44 000 deaths a year one every 12 minutes i urge my colleagues to support the democratic plan lifesaving legislation and vote against the republican repeal of health care it is wrong for america i urge a no vote i rise in strong opposition to this harmful illconceived bill when the republican majority said it was going to make the deficit their defining issue this congress most of us did not realize it was to make the deficit bigger but according to the congressional budget office their first act to repeal health care would do just thatadd 230 billion to the deficit while making americans pay more for health care instead of focusing on job creation republicans are running up our deficit jeopardizing the health of millions of americans and threatening the creation of new jobs under the republican repeal effort insurance companies will once again be able to drop people when they get sickexactly when coverage is needed most children with preexisting conditions will be denied coverage while insurance companies would again impose devastating annual and lifetime caps young people will not be able to stay on their parents plans until age 26 pregnant women and breast cancer survivors can be denied coverage seniors will face an increase in their prescription drug costsmillions thrown back into the medicare part d donut hole repeal would deny seniors a 50 percent discount on prescription drugs recreating the devastating coverage gap each of these things will disappear if republicans are able to repeal the historic health reform law in my home state of new york repealing the affordable care act would be devastating new york residents providers small businesses and other employers would be denied critical new benefits of the law from protections against insurance industry abuses to new coverage options and millions of dollars in support so states like new york can deliver quality affordable health care options to all of its residents without the affordable care act new york will suffer 77 800 young adults would lose their insurance coverage through their parents health plans sometimes just after they finish school and as they are looking for a job families across new york would lose the peace of mind the affordable care act provides by making sure that young adults can stay on their parents plan to age 26 if they do not have coverage of their own more than 10 million residents of new york with private insurance coverage would suddenly find themselves vulnerable again to having lifetime limits placed on how much insurance companies will spend on their health care insurance companies would once again be allowed to cut off someones coverage unexpectedly when they are in an accident or become sick because of a simple mistake on an application this would leave 734 000 people in new york at risk of losing their insurance at the moment they need it most as one of the worst abuses of the insurance industry would become legal again new insurance plans would no longer be required to cover recommended preventive services like mammograms and flu shots without cost sharing nor would they have to guarantee enrollees the right to choose any available primary care provider in the network or see an obgyn without a referral nearly 2 9 million seniors in new york who have medicare coverage would be forced to pay a copay to receive important preventive services like mammograms and colonoscopies medicare would no longer pay for an annual checkup visit so nearly 2 9 million seniors in new york who have medicare coverage would have to pay extra if they want to stay healthy by getting checkups regularly 192 596 on medicare would see significantly higher prescription drug costs in new york 192 596 medicare beneficiaries received a onetime taxfree 250 rebate to help pay for prescription drugs in the donut hole coverage gap in 2010 medicare beneficiaries who fall into the donut hole in 2011 will be eligible for 50 percent discounts on covered brand name prescription drugs without the law the burden of high prescription drug costs would hurt millions of medicare beneficiaries across the country for the sake of argument if we remove the moral obligation of providing health care to 32 million americans who would lose coverage with this repeal we are still left with a compelling fiscal reason for opposing the repeal of this law repeal adds 230 billion to the deficit over the first 10 years and more than 1 2 trillion in the second decade around onehalf percent of gdp americans purchasing health insurance on their own will see their costs rise americans will get fewer health benefits for their money i urge my colleagues to

having the conversation that were having here late in the day regarding these types of issues that in my strongest opinion are impacting our ability to create jobs and thats the prize that we all keep our eye on here in these chambers is what can we do to strengthen our capacity to put people back to work because i think at the end of the day thats exactly what people elected us to do last november is to come up here and change this climate change this culture and put the entrepreneur back in charge because thats where job creation comes from a couple of points before i go to some notes that i brought specifically for this afternoons presentation and that is that this cloud of uncertainty that continues to hover over the economy of the united states of america is influenced by a number of things but let me just take two or three of them the threat of higher taxes and not just the threat of higher taxes but the relationship of the threat of higher taxes to the issues of the deficit and the debt i made these comments not too long ago on this very floor that in private business in business in general your debt is usually tied to your assets the assets of the company most businesspeople get that but in government your debt is tied to your capacity to increase taxes so this debt and deficit issue that we continue to struggle with as a country and the prospect of that debt continuing to riseand not too long from now were going to have a vote on increasing the statutory limit on debtinfluences i think contributes to this cloud of uncertainty that leads a prospective entrepreneur a prospective job creator to not do what that person would like to do even with trillions of dollars sitting on the balance sheets of corporate america the hesitancy to create these jobs influenced by the threat of higher taxes and then i think also fundamental to this cloud of uncertainty as i call it continuous overregulation by this government that the prospective job creator cannot compute the input costs associated with more government regulation notice i havent even mentioned the impact of the health care law obamacare as we call it its hard to compute the input costs of this health care law and then more recently the threat of higher energy prices and a flawed if not almost nonexistent energy policy of this administration just think about it youre a prospective job creator youve got an idea youre a creative person you want to live the american dream but standing in your way between your dream and your capacity to do something creatively and resourcefully to put people to work to contribute to society are things like higher taxes more government regulation and red tape the impact of when i hire these people the impact of obamacare and then on top of all of that the price at the pump and higher energy prices i just dont see why the other side cannot understand why were not creating jobs why we continue to hover at the 9 percent level on unemployment just a couple of weeks ago we passed on this floor a budget for 2012 and in that budget immediately before the ink was dry we were being criticized because of what we were trying to do and what i believe is the reasonable approach to solving our nations fiscal problems and that is finally delving into something that nobody ever wanted to touch and thats the entitlement programs the mandatory spending side of the house where most of the money is i just want to make a couple of these comments as it concerns medicare because i heard back from my constituents a teletown hall meeting the other night the first phone call i got from bella vista arkansas was a gentleman worried because he had heard that we were attempting to take his medicare away in 1965 when that program was created baby boomers were teenagers and now 10 000 baby boomers a day enter qualification for medicare when medicare was created in 1965 the life expectancy of a human being was around 70 a little younger today its close to 80 years of age medicare spending is growing at an unsustainable rate of 7 2 percent every year seniors are already facing access issues think about this under the current system one in three primary doctors are limiting medicare patients one in eight are forced to deny medicare patients altogether if the medicare program is allowed to continue without any change at all the congressional budget office projects it goes bankrupt in 9 years basically if we allow medicare to maintain the status quo medicare collapses so were leading our conference is leading were taking mandatory spending and entitlement programs and were deciding that were going to throw our cards down on the table were going to do something about it the plan that we voted to approve just a couple of weeks ago preserves protects medicare for those 55 and over not just those drawing medicare but those nearing retirement people that have planned their lives around that program we dont change that for those people that needs to be said it needs to be repeated over and over again but again we get demagogued about it because at the surface level it sounds like were trying to just take it away let me repeat again those 55 and older not affected by the proposed reforms that we support starting in 2022 new medicare beneficiaries would be enrolled in the same kind of health care program that i have that my colleague from arkansas has and my other colleagues who have spoken here tonight future medicare recipients would be able to choose from a list of guaranteed coverage options and theyd be given the ability to choose a plan that works best for them its not a voucher system its premium support no money changes hands between the government and the individual its modeled after what members of congress and federal employees already have the reforms are designed to decrease the fraud within the system and requires congressional oversight by requiring transparent pricing and minimum benefit and quality standards and instituting more competitive forces my friends thats what the free enterprise system is about and i believe if it has worked for 235 years of this great country it should be also the way forward let me finish by saying this like my colleague from arkansas he and i came in as freshmen together on january 5 in these hallowed chambers we didnt come here to do nothing we didnt come here to kick the old can down the road to ignore the facts we came here to act with dispatch and make a difference for our country thats why im pleased to join my colleagues here of our great freshman class in providing this information to the american public its not only what we were elected to do it is our moral duty to do it and to do it as soon as we can and to do it with the sense of purpose that i think defines the 112th congress"], [0.0017759203910827637, 0.9982240796089172, 1, "for a great number of hours today in this chamber there has been a great debate on whether or not to repeal the affordable care act when we know fully that the chances are slim to move forward and the measure would not be signed into law is it political posturing i believe it is of a grand style theres a pattern being established here theres been an attackoutright attackon social security attempts to privatize the system its been under attack for the last 76 years its been the underpinning that provides stability for working families across this great nation it has been a security piece that has enabled many to have at least assurances that there would be some support in family budgets as they move month to month we know that that measure social security has been dealing with its enemies for a long timesince before it was made a law likewise medicare which came to us in the midsixties enabled our senior community to have its health care needs met provided predictability and stability for retired households enabled people to enjoy a quality of life a better quality of health care we know that before medicare many of those who had retired expected to see their economic security dip south because of the expected cost of providing health care when they perhaps could not get that coverage in an insurance context so medicare as we know it today would be undone by the republican majority in this house they would prefer to privatize social security allow us to reach to the financial sector to perhaps see a repeat of what happened to so many individuals and families out there with this past recession where they saw their lifetime savings wiped away trillions lost in the american economy pain and suffering endured by families across this land theyd rather see a voucher system for medicare handing it over to the insurance companies to leave seniors digging deeper into their pockets so the pattern has been established here and now a repeal of the affordable care act before its full implementation before given a chance as we arrive as the last industrialized nation in the world to provide a universal health care coverage program unacceptable progress is struck a decision is rendered by the highest court in the land a conservativeleaning court before the ink is dry on that decision a move to repeal the court spoke it has spoken to america and said the litmus test for constitutionality was debated and a decision rendered that said yes in fact it meets the constitutionality test and so this evening on the eve of the attempts to repeal the affordable care act as it stands is a very telling moment it is one that suggests to us that there is this outright attempt to undo programs that serve our middle class so very well and without a thriving middle class our nation is not prosperous without that thriving middle class theres not purchasing power strong enough to provide the recovery of our economy without a strengthening of our middle class there is not a confidence in the economy a confidence that is needed so as to grow more customers for our business base and so the affordable care act is offering promise and hope to millions tens of millions of americans across this land whether youre insured underinsured uninsured all categories will see strengthening because of this measure think of it i represent a large proportion of senior citizens who are concerned about their pharmaceutical costs many dealing with that doughnut hole have reached that threshold that requires them to dig into their pockets we close that doughnut hole we make more affordable the prescriptions that are required for people to stay well and in some cases to have the medications that keep them alive we deny that opportunity to our nations seniors we deny the respect that we offer we deny the dignity in the equation that speaks to affordable outcomes for the pharmaceuticals that our senior community requires that doughnut hole would have been closed by 2020 further at the other end of the age spectrum many young adults finding it difficult in this recessionand now the recovery periodto gain a job as they perhaps leave high school or college are given the opportunity with the affordable care act to remain on their familys policy until the age of 26 therein lies a strong benefit for some 6 6 million young adults denied with the repeal measure denying access and affordability to health care situations how many cases of young adults impacted by catastrophic illness or accidents will it require to turn the hearts and the minds in a positive direction that would not forego this opportunity for our nations young adults a strong benefit associated with this package what about those who have a preexisting condition some 17 million children in that category and thats not to account for the many adults who would be denied because of preexisting conditions asthma in children diabetes in our senior community being a woman utilized as a preexisting condition an opportunity to deny coverage and the basic core need that we should consider to be truly american another benefit lost to the greedy notion of repealing success that was achieved in this house and the united states senate and signed into law by this president what about the efforts to deny lifetime benefits as a threshold cutting people off of an insurance coverage at perhaps a very demanding time in their lives games played with people and their lives and their recovery hope pulled from working families across this nation because of an insensitivity of this congress a deplorable situation assistance to our small business community now if we profess our small business community to be the economic engine that is part and parcel of our economic comeback our economic springboard then would we not want to provide assistance in that basic core need area would we not want to allow tax credits to come the way of our small business community many a majority of those businesses will remind all of us as representatives that they want to provide for their employees they want a productive workforce that means a strong and well workforce and so they see it as a strong investment one however that they could not afford in recent years because of the escalating costs 18 percent larger bill than industry and perhaps weaker coverage they wanted that turned around they wanted a smart approach a businesslike approach a sensitive response they got it with the affordable care act progress denied the small business engine weakened by this sort of neglect that could be advanced in this cited pattern of undoing social security privatizing social security changing medicare as we know it forever now repealing the affordable care act we see the pattern we see the gross neglect the disrespect for americas middle class her working families so we go forward and we understand that with the opportunities of an exchange small employers our small business community understands that if theyre unable to enter into an exchange where all the private sector participants agree to play by the rules to sharpen their pencils roll up their sleeves provide the service live within the parameters and allow for the many to enter into a common exchange to provide corresponding benefits think of it if 1 of 10 in that employee firm of 20 were to be impacted with catastrophic illness its devastating an actuarial impact that hits that small business owner hard in the pocketbook because of the premium increase for that 1 person of the 10 you employ if those same 10 employees were allowed to enter the exchange a better outcome a different outcome a stronger outcome for the economic recovery of this nation because the gross majority of jobs being produced in this comeback are being done by our small business community and so you know the formula is quite obvious we want a comeback we want that strongest response here from washington for that kick that we endured from a recession that drained us of 8 2 million jobs the best way to do it first of three principles small business provide for the strengthening of small business which the affordable care act does because that small business community has forever been the pulse of american enterprise secondly invest in that entrepreneur the dreamer the mover the shaker it always stretched us since our days of pioneer spirit with the industrial revolution and the westward movement very familiar to the district i represent which is the donor area to the erie canal in upstate new york in the capital region mohawk valley that pioneer spirit exists in our fabric today its our dna invest in the entrepreneur to be the ideas economy kingpin we rely on these wizards to build us sustain us stretch us empower us and then finally invest in a thriving middle class which the affordable care act does it enables us as a middle class community to be bolstered by the confidence the security the stability that has come with this success story in guaranteeing access and affordability to quality health care that will underscore the value of wellness and not just deal with illness that will put together efforts to cost contain that will bring people into a structured program so that we can monitor their activities and connect them to a system you know youll hear from some on the floor we dont want to pay for this its going to cost us too much were paying today for the neglect for the consequences of a notsoperfect system status quo will not cut it and so we need to go forward with progressive policies with the soundness of reform with the boldness of transition with the confidence we can instill with the progressiveness of policies that we can draft and so it is a sad note here echoed in this chamber that would attempt to unravel dilute destroy deny the promise we can make to america as i look at this effort for a comeback the containment of health care costs is just one of those areas that we need to help control create that better environment in which to grow jobs cultivate a prosperity its important its important for us to understand that it is part of an economic recovery equation but theres also the wisdom of investing in education in higher education again under attack by a system that does not always profess the strength of research and education and patents and discovery we understand that we are in the midst of a global race on innovation clean energy and ideas and high tech to be outstanding competitors to arrive at that race ready to conquer we will need to be strong and fit in order to be the winning agent on that global scene we saw that order of passion we saw that order of investment in the global race on space just decades ago this nation impacted by a sputnik moment dusted off its backside and said never again never again and what was the result together a nation grew in its commitment to winning the global race on space we are going to be that agent that nation that proud people that would stake the american flag on the moon and we won that race because of a commitment because of investment in the soundness of the people of this great country and her business community we embraced research we embraced science we believed in our strength as a people and the confidence exuded was the elixir that brought us to the victory where is that like passion today where is that leadership a rather youthful president that led us in the sixties and challenged us in almost replication today finds us interestingly to be challenged by a rather youthful president asking us to enter into the global sweepstakes committing with passion to the cause and so we need that investment in education in higher education and research just today in schenectady new york in the 21st congressional district of new york that im proud to represent we announced formally the creation of the advanced battery manufacturing center at that facility of ge ceo jeff immelt traveled for the celebration came to town to announce this wonderful wonderful addition that is america at work with her genius activity thats america determined to win the global race on ideas advanced battery manufacturing the battery the linchpin to so much potential out there to grow domestic supplies of energy to grow jobs as we grow our energy future to reduce the gluttonous dependency on fossilbased fuels oftentimes imported from some of the most unfriendly nations to the united states sending hundreds of billions of dollars annually to those foreign treasuries that are then used to train troops to fight against our own daughters and sons on the battlefield unacceptable there is a better way and this congress knows it we invest in jobs we invest in health care we invest in education we invest in research we do it in a way that promises our best attempt as a nation to generations yet unborn someone was there for us and we need to be there for future generations of americans to provide the sort of cuttingedge opportunity that will spell america at her best i look at that opportunity for not only battery manufacturing but nanotechnology and semiconductor signs chip manufacturing the newly designed 20th congressional district in new york that comprises a good portion of the now existing 21st district that i represent is probably one of the most technology investedin congressional districts in the country it is happening because there is this belief in the worker a belief in the entrepreneur a belief in the small business community a belief in the industrial context of the district and knowing full well that americas needsbe they for the environment or energys sake or business creation job creation business opportunityare inspiring this remarkable progress it requires our moving forward with a plan it requires our moving forward academically with the soundness of policy and with the corresponding resource advocacy that will yield lucrative dividends i see it all the time i see it in energyefficiency programs that produce jobs that enable us to capture waste heat that is part of the energy process enabling us to be much more efficient efforts that enable us to create more and more patents in a world that has grown much more competitive much more sophisticated we can ill afford to weaken in our attempts to be the kingmakers of the international economy the old american spirit the history of this nation replete with those rags to riches scenarios that became the reason and the inspiration for the compilation of journeys made by our ancestors to these shores because the opportunity called the american dream became the prize for which they searched i see it in my own roots the proudest label i carry in life is as the grandson of immigrants their journey gave me great opportunity and it gave my family great opportunity those journeys chased after the american dream we need beginning in this house chamber to reignite the american dream to go back to the core essence of who we are as a people to reach into that american heart and soul that has forever relied on its passion that we can achieve because we have opportunity and that we will not deny that opportunity that we will strengthen the boldness of those dreams and enable us to respond to the needs of the moments and the future and to write our legacy as a generation of americans let us not fail in that attempt let us continue to reach deep into that american spirit at a time when we were challenged and our economy was brought to its knees by failed policies that did not manage well that did not provide for the stewardship of our resources and when we tripped and fell let it be known that in the recovery we were stronger than ever before because of that belief that our best days lay ahead of us the belief that those best days were in the future we moved forward and we dug deep into that american spirit to respond with the respect for americas middle class our middle classall of us in that middle classhave always understood if you play hard if you abide by the rules if you roll up your sleeves and do your best you could rightfully anticipate the taste of success that is america in her most shining moments and that is an economy that we can produce it begins with the soundness of a strong and productive workforce that went through training and retraining that got to taste the potential for success by that self discovery that comes with education and to then understand our gifts so that we could share them in the most profound way and then to provide for the wellness of that workforce so it could be most productive so that the conditioning that came with that sort of commitment and that order of respect and that potion of dignity could then allow for us to speak to a nation that was humbled by its own beginnings where the rightful stories of so many who made it their journey were written by a nation that believed in her people so tonight on this eve of an attempt to repeal the affordable care act let us understand that our budget here in washington our actions with legislation our responsiveness to the needs of the american people are an establishment of our prioritiesa prescription of what we see our future to bea reaching into the heart to say that we are a truly caring lot thats what separates us from other nations it is the uniqueness of america and her greatness the affordable care act is a measurement of not only sound policy it is a statement of a compassionate society that understands its not about oneself that its about neighbors that its about community that its about the great society it has been the history through the decades through the vintages of time that has enabled us to reach to the greatness of our government to reach to the soundness of ideas and innovation to respond to the challenges that have enabled us to build upon those who preceded us always anticipating that the next generation would be made stronger we owe it to our children and grandchildren and generations yet unborn let them look at this moment in history american history knowing that america was challenged that she stepped up to the plate and said yes to her people and truly made a difference and allowed people to understand full well that the best days of this great nation lie ahead of us with that i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0018519163131713867,

seniors of this guaranteed benefit the republican budget proposal dismantles medicare as we know it telling seniors they are going to be on their own to find insurance no matter what the cost or how sick they are and it slashes medicaid coverage for seniors who need longterm care threatening our sickest most frail elderly in nursing homes with no care at all this is absolutely the wrong approach to solving our nations budget problems every day 48 million elderly and disabled americans across this country count on medicare for their lifesaving medications doctor visits and hospital care sixtynine percent of people over the age of 65 and they are both democrats and republicans oppose medicare becoming a voucher program seniors know that changing medicare to a voucher program means that they will no longer have access to a guaranteed set of health benefits that the value of a limited voucher wont keep up with rising health care costs that the voucher would become insufficient over time and the care they need could become unaffordable that too many taxpayer dollars will be spent on advertising campaigns and administrative costs instead of actual medical expenses and seniors know that privatizing medicare means limits on benefits obstacles to care uncertain reimbursements copayments for primary care or specialty care exclusions for certain services discrimination based on income illness or age and more uncertainty if a serious illness or need for longterm care occurs seniors know that privatizing or voucherizing medicare will mean that they pay more in premiums or do without and it doesnt end there in addition to medicare cuts republicans also want to take away medicaid for the nearly 6 million seniors who depend on it for nursing home or longterm care they say proudly that they will cut funding to states by 1 trillion this means that disabled and frail elderly americans will be placed on waiting lists for services or have no access to care at all in pennsylvania my home state nearly 40 percent of funds spent on longterm care would be at risk this includes 62 percent of nursing home residents and 25 000 pennsylvanian seniors who receive home health services and yet when republicans had the opportunity to reduce costs while maintaining and strengthening care for our seniors they demonized the plan voting time and again to stop important improvements in medicare and they still want to repeal the law that eliminates copayments for preventive care services that makes prescription drug benefits more affordable and improves coordination of care and health outcomes reduces errors and reduces costs for seniors they want to repeal the law that curbs the growth in medicare spending saves taxpayers almost 500 billion by ending overpayments to insurance companies and extends the life of the medicare trust fund for 12 years instead the republicans here in washington want to end medicare as we know it and put health care for american seniors at great risk as a senior member of the budget committee i know how important it is to find solutions to reducing the deficit to do this right the solution must include spending cuts tax policy reform and economic growth we should not fix our budget problems by failing to meet our obligations to our seniors every day we hear how determined republicans are to slash billions of dollars from the central programs because we simply cant afford it they say we cant afford to make investments in the future we cant afford to educate our children or fix our roads or fuel innovation or cover health care costs for seniors yet in the same proposal to slash medicare and medicaid for millions of seniors republicans make permanent tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of americans in the very same budget proposal where republicans take away guaranteed benefits for seniors they protect billions of tax subsidies to the oil and gas industry in the very same budget proposal where republicans give seniors a limited voucher to pay for higher insurance premiums they protect the pentagon from spending cuts on unnecessary weapon systems one trillion dollars in tax expenditures 700 billion in tax cuts for the wealthy few 40 billion in tax breaks for oil companies and billions of dollars to continue inefficiencies at the pentagonall of this spending is protected by the republican budget and instead they choose to slash benefits to our seniors and our disabled americans budgets are about priorities and theyre about our values yes we should get serious about our nations deficit but lets be sure that our priorities are right and we do not threaten our obligations to our seniors to our children or to americas future"], [0.0019191690953448415, 0.0019191690953448415, 0, "weve all been back in our districts for the last month and weve been talking to friends and neighbors back home about what america is truly concerned with what is most important in the eyes of all americans and that is getting america back to work our economy is stagnant this administration is throwing up barriers which is freezing assets because the folks that normally would invest in growth and hiring people are frightened about whats around the next corner and theyre sitting with all their money and theyre not growing i met this morning with around somewhere between 12 and 14 of my neighbors in just a sitdown cup of coffee where we sat around and we talked about the way that folks in central texas view whats going on with the job market you know in texas weve been blessed we havent faced the kinds of unemployment numbers that other states have had but we now are certainly seeing unemployment creeping up in our state also we had small businessmen and women there and they talked about the things that concern them but yet weve had meetings with bankers whove explained to us that you can look at their deposits and see that american local investors are sitting on the sidelines and keeping their deposits in the bank and not investing in growth and not investing in capital structure not building buildings and certainly not hiring people and so part of the discussion this morning from some very intelligent small business folks was we think we know why why do you say this is happening the answers i got were answers that we hear on the floor of this house every day but the one that ive been talking about now for almost a year probably maybe even over a year is the fact that we are seeing the administration doing through government regulations which are basically laws passed by the regulators which change the playing field for people and our economy across the board at every level its not done by acts of this congress its done by acts of bureaucrats in the obama administration as they make rules and regulations that fit their view of the world and how they think the world should work and these regulations regulate the drivers the force builders that employ the american people many of these regulations have become such a shock to the conscience of people who are in business that they say my lord im not about to get invested in growth until i know whether im going to even have my business once the regulators are through with me and then sitting on the sideline is the giant regulator program which is the health care bill that this house passed last year and the senate passed we call it obamacare its 2 000 pages are multiplying very rapidly as the regulators the people who are able to pass rules to set up the regulations that govern that bill are imposing more and more burden on the individual employer and on those people seeking health care so what i heard today from some people who are presidents of small businesses run small businessesa thomas barrett a very intelligent lawyer who is both a financial adviser and a lawyer for small and other sized businesses all over central texas and is highly sought after for his opinionthey said its the unknown thats driving the investment off the page in the united states its the unknown we dont know whats going to happen next our taxes what are taxes going to do weve got taxes that will last for a while and then go back to a different tax automatically unless this house acts then most importantly and what we talked mostly about today was all the new regulations that are coming up in the next 3 or 4 months the republican leadership in this house is going to do everything it can to turn back some of the craziness thats gone on in the regulatory world i brought the members here tonight just a few examples of some of the regulations many of which weve been talking about all year weve spent a lot of time talking about the cement industry weve talked about boiler mact weve talked about a lot of other things were going to talk about tonight but its just a general outline of some corrective measures that this republicanled house is going to try and going to pass through this body to just start slowing down and changing the direction of what we think are some illconceived regulations by the executive branch the obama administration i want to start off with this poster right here which just gives you a small example of what were talking about in july of this summerthis is what weve called the regulatory summer these are regulations that have been proposed by various agencies many of them are household words like the environmental protection agency but there are plenty of others the labor departmentyou could go on and on in july 229 proposed regulations went into effect 379 final regulations and the cost estimated of these proposed and final regulations over 9 5 billion to the economy in the month of july that meant business the job creators took a hickey of 9 5 billion in 1 month the month of july 2011 we have just finished august270 proposed regulations 347 final regulations over 8 2 billion in august so for this summer just july and august the 2month total 17 7 billion in costs to the people who create jobs now is it any wonder that the people who create jobs are sitting on the sidelines and saying holy cow how do i hire somebody and i think the american people know why people in business hire somebody they hire somebody because they think that person will make their business more prosperous will make it work more efficiently will make it do the job the business was set up to do if you are in the roofing business and you put roofs on houses you hire more roofers because you think you will be able to produce a better quality product faster and more efficiently therefore enhancing the profit that those who have invested their capital and labor into that businessthey can make a profit so that that business can thrive you dont hire roofers when you dont need to put roofs on houses i mean that doesnt make any sense and everybody with any kind of common sense knows that now if youve got a person whos got some business whether it be big or small and they literally dont know what the government is going to do to them tomorrow or lets just say in the next 2 months following this track record they could be looking at another almost 20 billion worth of additional costs to their business that could be coming up in september and october based upon the last 2 months its arguable that its pretty close to 20 billion of additional costs that they were not anticipating and never thought was going to happen to them and all of a sudden out of the clear blue it drops in their lap now you will hear arguments like wait a minute there are these things that are environmental and other ways and people have known all along something about this was going to be done and that may or may not be true but the ramifications of what the regulators actually did are turning out to be horrendous costs to industries that right now are trying to get the ground under them stable so they can start hiring people again if youre on balancing ground sort of like this earthquake we had up here in washington which i am very fortunate that i wasnt in when that ground is unstable you dont know which way to turn well the same thing goes for business when the foundation underneath your business is unstable you dont know which way to turn are you going to go out and hire somebody give them a job when this is what your life is right now and someone is creating that problem that are actually by their actions making it unstable i would argue that questionable regulations the imposition of additional costs the unknown of what taxes are going to be tomorrowall these things create an unstable environment for the people who hire people so this last regulatory summer is a perfect example of the earthquake that has shaken the foundation of the small businessman and the job creators in america the president of the united states promised us the white house promised us to save 10 billion in redtape which is kind of the slang term for bureaucratic regulations in 5 years but the white house has put forward 17 7 billion worth of redtape in 2 months the message has been lost somewhere where is it when did what we were promised change into a threeforone worse situation we were promised a 5 billion savings for the job creators and in fact weve created a 17 7 billion expense and uncertainty to the job creators and we wonder why we are not creating jobs mr kucinich was talking about his view of the world he and i dont see the world the same way but the facts are when he was talking about we need to create jobs we darn sure need to create jobs the role of the congress today is finding ways to get this country back to work if we put this country back to work 90 percent of our problems will be much much better so the real goal of the republican house this year to finish this year out is going to be trying to correct at least some of this instability created by these regulators these unelected regulators these are appointed people not elected people the heads of these agencies are appointed by the president they are under the wings of the white house if you will they are part of the executive branch of government and the legislature this branch the congress is going to in the next several months try to put some reins on these outofcontrol regulators and hold them back and weve got just some of them i am going to talk to you about that some of my colleagues are putting forward in the future the week of september 12 which is next week i suppose were going to take up the protecting jobs from government interference act by tim scott of south carolina now the facts of this situation are very unusual in my way of thinking and i think most of the people in the united states when they heard this on television they said they cant do that can they it seems the boeing corporation has a big operation up in the washington state area and they were wanting to build an additional plant to build whatever boeing builds whether its aircraft or whatever it isthey wanted to do it in south carolina they have been negotiating and working in good faith with the citizens of south carolina and the government of south carolina they have looked at alternative locations around the country to make a determination of what is best for their business in their situation today and they determined that they were going to build a very important plant in south carolina but the national labor relations board the nlrb issued a complaint against the boeing company for the alleged transfer of an assembly line from the washington plant to south carolina yet not one union employee at the boeings puget sound facility thats the washington plant has lost his or her job as a result of the proposed south carolina plant still the nlrb is pursuing a restoration order against boeing that would cost south carolina thousands of jobsthese are new jobs in south carolinaand deter future investment in the united states this is the government telling boeing how they can run their business at the base level of you cant move unless we tell you you can move and if you choose to go to a righttowork state instead of a union shop state were going to tell you no you cant do it what happened to the freedom of movement that our founding fathers created in this country i mean part of what makes us great is if you cant prosper in texas you can maybe prosper in south dakota in fact people are right now as we talk right now people are taking businesses from one part of the country and going to another part of the country because of maybe newly discovered resources maybe a better work environment maybe a more intelligent workforce maybe a better investment community maybe better opportunities maybe better tax structure thats the free right of every american is seeking prosperity for their company and for their family to go seek these places if were going to tell boeing they cant build a plant to create jobs in south carolina next they may be telling sam smith in oklahoma im sorry but we need you to stay in oklahoma we dont want you to move to texas or we dont want you to move to south carolina to go to work in the boeing plant which we just canceled is that the kind of world we have and we want this government to have i would say no do we want the people of south carolina to have 1 500 new jobs yes is anybody talking about hurting the people employed at puget sound no its the issue of union membership that drove this whole thing and we have given our states the right to choose whether they have a righttowork state or they have a union state and every state in this country has some difference in how they view that its part of the environment that state creates to bring business into the community what in the world is wrong with that and when did that become big brothers job to tell somebody where they can and cant offer you a job so are we now saying that the people of washington stateand i have many friends there and i love very much and i dont mean to be in any way defaming washington statebut we have got a group of bureaucrats that are saying those are more important people than the people in south carolina who want to work for boeing for a good salary because the governments telling them they cant do it the gentleman from south carolina tim scott has got this bill h r 2587 were going to take it up next week i understand which is going to protect these jobs from this government interference it would take the commonsense step and it would prevent that national labor relations board from restricting where an employer can create jobs in the united states who would have ever thought we would have had to even address this on the floor of this house this world that we have lived in and in fact president john f kennedy in writing one of his dissertation papers at harvard came up with a term the great frontier which the whole concept of america was if you failed in one place the great blessing of america is you can pack up and move to another place at one time that was the frontier now that frontier is in technology that frontier is in science that frontier is not just moved from one place to the other its moved from one idea to the other thats the greatness of america to have the government tell you where you can and cant locate is an abomination to the very spirit of the american dream this one we need to do it right away we are going to do it we hope our friends in the senate are going to help we have the administrations new maximum achievable technology act mact standards and cross state air pollution csapr for utility plants will affect electricity prices for nearly all american consumers in total 10 000 power plants are expected to be affected i cant tell you the number in other states but texas surprisingly fell under this act which no one anticipated and we actually had no input whatsoeverbut thats a different argument which i have made before but i know that we are talking about 17 to 19 plants just in texas are being closed down these are coalpowered plants were talking about coalpowered plants in most instances here the result to middle class america is an annual electricity bill increase in parts of the country anywhere from 12 to 24 percent just by this one regulation that has been proposed dealing with coalpowered plants and greenhouse gas emissions well representative john sullivan of oklahoma has come up with a solution for this h r 2401 the transparency in regulatory analysis of impacts on the nation one of the things that we think any regulator should be looking at as he is doing this type of work is how does this impact the jobs of the american people how does this impact the economy of the area if you have a state that has 20 power plants and the results of your mandatory and arbitrary ruling is going to shut down 12 or 15 of those plants it doesnt take a genius to figure the price of electricity is going up even if they go in and they make a conversion to some other form of power at great cost and expense billions of dollars of additional money happen to be spent even if they do that you are still going to have down time when electricity is going to be scarce and the risk of blackouts and brownouts is going to be increased quite honestly it hurts every industry and every person that depends on that electricity has anybody looked into this and said here is how we figure this out and told us with transparency what effect this has no so what mr sullivan is trying to say is that we need to call a timeout and it would require a cumulative economic analysis for specific environmental protection rules and specifically delay the final date for both utility mact and csapr rules until full impact of the obamas administration regulatory agenda has been studied some of this stuff is done with computer projections but the facts are its kind of a shock and surprise to everybody thats in the business and its time that we call time out and rather than cost this country jobs give these people a chance to continue to have good jobs for the american people to work in this is a good bill and were going to take this bill up the week of september the next bill that this republican congress is going to go take up is h r 2250 to deal with whats called boiler mact from hospitals to factories colleges thousands of major american employers use boilers that will be impacted by the epas new boiler mact rules these new stringent rules will impose billions of dollars in capital and compliance costs increasing the costs of many goods and services college kids will tell you how expensive going to university is today they dont need any more cost increase there but it will increase the cost of higher education and it will put over 200 000 jobs at risk just what they have done under the boiler mact rules so what are we doing with h r 2250 representative morgan griffith of virginia has proposed this its called the epa regulatory relief act and would provide a legislative stay for four interrelated rules issued by the epa in march of this year the legislation would also provide the epa with at least 15 months to repropose and finalize new achievable rules that do not destroy jobs and provide employers with an extended compliance period in other words if its a problem lets fix the problem without costing people jobs lets fix the problem with a reasonable amount of time for compliance so that its not a kneejerk reaction that is required by everybody to try to keep from going out of business because of epaimposed rules so basically just like the last bill we talked about this is saying stop this craziness take a new look let the people youre regulating have some input into the cost and the compliance and the job loss and then lets restructure if weve got to fix this problem restructure it in a manner that makes common sense to keep the american men and women of this country working keep the factories open and producing and the colleges and universities open and producing and not impose a shortterm heavy burden of an additional capital infusion in order to meet regulatory changes give them a reasonable amount of time that common sense says it would take to fix the problem instead of imposing this rammeddownyourthroat series of rules october 3 is the week the republican congress will be bringing that before the american people and before this house this is one ive been working on for quite awhile i hope through part of our efforts during these evenings when weve talked about the cement mact issue the imposition of new regulations on greenhouse gas emissions for the cement factories and the fact that weve had the opportunity to very effectively drive cement production out of this country and offshore to china india and maybe mexico where they dont regulate at all the emissions and then we think that somehow its going to fix greenhouse gases its kind of insane that cleaning it up over here and driving people offshore to where they dont clean it up at all is going to help anything its going to hurt something but thats a different argument in the week of october 3 the cement mact and two related rules are expected to affect approximately 100 cement plants in america the cost is estimated to be somewhere between 3a billion for a 68 billion industry just do the math thats a tremendous burden if these rules come into effect these stringent requirements will be cost prohibitive and the american cement industry quite frankly could be at risk across the board we could wake up finding ourselves importing from other countries by necessity a product that we now lead the world on you know concrete is the second most used building material on earth the only thing thats used more than concrete is water so portland cement which is the base ingredient in creating concrete is as important to the building of infrastructure buildings and basically everything that we live with as anything on earth and we are in that business and we produce cement in various states in this country we produce the portland cement process and these regulations would shut down factories and basically cause these international companiesbecause all companies whether they are based here or not trade internationallyto move someplace else and you wonder why jobs are going overseas well in this case in the cement industry jobs will be going out of the country for one specific reasongovernment regulations beyond reasonableness the cement sector regulatory relief act sponsored by representative sullivan my good friend from oklahoma will provide a legislative stay of these ruleshold off brother we need to look at these thingsand provide the epa with at least 15 months to repropose and finalize new and heres the magic word achievable rules that do not destroy jobs and provide employers with an extended compliance period once again quit cramming it down our throat quit saying youve got to do it tomorrow give us time to implement reasonable rules and as we look at these rules lets analyze what they are going to cost us in the way of jobs and in the way of our economy and take that into consideration as you plan out the reasonable way forward youll find that many of the things that well be taking up in the next couple of months right there is the secret key ingredient were going to come up with rules that you can achieve without destroying jobs that will still over a long term if you give time to comply will meet the requirements that are necessary that people think to clean things up if they need to be cleaned up october 3 is when we are going to take that up sometime in the month of october or november we will take up another bill oh by the way when youre talking about jobs in these portland cement factories these jobs are good jobs these are labor jobs but they are trained labor jobs they are good jobs that pay somewhere between 65 000 and 85 000 each now thats a good american job that ought to be done by an american not by someone from china or from india because we have driven these industries out of our country coal ash h r 2273 these are antiinfrastructure regulations commonly referred to as coal ash rules that will cost hundreds of billions of dollars to fix according to the existing regulations affect everything from concrete production to building products like wallboard the result is an estimated loss of well over 100 000 jobs so you know at the end of this last month we had no job gains not one job was created thats what the report said well just in the things that ive read to you so far as a result of these regulations if all of this took place next month just the numbers weve given were talking about 500 000 jobs so far that these bills that this republican congress is going to take up and try to get some reasonableness in this regulatory process its time for this congress to not surrender the lawmakingrulemaking is lawmakingauthority to regulators without overseeing what they are doing and making sure that they are not harming our economy and harming what is going on in america and the jobs that everybody needs we cant afford to lose more jobs we have to keep the people working who have jobs and then weve got to enhance these businesses in such a way that they feel that they are not going to be threatened by surprise regulations and therefore they are willing to say i have got stable ground under my feet and i can start to expand and hire again and start to invest my capital which right now is sitting in the bank into new and better products services factories et cetera so this coal ash bill that will cost this country 100 000 jobs h r 2273 the coal residual reuse and management act sponsored by representative david mckinley of west virginia will create an enforceable minimum standard for regulation of coal ash by the states allowing their use in a safe manner to produce products and protect jobs its just basically saying let the people who have this coal ashand its in certain states more than other placesuse this coal ash and regulate this coal ash in such a manner that it does enhance the environment without destroying american jobs once again the congress has got to act and the republican congress is prepared to act now here comes my favorite of the crazy regulatory acts the epa is now proposing rules to regulate dust now i live in texas weve got more highway miles than any other state in the union plenty of paved roads but weve also got what we call farm roads and ranch roads and in the western part of the state those farm roads are covered with what we call caliche which is a pulverized limestone and over in the eastern part theyre covered with certain types of gravel some of its river gravel and other things when a farmer drives up to his house on his driveway its usually got some kind of gravel or caliche on it and it kicks up dust the epa is now saying you can be fined for driving home every night on your gravel road now what is your solution well its easy go out and spend 20 000 and pave your driveway5 miles of driveway so put pavement on it oh but make sure you put a certain kind of pavement because its got to have pavement that doesnt kick up dust arguably if you use asphalt it wont kick up dust or concrete wont kick up dustor not as muchbut you might kick up a little more dust if you do what they call squirt top which is what most farm roads are which is tar with gravel spread on it until that gravel sets it kicks up dust so even if you went to the expense to build a farm road that was a paved farm road your paving method might kick up enough dust to get them to fine you and take money out of your pocket anyway and the epa now wants to regulate dust california does this already i asked one of my california colleagues how do you keep from getting fined in california while having the dust regulations heres what they said water down your roads every day so it doesnt have dust mud is okay dust is bad okay now that may be great for california i dont know what the water situation is in california but it hasnt rained in texas some kids are about to go off to school and havent seen rain in texas it hasnt rained so long but seriously i landed at the airport and looked out at this waterfall up here on the east coast and said holy cow we dont know what that looks like back home why dont they move all this water on the east coast down to texas where it hasnt rained to my knowledge in 6 months and half of my neighboring county of bastrop is burning to the ground because its so dry and so hot and we havent had a rain in so long we may be the only state in america thats praying that a hurricane will hit our coast so we can get some rain are you going to tell that farmer that the only way hes getting that water that hes feeding his animals is through shallow wells that may have gone dry on him or deep wells he has to drill to get to additional water under the ground or windmills that are pumping that water if you are out west which are not that deep and a lot of them have gone dryhis precious water that his livestock and his family needs to survive hes got to take it out and squirt it on his road so he can get home at night now does that make economic sense to the american people i dont think so but then if you sit in the big epa building in washington d c and have never even seen one of these roads and probably never been outside this beltway it may make perfect sense to that person in this paved world that we live in inside the beltway but it doesnt make sense to the average person thats trying to make a living all across the rural parts of the united states and not just rural but all across the united states where unfortunately we kick up dust by the way plowing kicks up dust so then you can only plow when the fields are wet did you ever plow when the fields are wet the only person who would sit in the epa office and think that the farm products magically appear at their grocery store would know that you cant get off in a muddy field and plow effectively yes you can turn up some moisture at the right time and you can keep dust down and farmers do they dont want their top soil blowing away like it did in the dust bowl theyve learned their lesson about that and theyre doing the best they can and i would commend them for doing it i went to school in lubbock texas back in the 1960s at the end of what we call the dust storm era and because of modern farming methods and so forth they still have dust storms up there but theyre nothing like what they had in the fifties nothing like what we had in the sixties and i would argue that because of good modern farming methods we keep the dust to a minimum but we still sometimes have half the state of new mexico blow through the panhandle of texas now who are you going to fine the state of new mexico the new mexico farmers the texas farmers where it lands whos going to be responsible for all that dust thats out there in the air well the epa says somebody is because they set regulations and that would be a violation of these regulations the biggest shortage of anything in this town is common sense this is the most nonsensical rule of anything thats come down one of our new freshman congressmen kristi noem is a smart lady she knows rural america she knows the ridiculousness of this set of epa rules shes come up with a farm dust bill which we will take up this winter to make epa start using some common sense the president was asked a question about this in one of his meetings here recently at a town hall he sent this farmer on a bureaucratic wild goose chase and he never got anything in return so as a result of that that farmer his efforts whichthat wild goose chase produced nothing that was satisfactoryrepresentative kristi noem of south dakota has h r 1633 which would protect american farmers and jobs by establishing a 1year prohibition against revising any national ambient air quality standards applicable to coarse particulate matterthats dustand limiting federal regulations of dust which are already regulated under state and local laws in other words let the states take care of it let me tell you something this is not one of those texas brags we had dust storms when i went to school where girls didnt wear dresses in the spring because it would pick up pea gravel the size of a dime with those 60mileanhour winds coming across the plains and it would blow that gravel so hard against their bare legs if they had on dresses it would literally cut them off if they tried to walk to class now thats an act of god nobody created that wind and certainly pea gravel is about as big a particulate matter that would be flying around anywhere but the federal government doesnt control the wind and it never will weve got to get some reasonableness back into whats going on finally because ive been talking about this now for over a year and in my office we are tracking every regulatory agency and every day were seeing new and bizarre concepts of what we need to do from regulatory agencieswere seeing bugs shut down major highway projects when the president laughed and he said he learned that shovelready jobs are not really shovelready jobs he should have gone on to tell you why many of those shovelready jobs werent shovel ready and it was because of regulations created by the regulatory agencies that stopped legitimate road and bridge projects that were funded i have one in my district right now that is funded and the dozers are on the ground ready to move and that project is shut down by one of these many many regulations its the same across the country we cant do today what fdr did its great to talk about what fdr did i dont think it accomplished a whole lot in getting us out of the depression but thats my opinion but the facts are you couldnt build a hoover dam today just up and go out there and start building a hoover dam my lord just to build an electric power plant the number of regulatory agencies and permits that you would have to have would cover the walls of this chamber before you even get to break ground ive seen those rules put on walls its an amazing number of rules we are a world of government control of everything thats what these regulatory acts are about finally this congressman john carter because of looking at this stuff now just for the last year or so i really and truly think the best thing we can do to give the stability to the employers who employ people is to basically ban the implementation of any new federal regulations from now through january 31 2013 guarantee a 2year window for businesses to hire without any fear of new costs from regulations and certain exceptions would be allowed for the military or foreign affairs or internal agency management and personnel rules so theyd still be able to have regulations that fit in those categories and make sure that we keep our foreign operations and our military operating they have to make rules to operate under we would exempt those particular things but the rest of them we would say timeout continue your studies continue your discussions i would encourage you to extend an arm out to business to say this is what were looking at lets hear what you think lets start putting ourselves together with the idea that people are part of this environment too people are really what makes up this country without people were just a barren land people to live need to have a job and the people who create jobs need to have a reason for hiring people and giving them a job people who have ideasthe great driving force of america the new idea we just have so many examples of new ideas just in the hightech industry and the communications industry the revolution that has taken place just in the last 10 years of new ideas those new ideas come from the freedom to think and the belief that you can take that idea and put it into reality without somebody stepping on your toes and preventing you from doing it these regulations and this control from washington d c this cradletograve mentality that seems to be running inside this beltway and the creation of these regulatory rules is putting the brakes on our economy and putting fear in the hearts of american entrepreneurs and businesspeople and employers who want to make their business better by hiring those good people that were graduating from our colleges and universities those good people that are trained in trained skills that we need to put to work in america and well put them to work in real jobs not governmentcreated jobs with borrowed money but real jobs that produce something and create wealth and make us and continue to keep us the most prosperous nation on earth it doesnt come from government it comes from the people the people are the wealth of this nationtheir ideas their entrepreneurship the investment of their own personal capital and their willingness to take a risk on america because they know america is great and to people who dont think were great or think that theyre smarter and can be inside this beltway and make rules that can do a better job of telling you how to run your life or how to drive home on your farm road than you know i say get out of the way thats what this fall is going to be about were going to be bringing these things up and these are things that are going to be discussed and talked about and voted on this fall because we republicans believe that the right path to create jobs and create wealth in america is to get the regulators to start thinking in terms of creating jobs not destroying jobs enhancing businesses not negating businesses and to put america back to work and if we put america back to work all the rest gets better the debt goes down the tax revenues go up the country has more to pay back the people we owe which ought to be our first priority we can get our financial house back in order we can get our credit rating back that was taken away from us and we can start operating like america has always operated the business of this country is business and as much as that was criticized back in the twenties that statement is true today just like it was then its the american people that give the american people jobs not the government lets put the brakes on these regulatory things were going to do that this fall i look forward to it pay attention to it members of this house and anyone around the country who has an interest pay attention to it give us your input because we are bound and determined to level out and stabilize that playing field that business creates jobs on so that we can put america back to work i thank you for your time and i yield back the balance of my time"],

million americans live in poverty and one in five children are growing up in poverty the recession may be over for big corporations and the superrich but for far too many americans the recession is actually a depression yesterday the out of poverty caucus held a press conference with organizations working on the front lines with lowincome and poor people we heard stories of more homelessness long lines at food pantries and the desperation felt by so many our nations unemployment rate remains at an unacceptably high 9 2 percent millions of americans who have lost their jobs are finding it harder and harder to find a new one these new ranks of the longterm unemployed and their families are facing the stark reality of life in poverty for the first time the ongoing impact of the recession on struggling families and those facing or living in poverty simply must not be ignored but instead of working to improve the lives of millions of americans in poverty the republican party continues their drive to plunge our nation into default and our economy over the brink speaker boehner has unveiled yet another republican plan that fails to do what america needs his plan fails to end the threat of default his plan targets the programs aimed at americas most vulnerableour seniors our children and our lowincome familiesfor more draconian cuts trying to balance the budget on the backs of the poor is morally wrong we need a balanced approach that balances targeted cuts with the revenue that we need we must make sure that we can pay the benefits that we owe to our seniors protect medicare medicaid and social security and safeguard our most vulnerable communities while the nations unemployment level remains unacceptably high for some minority communities it was double digits even before the recession began the unemployment rate for african americans today is recorded at 16 2 percent and latinos recorded at 11 2 percent and what many of us have known for a long long time now african americans and latinos have lost 18 to 20 times their net worth more so than white americans due to structural inequalities where race is a factor these numbers are horrific and speak to the larger crisis facing our nation the jobs crisis let me share the story of one american who is looking for a job reverend david was laid off from his job as the successful director of a faithbased nonprofit that served the disadvantaged and worked to put people on a path to selfsufficiency now he is relying on the very safety net programs that he used to connect others to he diligently job hunts week after week david and his wife rely on unemployment benefits to make ends meet and he is worried about what he will do when he reaches the 99week limit of those benefits reverend david is not alone fortyfive million americans worry about where they will sleep at night if their children will eat what will happen if they need medical attention and when will they secure a livingwage job we must work together to help the millions of americans who are still struggling to recover from the great recession as the first order of business i call on the speaker to bring my legislation h r 589 to the floor for an upordown vote immediately it would add 14 weeks of retroactive emergency unemployment benefits to those longterm unemployed known as 99ers who continue to face uncertainty and hardships passing this extension will stimulate our economy not to mention that it is our moral responsibility to help those in need but people really want to work instead of creating jobs republicans are holding our economy hostage putting forth policies that will create more unemployment and more job loss instead of quickly passing a clean debt ceiling vote the republicans are marching lockstep to create this default instead of supporting the vital human needs programs that will protect our most vulnerable republicans are trying to balance the budget on the backs of the poor while maintaining these tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires and big oil there is no more time for these republican games the american people expect us to put partisanship aside to protect our economy and create jobs the american dream has been a nightmare for the 45 million living in poverty and is turning quickly into a nightmare for millions who are falling from middle income into the ranks of

wasteful defense spending unfortunately the underlying bill is just another part of the republican no jobs agenda since the republican caucus has taken over the majority they havent put one jobs bill on i mean they havent done a poor jobthey havent done anything it is as if they are not in favor of americans having jobs we know they are but they havent demonstrated it in anything they have done which is the important thing instead as part of the republican no jobs agenda they bring up a bill to cut 1 million jobs cut 1 million jobs from the american middle class these cuts are republican answers for the job crisis that they created cutting 1 million jobs if you are a nurse no jobs if you are a teacher no jobs if you are a firefighter or police officer no jobs if your jobs are from american manufacturing no jobs and if you are a small business person who is going to have any money to even go into your store no jobs for them either the list goes on and on if you want to know how we cut the deficit it is by putting america to work not by cutting social security make no mistake when the republicans say they are cutting costs they are cutting social security they are cutting medicare they are cutting medicaid until they cease to exist republicans want working americans to shoulder the whole burden the burden of a taxpayerfunded spending spree for the rich while protecting millionaires and billionaires who refuse to pay their fair share the republican answer to the crisis they created is you pay american people they must make you pay for big oils billion dollar subsidies they want to make you pay for higher drug prices they want to make you pay for taxes to start a small business they want to make you pay for ceo bonuses they want main street to take the hit while wall street gets a bonus while democrats work to create jobs reduce the deficit and rebuild america republican speaker john boener said so be it if we lose hundreds of thousands of jobs is that what the american people said they wanted in november the american people want republican leaders to look out for constituents first not corporate friends and now the american people are saying show us the jobs we have been seeing a no jobs agenda a jobless agenda forty days in the majority and nothing to create jobs no jobs for the american people madam chairman we need to make this change will the republican caucus even today madam chairman say you know what we are not going to cut 1 million people 1 million public employees out of work we are going to actually do something to create jobs it appears not madam chairman what we need to do is withdraw some of these massive oil subsidies what we need to do is save some money by not rewarding the wealthiest among us and industries who have not been responsible corporate citizens and actually use it to put americans back to work so that they can pay some taxes and actually reduce this deficit make no mistake about it madam chairman we are concerned about the deficit 200 billion of it goes to interest on the debt that money could be going to programs that help people to help children to help seniors that can make and strengthen and improve our infrastructure and our country but instead it goes to this massive debt built up by republicans with their massive tax cuts to the rich two wars and a big pharma giveaway they created the problem now when we try to solve it they want to put us back in the hole so i want to say that if this countryour countryhas a deficit to fix lets fix it by a bold creative courageous vision of

farmworkers who spent their lives working in the swampy fields bordering lake apopka in florida their backbreaking work helped to provide the bulk of the winter season produce on the eastern seaboard in the early 1990s a settlement was negotiated with the large farming corporations where 20 000 acres of land were sold for roughly 100 million a negligible amount of 200 000 was allocated for the 2 500 farmworkers and most were simply given pink slips despite decades of service on the farm for years these workers were exposed to a chemical mixture of carcinogens and other contaminants as planes cropdusted the fields now these workers are suffering from an array of diseases that have been linked to longterm pesticide exposure their children suffer from defects cause by prenatal exposure to harmful contaminants these women have worked for over a decade to bring attention to their cause while many of their former colleagues unfortunately have passed away although these women are desperately seeking some relief and good health what they ask for more than anything else is their dignity dignity is the contribution of their community to feeding this nation and the sacrifices they made in doing so i would therefore offer my profound and earnest gratitude to these incredible women to their community and to farmworkers across the country for theirs truly are the hands that feed us now more than ever we need to redouble our efforts to reward hard work we must work to be sure that americans who work all of their lives have something to show for it this does not just affect linda lee or geraldine matthew we cannot ignore the fact that millions of americans have seen their retirement savings decimated their pensions shortchanged and their wages stagnant or falling even in the face of a rising tide of poverty and an economy with high unemployment the tea partyled republicans continue their efforts to slash programs which protect the health and wellbeing of millions of lowincome and working poor families in the coming weeks and months we will begin to see the impact of the quite frankly immoral cuts to vital unemployment benefit extensions as thousands of people thousands of people across our country who are struggling to find a job will be thrown off of unemployment benefits thrown off kicked off the rolls some of them may be lucky enough to find work but far too many will be suddenly cut off with nearly nothing nothing to keep them from falling behind into poverty they will have been left out and left behind we may disagree on how to help families in need and workers who are struggling find work access needed health services or feed their children but we can all agree that leaving struggling families completely cut off of unemployment insurance with nowhere to turn for help is not the american way when republican politicians protect tax cuts for millionaires we must be very adamant about protecting the working poor when tea party republicans fight to protect tax writeoffs for corporations and big oil we must fight to protect hardworking americans when republican tea party members continued to expend their energy protecting the dividend gains on investments we must fight to protect linda lee and geraldine matthew women who have worked their entire lives and are left with nothing to show for it unfortunately there are some who continue to support policies for the 1 percent where profits rather than people matter we need a jobs bill for those who are desperately in need of a job and we need to help with their support for

great depression today we understand a series of mistakes were made in the past decade which led to our current financial crisis now the financial crisis inquiry commission fcic was given the task to investigate the causes of the meltdown of our financial institutions though the commission was unsuccessful in reaching a certain consensus of the exact cause they did however conclude that the financial crisis was avoidable and was the result of the following factors an explosion in risky subprime lending an unsustainable rise in housing prices widespread reports of egregious and predatory lending practices dramatic increases in household mortgage debt and exponential growth in financial firms trading activities unregulated derivatives and shortterm repo lending markets just among a few of the red flags surely with all those factors chairman bernanke should have been more concerned in fact the title of my speech this morning is even with warning signs bernanke failed to sound the alarm in fact he was warned by members of the federal reserve board often the release of transcripts from the federal open market committee fomc meetings in 2006 shed light on the critical failures of the federal reserve and mr bernanke to act when the warning signs were clear and present the first meeting however was spent praising bernankes predecessor outgoing federal chairman alan greenspan but the fcic later concluded that 30 years of deregulation and reliance on selfregulation by financial institutions that was championed by mr greenspan were the factors in devastating the stability of our nations market stripping away safeguards that simply could have avoided this catastrophe now in a later meeting on may 10 2006 of the fomc then fed governor susan bies was one of the earliest to raise concern over the nations mortgage sector which offered exotic loans that increased household debt over time instead of decreasing it now specifically her concerns stem from the absence of home equity growth and the consumers ability to absorb the uncertainties of the housing market listen to mr bernankes response when she made her declaration so far we are seeing at worst an orderly decline in the housing market but there is still i think a lot to be seen as to whether the housing market will decline slowly or more quickly yet again another colleague then fed vice chairwoman janet yellen warns of the possibility of an unwelcome housing slump but in the meeting of august 8 2006 chairman bernanke remains hopeful in his prediction for a soft landing for our economy need i say the 2008 great recession was not a soft landing in the september meeting the feds still remained oblivious to the detrimental effects in the housing market that will affect the rest of the economy in the last meeting of the fomc fed governor bies again in december 2006 stated once again her concern of the housing market stating that mortgages securitized in the past few years warrants additional risk than the investors have been focusing on despite the concerns that reported increased difficulty getting mortgages in their region as well as a noticeable cool down in housing activity mr bernanke fails to see the warning signs and again predicts a soft landing on december 12 2006 once again this was his second statement of a soft landing in the same year it was the failure of mr bernanke to not pursue possible vulnerabilities and assuring us to the contrary that attributed to the economic crisis that we faced on february 15 2007 he stated overall economic prospects for households remains good the labor market is expected to stay healthy and real incomes should continue to rise the business sector remains in excellent financial condition again on march 28 2007 he stated the impact on the broader economy and financial markets of the problems in the subprime markets seems likely to be contained even on may 17 2007 despite concerns raised by fed governor bies again he said we do not expect significant spillovers from the subprime market to the rest of the economy or to the financial system how wrong he was but all of the dire warning signs were there at bernankes confirmation hearing in the senate banking committee he conceded to the notion that the central bank should have done more thats an understatement the fed had the authority and necessary power to prevent further abuses happening in the financial industry but simply chose to ignore critical warning signs bernanke agrees he missed the warning signs but thinks he can prevent a further crisis im not sure that he

was sworn into office this january about 6 months ago the house and the senate have both been understandably and properly concerned with one issue that has perhaps eclipsed every other issue that has come before us in this halfyear period of time that related to our national debt and the anticipated expiration of our debt limit which will hit in just a couple weeks many americans are understandably concerned and have articulated the concern that if we pass the debt limit deadline of august 2 without raising the debt limit there could be catastrophic financial consequences in light of that i along with a number of my republican colleagues both in the senate and in the house have introduced legislation called the cut cap and balance act to address the debt limit to address it head on it says we will raise the debt limit if three conditions are met first that we make significant cuts to domestic discretionary spending for the fiscal year 2012 budget second we need statutory spending caps to put us on a smooth but steady glidepath toward balancing our budget sometime within the next decade third we need a balanced budget amendment passed out of congress and submitted to the states for ratification we think all three of these steps are necessarily required before we take the significant additional step of raising the debt limit because of the fact that it took us a long time to get to this point the point where by the end of the year we will have accumulated 15 trillion in debtabout 50 000 for every man woman and child in america between 120 000 and 150 000 for every wage earner in america this is a lot of moneybefore we extend that debt limit again by an additional 2 4 trillion we have to solve the problem we have to address the problem that led to its creation in a real lasting binding fundamental way that is why the most critical part of this legislation while each part is important happens to be found in that which rests upon the idea of a balanced budget amendment to the constitution we as members of congress could decide right now that over the next 10 years or 15 years it might be a good idea to cut spending by 2 trillion 3 trillion 4 trillion 5 trillion 6 trillion perhaps morebut if we made that promise today as a downpayment to the american people in exchange for the permission of the people to raise the debt limit it is a promise we cannot make good on because we cannot bind a future congress this congress was sworn in in january of 2011 elections will be held in november of 2012 and a new congress will be sworn in based on those elections in january 2013 the same thing will happen again in january 2015 and every 2 years after that for the duration of our republic the decisions we make right here right now can affect the here and now and can be binding for the here and now but we cannot reasonably expect and we cannot ask the american people when making a decision so longlasting and precedentsetting as this one to simply trust us that future congresses will see things the same way we do the only way we can bind a future congress is by amending our law of laws that 224yearold document painstakingly ironed out by some of the brightest men of the last several centuries in philadelphia 224 years ago when we amend the constitution we make it possible to bind a future congress that is what we need to do we have had some interesting debate and discussion surrounding this proposal last friday i listened with surprise and dismay as our president said we dont need to amend the constitution to require a balanced budget but we do need to balance our budget in the opinion of the president congress just needs to do its job not amend the constitution i think i understand his point i think he is suggesting that for congress to do its job it needs to balance its budget but i have to ask the question how has that worked out for us have past congresses balanced their budgets has the current congress balanced its budget overwhelmingly the answer is no it happens every now and then some would describe those instances where it has balanced in the last two or three decades as an accident others a momentary blip still others would suggest it was the product of accounting gimmickry rather than an actual act of budget balancing when that occurred regardless we know that balanced federal budgets are newsworthy indeed because they are very rare i look forward to the day when they are no longer newsworthy when they are customary and the only way to make them customary based on our experience as americans throughout most of our nations history is by amending the constitution to require it to make this a binding and permanent law i was shocked and dismayed again to learn that our senate majority leader senator reid from nevada stated just a few hours ago that he does not like this legislation he made some very disparaging comments about it notwithstanding the fact and completely ignoring the fact that this is not just the best legislation to address the debt limit issue right now it is the only legislation it is the only legislation that addresses this issue that is moving through congress and that has been reduced to legislative language it is certainly the only one that has been passed by one body of congress and is now moving over to the senate he is criticizing something when he himself has not offered anything this is the only show in town given how close we now are to the august 2 deadline and in part because we punted this so long and in part because we have not been having the debate and discussion in congress we should have been having for months this is it this is the only proposal if senator reid has suggestions on how we might change this proposal i am all ears i would love to hear what they are if he has his own proposal i would love to see what that is but simply to stand from that desk over there and disparage this legislation is inexcusable absolutely inexcusable given the fact that he has offered nothing let me read some of his words he said the american people should understand that this this meaning the cut cap and balance act is a bad piece of legislation perhaps some of the worst legislation in the history of this country i dont know what he is referring to he didnt give specifics nor has he given any specifics on what he would like to see in its place or how it could be improved my suggestion to our senate majority leader is if he has ideas please put them on the table because as we approach this debt limit deadline we are running out of time the clock has been ticking for 6 months we have known this was going to happen this is not news to us why then has there been so little debate and discussion in this body why is it that we spent weeks and weeks and weeks often dealing with legislation that paled in comparison to the importance of this issue the clock kept ticking and we kept debating and discussing other legislation far less important this in my opinion was a gross dereliction of duty but we still have a few weeks we can still deal with it we can still address it i suggest strongly that we address it by starting with that legislation that has actually been proposed and that we have full debate and discussion but no we are told even after the house of representatives earlier this week passed the cut cap and balance act passed it with bipartisan support by the wayno fewer than five members of the democratic caucus in the house of representatives voted to support this that was passed tuesday night we were told later we would be having a vote on saturday or perhaps monday then just a little while ago we were informed by the senate majority leader that the vote would be tomorrow giving us little or no time for actual debate and discussion on the floor of what is still to this moment the only legislation moving through to address this issue this is not an appropriate moment for demagoguery demagoguery on an issue this important can result in a lot of unnecessary pain no one disputes that there could be significant negative economic consequences associated with not raising the debt limit i do not dispute that not for a moment that is exactly why i put my neck on the line in order to file this legislation because nothing else was moving forward i didnt want to do it but when i was sworn in as a senator just a few months ago i understood it was my obligation to do what i could to make things better to make our constitutional system work so i filed it it is an insult not only to me and to my colleagues but to all americans when addressing an issue this important to have so little debate and discussion over this issue i find it appalling i find it reprehensible i demand an explanation and i demand an alternative solution if the senate majority leader is going to pick this apart and say he will not do it moreover i will remind the senate majority leader that just a few short years ago in 2006 when we had a different president belonging to a different party and this body was in control of another party if my memory serves me correctly not only did thensenator barack obama vote against raising the debt limit calling the need to do so the product of a failure of leadership that he was not willing to condone and perpetuate but every single one of his democratic colleagues joined him in that vote not one of them voted to raise the debt limit here we are again approaching the debt limit here we are again with only republicans stepping to the plate and offering a solution only this time the solution is a permanent one unfortunately in 2006 and prior and in subsequent debt limit extension votes there was no serious debate attached to it as to a permanent solution we have to amend the governing document the law of laws the only kind of law that can bind future congresses in order to solve this problem we have to do it now this is part of what it means to be an american we as americans crave liberty and we eschew tyranny to any degree every single time we authorize deficit spending we fuel the unfettered expansion of the federal government and all its power we commit ourselves and our posterity to a future that will include working more and more hours and days and weeks and even months just to pay their federal tax bills every single year that is time they will not get back that is time we will not get back that erodes our individual liberty it also erodes our liberty when the same regulatory structure that exists today grows bigger and bigger every year because we are borrowing now more than 1 5 trillion every single yearnot because of some aberrational condition some unusual development that requires an unusual expenditure of borrowed money but just to cover our basic daytoday operations this is what fuels the perpetual expansion of government and when government expands perpetually our individual liberty is diminished unfortunately and to a corresponding degree this is unacceptable but there is a way home the way home is found in limiting the role of government we can limit the role of government most effectively at this point in time i believe by limiting the pool of money to which congress has access the only way to do that is through a constitutional amendment i wish to close by addressing one final argument that sometimes has been used in response to and against the cut cap and balance act many of its detractors are making the claim that i find extraordinary a claim that says why are you even supporting this because it cant pass it is a little bit akin to saying why do we even play the super bowl when it is expected that one team is going to beat the other team we have to play but this one is not a game this one is for real when we vote after debating and discussing members of this body can and will be held accountable to our constituents so it will be up to me and each of my colleagues in this body to decide how to vote on this issue for those who make the unfortunate decision to vote against this notwithstanding the fact that 75 percent of the american people strongly support the idea of a balanced budget amendment notwithstanding the fact that 66 percent of americansboth of these figures according to a cnn poll todaysupport the principles underlying cut cap and balance notwithstanding the fact that this is the only permanent way of solving our debt problem if members of congress and members of this body choose to vote against this legislation they will do so i believe at their own peril they will have to face their constituents and explain why a handful of them were unwilling to raise the debt limit unwilling to address this problem unwilling to fix the perpetual deficit spending habit of congress simply because they did not want a balanced budget amendment to the constitution i think that is a tall order i think that is difficult to explain i think those who try to make that explanation to their constituents will do so at their own political peril but more importantly the vote they cast will be at the peril of the people of the united states of america of their liberty of their economic stability and of their ability to prosper now and in the future we can turn this ship around but in order do it

myself seeks to authorize the striking and awarding of a congressional gold medal honoring raoul wallenberg in recognition of his heroism in saving tens of thousands of lives in nazioccupied budapest during world war ii mr wallenberg truly personified the definition of a humanitarian a hero and a defender of individuals facing persecution and nearcertain death at the hands of a truly inhumane nazi regime born into an affluent swedish family of diplomats and bankers raoul wallenberg developed a keen interest in foreign cultures and languages at an early age he became fluent in english french german and russian and after graduating from high school attended the university of michigan to study architecture in 1936 a year after graduation he accepted a job at the central european trading company an exportimport company with operations in stockholm and eastern europe he quickly became joint owner and international director of the firm and traveled throughout europe to assist his boss a hungarian jew during this period mr wallenberg immersed himself in the hungarian language and culture and witnessed the nazis increasing stranglehold on europe while hungary was nominally an axis power it sought a secret peace pact with the allies when that was discovered adolf hitler invaded hungary in march of 1944 under the nazi occupation hungarian jews faced immediate deportation to the auschwitzbirkenau concentration camp in southern poland jews living in budapest desperately sought help from the embassies of neutral countries which could provide shortterm identity passes to escape the nazis the swedish delegation was successful in ensuring that the provisional passes would allow the bearers to be treated as swedish citizens providing a great deal of protection in 1944 the united states created the war refugee board for the purposes of rescuing european jews from nazi persecution the board worked closely with the swedish delegation to locate a swedish national to spearhead a rescue operation for jews facing deportation raoul wallenberg then a 32yearold prominent businessman who had a keen familiarity with hungary was given the daunting task in july 1944 when he arrived in budapest as the first secretary of the swedish delegation more than 400 000 jewish citizens already had been deported by ss officer adolf eichmann only 230 000 jews were left wallenberg succeeded in designing a facsimile swedish passport to be issued to jews trapped in budapest they were authentic enough to pass the inspection of local officials and wallenberg employed several hundred workers all of jewish descent to produce and issue more than 10 000 he also constructed more than 30 buildings that allowed more than 15 000 jews to find shelter under the banner of the swedish delegation a swedish flag hung in front of every door and residents in every building were granted diplomatic immunity in november 1944 eichmann began a campaign of death marches forcing large numbers of the remaining hungarian jews to march out of germany on foot wallenberg marched along with them he handed out provisional passes provided food water and medicine and bribed nazi guards to free those with passes wielding the full authority of the swedish government for the persecuted who were deported by train wallenberg issued provisional passes on the train tracks on the roofs and even inside the train cars themselves in one of his most important accomplishments he prevented eichmanns attempted massacre in budapests largest ghetto in january 1945 at the risk of his own life wallenberg used his diplomatic influence to secure a note from a prominent official calling off the massacre then at the end of the war he was taken by the soviet army allegedly for spying and was never heard from again he is said to have died in the kgbs lubyanka prison in 1947 we remember raoul wallenberg for his unwavering courage in saving the lives of as many as 100 000 innocent men women and children awarding the congressional gold medal to mr wallenberg is the very least that we can do to honor a man who imperiled himself for a cause so worthy we can now examine with gratitude a uniquely bright flame of valor in a terribly dark period of world history individuals such as raoul wallenberg were willing to make the ultimate sacrifice of life and livelihood to serve the greater

impending collision of two closely related crises the expiration of the payroll tax and the acceleration of social securitys bankruptcy last year congress voted for a payroll tax cut that averages roughly 1 000 for every working family in america as warned it failed to stimulate economic growth and it accelerated the collapse of the social security system but as promised it threw every working family a vital lifeline in very tough economic times we need to meet three conflicting objectives we need to continue the payroll tax cut we need to stimulate real economic growth and we need to avoid doing further damage to the social security system first we need to understand that not all tax cuts stimulate lasting economic growth cutting marginal tax rates does so because it changes the incentives that individuals respond to cutting inframarginal tax rates such as the payroll tax does not but that payroll tax cut did make a huge difference in the ability of working families to make ends meet in a time of declining family incomes and steadily rising prices to restore that payroll tax rate today given the economic pressures on working families is simply unthinkable yet at the same time the payroll tax is what supports the social security system last year that system entered a state of permanent deficit and this condition will worsen until the social security system bankrupts in 2036 at that moment every retiree will suffer a sudden and permanent drop in benefits of roughly 25 percent further reducing the revenues into that system will hasten this day of reckoning just as bad in the intervening time the expanding social security deficit will heap growing burdens on the nations already staggering public debt now some have proposed paying for the inframarginal payroll tax cut that doesnt help the economy with a marginal tax hike that actually harms the economy surely we can do better than that actually congressman landry of louisiana has done better and i commend his proposal to the attention of the house it avoids damaging the social security fund while at the same time offering families continued relief from crushing payroll taxes his measure h r 3551 the social security preservation through individual choice enhancement or sspice act constitutes the most realistic and innovative approach to these twin and related crises that has yet been placed before congress by linking the cost of social security to the benefits that it provides h r 3551 would give every american the choice of paying a lower payroll tax each year in exchange for working a month longer thats all it would take to pay for itselfa months delay in retirement for a years worth of tax relief for the first time individuals can make this choice to pay a lower payroll tax based on their own circumstances without further undermining the fiscal integrity of the social security system or the financial security of those relying on that system for the first time costs and benefits would be linked in a manner that all consumers can understand and judge for themselves based on their own circumstances in a difficult year like this i think most families would rather save the extra tax and work the extra month in better times ahead they may choose to pay the extra tax to maintain their retirement schedule but it will be their choice based on their needs their plans and their best judgment and not the governments and by linking costs with benefits it will protect the longterm actuarial soundness of the social security system a fact that the social security systems chief actuary has confirmed im excited to cosponsor mr landrys bill and strongly and enthusiastically recommend it to the membership of the house and to the leadership mr landry has done an enormous service to every retiree who depends upon the social security system as well as to every working family struggling in america by preserving the fiscal integrity of the system while at the same time giving every american a choice that links the tax they pay to the benefits they receive and its an option they can exercise every year without fear that a future congressional act or failure to act might

characterizes his leadership of the subcommittee i wish we had been able to reach an agreement on the issue at hand but as that has not been possible im offering this amendment to strike section 301 a of the bill section 301 a would eliminate provisions included in the coast guard authorization of 2010 that i authored to establish an ombudsman in each coast guard district the district ombudsmen are intended to serve as liaisons between the coast guard and ports terminal operators ship owners and labor representatives the ombudsmen will enable these stakeholders to seek further review of disputes regarding the application of the coast guard regulations let me be clear that the provisions creating the ombudsman specifically provide that the district ombudsman shall not provide assistance with respect to a dispute unless it involves the impact of coast guard requirements on port business and the flow of commerce the provisions further clarify that in providing such assistance the district ombudsman shall give priority to complaints brought by petitioners who believe they will suffer a significant hardship as a result of implementing the coast guard requirement i authored the provisions creating the ombudsman at the request of the port community which approached me seeking another mechanism to engage with the coast guard to ensure that the application of regulations achieves critical safety and security objectives while having the least possible impact on commerce many members of congress and particularly those on the other side of the aisle profess that limiting the power of government and ensuring that businesses are not burdened by inappropriate regulations are among their top priorities given these priorities and given the need to ensure that regulations do not threaten commerce or jobs i am frankly quite deeply surprised that the majority would seek to eliminate a provision that specifically provides businesses with an avenue through which they can seek changes in regulatory decisions in an effort to improve their businesses let me also be clear that i understand that the coast guard has not yet appointed any ombudsmanand i know that the service would probably prefer never to appoint an ombudsman because they would prefer that their regulatory decisions not be challenged that said rather than eliminating the requirement that the coast guard appoint an ombudsman i believe that this authority should be implemented quickly to give businesses the opportunity to improve the application of coast guard regulations finally let me also explain that this provision does not require any new personnel to be hired the statutory language is clear and staff have reconfirmed with the coast guard that the position of ombudsman could be a collateral duty that a qualified staff member performs in addition to their other duties this is not my ideal arrangement but i raise this point so that it is clear that the implementation of this provision does not require the coast guard to hire new staff members i urge all members who are concerned about the impact that undue regulatory burdens may have on commerce to join me in supporting this amendment i

predicted that the cost of this continuous and expanding war will reach 6 trillion the hostilities and our overt involvement in iraq can be dated back to january 16 1991 when the defensive operation desert shield became the offensive operation desert storm though the end of the persian gulf war was declared on april 6 1991 with a unitedstates military victory the 20year war was just beginning the unitedstates and britain have had an intense interest in controlling the oil of the middle east dating back to the overthrow of the ottoman empire during world war i this interest expanded during world war ii with fdrs promise to protect the puppet governments in the persian gulf region especially saudi arabia though this arrangement never sat well with the citizens in the region a fairly decent relationship remained between the arab people and the american public but animosity continued to build with our everpresent military involvement in iraq our military assistance to the mujahedeen in the 1980s now the taliban helped the muslim defenders one of whom was osama bin laden oust the soviets from afghanistan at that time we were still not seen as occupiers and the radical muslims encouraged by the unitedstates were expected to direct all their efforts toward the communist threat that all changed with the breakup of the soviet system and the end of the cold war when as the lone superpower left standing we named ourselves the worlds policeman it was then that the resentment by arabs and muslims became directed toward the united states now seen as an invader and occupier continuous bombing and crippling sanctions against iraq during the 1990s the appearance that the unitedstates did not care about the plight of the palestinians and our military bases in saudi arabia led to attentiongetting attacks against the united states the 1998 embassy attacks in kenya and tanzania and the attack on the uss cole in the year 2000 were warnings that the war was far from over the horrible tragedy of 9 11 shouldnt have been a surprise and many believe it was preventable currently the war has morphed into a huge battle for control of the persian gulf region and central

though that id said so great to meet arnold schwarzeneggers fatherinlaw he really didnt want to be known as arnold schwarzeneggers fatherinlaw he wanted to be known and is known as the most dynamic director of the peace corps and for many others of his workswith mrs shriver on the special olympics and for a variety of other good works that he did with his life we all have our peace corps experiences i had the opportunity to serve in the neighboring country to ethiopia which was somaliaa troubled place now it was a great experience though people ask about the peace corps and i always say that one of the things you have to remember about the peace corps is that you get a lot more out of it than you really give youre serving other people but youre learning youre learning about another culture and at the same time youre learning about your own country and your own experiences because of the points of contrast what a wonderful thing it is that america has now tens of thousands of people who have served in the peace corps who have returned and who now are working in every walk of lifeworking in international organizations working in business organizations knowing different cultures knowing different languagesthereby providing a dimension to our own national life that we would otherwise not have if we did not have people who had had the experience of serving in the peace corps there is one other thing i still can remember the quizzical but interested reaction that so many people in somalia or im sure anywhere in the world had who are you why are you doing it explain that to me again the spirit was kind of catching and they would participate in all kinds of little volunteer activities and things that they hadnt necessarily thought of doing themselves of course the peace corps volunteers are not representatives of the american government they are representatives of the american people that was always emphasized very very strongly to all of us as part of our peace corps training the way we were living was among the people not behind these diplomatic bunkers that we sometimes see in the world today youre experiencing life in the country in which youre serving one thing just as an example is that peace corps volunteers of course do their assignments but theyre also people who do volunteer work of one kind or another one of the big hits was when i was in mogadishu in the peace corps i was with two other people who were peace corps lawyers at that time and there were about 50 60 people who were teachers some were community health workers and some were community school construction workers they would come to mogadishu for a couple days off for vacation time when school was down that kind of thing and five or six of them got together and started playing some american young peoples music and the next thing you know they were invited to a restaurant in mogadishu crowds of hundreds of people gathered and it was the sensation of the town for a couple weeks of course they couldnt be paid for doing this sort of thing but they might have gotten a couple of free meals from the restaurant and that kind of thing what a wonderful sort of natural way of building bridges the people in this country had never really seen something like this they werent on a tour for any of these international shows and they just thought it was the most wonderful thing to see live music played by american peace corps volunteers and that was the face of america that they were presenting in this country and it was one that i think has served our nation
