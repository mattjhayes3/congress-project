district showed a definitive difference in the amount of monies paid by senior citizens for prescription drugs it was higher in the 18th congressional district in houston than in canada and in mexico we find that those who are 85 years old 40 percent of them do not even have the ability to pay for any drugs they have no benefit whatsoever and we must realize that seniors are living longer we also find that seniors are paying twice as much for their prescription drugs if they are medicare beneficiaries and they do not have that provision and so they are buying onethird less drugs what does that mean it means sicker seniors that is what it means these are individuals who have worked hard in our communities then we find the cost of our prescription drugs the amount of money our seniors pay is far more than any other health need that they have and this i would say to my colleagues begs for us to have a prescription drug benefit under the medicare provisions i do not know why it is so difficult this is something we should support i cannot go home and tell my seniors in the 18th congressional district that in the united states of america they cannot have a drug benefit but yet in mexico and canada prescription drugs are cheaper i would say it is time now to support this motion to instruct today i rise in support of the spratt motion to instruct the conferees on the budget resolution the spraft motion sets the stage for enacting a medicare prescription drug benefit or other legislation to improve medicare before the reporting date for a tax cut reconciliation bill by setting september 22 as the date for reporting a tax cut bill protected by reconciliation furthermore the spratt motion recedes to the senates slightly smaller tax cut and also recede to the senate by dropping the reserve fund language in the housepassed resolution that provides for an additional 50 billion in tax cuts while the republicans propose large tax cuts over the next 5 years and reconcile the finance and ways and means committees to report legislation republicans do not show the 10year cost of this tax cut which could be as large as the 792 billion that the republicans proposed and the american people rejected in 1999 moreover the republicans do not intend to strengthen or support medicare due to the fact that there are no reconciliation instructions to require legislation that would actually use the 40 billion reserve earmarked in the budget resolution in addition the republicans have cut nondefense appropriations while defense significantly increased for the third consecutive year republicans have chosen to provide large tax breaks for the wealthy this budget resolution provides at least 200 billion in tax breaks over the next 5 years for the financial elite of america furthermore this resolution is a major down payment for george w bushs proposed trilliondollar tax scheme i will not stand by while our childrens future is bankrupted to fund this irresponsible budget resolution this budget contains deep cuts in domestic spending by 114 billion over the next 5 years fails to provide anything to strengthen social security or medicare cuts nondefense discretionary spending by 19 7 billion in 2001 and 138 billion over the next 5 years below the level needed to maintain purchasing power after adjusting for inflation and pretends to reserve 40 billion for a medicare prescription drug benefit contingent upon essentially turning medicare into a voucher program republicans have used slight of hand to hide the facts of their irresponsible budget by showing the effects of proposed tax cuts for only the first 5 years and not the full 10year projections commonly used during the last 4 years i am disappointed in the budget resolution because i do not believe that it provides adequate investment in our nations future americas future depends on that of her young people in providing them adequate resources and opportunities to become our future leaders including providing them education and ac cess to adequate health care the budget resolution provides inadequate resources for the education of our young people i firmly believe that we must focus our attention and our energy on one of the most important challenges facing our country todayrevitalizing our education system strengthening education must be a top priority to raise the standard of living among american families and to prolong this era of american economic expansion education will prepare our nation for the challenges of the 21st century and i will fight to ensure that the necessary programs are adequately funded to ensure our childrens success we must provide our children access to superior education at all ages from kindergarten to graduate school recent studies emphasize the importance of quality education early in a childs future development and yet despite these studies the budget resolution still inadequately funds programs that would provide for programs targeting children in their younger years in addition we need to open the door of educational opportunity to all american children it is well known that increases in income are related to educational attainment the democratic budget alternative rejects the republican freeze on education funding and allocates 4 8 billion more for education for fiscal year 2001 than the republican budget over 5 years the democratic party demonstrates its commitment to education by proposing 21 billion more than the republican budget resolution the congressional black caucus offered an amendnient in the nature of a substitute that promised to invest for the future of our nation the cbc substitute is a budget that maximizes investment and opportunity for the poor africanamericans and other minorities this budget for maximum investment and opportunity supports a moderate plan to pay down the national debt protects social security and makes significant investments in education and training the cbc budget requests 88 8 billion in fiscal year 2001 for education training and development this is 32 billion more than the republican budget provides the cbc substitute proposed a 10 billion increase over the presidents budget for school construction other projected increases include additional funding for head start summer youth employment trio programs historically black colleges and universities and community technology centers in an age of unprecedented wealth the cbc has the vision to invest in the american family and not squander opportunities afforded by a budget surplus i will not support the failed policies of the past senator mccain has best characterized this budget resolution as one that is fiscally irresponsible i support a budget that invest strengthening social security provides an affordable prescription drug benefit for all seniors helps communities improve public education with quality teachers smaller

facts and figures but truly what we are trying to emphasize that these are just not facts and figures but real people the 2000 census is just around the corner and if we do not stop the partisan rhetoric which has clouded this issue for far too long we will once again keep millions of americans from having a voice as chair of the census and civil rights task force for the hispanic caucus and cochair of the census task force for the democratic caucus i am committed to achieving a fair and accurate census the impact of a fair and accurate census will be felt across the nation in every community and in the lives of every american the information gathered in the census is utilized in many ways it is used by states and local governments to plan schools and highways by the federal government to distribute funds for health care and countless other programs it is used by businesses in creating their own economic plans our last census in 1990 was the first time in history that the count was less accurate than the one before in 1990 more than 8 million americans were not counted and more than 4 million were counted twice in texas as already indicated over 500 000 were not counted in my own home city of san antonio as referredto earlier 40 000 were not counted in a report released by the general accounting office this past week it is reported that 22 of the 25 large formula grant programs use census data as part of their allocation formula those 25 formula grant programs distribute approximately 166 billion in federal funds to the states the 22 formula grant programs that utilize census data account for 97 percent of the total that is 161 billion these are federal tax dollars that citizens across the nation have paid federal dollars that should come back to the community in the form of improved infrastructure better neighborhood schools health care for the poor and the elderly local economic development and much more in my state of texas where over 500 000 were not counted it is estimated that we lost close to 1 billion in federal funding over the past 10 years we were second only to california in the harm caused by an inaccurate count this astronomical loss of funding breaks down to 1 992 per missed person it is estimated that if we utilize the same inaccurate enumeration methods for the 2000 census texas will stand to lose 2 18 billion in federal funds we must realize that this is not a political issue this is an economic issue it is an education issue it is an infrastructure issue and most importantly it is about fairness it is about time that we stop the partisan rhetoric and choose people over party politics every person in this nation counts and every american deserves to be counted it is important to point out exactly who was missed in the 1990 census it is really no surprise because the very people who were not counted in the last census are those communities who are typically overlooked of the 8 million americans not counted minorities children and the poor were disproportionately represented nationally 5 percent of hispanics 4 4 percent of african americans 2 3 percent of asian and pacific islanders and over 12 percent of native americans living on reservations were undercounted in texas the net undercount from the 1990 census was 2 8 percent almost twice as high than the national average of 1 6 percent the percentage of hispanics and children missed in texas were all greater than the national average of the 500 000 texans missed over half were of hispanic origin statewide 3 9 percent of african americans 2 6 percent of asian and pacific islanders and 2 8 percent of native americans were undercounted while missing or miscounting people is a problem for the census the fact that particular groups children the poor people of color city dwellers and renters were missed more often than others produced census data that underrepresented these particular groups each of us should be outraged by these types of inaccuracies the census bureau and other experts have told us that the most accurate census can be obtained by utilizing modern and proven scientific statistical methods these are proven methods proven to be the most accurate system to obtain the census now we know that the constitution calls for an enumeration i agree we should try to count as many people as we possibly can i also realize the obstacles that face us if we rely on this head count alone today society is highly mobile most households are twoincome families there are language barriers and there are people who have a distrust of government these are just some of the obstacles facing us if we choose to continue to employ a head count system alone proven scientific statistical methods can overcome these obstacles and will give us the more accurate count over and above the accuracy we know that this system is cheaper than the actual head count the supreme court recently ruled that these scientific methods can only be used for redistricting and distribution of federal funds and that a head count must be done for the purpose of apportionment if we know we can get the most accurate census through these methods and that they will save us money we must utilize them the gentlewoman from new york who just preceded me has introduced legislation that will amend the census act so that scientifically proven statistical methods can be used for every purpose of the census apportionment redistricting and distribution of federal dollars i believe in this bill and urge all of my colleagues to support it so that every american will be counted and have a voice we must stop the partisan bickering over the census we must put people first we must put people over party politics we must and should be

legislation without delay before our adjournment for the year we have missed opportunities after opportunities to stop our partisan wrangling and pass a meaningful bill and reach the priorities that we need to reach with this legislation as a congressman from north carolinas second congressional district i represent an area of the country that has undergone some tremendous growth over the last several years in communities throughout my district and across this country our schools are bursting at the seams our local communities are struggling to provide resources to build new schools and to repair old ones and get children out of trailers and just fix up old rundown buildings for nearly 4 years now i have worked with my colleagues in the house on both sides of the political aisle to provide leadership on this important issue and pass a common sense bill that will help our local schools deal with this critical problem we have come together to support h r 4094 the rangeljohnsonetheridge bill that is sponsored by the republican congresswoman from connecticut and my friend from new york this important bill will provide 25 billion in school construction bonds for our local communities to build schools for our children it really provides national leadership on this issue that is critical to the american people a clear majority of the members of this house have supported h r 4094 228 members democrats and republicans alike have signed on as cosponsors the house will pass this bill if we can only get a chance to vote on it the president has stated that he will sign this important legislation the minute it reaches his desk we have an opportunity to provide real leadership and pass this measure to help provide educational opportunities for our children but unfortunately the republican leadership of this house has chosen the path of confrontation and gridlock over the opportunity for consensus and progress rather than working together to produce a common sense solution to the need for school construction the republican leadership brought to the floor today a bill that was a sham of a school construction measure instead of fully funding the costeffective rangeljohnson bill the republican leaderships bill would shift funds to much less effective arbitrage relief and private activity bonds the arbitrage proposal would provide schools with only 24 per 1 000 in bonds compared with 624 per 1 000 in bonds in the rangeljohnson bill in addition because schools would have to delay construction for at least 2 years to receive any benefits areas with the most urgent need would not be able to build the buildings that they need the private activity bonds benefit only those schools available to find a forprofit company willing to pay upfront construction costs neither arbitrage nor private activity bonds target assistance to the schools that so badly need it today the members of this house have an obligation a solemn responsibility in my opinion to work together to craft common sense solutions to the problems facing americas schools but rather we do not work hard to meet the responsibility that is before us the republican leadership has chosen to pass a sham proposal a bill that is truly going to be vetoed they knew it was going to be vetoed when it passed today the republican tax bill contains many provisions that i supported but the sad fact is the republican leadership chose to include many good provisions in a fundamentally flawed bill in addition the leadership today pushed through an appropriations bill that provides 687 million in grants to states to build prisons i supported that provision because we probably need to build some but to me it is the wrong priority to pass prisons before we build schools in conclusion i remain an optimist we still have time to pass a real school construction bill before this congress adjourns and i urge the republican leadership to do so"],

substitute being offered on our side here we are in washington in the middle of july but one would think with the legislation before us that it is the middle of the winter because we have been hit with a veritable blizzard of large taxcutting measures the closer we get to election day my constituents in western wisconsin honestly know a snowjob when they see it unfortunately i think this is just another of a series of electionyear politics playing politics with future budget surpluses because that is what this debate is really about what is the best priority use of future budget surpluses if in fact they do materialize there is a clear difference between the two parties on this i came to washington with a lot of concern in regards to the 5 7 trillion national debt i am the father of two little boys who are just 4 and 2 and i refuse to support policies that are going to make it more difficult for us to eliminate this legacy of debt that we are due to pass on to future generations unless we have the courage to resist large tax cuts now and use the money for debt reduction and shoring up social security and medicare the series of tax cuts when you put them all together would virtually consume every last cent of projected budget surpluses if in fact they materialize at all there is no guarantee that they will but let us talk for a minute about the policy implications of these series of tax cuts and who better to listen from than the chairman of the federal reserve board chairman greenspan this is basic macroeconomics 101 he has been telling us consistently in his testimony large tax cuts now are bad economic policy because it will overstimulate the economy and force the federal reserve to increase interest rates to slow the economy down that would be detrimental to all citizens who need to make home car credit card student loan or other payments it will also make it more worthy to invest in new capital and create more jobs here are just a couple of statements that chairman greenspan said saving the surpluses if politically feasible is in my judgment the most important fiscal measure we can take at this time to foster continued improvements in productivity another one we probably would be better off holding off on a tax cut immediately largely because it is apparent that the surpluses are doing a great deal of good to the economy perhaps most importantly chairman greenspan said this lawmakers are counting on unpredictable economic trends to continue producing the budget surpluses they need to pay for their tax cuts the longterm forecasts are often inaccurate and lead to vast errors in predicting budget deficits and surpluses you should not commit contingent potential resources to irreversible uses that is exactly what we are doing in these series of tax cuts when you look at them all together go slow we can provide modest tax relief for families who need it but we need to do it in a fiscally responsible way let us not bank our future on projected surpluses that may never materialize let me be clear the house leadership has embarked on a series of tax cuts that will obliterate a surplus that is the hardwon product of nearly 8 years of fiscal discipline taken all the tax cuts offered in this session over two trillion dollars they will consume virtually the entire projected budget surplus in the next 10 years and then explode in the second 10 years now is not the time to abandon responsible budgeting by spending money before it even comes in the door further this bill will leave fewer resources for other priorities within the medicare program including extending the solvency of the medicare trust fund creating a medicare prescription drug coverage benefit investing in education and providing relief to rural hospitals and other health care providers i support the substitute to h r 4865 this substitute is fiscally responsible and will provide tax relief for middle income seniors who need the most assistance rather than eliminating the tax for all seniors this proposal sustains the tax on social security benefits for individuals who earn more than 80 000 and for couples eaming more than 100 000 roughly 95 percent of all seniors are covered under the altemative furthermore this substitute will only go into effect those years in which there is enough of an onbudget surplus to replace lost revenues i have always felt that if projected budget surpluses do in fact materialize we have a number of existing obligations that we must meet such as paying off our 5 7 trillion national debt shoring up social security and modernizing medicare with a prescription drug benefit and investing in education these should be our top national priorities before we pass large tax cuts that will benefit the most wealthy and consume the entire projected budget surplus that may or may not materialize if those commitments are given their due priority then fiscally responsible tax relief can be provided to those struggling families trying to make ends meet we must not enact risky tax cuts today that will result in harming our seniors and our children tomorrow i urge my colleagues to vote against this final bill americas seniors are depending on us to balance the needs for tax relief with the need for medicare solvency we can do both in a fiscally responsible way"],

this amendment my colleagues will define the agenda of the majority party is it to ensure that all americans have an equal opportunity in this country or is it to prevent that from happening the justice departments civil rights division is the most important weapon we have to fight for equal opportunity through its investigation and prosecution of criminal civil violations violationsof the fair housing and lending laws employment discrimination and other civil rights abuses unfortunately the majority has consistently underfunded this office why this year the administration has asked for 97 9 million and is getting only 86 million from this bill and this is in the midst of a 200 billion budget surplus that is the wrong message to send to the american people about the importance of civil rights this amendment can fix this by fully funding the division with an additional 11 8 million now in the past few years the civil rights division has been more important than ever in pursuing criminal civil rights abuses the nation has experienced the horrors of the torture and deaths of matthew shepard and james byrd and the murder of a reproductive health care provider dr bernard slepian more recently four new york city police officers killed amadou diallo an unarmed immigrant in the lobby of an apartment building and another four officers brutally assaulted abner louima these are just a few of the cases that the division is reviewing the federal bureau of investigation stated that there are 10 461 law enforcement agencies across the united states reporting a staggering total of 8 049 hate crimes in 1998 alone these are conservative numbers though because the truth is many hate crimes go unreported because the victims fear retaliation and many police departments just do not collect such data now while law enforcement offices and agencies pursue the bulk of the offenders the justice department must train those agencies and prosecute those offenders the local officials car not with added funding the civi rights division can hire five just fiv more lawyers and assure that many c these perpetrators are brought to juc tice three prominent civil rights groupe the naacp the aclu and the na tional asian pacific american lega consortium have pointed out in a let ter to the house that one of the mos pressing issues for many americans i that of police misconduct the department has investigated th police departments of washington d c new york city new orleans and lo angeles and many others for numer ous offenses including excessive force prior investigations have led to con sent decrees with local police depart ments including steubenville ohio and pittsburgh pennsylvania foi using excessive force and impropei searches in december 1988 thejustice depart ment was conducting six public inves tigations with eight attorney throughout the country and in december 1999 the department was inves tigating at least 12police department with just the same number of attorneys as the previous year we cannot expect the department tc increase its workload in this mannei without adding additional resources andso this amendment would permit the division to hire three muchneeded attorneys to prosecute police misconduct and so my colleagues i urge my colleagues to support the serranoconyers amendment it adds modest funding to the civil rights division all to oftenthe majority gives our nations civil rightslaws mere lip serviceoffering us civil rights on the cheap the budget before us today confirms my worst fears if you look at the actual evidence in critical areas such as hate crimes police misconduct employment and housing you will see that there is overwhelming evidence of ongoing discrimination in our society yet the budget actually under funds the critical civil rights division to the tune of 11 million consider the problem in hate crimes our nation has only recently began the healing process in the aftermath of the tortures and deaths of james byrd jr and matthew shepard in laramie wyoming in the years 1991 through 1997 there were more than 50 000 hate crimes reported 1 this is why the conyersserrano amendment would allow the division to hire five new attorneys to help prosecute hate crimes and other civil rights crimes the incidence of police misconduct toward minorities is also growing dramatically in pittsburgh a police officer shot to death a black motorist who had slowed down and peered through his side window while observing a drug arrest in riverside california a 19yearold black woman was shot to death by a policeman in her car at agas station and we all know thatamadou diallo a west african immigrant was shot 41 times in the vestibule of his bronx apartment by four police officers at a time when the civil rights division is on the verge of being totally overwhelmed i our amendment would also allow the division il to retain three additional attorneys to fighl against police pattern and practice misof conduct the problem with regard to employment and housing discrimination is no better the number of employment discrimination cases in federal courts has almost tripled between 1 1990 and 1998 from 8 413 complaints to 1 23 735 the bipartisan glass ceiling commist sion recently found that 95 percent of top cors porate jobs in america are held by white males with africanamericans holding less

rail system in houston texas this is an effort to speak on this floor and to ask for collaborative support on communitybased efforts dealing with the great needs of regional mobility in an area that is working to comply with clean air requirements as a representative of the aiea that would see the benefits of this light rail project and as a representative from houston that would see the larger benefits i want this floor to know that this is a collective and collaborative effort houston metro simply wants to transfer 65 million in federal funds earmarked for construction of a light rail project in my home city of houston the rest of the monies would come from other local sources what better collaborative federallocal government collaboration than to see the matching funds the effort that the community is making the light rail project has been vetted extensively in our community it has been vetted by the metro board the city council the mayor of houston who is of course a supporter i have received support from the local surrounding congressional members the gentlemen from texas mr green mr lampson mr doggetr and mr turner the mayor of the city of houston the county judge of the city of houston the houston partnership the medical center the astrodome area of which this connector would connect if we just envision a straight line going through a myriad of areas in a city some high some low this light rail connector is in fact a dream effort to ensure a working laboratory to give further data and insight into the idea oirregional mobility it connects the large astrodome where the republican national convention was held along through some depressed areas along through our museum area the rice university main h3438 coi street as most of our towns have their main street which have fallen upon hard times then into our vibrant downtown area and connecting the university of houston downtown that serves a high population of hispanics and african americans this light rail is a win win circumstance it is a system that has been frugal in its analysis no comment or criticism has come from the department of transportation that this is not a good system no criticism has come that they are overrun with the new executive director and ceo of the metro shirley delibero we brought in a very fine rail professional we know for sure that this rail system will help to generate feeder lines if the community so desires in parts west north south and east reaching to all parts of this metroplex as we have seen the proposal of the light rail we have seen a light

would ask my colleagues to consider this as we proceed i would have liked to see this amendment come to the end i intend at the conclusion of the debate to withdraw this amendment because i am hoping that we can enter into an abbreviated colloquy to say that we will work together i see the gentleman from texas on the floor of the house i want to work with him but i do want us as a community to be able to move into the 21st century i look forward to my colleagues working with me and the gentleman from texas on this very important issue i rise with my colleague mr bentsen to offer an amendment to section 331 of this bill h r 4475 that would only prevent funding for the planning design or construction of a community supported light rail system in houston texas as a representative for the 18th congressional district in houston i fully support the transit funding that was appropriated for houston and approved by the department of transportation for the light rail project the houston metro was to transfer 65 million in federal funds earmarked for construction of a light rail project in my home city of houston the rest of the 235 million needed would come from local funds slated to build park and ride centers and other projects the light rail project is supported by the houston metro the surrounding congressional districts of congressmen bentsen who is a cosponsor of this amendment gene green lampson doggett and turner the business community the mayor of houston lee p brown and the harris county presiding elected official judge robert eckels this light rail project is a winwin situation for everyone in houston as well as the millions of people who visit every year in that it would attract and focus new development and an economic boom around the station areas and to the economically depressed areas within the city of houston and the 18th congressional district which i represent in fact an independent overview written by the greater houston partnership which includes the houston chamber of commerce houston economic development organization and houston world trade stated that the economic impact of the light rail project in houston would have an estimated incremental development over the 20012020 period ranging from 0 percent to 40 percent the light rail project would also reinvigorate retail sales in downtown houston as well as link the two principal employment centers of houston which is made up of 200 000 employees some of the local businesses that began to plan for the economic boom that the light rail project would bring are century development which started plans to build a 27story high rise office building with a 1 500 space parking garage and 50 000 square feet of retail space trammel crow residential which is evaluating two 250300 unit multifamily housing complex in midtown houston camden development which recently completed a 337 unit apartment project in midtown and mccord development which has two 2 highrise office redevelopment projects underway totaling over 50 million in renovation fees these are only some of the redevelopment that is being implemented as a result of the light rail project in houston which was to receive federal funding houston has also been hit with major concerns about air quality and requirements for improving its air quality through better mobility plans therefore the light rail project for houston is of urgent need to the community the main street light project is welcomed by the residents of houston light rail will help alleviate houstons traffic congestion problem and significantly reduce the number of motorists that presently pollute the air with exhaust the light rail project will play a pivotal role in regional transportation among other benefits the light rail project will service all day transit demand including peak hours it will relieve bus congestion in the urban core as buses from throughout the region currently converge on downtown this project will offer a transportation choice to many area residents who will choose to leave their vehicles at home i will be absolutely opposed to any efforts in the appropriations committee that would hinder or prohibit the timely funding of this urgently needed project i urge my colleagues to support this amendment"], [0.0015656352043151855, 0.9984343647956848, 1, "i thank my colleague from new jersey for taking this time to talk about really quite a serious issue i think we should try to put this in some kind of a perspective first of all let me mention that we are going to be gone from here within the next few days we do not know how many more days there will continue to be the deliberation on the budget but the fact is that if we do have an opportunity after the republican leadership has been fighting tooth and nail more cops on the beat more teachers reduced class size if in fact there are some gains in that area we will feel vindicated and we will be very very pleased they are important victories for working families that is what we want to do that is why we come here we want to try and protect those vital priorities but that leads me to say that one has to take a look at why we are here each of us comes as a direct result of elections people cast their votes and they say frank pallone of new jersey rosa delauro of connecticut of the third district we think you will do a good job on our behalf each of the 435 members who comes here has that kind of trust it is a responsibility as well as an opportunity what we try to do is to take very seriously that responsibility those obligations and try to reflect the will of the people in this body it is the peoples house but the kinds of issues that you have talked about the health issues and as you go through the list of the unfinished business and whether it is hmo reform or prescription drugs or gun safety or minimum wage social security or medicare in each of these areas we know that the public is clamoring for some kind of relief if it is on hmo reform they are desperate to get back to doctors and patients and themselves making their medical decisions they are desperate and clamoring for the notion that my gosh if something goes terribly wrong with a course of medical action that has been if you will prescribed by an hmo that they in fact cannot get any accountability any relief they have no place to go they worry about that for themselves and their families you mentioned prescription drugs you know and i know that people are making those hard decisions every day as to whether or not to fill their prescriptions or buy food because the cost of prescription drugs continues to escalate gun safety we know that it is now 7 months since columbine that terrible tragic case and there have been subsequent tragedies and yet modest gun safety legislation cannot seem to see the light of day when we have parents and children saying help us to make our communities safe minimum wage we are at a time in this country over the last 10 years where chief executive officers of corporations have seen their wages escalate 481 percent over the last 10 years in fact workers have seen only a 28 percent increase and quite frankly if workers salaries had gone up as much as the ceo salaries the minimum wage would be roughly about 22 people want to raise their standard of living they are working very very hard social security and medicare bedrock programs which have lifted really lifted and provided a retirement future retirement security for so many hardworking men and women in this country these are the issues that people speak to us about these are the issues that they are concerned and worried about this is what they feel that they have given us their trust to do something about yet there is a hard core minority within the majority party within the republican party here that has said no to these pieces of legislation when there has been real bipartisan support as you know hmo reform campaign finance reform which i did not mention but there were bipartisan gun safety measures in the senate if this were just onesided you might say that my gosh all these folks on the democratic side are wrong these are not issues that people care about but in fact it does not make any difference what party you are about what your party identification is prescription drugs hmo reform gun safety minimum wage medicare social security they know no party affiliation people just expect that we are going to do the best we can on their behalf and yet this majority party this republican leadership has bottled these bills up after they had passed in the house after they have real bipartisan support they have said no so they thwart the will of the members who serve here but much much more importantly they thwart the will of the american public it is wrong it really is that is not why we were sent here we cannot subsume all of this legislation that in fact has a tremendous impact on what peoples lives are about because we may have some individual views or there may be some special interests out there that provide us with funding for campaigns for some reason that we do not like that i do not like or the gentleman from new jersey does not like or the gentleman from maine does not like that particular thing that is not why we are here we have an obligation we have responsibilities to those people who send us here we do not come here on our own we are sent here to do the publics work what this does when the republican leadership thwarts the will of the public they fray that public trust and we find wherever we go people say well i have got to make it on my own because those folks in washington are not going to make a difference in the lives of my family of my work that is sad that is very sad because that is not what we are supposed to be about i lament that you do my colleague from maine does and people on both sides of the aisle my hope and it certainly is not going to happen in the next few days of this year of the 106th congress but we have to make that commitment that we will come back and every day of the last year of this 106th congress of this session that we pledge to make the fight for prescription drugs and hmo reform and gun safety legislation and social security and medicare and the minimum wage the public has got to know that we want to do that and we are on their side on these issues there are those in this body who would do harm unfortunately they are in the leadership of the majority party that is wrong i

only be granted so we can get our work done this continuing resolution is being granted and then everybody is going to go home everybody is going to leave here tonight and come back wednesday and the

the peoples business done there is a great deal at stake here there is a great deal of concern in this country and we have expressed it on both sides of the aisle about our education system about the

expenditures for school construction for modernization and we ought to get on with it we ought to get it done because this is what the people want for their children we ought to make sure that clearly the funds are in place for teacher quality to lower class size and supposedly both sides of the aisle are for that except it just is not being done the president has asked us now point blank to get it done and yet we find out that the meetings are not taking place that the republican leadership in the senate and in the house are not coming together to present that plan and that proposal so what do we see we drag on day after day week after week and the continuing resolution now instead of forcing us to get things done becomes an excuse for which we do not get things done and meetings do not take place so i think we would be much more honest to the people we represent and to the people who are concerned with these issues in the country if we would shorten this continuing resolution if in fact we would require people to stay here and work maybe we ought to go back to open conference committees where people are heldaccountable for the work product of those committees i know that this

resolve these issues on health care i do not know if we have run out of time but i would also hope that we could address the problems of prescription drug benefits that we could address the problems

in opposition to the amendment i have to apologize to our colleagues that we are taking up the time of the house for something that should be settled in houston texas but i rise and feel the need to rise to explain what is going on here i have been involved in mobility around houston for 20 years i have been involved in the regional mobility plan and in developing that plan in the 1980s that we are now finishing i am very proud of the fact that the city of houston as my colleague says the fourth largest city in the country just does not do things like everybody else does we are a major city and a great city in this country because we do not just do it the same way we are the city that built the astrodome we are the city that has a port that is off the shores of texas and the second largest port in the nation we are a city that does not say that they are not a great city unless they have rail and the reason is and i might point out to my colleagues if they had been involved in all the rail systems as i have and the chairman has for over 15 years they would understand why l a is getting out of the rail business because it is a boondoggle and a black hole for a city that is spread out like l a i might say that houston has stepped outside of the box and developed a regional bus plan that is the model for major cities in america this bill has over 20 million in it finishing the last part of 500 million in building one of the best bus systems in the world because we did not grab ahold of the notion that in order to be a great city they have to have a rail system every line that the gentleman from texas talked about every one of those lines loses huge amounts of money and takes money away from mobility systems for those cities but they do get to take a picture of a nice train and put it in their brochures and it makes everybody feel good the problem here in this particular dispute is that the houston metro following the design of many other cities and the gentleman says no elections were held in those other cities it is because the other cities did not pay attention to the voters in those cities and developed the same strategy that is going on here in houston they developed the strategy of starting a little starter line and when it does not make money and becomes a huge hole for transit funds they go to the people and say we made this great investment but it does not work only because we do not have this other line and when that does not work they say well we are just going to build another line and then they wake up and develop what dallas now has dallas now has a rail line but now has surpassed houston in congestion because dallas is more concentrated on rail than they are for the mobility in dallas i do not want to see that happen in houston it is my responsibility as a member of this committee to make sure that the full funding grant by the fta the 500 million is finished what houston metro wanted to do is take money from the regional bus plan from our regional mobility plan and move it to a rail line that makes no sense whatsoever transportationwise my good colleague and friend the gentlewoman from texas says no criticism there is all kinds of criticism including houston metros own study that says this does not help mobility this does not help transportation and this does not help the environment this is an economic development project to build a signature main street in houston texas a very worthwhile project but this is not a transit system this will not carry anybody this will not get anybody off our freeways this will not get bubba i say to the gentleman from texas out of his pickup and put him on a rail system this is an economic development project my position is if they are going to build a huge rail system in the houston region then the people of the houston region ought to vote on it and decide whether they want a rail system or not instead of doing the back doorway that was done in dallas that was done in portland that was done in miami that was done in many other cities that i described there is no transit benefit here major transportation decisions like the proposal to build

vote congress has on this momentous agreement on the one hand china is a potential boom market for our industries particulariy agriculture which is critically important to my district bringing china into the wto has the potential of making the port of hueneme in my district an even more important portal for pacific rim trade with 20 percent of the worids population china is an appealing market it behooves us to work diligently and intelligently to open that market to unitedstates sellers the other hand carries many pitfalls chinas track record in meeting its obligations under international agreements is not good china is the only remaining communist superpower china has stolen our nuclear secrets and threatens stability in asia with her belligerence towards taiwan and others we ignore that reality at our own peril last year i voted against a oneyear extension of chinas most favored nation status based on two criteria the united states maintains a multibilliondollar trade deficit with china and has for years and china has repeatedly demonstrated an aggressive military stance that includes stealing our most important nuclear secrets at the beginning of this debate i was not automatically against chinas entry into the world trade organization but i did have some very serious concerns wto membership carries more protection for the united states than does most favored nation status mfn has been a oneway street it was a unilateral decision on our part to allow china access to our markets with no reciprocal opening on chinas behalf wto is more of a twoway street china must meet and maintain certain opendoor criteria to remain in the wto our trade with china historically has been a oneway street in 1990 our trade deficit with china stood at 10 4 billion by 1998 that deficit had climbed to 56 9 billion it is estimated our trade deficit with china in 1999 will be 66 4 billion chinas entry into wto and the ratification of the unitedstates china trade agreement can ease that deficit but only if the agreement has teeth i believe the wto process has those teeth in 1992 china and the unitedstates signed a bilateral memorandum of understanding on trade access china has violated it many times in 1992 we also struck a deal with china to protect intellectual property including copyrights on unitedstates products today unitedstates copyrights for motion pictures and software in china are still being stolen by chinese companies a situation that results in the loss of billions of dollars and many thousands of american jobs chinese noncompliance has forced us to threaten trade sanctions several times on the national security front china was continuing a systematic raid on the designs of our most sophisticated thermonuclear weapons at the same time that it was modernizing and pretending to normalize relations with the unitedstates among the stolen designs was information on the neutron bomb which to date no nation has opted to deploy and hopefully no one will even though china has been caught redhanded it continues to deny its espionage meanwhile it continues to showcase its belligerency by transferring sensitive missile technology to north korea and by repeatedly threatening to attack taiwan the unitedstates china agreement can have positive consequences for the unitedstates china and indeed the entire world the agreement will force china to open its markets to unitedstates goods and services which will result in a lowering of the trade deficit it could wean china from its passion for subsidies and govemment interference in its industries it could educate the chinese on the rule of law as opposed to its current system of rule by the whim of its leaders it could also hasten the spread of democracy within her borders each time a country has opened its economic markets an open market of ideas has followed but we must step carefully we must not let our desire to access chinas markets to blind us to chinas distaste for democracy her threat to our national security and her history of violating international laws and agreements for the wto agreement to work it must level the playing field for unitedstates exporters

markets are open to american goods and services protect americas strategic interests andbe enforceable i have made it clear that without those provisions i would vote against permanent normal trade relations some of those protections were not in the bill until last night those protections are in the bill only because i and other members of congress withheld our support until every t was dotted by working behind the scenes we were able to force concessions that make this agreement a better deal for american businesses american workers and for those who support greater human rights for the chinese people last night a bipartisan provision was incorporated into the bill that makes it easier for us to monitor chinas trade compliance and act if need be that provision builds on provisions in the world trade organization agreement that allows us to continue to treat china as a communist economy thats important because our safeguards and antidumping countermeasures are more stringent for communist economies than it is for capitalist countries in addition the revised bill continues congress allimportant right to debate and vote on chinas human rights practices and international behavior each year the european union signed its wto agreement with china on friday followed by an agreement with australia on monday both were negotiated with chinas history of duplicity in mind in particular the eu agreement improves the deal signed by the unitedstates by making china significantly more open to foreign investment and trade under wto rules those provisions are open to the unitedstates as well we have given china permanent normal trade relations but this is not the end only the beginning china has at best a mixed record of living up to international agreements and i

to vote for the bill because i believe there are so many things that have been compromised and even in title vii there was some compromise we did raise the trigger from 210 million to 225 million we then further got a little compromise on the language that would allow the children to opt in or opt out that is in my mind one of the biggest hurdles or obstacles there was in title vii i am going to support the bill and support the managers amendment because i strongly support all the programs that i believe h r 2 really does a good job of maintaining it also maintains the integrity and original intent of the bill originally when it passed out of committee i was not able to support the bill i was one of six people that voted no it was more on process than it was on what were the contents of the bill even at that time i stand here again in objection to the process on title vii although that is there and we have to deal with it i am hopeful that as we move to the conference committee and deal with the senators and their version that we may be able to revisit title vii and make it better than it is as it presently stands in this bill i understand several of my colleagues on that side of the aisle were concerned about the parental involvement and they did move to strengthen that parental involvement and i support their desire to make sure that parents know everything that is going on with their childrens education in school but by the same token a child should not suffer the lack of services because a bureaucrat is waiting for a parent to make a decision or they cannot make a decision themselves i believe the way my amendment has been accepted into the bill that the children will receive services immediately upon entering school that the final notification will take place quickly that the school will be required to pick up the phone or make some direct contact as quickly as possible to make sure that that child does not lack any services having said that i feel that the bill is vastly improved i believe the managers amendment which i hesitate to vote against because it does contain all of the agreements that we have made and made improvements to but i do not believe this is the end of the situation i believe that we have a process yet to go through in which we will have to meet with the senate and have a conference and the senate will have to concur and we will have to yield to some of the senates desires and i am hoping that the senates desires for bilingual education and for title i and parental notification is even stronger than it has been on this side of the aisle along with that let me tell my colleagues that one of the reasons that i support the bill is that we are able to increase or include language increasing the standards and accountability for instructions this is something that the gentleman from california from our side has been a strong proponent of for many years we were able to put it in the bill that is going to be marked up tomorrow i would have liked to come down earlier and join in the lovefest that was taking place on the floor in the general debate regarding this bill the only problem is that i could not join in that lovefest because i believe the honeymoon is going to end tomorrow as the gentleman from new york has stated tomorrow we are going to take up straight as which destroys everything that was negotiated in this bill which i think is absolutely ridiculous although i am hopeful somebody will come to their senses and either not offer straight as or that straight as will be voted down and if it is not voted down i hope it will be vetoed by the president so that we will not have to deal with it and keeping intact what we have in title i i would also like to commend my colleague from arizona for working with me on the parental consent portion of this bill i believe his willingness to compromise gave us the ability to be able to vote for this bill and madam chairman i do support the managers amendment madam chairman while i regret that the committee did not have an opportunity to mark up and fully debate title vii the bilingual education act which is included in todays managers amendment and while i still have a number of concerns regarding the effects this bill will have on limited english instruction programs and the children they serve i am going to vote yes on the managers amendment because it is vastly improved over where it was a week ago and because i hope it will be further improved in conference last week the education committee considered h r 2 which includes the reauthorization of several important federal education programs including title i which provides nearly 8 billion for the education of disadvantaged children the magnet schools program the indian education program the javitz gifted and talented program and the mckinney homeless assistance program although i strongly support these programs and believe that h r 2 does a good job of maintaining their integrity and original intent i was not able to support h r 2 when it was reported by the committee due primarily to what i consider to be unreasonable parental consent requirements placed on the education of limited english proficient children while i understand that several of my colleagues on that side of the aisle desire increased parental involvement and strengthened parental rights and although i support that desire i could not support the manner in which they were going about obtaining that involvement and those rights since it meant that a limited english proficient child could go for months without title i services however over the past week since this bill was reported from committee staff have worked tirelessly to negotiate an agreement whereby parental involvement and rights are maintained and more importantly lep children begin receiving educational services almost immediately in the process of those negotiations we were also able to make headway on a number of issues in title vii for instance we were able to increase the trigger point at which the instructional services program turns into a formula grant we were able to insert provisions ensuring that local education agencies measure the progress of lep students not only on english proficiency but also on challenging academic and contents standards and monitor the transition of lep students into the mainstream classroom we were also able to include language increasing standards and accountability for instructional programs and teachers and requiring the department to do research and collect data on best practices and while i still have concerns regarding some of the provisions in title vii i am pleased with the progress that has been made over the last week and would like to commend the staff for their hard work i would also like to commend my colleague from arizona mr salmon for working with me on the parental consent language although i know he feels as strongly about his original position on this issue as i feel about mine in all honesty were the democrats in charge of the house many of the provisions in this bill including those regarding parental involvement and consent would look quite different and i am sure that mr salmon would have rather stuck with his original language however i believe that we have come up with an agreement that we can both live with and support and i believe that h r 2 carefully crafted by chairmen goodling and castle and ranking members clay and kildee is also something we can live with and support and so madam chairman as i said earlier i will support the managers amendment and urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same"], [0.9940702319145203, 0.9940702319145203, 0,

and nagornokarabagh accepted a compromise peace proposal developed by the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce azerbaijan rejected it outright this reaction by azerbaijan was extremely disappointing to those involved in the peace process however at the nato summit in washington in april and in recent weeks the presidents of armenia and azerbaijan have been discussing other strategies for peace this is very promising and i hold out hope for a permanent peace in this area the most important role that the united states can play at this point is to continue to encourage all parties towards a lasting peace this includes the continued enforcement of section 907 of the freedom support act this provision keeps needed pressure on azerbaijan to come to the negotiating table and works toward a permanent peace settlement all azerbaijan must do to have section 907 lifted is to take demonstrable steps to cease all blockades against armenia and nagornokarabagh any attempt to repeal or waive section 907 legitimizes azerbaijans blockade and rewards its rejection of the current osce compromise plan further such a waiver would seriously jeopardize any chance for peace in the

back that is why we urge president clinton to veto this thing we would like to get most of the things that are in this tax bill we believe vice president gore is correct when he says we ought to make careful decisions and selections about whose taxes are going to get cut that is what we ought to attempt to do we ought to target those tax cuts but you have to target the tax cuts especially when you are dealing with pensions and health care as much of this does you ought to target it so as to increase the number of people who have pensions all of us here in congress arent going to have any difficulty contributing to get another 5 000 we have plenty of disposable income to come up with the money to be able to increase our contributions the problem is for that minimumwage or slightly over individual in a small business who is struggling to get it done the same on health insurance if you are trying to increase the number of people who have health insurance you have to do more than what is in this tax package my friend from texas senator gramm was talking about the value of the tax deduction the value of the tax deduction is much greater the higher your income i get a 40percent subsidy as a consequence of the level of my income but if my income is 16 000 a year i dont get any deduction if i am paying at the 15percent rate i get a 15percent deduction that is how it works the joint tax committee estimates that 26 million people will get benefits as a consequence of the health care provisions but only 1 6 million of those people are people who currently dont have health insurance republicans in congress i think correctly are saying that what governor bush said in the third debate that is the difference between my opponent and i he wants washington to decide and select who gets a tax cut republicans apparently are saying that the governor is wrong because we are going to select who gets the tax cuts if you are going to have a tax cut right now it seems to me one of the things we ought to try to do is to say this remarkable recovery we are having right now has been fabulous but there are some people who have been left behind lets try to help them acquire pensions in their part of the american dream lets try to help them acquire health insurance in their part of the american dream we dont do that as i said i heard my republican friends assert several times that democrats were on board and support many of the provisions that is true but we added provisions that were stricken out we added provisions that would have made the proposal much more fair i believe you cannot apply a fairness test every single time you are doing things thereare times when life isnt fair but when you are giving tax cuts to american working families it seems to me a test of fairness is appropriate when you are trying to increase the number of people who have pensions in the workforce when you are trying to increase the number of people who have health insurance a test of fairness is appropriate for members of congress to try to apply to the piece of legislation we are considering those are the two objections i have to what is going on right now the first is i think we have lost our way when it comes to fiscal discipline the discipline that enabled us to say to a citizen when a citizen comes and says senator it only costs 100 million over 10 would you offer an amendment and i would always say in the 1990s well i have to have a pay for i have to find an offset not anymore if the paygo provisions of the budget act are repealed as is proposed in this tax bill no longer will that be necessary it used to be i would say look this is going to be tough because it is beyond what we authorized in the budget act and to get 60 votes to waive the budget act is going to be hard not any longer does it appear to be difficult to waive the budget act that discipline that enabled us to get where we are today is at risk in the closing days of the 106th congress i hope that in this election the american people will say loud and clear we recognize the value of that fiscal discipline we benefited from economic growth we benefited from lower mortgage payments we benefited from greater opportunity as a consequence of congress getting its act together all the way through the 1980s and 1990 1993 and in 1997 secondly i have great objection as i look at especially the tax cut proposal but also the bba giveback proposal that we simply havent applied a test of fairness that is why it was a mistake for republicans to have a meeting with only republicans if you want something to be bipartisan you have to let democrats in the room likewise democrats cant hold a meeting and expect it to be bipartisan if we are the only ones in the room and then go out and say gee i dont understand why senator hatch wont sign on board it is something he supported years ago i dont understand why he wont support this it is similar to something he was talking about the answer is he wasnt in the room he didnt have an opportunity to voice his concern he didnt have an opportunity to say what he liked or didnt like what the republicans did is they brought something that stripped out things we had agreed to and they did not apply a test of fairness as a consequence i am pl eased especially connected to the loss of fiscal discipline that in the closing days of the 106th the president has indicated he is going to veto these two pieces of legislation i think the american people will be the beneficiaries of it my hope is on both of them that it will result in bipartisan negotiation and producing something the president can sign it can be done we dont have to run out of here over the weekend we know exactly what to do it would take us about 30 minutes to put together a tax bill and a bba giveback bill that would get 80 votes on this floor we wouldnt have to sit and say i wonder if the president is going to sign it we would know he would sign it if we have 80 votes he is going to sign it the last time i checked that is still enough to override a veto but we didnt do that as a result we are left here on october 27 27 days beyond the time we were supposed to be done and home we are left here still a long way to go before we have an agreement a long way to go before we will be able to say we have closed up shop and we have finished the peoples

unitedstates ambassador to the united nations richard holbrooke and treasury secretary lawrence summers for the signing of two landmark protocols that address prostitution the impact of pornography on children and the global practice of child labor this resolution applauds the decision by the unitedstates government to support the protocol that condemns the use of children as soldiers by government and nongovernment forces as we vote on this important resolution i look forward to backing for the other protocol regarding child prostitution and slavery it is estimated that this year some 300 000 children under the age of 18 are engaged in armed military conflicts in more than 30 countries sadly far too many of these wonderful children are forcibly conscripted through kidnapping or coercion and others joined because of economic necessity to avenge the loss of a family member or for their own personal safety military commanders often separate children from their families in order to foster dependence on military units and leaders leaving such children vulnerable to manipulation that is clearly unacceptable i believe it is very unfortunate that military forces actually force child soldiers to commit terrible acts of killing or torture against their enemies including against other children last august the united nations security council unanimously passed resolution 1261 condemning the use of children in armed conflict on may 25 the un general assembly unanimously adopted an optional protocol on the use of child soldiers this is a sensible addition to the convention on the rights of the child the protocol extends much needed protection for children my fellow americans this is one of the first international commitments made by this nation that protects our children we can no longer deny that thousands of children are killed brutalized and sold into slavery in sierra leone half of the rebel forces are under 18 and some are as young as 4 or 5 years of age the protocol addresses such action by raising the international minimum age for conscription and direct participation in armed conflict to age 18 it encourages governments to raise the minimum legal age for voluntary recruits above the current standard of 15 years of age and it commits governments to support the demobilization and rehabilitation of child soldiers that is a very strong step

the united states we are just going to laugh that off where they have a trade surplus they allow us to import all of their goods while they put restrictions on our goods in terms of our national security they have used that trade surplus which will be 80 billion this year to build up their military and who do we think is being threatened by this military buildup of the communist chinese they now have the capability of murdering millions of americans with nuclear weapons that they did not have the capability for 10 years ago based on our technology and our money i consider that a disastrous policy and morally morally has this worked in our benefit to have this relationship which people now want to make permanent that is what this is about making a disastrous relationship with communist china permanent what has it done morally today the democratic movement in china which used to be healthy has been smashed religious believers are being persecuted even to the point where people who believe in meditation and yoga are being thrown into prison by the thousands in tibet the genocide goes on the communist chinese could drop an atomic bomb on tibet and murder millions of people and our business community would still be up here saying well how are we going to cut off progress by trying to confront them with this no we have to maintain our engagement pntr basically says

are going to bring down their unfair tariffs that they have had no i am afraid not what will happen is these tariffs which have been disproportionate monstrously disproportionate will be brought down

enforce our agreements with china which we have not been able to enforce before and they have broken their agreements with us we are going to rely on panels and commissions of the world trade organization we have been told that if we engage with china that we will liberalize china we will make them more like us they will become more democratic it has gone the opposite direction we have been dealing with gangsters and right now we are talking about putting gangsters into the chamber of commerce what makes my colleagues think that dealing with a gangster is going to do anything but corrupt their people rather than making them any better the debate is not about isolating china do not let anybody fool us this is not about isolating china it is not about severing our relations with china my colleagues will hear that over and over and over again in this debate that is a ruse it is not true it is trying to get us off what this debate is really about what are we going to achieve by this decision today on permanent normal trade relations with china what we are talking about is continuing to allow our big businessmen to massively invest in china with government guarantees to the exportimport bank and subsidized loans and guaranteed loans that is the bottom line that is what is pushing this we have people closing factories in the united states and opening them up to use slave labor in china and they want the taxpayers to guarantee that they do not care about morality they do not care about human rights this is a joke even with the proposal of the gentleman from michigan we are taking away our ability to enforce any type of human rights standards that we have been trying to push on communist china and they know it they know that we are taking away our rights even to

better the prospects for freedom which i think is nonsense we do not treat tyrants that way but we have tried this before the world has tried this before we remember neville chamberlain as the man who gave away czechoslovakia to hitler and munich but we do not remember what neville chamberlain did in the years prior to munich when hitler had taken over nazi germany neville chamberlain led up to munich by creating an economic task force designed to invest in germany so that the germans would have so many economic ties they would never think of violating the peace it reads almost verbatim the
