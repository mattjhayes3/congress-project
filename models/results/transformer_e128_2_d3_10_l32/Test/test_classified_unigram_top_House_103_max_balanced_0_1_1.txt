neatly at his side and they were just like that congressman mica with nothing in them he said nothinj in the hands congressman rohrabacher and when you made the concession to the fbi after repeating that you didnt believe there was a gun in the hand over and over again when you finally made the concession it was based on a description by the fbi that the gun was found withthe man was found with his palms up and that gun was underneath the palm he said that was all that would have been visible was the trigger guard would i have missed seeing a gun with the dense foliage if that being the case its possible i could have missed it in other words if it was only the trigger guard and if the gun was obscured under the hand but when we put the gun in the hand in the position it was in in the picture and we rolled the hand over the butt of the gun was up or the gun was lying across the palm of the hand you could not have missed it it would have been impossible and i do not know why fiske did not check that out a blind man could see it yet everybody is accepting this report at face value saying it is a great report and forensic experts are perfect everthing else is perfect and it is so full of holes you could not put water in it it is terrible it makes me sick i do not want to upset mr fosters family i am sure that they would like this thing to go away i am sure that o j simpson the families of the people who lost their lives in the o j simpson case i am sure they would like for it to go away but you do not stop an investigation because people want it to go away especially if there are questions that are not answered you get to the bottom of it when a homicide detective goes out to investigate a site like mr fosters death scene they assume it is a homicide until they prove it is a suicide in this case they tried to do just the opposite other questions congressman rohrabacher well we have two discrepancies here we have one discrepancy when he says he doesnthe never saw the gun and the other discrepancy is that he is absolutely certain that the palms were up so thus we have two major descrepancies then we go on i said but the point is see that gun is shoved under his leg partially but you are saying the palms were definitely the confidential witness said for about the 90th time the palms were up i said and if the palms were up in that position you would have seen the gun illand he said i would have seen the gun other questions i said okay now tell us about the cabin there was a cabin there i said you said you knew the guy that owned that cabin years ago theres a cabin about 175 yards aviay from the site where they found the body he said i knew a retired navy commander who lives in that project he was going to set me up with the owner i said but there is a private road that goes back to that cabin he said there is a private road that goes right back to it from the housing development right next to it i said if somebody came back that road they wouldnt be seen he said they would not be seen period i said how far is that from the cabin he said 150 to 175 yards congressman burton so they could have walked around that and come right up he says they are dead in the woods all the way and there is a path that leads right straight up to where they found the body i do not know if somebody brought the body in that way or not i had no idea but that was something that was not investigated because when they told the fbi about it they did not even know there was a cabin back there he had to go show them then we started talking about when he left to call the police after he found the body he said i went got in my van started up the parkway because i was on the parkway i got up to where the park headquarters axe about two two and a half miles maybe a little further up the road the righthand side there is a little phone sign right there i pulled in there was a couple of vehicles on the left i had never been in there before there is two phones there i never saw thembecause i saw the guys there 11c622 co the phones sat back behind the trees over here on the right side i saw the guys there i was looking at them drove by still didnt see any phones looked both ways but apparently drove right by the phones and never saw them backed up turned around started back out was going to ask them to use the phone motioned for them to come over the younger white man walked over i asked him for a phone he stated that you know why and i says well its an emergency i need to use the phone can you get me to a phone yes but why and he says i think he said it the third time at that point i went wait a minute fine are you familiar with fort marcy oh yeah i know it well do you know where the two cannons are oh yes i know it well do you know the one up on the hill to the right oh yeah the next chain bridge road now not the one on the left up there the one on the right all the way up on top oh yeah i know it well i says right beside it down over the bank is a dead man you call the police and tell them oh sure great i dont need the headaches that go with possibilities of going to courts and hearings and crap that all i done was come onto a body thats all hey i done my duty im gone he went to call the police i simply drove off and i stayed quiet for approximately six months the reason he stayed quiet for 6 months was because he was afraid he found this body under mysterious circumstances and did not want to get into it now he got into it decided to become semipublic when he was coming back from africa he went over there to take some pictures of some animals and i said now you were coming back from africa you went to kenya tell them about coming back from af rica and how you decided to call gordon liddy to talk about it he said when i got back from africa i was readingthe london times was eating that story up and iwas sitting in the hotel reading it congressman burton this was what month he said this was april yeah it was i believe it was in april it was either april or may he is talking to his girlfriend hun when was i in africa she says i dont know i didnt go you left me home remember congressman burton okay go ahead cw and its when i got back my brother came over and told me says you hear the story that the new york times printed about the two park rangers have changed their story and stated that they had made up the story about the guy in the white van that they had snuck off down to the park to have a drink and discovered the body and to cover themselves they made this story and at that point i went

important subject but what i would like to do is to get back to the real kernel of the whole issue today because it is past midnight we are going to be discussing probably as important an economic package as we have ever faced certainly as i have ever faced during my time here in the house i would just like to talk a little bit about it i know there are not too many people here and i wish there were more people here it is late and we are all tired but i think it is important important to everybody in this country who is interested in jobs in security in deficit reduction you know i give president clinton great credit for asking for change and i think the american people responded to that he held the torch high and he said believe in me and we can have change and it is for the better and we are going to concentrate on the economy you know a lot of people could have done that and they have not he did we should appreciate that fact i guess where i come down is that i do not think that he is being properly served by those people who are putting the economic plan together because i think what he wants and what he says and what actually is coming to this floor for votes are not the same thing let me tell you why i do not think ever in the history of mankind has a tax increase stimulated the economy you may say well you dont want to stimulate the economy but the president does we all want to one of the things we are looking out on now is unemployment we want people to believe we want them to invest we want them to employ but if i say to you who are business people who are individuals who own homes who are interested in your own activities please employ please invest because we need to pick this economy up because if the whole tide comes up we all benefit we cannot do this in individual pockets so you say fine what are you going to do here in congress and what we say is this look we have got to fix the deficit and therefore we are going to increase taxes and then you say but you know there must be another way of doing this you ask me to invest and to employ and yet you say i am going to throw on you a huge new cost and furthermore there is a train coming out of the station which says health care which may be up to another 100 billion they say in additional costs so what are you going to do are you going to buy a new car are you going to invest in your business are you going to employ somebody else no you are not you are going to wait because you just do not know what is going to happen you know business is two things it is timing and psychology one of the big problems i have with this particular package is it flies in the face of what we want now you have all these fancy 3story minds and you have these brilliant rhodes scholars but at the same time people like us are out there and we are in the real world we have met payrolls we have to renegotiate our loans we have got to go down and ask for extensions on our taxes so why should we do the things which the president wants with these huge new costs and expenses on us we are not going to do it and frankly it does not make any sense so what you have got to do you have got to balance what you want to do with the economy with deficit reduction now let me talk a little bit about deficit reduction i was down here in 1982 at the time of the grace commission and i headed up one of the teams our expenses at that time were 5800 billion now it is 1 trillion 500 billion our income at that time was 5600 billion if i had said to you iii tell youwhat ill do ill increase your income by a factor of 2 in the next 10 years can you hold your expenses to a 50percent increase any family could do that any business could do it no we cannot so deficit reduction is not a matter of taxes it is a matter of cost control and that is expensive i guess that is what we are pleading for it is a perfectly human reaction it is a reaction we understand you do not when you are in trouble in a business increase your prices you cut your costs and that is what we are not doing here let me say one other thing this is a highrisk economic policy and i will give you an example we have a debt of 4 trillion 200 billion a lot of money 4 trillion you can hardly pronounce it do you know that 70 to 75 percent of that debt is in socalled treasury bonds which have a maturity of less than 5 years now if there is anything we learn as we are growing up you do not borrow short to pay long you do not borrow on a shortterm basis to pay something long and that is going to come and hurt us furthermore we are further shortening it so the deficit package and the debt package does not make any sense i am sorry about this i want to support our president but under the circumstances i cannot"], [0.4376276433467865,

that vince foster committed suicide i do not believe after reading that report in some detail with about seven other people that he committed suicide at fort marcy park i believe his body was moved to that location and i will tell this body why i want to go into my remarks this morning because i do not want to hurt the foster family but at the same time i believe that if there was some misdeeds done out there the american people have a right to know and this congress has a right to know and there should be a complete and full investigation if there are any irregularities let us go into this just a little bit the man that found vince fosters body said his face was straight up and yet if you read the report there was blood coagulated on the side of his face and on the shirt forensics experts say his body was like this and they say in the report that one of the people who worked on the investigation must have moved his head the fact of the matter is before they even got out there the man that found him said his head was straight up so the head had been moved before the experts went out there who moved the body we need to find out who moved the body there was blonde hair not mr fosters on his tshirt and other parts of his garments whose hair was it it was not his there were carpet and other wool fibers found on the body where did they come from i do not like to talk about this but there was semen found on his underwear which would indicate there might have been a sexual experience that afternoon between i and 5 if that is the case it is hard to understand the state of mind of somebodk who is thinking about committing suicide and having a sexual encounter at the same time here is something very damaging they dug 18 inches around the body and they sifted all of the dirt and they could find no skull fragments at the site no skull fragments were found at the site and there was a 3inch hole at the back of the mans head from the gun if he was killed at fort marcy park they would have found skull fragments at that site why were they not found there i believe because he committed suicide or was killed someplace else and moved to that spot all of the bullets that were found at the site using modern technology show that there were a number of bullets found but not the one which killed vince foster and they were out there with grids and everything else for several days with 16 people looking and why was the gun in mr fosters hand in the wrong hand mr foster was lefthanded the gun was in his right hand i want to tell you that if you are going to commit suicide and you are in that state of mind usually you grab with the hand you use all of the time the gun was in the other hand why did the man who found fosters body say there was no gun in either hand not once not twice but three times when he talked to gordon liddy and that is the man the fbi investigated my concern is for the facts and the truth when people say i am down here trying to bring this body to a low ebb i resent it i am concerned about the feelings of the family members and i think it is tragic that they went through this mr foster had an awfully good record in life but if his body was moved we need to know from where it was moved if he had this kind of experience during the day we need to know about it we need to know whose hair was on his body these are questions that need to be answered we need to know why there were no skull fragments at the site if he blew the back of his head out it appears to me that he probably was moved from someplace else while i have time left let me go into what happened after mr foster was killed at 6 on july 20 deputy white house counsel vincent foster was found dead in the park shortly after 9 white house chief of staff mack mclarty was informed of his death mclarty ordered his office sealed however the office remained unlocked overnight until u the next day and despite this order less than 3 hours after his body was found white house officials removed records of business deals between mr clinton and his wife and the whitewater development corp from mr fosters office without telling federal authorities who were investigating the death in fact they did not admit that they were in the office until 6 months later why the people who went in were white house counsel bernie nussbaum the presidents special assistant patsy thomasson and mrs clintons chief of staff maggie williams bernie nussbaum said they were there 10 minutes the park police said they were there over 2 hours taking files out of that office during his first search whitewater files and president clintons tax returns were removed and turned over to david kendall president clintons attorney were any of those destroyed i do not know white house officials did not confirm that the july 20 search took place as i said until late in december there are a lot of questions to be answered we want to take care of peoples feelings

most of our new members are aware that there are actually two kinds of house rules around here there are the standing rules that we adopted on opening day presumably to guide our committee and floor deliberations for the next 2 years then there are these special rules which are resolutions reported by the rules committee to permit important bills to be considered out of order and to establish the procedures for their debate and amendment in the nottoodistant past most of these special rules allowed for an open amendment process back in the 95th congress when tip oneill was the speaker in 1977 and 1978 for instance 8 percent of all of these rules allowed any and all members to offer germane amendmentsany one of the 435 members but i say to my colleagues all that has gradually changed over the years until in the last congress fully twothirds of any rules that came on this floor limited the amendment process on important bills and so far in this new congress eight out of eight rules have been limited in other words all of them 100 percent i think the time has come to rename these special rules kings rules because they seem to conform to the rules laid down by the king of hearts at the trial of the knave in alice in wonderland do any of the members have grandchildren i just read this story to my grandchild the other day i suggest you go back and reread it my colleagues will recall that when alice was called as a witness the king suddenly pronounced rule fortytwo all persons more than a mile high to leave the court well alice protested that she was not a mile high and she added thats not a regular rule you invented it just now to which the king replied its the oldest rule in the book well things have gotten curiouser and curiouser in this house and today we are operating under the kings rules right out of alice in wonderland we ought to be ashamed of ourselves as much as we might protest that this is not a regular rule and that the majority has just invented it we are told that this is the oldest rule in the book the king makes the rules around here and they are subject to change at any time and boy are they ever today is an example of just how absurd all this has become back on february 16 our rules committee reported a rule that allowed just one amendment to the family planning billan amendment by the gentleman from virginia who is sitting right behind me requiring parental notification on abortions for minors the following day february 17 the democrat leadership pulled that rule just as it was about to be brought up here on the floor and nothing further was heard of it for more than a month yet we did not have anything on the floor for action we had i believe one bill a week then last week the chairman of the rules committee announced that he was reopening consideration for a new rule and members could again file amendments they wished to offer even though the committee on rules had rejected seven out of eight amendments submitted on the first go around the democrat chairman was now inviting members to offer even more amendments to me that was a hopeful sign that we would now have an open rule or at least a modified open rule making in order all of the amendments that were submitted up there but as it turns out the democrat majority had not been overcome by a sudden fit of guilt fairness or generosity in point of fact the democrat leadership feared that the one amendment that had been made in order might just pass so to counteract that possibility they had to reopen the entire amendment process in order to neutralize that one amendment and that is what this new rule is all about neutralizing the opposition talk about democracy oh it is true that the committee on rules has made in order four other amendments submitted by republicans but just as with the bliley amendment in two of those instances they allow a democrat to trump the republican amendments with a watereddown seconddegree amendment so there will not be a legitimate vote on any republican amendment and in one instance they even allow a democrat to totally preempt a republican amendment that they made in order with another amendment so that if that is adopted it would preclude the republican from offering it at all mr speaker you talk about cuteness these are supposed to be representativeg of the people of this nation not members being cute this new twostep rule process has been a complete sham and a shell game allowing the democrat majority to reopen the amendment process so that democrattrumped amendments can be offered we might as well rename this committee on rules the trump shuttle we show our hand first then the democrats shuttle back to the committee on rules to produce some kind of a trump card that knocks our hand out just as when the king said to alice that rule xlii requires that all persons over a mile high must leave the court the democrat leadership is saying that according to their kings rules anyone with an amendment with a chance of passing will not win and they will guarantee it it is a little like the queen of hearts put it at the same trial first you get the sentence then you get the verdict here in the kings house you are sentenced to death by the committee on rules before the jury of your peers the full house can pronounce itself on the merits of your amendment at all i will put it another way and i hope members back in their offices are listening free thinking and free voting representatives can forget about participating in the legislative process the rules are automatically rigged against them unless they are doing the bidding of the democrat leadership or the democrat administration well welcome to the committee on rules instead of a kangaroo court we have got a king of the rule court right out of malice in wonderland no i am not tonguetied malice in wonderland i was amazed to read in last sundays washington post that one freshman democrat was quoted as saying first and foremost we are here to enact a substantive agenda he goes on to say whether or not we have open or closed rules will not affect the daytoday lives of ordinary citizens change i think there is a serious disconnect here on the part of some of the members too many of them perhaps on the relationship between process and policy let me put it bluntly if you do not fight to be a part of this process you are not going to have a dimes worth of influence on the policy it is just that simple i did not come here for that and i hope you did not if you do not realize that every time you agree to one of these restrictive rules you are not only disenfranchising yourself but you are disenpowering your constituents as well then you sure have a lot to learn about both procedure and policy maybe to some members that does not make any difference maybe they are more comfortable letting their democrat leadership and democrat administration make their decision for them maybe they prefer to be spared the pain and the work involved in being a real player around here but let me caution members right now this kind of automatic pilot mentality will not land them safely back in their districts come election time memnbers will be held accountable for the decisions made by this government regardless of whether they are actually involved in it or not and it just will not do for them to claim they were just following orders if those policies turn out to be wrong and they fail members are going to learn real fast about term limits there are 63 new democrats over there just continue to be yes men they should continue ignoring why their constituents that sent them here it was for change remember that word on the day after the election just 19 months from now it is right around the corner they are going to wake up and find their term has been limited to one that is right half of them will be gone i have seen it happen year after year for 15 years and they wonder what did i do wrong i followed my democrat leadership i would appeal to members on both sides of the aisle do not stand blindly and idly by while your basic rights and those of your constituents are being stripped away this is not a partisan matter this is about a role of the peoples branch and your place in it if you do not fight for it now you will soon be out of it you had better think about that at this point in the record i include extraneous material including the roilcall votes in the committee on rules including the rollcall vote where every democrat voted party line against my amendment the solomon

never met anybody like him and i think most people felt that way b t actually i first met when he was as has been mentioned was governor browns chief of staff and he was a republican even then actually b t opposed me as i recall my first three elections but he did not know me all that well and he eventually came around and supported me very staunchly particularly beginning with the 1990 election when there was a very controversial tough issue that came up and he jumped right to my defense i am not here tonight because he either opposed or supported me simply to observe that b t collins was a straighttalking man if he told you something you could count on it and he was one of the few individuals i have ever known that actually whatever he said he would do he always did that and then some i think that was respected very much about him i had the privilege of attending just a wonderful service that was quite a lengthy one but actually every speaker there had something valuable to say it went on for abut 2 hours it was the memorial service right near the vietnam veterans memorial that he actually brought into being through his perseverance an outstanding memorial thatwould be if we had nothing here in washington i think would make it seem to pale by comparison i am always proud of it when i see it and i realize it was through his efforts obviously these things are a team effort but b t took the lead and went to many people and i say this personally and solicited contributions and really made it happen it was so unusual to me it is one thing to lend your name to an effort but b t went well beyond that he actually personally took charge and went down the list and called people and buttonholed them and collected those contributions many times i would see him around the district not just the sacramento area there too but he never represented for example nevada county and yet i would see him when they had the annual republican barbecue b t collins had driven up to the fairgrounds in grass valley to give a talk and share his thoughts with the people they loved him and as i would watch him climb into his car i thought how difficult well that is difficult frequently going beyond your area to speak taking time away from other priorities but i thought here was b t collins severely injured in the war and frankly i think never without pain not that he ever showed any sign of that but i am given to understand through the remarks that were made that he was almost in constant paizi and yet he never revealed never complained about it always giving and realizing that i think about him climbing into his car and tired at the end of a sunday afternoon where he had given a speech in nevada county quite distant from where his focus of activities would have been when i think of b t collins i think of the following terms heart b t collins was a man with heart he understood people he loved people and he did everything he could to try and improve peoples circumstances loyalty fiercely loyal to whomever his superior officer was i mean i saw that loyalty clearly first for governor brown and then to tom hayes the state treasurer and then to governor wilson b t collins sat in my office it was wednesday i guess and told me he had no interest in running for the state assembly and the following tuesday he declared he declared because the man to whom he was loyal whom he served the governor of california asked him to run and for b t collins anybody knows running a political campaign is a major undertaking he gave up a job that paid him pretty well and instead went into the political fray once again and he did it out of a sense of loyalty made a lot of sacrifice service b t collins believed in public service he was i think the premier exemplar of that the gentleman from california referenced his accomplishments in taking the ccc and really giving it form and definition and inspiring young people to want to serve in that body he really personifled the california conservation corps always felt proud i think of that assoclation i have mentioned before b t collins was a man of action he was a good talker never forget his talk but he was a man of action and as the gentleman listed in his accomplishments he was out there always doing things in lieu of flowers we have been invited to send contributions to the weve center woman escaping a violent environment so even there in death he was out there active raising funds for the causes that he believed in i just want to mention briefly i saw him various times at the eagle scout courts of honor and it was always interesting to listen to him speak i do not think i ever saw him speak with notes he always just spoke straight to the audience came right from the heart and it was always interesting and frequently memorable the things that he had to say reference has been made to the notes and he also called people on their birthdays in fact i was surprised i got a telephone call it is just so unusual that people are able to make the time to do hat kind of thing and as irony would have it i had gone through a file which i was overdue in looking at of correspondence sent to me and i pulled out two notes from b t collins to me and i took them home to show julie but as fate would have it he passed away before i had that opportunity to do that and so when i came back from the funeral last week i pulled those notes out and showed her along with the program of his memorial service and b t collins attending the memorial service by the way it was really kind of the outpouring of support you would find almost for a deceased president i commented upon that i have never seen during my time at the scene there in the state capital an outtouring of support like we had for b t collins it was truly remarkable he was an outstanding individual i think he always will have left an impression upon my mind of someone who truly through his actions performed the acts of christian service i am very very pleased to be here this evening to join in this special order commending b t collins i think his relatives and friends can be very proud of him

the union message talked about his plan to deal with the deficit and the republican study committee which i chair spent the entire weekend studying president clintons budgetary proposals and what kind of an impact it would have either positive or negative on the united states of america here is what we found there were 325 5 billion in tax increases the largest tax increase in unitedstates history by more than 60 or 70 percent the largest before that was around 184 billion in addition to that there are 70 billion in hidden fee and get this they are called spending cuts they have got 70 billion in fees in there that are called spending cuts when that is actually more money coming out of taxpayers pockets when you talk about spending cuts he has been telling america about this there are spending cuts totaling 91 7 billion but there are spending increases totaling 185 9 billi6n for a net increase of 94 2 billion so when he tells you he is going to cut spending the fact of the matter is we are not cutting domestic spending we are increasing it by over 94 billion on top of that there are 395 billion in new taxes and hidden fee increases the only spending cuts in his budgetary propolal that we can find are in the area of defense and those cuts were going to take place anyhow and that is 112 billion so the deficit reduction plan he is talking about is not coming from spending cuts it is coming out of the hides of the american taxpayer now 2 years ago when we had the budget summit agreement and president bush erroneously i believe signed on to that agreement with the democrat majority in both the house and the senate weraised taxes on the backs of the american people to the tune of 182 billion and that tax increase cost us thousands and thousands of jobs and put this country into an economic recession that we are just now coming out of the tax increases president clinton is talking about in my view are going to cost at least 250 000 jobs in the next year to 18 months and it is going to put this country into an economic decline much worse than what we have seen in recent years now i was talking to one of my democrat colleagues today and i promised i would not use his name because he was sorry he said this but he meant it here is what he said with smile any tax you pass is going to put somebody out of business and that is the problem these huge tax increases are going to put a lot of marginal business people over the brink and they are going to go bankrupt today out in the hall just 5 or 10 minutes ago i talked to members from the farm bureau do you know what they told me the btu tax the energy tax which i call the big time unemployment tax the btutax is going to cost them so much that many of them will go out of business because they cannot pass those increased costs on to the consumer because of the way the agricultural markets work on the commodities exchange they cannot pass that on so a lot of small farmers and mediumsized and large farmers are going to go out of business if we pass the btu tax in addition i just had a bunch of people call me who are in the foundry business they rely on energy to make the molds and make the products that most of us in this country use it is one of the biggest industries in america they tell me that many foundries are going to go out of business if we pass this stu tax then we come to the airline industry and i am only going to mention three tonght but i can go on and on and on but the airline industry is going to be hit with a 15 centsper gallon jet fuel increase and many of those airlines if you have been reading in the papers are on the brink of bankruptcy now they are trying to cut deals with british airways and other foreign airlines just to stay above water here we are going to joad on the backs of the airlines one of the most important parts of commerce in this country another 15 cents per gallon fuel tax i guarantee itis going to put alot of them out of business every one of these companies that go out of business has enployees when they go out f business their emplqyees lose their jobs and when they lose their jobs that increases the unemployment rolls for each 1 percent of unemployment when you add in all of the benefits they get that costs the taxpayers and the treasury 342 billion this one little phase of his economic recovery program is a recipe for economic disaster so i am telling my friends across this country who say well we have to do something we have gdt to do something we want to cut that deficit cut the debt that is absolutely true when president clintonstood up here and he said to the american people it is not what is important for me it is what is important for us meaning the entire nation he was absolutely corpect but the solution is not these homongous tax increases which will make us less competitive tith our foreign trading partners will drive business out of this country and itake jobs along with it take money out of the taxpayers pockets withoutwhich they cannot buyproducts and if they donot buy the products they do not produce products and if they do nat produce products people lose their jobs and unemplqyment goesup the solution is to cut government spending ten yearsago we were bringing in 500 billion a year in tax revenues it is now 1 2trillion we have almost tripled the amount of tax revenues coming in in the last 10 years and yet we are still rumling deficits tof about 350 to 400 billion per year so what is the answer the answer s nut more taxes out of your hide america the answer is to cutspending now how do you do that president clinton mhallenged the republicans saying if you are gding to complain be speciffc i have got a plan and you dont well we do mve a 3plan many of us have aplan it is called freezng spending at last years level do not increase government ependlng some peoxle say wail 7ou have got to increase some progrbrna ok let us increase ithem 1 or 2

what is happening in haiti as well as my outrage at some additional facts that i learned today in a briefing that was provided to myself and other members of the committee on armed services president clinton has been telling the american people that this effort is a multinational effort and if you ask most americans and r think most members of congress who is in haiti right now they would tell you it a multinational force at todays briefing we had the deputy secretary of defense john deutch and lt gen john sheehan who is the director of operations for the joint chiefs i asked that specific question right now today 10 days after president clinton committed our troops and has told the american people it is a multinational force how many americans are involved in that effort the answer is that there are 19 000 young americans who are involved ir haiti today then i said would you tell me how many other troops are involved in that effort today right now 10 day after the president committed us after he has told the american people it is a multinational force secretary deutch hemmed and hawed and talked about what is committed and what may be i said no what is f there right now how many troops that are not american he said well about two dozen i said you mean like 24 three times i repeated the question and three times secretary deutch confirmed that there are 24 nonunited states troops involved in haiti right now 19 000 americans and 24 troops not 24 countries 21 troops i said where are they and he said they are all in the command headqcuarters so we have 19 000 americans in haiti in harms way and we have 24 troops from other countries who are all in the headquarters building this is not what the members of congress and the american people have been led to believe this is not what this president has told us in terms of the commitment and the involvement last week he said that within 2 to 3 days the multinational forces would be in haiti here we are 10 days later some other things came out o the briefing we learned today that the united states in fact will pay all of the costs if and when other troops come in so for the taxpayers of this country we can now advise them that with our serious budget shortfall if in fact we get other troops to come in which is still doubtful the taxpayers of this country will pay the full bill we will pay their salaries we will pay the cost of transporting them we will pay all of their expenses and in fact today we had an announcement that the russians will send troops we will pay the russians not the united nations the united states this is outrageous not only are we going to pay the cost for the troop but we even heard about big gun buy back program in haiti america is buying those guns we in fact are the ones who are paying that bill what is the cost going to be secretary deutch could not give us an exact figure estimates range from 800 million to 1 5 billion the secretary tried to focus on the fact that we should not legislatively impose a date certain to bring the troops out well that is outrageous because most of us in this body do not think they should have been inserted there in the first place the secretary and the president would tell us they are going to be out within a few months perhaps in the early part of 1995 if you read the boston globe today or yesterday there is an article that says the unitedstates military role may last until and through 1996 mr speaker we are not getting good information the american people are not being told the truth about what is happening in haiti and we have our men and women in harms way now we hear if you read the news accounts today that what we thought was a suicide of one of our troops in haiti is now thought to not be a suicide and in fact there was one ap report today that said it is likely not to be a suicide we do not know the facts of that young military personnels death but we will find that out what is happening in haiti is outrageous because we are not given the facts and the chance to even ask the questions about what we are doing there i wanted strobe talbott to be at the briefing today strobe talbott was scheduled to be one of the witnesses representing warren christopher our secretary of state stobe talbott did not show up but if i would have had him there i would have asked him to respond to the internal memo of the united nations from the united states special envoy to haiti dante caputo on may 23 of this year this is what he wrote to boutrosghali to the ministers question about the existence of another alternative other than force dante caputo replies that the united states acted as a brake to a diplomatic solution creating a situation where military intervention became nearlyinevitable as we all know dante caputo resigned from the united nations last week because of his objections to what we have done in haiti i have inserted twice in the record of this institution the full text of dante caputos memos where he outlines everything that is happening now back in may of this year this outrage has got to stop we have got to have a full vote on this we have to debate

distinguished chairman the gen tleman from massachusetts for yielding me this time because deficit growing emergency spending is a real problem that needs to be addressed and because all members who sought to offer amendments have been allowed to offer them on the floor i am not going to call for a vote in opposition to the rule that we have before us but that is not to say it is a good rule or that it has not got some problems with it i think it is sort of appropriate we are here today on the leading edge of a weather event which has caused serious problems to our south down in the area which i represent and other areas of florida and georgia and the carolinas and once again we have gone a icg distance of time without providing for these acts of god or these unforeseen disasters that come upon us weatherrelated disasters are predictable in the sense we know they are going to happen it is just we do not know the date it seems to me we ought to be a little bit smarter about getting ready for the fact we know we are going to have these kinds of problems that is one of the things that the government can do is to try and buy relief for people in need for our citizens in need in this country and we need to find a way to do it better i would point out as we start this that we had assurances if not promises from the democrat leadership i believe it wa s a little over a year ago when we were debating the mississippi flood problem that we would come to grips with this problem well we have not come to grips with the problem and today we have a very modest bandaid patch which really does not do anything different than what we are really doing now and the real purpose of why we are here today is to vent on the a to z issue rather than accomplish a really solid proposal that will lay some funds aside for these predictable problems that we are going to have helping out americans in need as a result of natural disasters and other emergency spending needs that this body and the other body and the president and the communities deem truly worthy of relief from the federal government 0 1040 going back to the rule first the rule waives all points of order against the bill that is a red flag for most members now especially after we have discussed the crime bill at such length and seen the kinds of minefields that can be in there when we protect things and we are not sure what we are protecting sometimes there are some nasty little surprises and i think we have gone through that process one more time we have got a rule that waives all points of order against the bill while we at least took the sensible step of waiving all points of order against the amendments as well and the reason i say that is so that they are treated fairly if we are going to protect one part of the process then we may as well protect it all i think that is justifiable as long as we know what is there in this case we generally do know what is there so it is not quite as upsetting as not knowing what isthere i must comment once again that this is a dangerous trend however and one we on the minority side would like to get away from we think members should know what is in the bill and what is being protected and what is not the committee on rules now seems to be in the business of providing blanket waivers as sort of a normal way that we do stuff i do not think that is a good ideat we are going to continue to resist that i will admit there are times when there are items that meed protection i am not saying that we should not use judgment and wisdom i am just saying providing blanket protection all the time for everything that might be hidden in one of these reports is not a good way to do business it has actually reached the point where we are not even told what provisions in this bill might need protection i think we do know in this bill more than we do in others i am not as concerned about this bill because this bill does not do a whole lot but i do not like that uncertainty and i do not think members want that uncertainty i find it frankly a little bit ironic that as we are about to consider a bill that seeks to use points of order to control future spending and that is what this does we are demonstrating why such a measure is impotent because we are violating the very thing we are seeking to outlaw in addition this rule calls for a kingofthehill procedure we have had much debate on that it is a complex machination that in this case as in every case stacks the deck against the adoption of any of the amendments offered what generally happens is this we go back to where we started and we tilt the deck so where we started is the choice that will normally come up this is because even if an overwhelming majority of members vote in favor of a substitute it would only take a bare 218 votes to restore the language in the base bill which will be considered as the final amendment so we go through a long process of maybe debating for half an hour on each side or whatever the time allowance is worthy amendments and we do two or three and we have votes on each one then the last amendment we always put back in as shall we go back to square one what that does is it allows everybody to say gee i voted for one of those great amendments but at the end i also voted for the bill because that was the best i could get so it is sort of a charade we are giving cover to members to say they voted for something that they thought their people wanted back in their district but when it came really to the end the last vote they had to vote for is the one that the majority party wanted in the first place the party position and that is the one they vote for to be members of the party and adhere to the discipline in their party position so we end up not with a merit but we end up with sort of a partisan approach to the debate we have advocated in theminority for an alternate approach to this instead of it being the going back to square one when we go through the amendment process that instead of that that we allow the amendment which gets the most votes to win i think any american would say that makes sense the proposition that the most people vote for is the one that should come up as the winner that is not the case when you ever king of the hill unfortunately it could happen that way but it usually does not in committee we have offered a motion to allow the amendment that garnered the most votes to carry the day we do that on the committee on rules and we think that is a more democratic way to go and a more common sense way to go but unfortunately it gets rejected and i would point out it gets rejected in the committee on rules and one of the reasons there are usually party line votes i would point out the majority has nine positions in the committee on rules and the minority has four so it takes a mighty effort to overcome a 9 to 4 tilt finally as we shall see during the general debate this emergency spending control act of 1994 as it is called does not provide for greater control over emergency spending than is currently provided for under the standing rules of the house what we are doing today does not provide for greater control over emergency spending than is currently provided for under the standing rules of the house in other words we already can do in this house what it is we are trying to legislate today so we are going to have this wonderful long debate about are we worried about emergency spending while those folks in carolina are having so much trouble those folks down in northern florida are picking stuff up off their streets and wondering where their house rests and those folks in georgia are digging out from another flood there is going to be the appearance that we are really serious about laying funds out to help these people in situations like that the truth of the matter is under the rules of the house what this little bit of legislation does today could actually come to pass so it is not going to add a whole lot to their relief i am afraid that this just is another empty part to that atoz buyoff we have talked about so much members will recall that a to z was the program where we could have some time set aside to have real opportunities to debate spending cuts here members would have the opportunity to offer individual cuts they felt worthwhile in order to achieve an even further plummeting of the deficit and a closer balancing of the budget here and we were going to go through that process and let those proposals stand on their merit the majority leadership has felt that would be a poor idea and they have looked for other ways to deal with the problem and this is one of the solutions that they have come up with i use the term solution lightly because this does not accomplish as i say anything we cannot already do but we will have a fun debate about it frankly i think we would do better if we were debating a to z or other substantive matters because the american public is asking us to come to some kind of a reasonable conclusion on the crime matter and the health reform matter and all of those issues which are absorbing us and here we are on a wednesday during time that many had thought we would be in our recess talking about something that is really not going to accomplish anything one wonders why the distinguished chairman has mentioned that economic times are relatively good relative to where they have been i agree they are relatively good it is a precarious situation and i hope they stay relatively good the outlook is that they will become relatively not quite so good i think we had an indication of that as interest rates climbed up half a point yesterday i think that anybody who studies the numbers realizes that a plummeting deficit is a very temporary downturn in what appears to be a very serious uprise in the deficit that is scheduled in the years after 1996 a significant rise in the deficit so we do have to come to grips with this deficit question i mentioned at the beginning of my remarks that we had a promise from the democratic leadership that we would have a task force that would deal with this subject of emergency relief spending i understand there is such a task force i do not believe that it has delivered any kind of a product so far surely had it delivered a product wewould be having a request for time for members of that task force to speak today i have no such requests for time i may get them but i do not have any yet i think that we have one or two speakers who want to address the subject but not a report the final thing that really concerns me very much about this when we have these disasters it appears that it is too much of a temptation to let a mustpass relief bill go through without adding a whole bunch of what we will call christmas tree items there has been outrageous abuse on that as we have seen in the past that is a process that we just seem not to have been able to bring under control and even though this legislation talks a little bit about that i do not think it does as firm a job as we need to do i guess it is like having a leaky roof and wanting to sell your house and then you paint the wall to cover up the leak stains before any new customers come in it is not any good to keep painting the wall you have to fix the hole in the roof and this legislation is not going to fix the hole in the roof the final part of it is that yes we are going to continue to have a need for emergency spending and sadly enough we are going to have emergencies and we will have victims of emergencies in our country and it is going to be appropriate for us at the federal level to help out we are going to have to find a way to shift resources to do that but we just cannot keep adding up immense amounts of debt on the burden and say that every time we have an emergency a storm or a fire or something of that event a flood that we just simply have to step back and"], [0.4617878496646881, 0.4617878496646881, 0, "i feel like a prizefighter pumped up i thank the gentleman for yielding to me i would just like to say when the gentleman from ohio asks you to come to a meeting the way he just said when he said that you go to the meeting you dont ask any questions about that so that is relatively simple i cannot thank the gentleman from ohio and the gentleman from minnesota enough for what they have done to really in my judgment and i think in the judgment of all six of us who are handling this debate tonight to energize this particular issue for true cuts in washington dc every single one of us in this building goes home and when we go home we see the individuals who have lost their jobs or those who have had to cut back on their expenditures because they did not have enough money or their spouse lost a job or a child is sick or whatever it may be we have seen businesses which are not making it for various reasons and some drop by the wayside they go into bankruptcy and they have to go on and do something else but they have to pay their bills they know that eventually they are going to have to pay the piper in some way or another and they are going to have to somehow or another be able to earn the money in order to do that we see our local governments we see our city governments we see our country governments and we see our state governments they are doing the same thing they are fighting like heck to balance their budgets as a matter of fact practically every state in the united states of america has now adopted a balanced budget amendment i think all but one at this point have done it because they understand and the people have stressed the importance of balancing that budget we ran for office and then we go out there and we talk about the federal government i will guarantee that those same rotary meetings that the gentleman from new jersey referred to that people raise their hands and say why cant the federal government balance its budget why does the federal government have so many programs why does the federal government spend so much money there were i guess about 30 of us that the gentleman from ohio and the gentleman from minnesota brought together for the idea of talking about can we make a difference as far as this is concerned it was a group of individuals who care a great deal about this country about their president and about what is happening in the united states of america we sat down and talked about the issues we broke up into little groups and we figured out what we could really do that would make true budget cuts in the united states of america but would not harm people or programs in such a way that they could not function in the future we went over this we went over this we went over it at different levels we eventually debated it it got done i believe every single program that is included in there is something that can indeed handle the reductions which have been proposed and where is the opposition coming from it is coming from the white house it is certainly coming from within this building it is coming from the appropriators and we all have our letters threatening various projects that may not get renewed if indeed we try to cut this particular money and vote the wrong way tomorrow it comes from the interest groups and i do not know how extensive they are but i know of one union in my home which wrote and said gee we dont want you to cut back on the cost of living increases and raise retirement ages and then when we took some of that out because there was so much opposition to it they indicated that they did not want to be in a union with other people who were going to have their retirement ages raised even if they were not which is an incredible rationale when you get right down to it are the arguments we are hearing really sound would it destroy changing health care i do not think so would it really depress the economy you heard the figures and i think the gentleman from ohio used some of the figures as did others and it is a very slight reduction as far as economic progress of the united states is concerned will it destroy government programs that has got to be a joke i do not know how small cuts such as this could possibly destroy any government programs most of which are already overfunded will it decimate our defense beyond repair again that is just beyond reason to be able to make that representation but the real issue is maybe not what is happening at the white house and not what the appropriators and the chairs of the committees think that we work with or even what these interest groups that have contacted us think the real issue is what do the people of the united states think what about that 99 some percent that we have not heard from at all where are they tonight what are they thinking if they are smart they are home in bed asleep but what are they thinking at this point i would suggest that they are thinking why can we not live here in congress the way they live at home with those businesses that are trying to make it with the accountants at home where it is a struggle to meet the bills each week and each month why can we not eliminate the waste we have heard so much about and clearly is there why can we not sunset outdated programs why cannot the government run more efficiently why cannot runaway government be checked in some way or another what should we do about it as members of congress i have a lot of ideas i personally think we should pass lineitem veto we got within 21 votes this year we should have a balanced budget amendment in the united states and that is going to be difficult to do because it would have to be done in the future we should sunset some programs we probably should go to 2year budgeting i am not sure i understand that concept but it seema to make sense from what i have read about it but the truth of the matter is we are going to have one real great opportunity before we go home this year before we go home to the chamber of commerce to give the speech in the editorial board to say what we are doing to cut expenditures in the unitedstates government to make congress balance its budget and we are going to have that chance tomorrow when we look at the pennykauich bill and we make our docision if we are going to vote yes or no more or leas in the range of 211 of us are going to have to vote yes on that particular very sgnificant piece of legislation we are going to have to cast aside the special interests and those who feel their oxes being gored and we are going to have to think about the people of the united states of america and what they really want and where we can really begin this process and it is only a beginning there is a tremendous amount more that we have to do if we are really going to deal with the concepts of balancing budgets and making government programs funded in such a way that they are streamlined and they meet the methodologies of going ahead that we should follow in this country but this is the opportunity this is the time for republicans this is the time for democrats to stand up and to cast their votes in what is going to be in my view the most significant vote we are going to cast in the congress this year i hope the whole country is looking at that vote tomorrow and i hope when that vote ti called for that we deliver the majority needed in order to have a real victory before this year is out and i thank the gentleman for yielding"],

side new suggestions for new taxes for more taxes let us review just a moment if i may with the gentleman where we are a lot of talk a lot of rhetoric that came out of the administration in the last few months has confused people where we are first of all we had in this body passed in march the budget bill the budget bill put together by the budget committee and hailed as a great success for the president is generally meaningless i found that the administration does not follow it and the committee on appropriations does not follow it and very few people in this house seem to follow the budget bill so for all practical purposes the great victory of the budget bill is pretty much forgotten between march and today then next came the presidents package of spending his first package of spending it was some s16 billion essentially this spending as i recall was to pay off major political debts and to put some 16 billion out into the economy i remember there was something like a s3 5 million item to puerto rico we all thought in my district that that might stimulate jobs but it was just a little too far for us to commute there were several other million dollars in spending that i saw in puerto rico and other parts but we could not see how spending that kind of money and charging it to a deficit would give us any great momentum here in this country when clearly spending federal government spending was not what was holding our economy back it could not be called a spend your way you know and pay off political debt package so it was 6alled a stimulus package very little stimulus a lot of spending the people in the senate saw through that and they cut that as you recall some 12 billion was cut out of that 16 billion package and only the 4 billion left for unemployment was there then came the third package that was put before us a lot of people think that the package that passed this house a few weeks ago and it really is a tax and spend package but obviously here again the administration was not going to tell the american people it was tax snd spend so it was called a budget reduction package even though it did very little toward reducing the deficit but in this budget reduction package and most people think this is where cuts are made in this body you had essentially as the gentleman has been pointing out numerous taxes placed upon the american people we had social security 85 percent taxation of that social security for the first time to go from the social security fund over to the general fund and start funding general fund matters and let me tell you although that will affect according to the cbo something over 13 5 million people in just a few years it will affect the whole social security fund if we break the seal of saying we can start taking funds in any manner from the social security fund paid for by the workers of this country and using those funds for general appropriations over in the general appropriation bills that is what this is doing for the first time it is establishing that precedent and it is a bad precedent as the gentleman from georgia quite accurately pointed out the gasoline tax is a middleincome tax it is a tax that hurts my region and many rural regions all across america more than it does anyone else the president pointed that out as the gentleman stated a moment ago many other governmental officials said that when they worked up the btu tax that they did not want a gasoline tax that would hurt parts of the country yet we are going to have a gasoline tax in this bill finally i would like to point out that the opportunity to cut is here now now you do not hear much being said about it in the press the administration certainly is not saying anything about this but we are in the process of putting together the nations budget it is going to be somewhere around 51 6 trillion when we finish that budget is put together in 13 appropriations bills there are 13 subcommittees of the committee on appropriations each one appropriates and reports out a package they have been coming to the floor starting last week and they will continue to come to the floor for the next 2 or 3 weeks sometime before the fourth of july this house will have adopted all 13 of those appropriations bills now i know the gentleman knows as i do and we would like to remind all members here today that this is the time this is the place to make cuts in the budget this is the time to save money this is the time to try to reel back this massive deficit this is the time to speak up if you really feel that you want to make cuts now we have seen very little from the administration in fact the administration has come into the subcommittees i represent and asked for increases in spending not cuts in most cases i would say that we have coming in a few weeks a bill from commerce justice and state in that and i am speaking toward one item it sounds like a small item when you talk about 1 6 trillion and it is only 400 million now 400 million represents a great percentage of the budgets of a lot of states but in terms of 1 6 trillion it is not that much but it is called the fund for the legal services corporation it has grown dramatically over the last few years when you ask what does it do a lot of people think it provides criminal defense for indigent people it does not we have a public defender fund that will have something close to 300 million in it that provides for public defense for indigent criminal defendants it is being increased incidentally about 38 percent to help cover that sort of thing it cannot provide support in cases such as where there is personal injury and large money sums available because private attorneys provide that type of funding and provide that type of support se we are going to be spending 400 million for a legal services corporation that does many things that a lot of us question there was a distinguished gentleman in our committee that was a former mayor that pointed out quite vividly something that i have spent time checking and see that it is more than just his city where the program in public housing that was designed to eject drug pushers for public housing was started by secretary kemp in the last administration it was very successful in trying to eradicate drug pushers from public housing it was successful in most cities until in many cases the legal services corporation came in and took the case of the drug pushers and in fact stopped the process because it could break city governments they did not have enough money to put up with the hundreds of millions of dollars we are providing the legal services corporation now when i heard this i was much impressed i said can it be so so i checked with other municipalities many of them said yes this is exactly right we have virtually stopped our ejection program in public housing because many of these people can rely on an unending amount of federal tax pay legal services for defense and we cannot with city tax paid dollars fight that sort of program now i am not here to say that there are not poor people in this country who need legal service there is no question that there are cases where the services that the legal services corporation now provides may be good but we have almost 1 million attorneys in this country we have an opportunity here for the state bars and local bars to provide pro bono for this type of help in fact this is what was done several years ago before legal services came on the scene to provide the kind of help through voluntary agencies this is really an opportunity for the state and local bars to step forward and provide this kind of service and relieve this country of a 400 million and growing expenditure and the bureaucracy that often provides which fights good programs in cities such as the drug eradication program"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.5367015302181244, 0.4632984697818756, 1, "jim thank you for those

connecticut the first chairman of the committee on the budget who had retired a few years earlier how are you handling retirement 0bob said un a very gracious way oh ftine ii told him i didnt like losing the cohio gubernatorial race to an italian democrat but i am taking it all right i said that without any effort at pcilitical correctness somewhat more gently with a hand on my arm he said seriously bud how are you handling it i said well idreamed tthe other night i had heard the bells ringing and i was lte for a vote that i hadnt decided how i was going to cast and i think i am driving joyce crazy but other than that everything is ok he smiled and patted my arm and he said well youll get over it give it another 6 months or so you should be ok after the next election indeed bob it turned outthat way you had the experience that you shared with rne and i appreciate it my dad loved this body and his friends and adversaries on both sides of the aisle and we d6 have adversaries on both sides of the aigle there is nothing quite like the infamy of one of your own colleagues who votes the wrong way on an issue that you feel strongly about he hated to see it deprecated uunless of course he was doing the deprecating and that is true of all of us ton one of dads friends from across the aisle an ohiocolleagheothis and mine later was a great american whom some of you will remeniber i will not identify him but he had a 3r d grade education becausehe hadleft schoo to go to work in the mines the coal mines in ohio when he was 9 years old he had a pet project for hisdistrictwhich he never got quite through the congressional process in spite of considerable power and the promises thathe had received from many of his colleagues that thy thought it was a good idea and they would support it when he would get frustrated he used to isay that he met more igentlemen in the mines than he ever met in the unitedstates congress well unfair though it was i thinik sometimes you felt that w ay when you got mad that seems a tough xemark when we have just recently laid to rest bill natcher with whom so many of us served judge natcher would probably get a unanimous vote as one of the best examples of a true gentleman that any of us ever met but not all of us are h3690 gentlemen as a matter of fact there are some in this room who are not and i intend to identify them at this morrent first i want to point out representative pettis of qalifornia do not know were representative boggs of louisiana is but that is another and of course there were others here who were not gentlemen griffiths of michigan jordam of teas aid many many more and i expect one of those ladies would say any one of those ndiles would say as one of my great colleagues from ohio frances bolton once said to a group of her male counterparts when she discovered them discussing legislative matters in terms that were very ungentlemanly and she was embarrassed when sbe walked into the room at that time she said dont worry fellows just think of xne as one of the bqys but all of us did get frustrated d id get frustrated ifom time to time as are many of the members serving in congress today and as many of amen cans are with congress and other of our institutions i remind them all that the bleesing we have in our democratic republic is that we have within our hands the power to make whatever reforms we like sometimes wisely sometimes unwisely i am reminded in my historical aotivities that almost a entury ago the house rebelled against omnipotent speaker unrle joe cannon to establish the committee on rales and the iseniority system for selecting chairmen uncle joe used to pick them out of the group by his own choice within my time of service junior members of congress on both sides upended the seniority system to aelect their own zlhairmen instead of relying on the wino owing system of seniority and just last year at the apex of the furor over term limits over onefifth of the members of congress did not return to serve patience somhetimes serves us better than revolution but we do have those means within our own hands it does not work perfectly this systern of ours and it does not always satisfy us but it does work and this system has made us the greatest nation and the most envied nation in the history of mankind the dome above us under which we have all served and labored sincerely even among our differences makes this building and what goes on here the bestknown edifice in the world there is mot a person beyond our nations shores who would not be pleased to be governed under this dome i assure my colleagues particularly my colleagues and friends on the other side of the aisle that i will not rewrite any history in my new role but candor advises me to admit one of the reasons i accepted that xesponsibility with the hstorical society i hope to be able to use the position to bring about a better public perception of the unitedstates congress and the people who serve in it i feel more deeply than i can adequately ex press that service in the unitedstates congress is one of the highest callings there is and it is one of the greatest honors a person can be given by fellow citizens of this country our nations founders must have shared that view because the congress this body in which we have all had the honor to serve was the first to be established by our constitution we the people of the united states in order to form a more perfect union establish justice ensure domestic tranquility provide for the common defense promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and to our posterity do ordain and establishthis constitution of the united states of america article 1 section 1 all

calling in public service in this country than serving as a wfexnber of the u s congress it is a demanding job as i said we are all proud to have had the opportunity and i am paxticularly prud today

this time to me and i especially thank the gentleman from missouri for standing by me for 8 years and as we bring this bill one more time to the floor madam chairman i really want to say this is a good day because i think we finally are going to see it move from rhetoric to reality for people who are really going to have something today when we finally finish this we are going to find out who is for families and who is just faking my colleagues having been around for 8 years and having listened to all this debate about what is legislative history and on and on and on i feel that for 8 years we have been talking past each other on some very critical items in this legislation that the critics get up and say the same thing over and over again and they never listen to the answers that we continue to give them madam chairman we constantly hear if you pass this bill its going to hurt americas competitiveness well i want to know what is different about americas families my colleagues if the japanese and germans who are knocking our socks off in international trade do much more than this bill ever would why is our doing a little bit of something even though it is less than what they do for our families going to mean we never can compete again i do not believe it then we hear it is going to hurt small business well over and over again we say please look groups under 50 or businesses under 50 employees are not covered then we hear it is going to cost too much well the gentleman from new york just gave a fantastic statement about that and over and over again it has been shown that the cost of retraining new employees is much greater to an employer than the cost of retaining people through family leave that the cost estimate on this is 6 per employee per year now if we do not care that much about americas families we are in trouble the new one i love is that this discriminates against women right that is why i have been pushing it i really want to get all women out of the workplace come on again every single other industrial country has done this and they have not found that it discriminated against women and so i do not think we are going to find out it does that here either so madam chairman one more time when we look at this body and see 80 percent of the elected women backing this i do not think any of them are backing it because they are out to discriminate against women and i hope just once our critic would listen we also have people standing up against this because they want people to have the flexibility to design the benefit package they can get well that is wonderful except that employers are not giving it flexibility we have listened to testimony upon testimony upon testimony of people who would love that flexibility but have never been given that flexibility and we know the horror stories madam chairman in the workplace we have never established a familyfriendly standard and we have never recognized anyones caregiver role in the workplace the answer is always if you are a oaregiver you shouldnt be in the workplace you should be able to afford somebody full time to stay home in other words get a wife i mean i would like a wife i think most of the congresswomen would like a wife my husband would like a wife we are going to get one so let us get real about that and let us realize that we do have to be both caregivers and good employees if every other country can get it we can get it then finally we hear what i really love the people say that because it is unpaid all of a sudden there becomes this great compassion for the poor now i would believe this a whole lot more if they were offering to pay it i would love to have it paid but we figure this should be in the area of a labor standard and not a benefit because indeed at the federal level we have never legislated benefits so this is a labor standard which means it is a de minimis floor the lowest possible floor that we do not want people to fall though therefore it is unpaid unpaid leave for a handful of weeks for some of the most critical things people can go through the birth of a baby where it is so important that bonding take place the adoption of a baby and adoption agencies will not even let someone apply for an adoption if they oannot stay home with the child for a while and get to know it because they know they do not bond when they are picked up at the agency it takes a little more time we also see it for the critical illnesses that all of us are going to have to face at some time with a spouse or with a parent or with a child i madam chairman i just do not understand why we did not pass this ages ago i now realize that children who were born the year i introduced this are in third grade it is time we pass it it is time we make it the law and i really look forward to it madam chairman again i thank all my colleagues for their help"], [0.5350002348423004, 0.4649997651576996, 1, "i must say that i do not have avery high expectation that i am going to get a lot of courtesy today but the debate should go forward i was about to ask a parliamentary inquiry because i was wondering whether logic would be allowed in this debate iam assuming it will be allowed but not highly valued because the argument somehow put forward is that families are being undermined by what the district of columbia did and even by thie somewhat strained logical standards i am prepared to apply from time to time in this house i cannot understand how that is supposed to work what the district of columbia has said is if two people who are living together want to register as domestic partners they can do so and we are told that this will undermine the family now many of the people who will be taking advantage of this as the gentlewoman from washington has pointed out will be people who are in no particular loving relationship of a sexual sort but what has clearly rolled some of the members here is that some of the people who will take advantage of this will be gay or lesbian couples and that i gather is how this is supposed to undermine the family i have to tell you that i do not understand for the life of me how the fact that i will go home tonight and have dinner with herb undermines anybody elses family i do not begin to understand the logic i understand there are people who are so motivated by anger toward others that they are resentful that other people might find some happiness and they consider it their mission in life to interfere with the happiness of others solely for that purpose but to argue that this somehow undermines their families has no logical basis the only thing i can think of is that they were very impressed at an early age by the v8 commercial you remember the v8 commercial you remember the commercial where the guy is drinking a tomato juice drinking stringbean juice and he is drinking whatever else and then someone gives him a v4 and he says by god i could have had a v8 apiparently the analogs are happily married heterosexuals all over washington dc indeed all over america and they learned that in washington dc herb and i could register as domestic partners and these happily married people say god i could have married a guy i mean are we really the v8 of america is the attractive power of the way i live my life so great that you fear that happily married couples will somehow dissolve their bonds ignore their children and come knock at our doors that is of course nonsense even by the standards that some of the nonsense purveyors of this place specialize in and it makes it very clear we are not talking about undermining a family no one thinks that the recognition by the district of columbia of the right of two men who love each other or two women who love each other to try to be responsible and share each others lives responsibly that that undermines anybodys family it does not undermine my family or herbs family we coexist very happily with our family but i do not understand the logic what is it about the fact that a couple of people have found happiness that so offends you what is it that drives you to try to make political capital by inflicting misery on other people what is it that says we have a duty to interfere with the lives of others the gentleman from california made a reasonable proposal the gentleman from californias proposal says all right there will not be any federal money and by the way i hope on will tell me under oath that they are doing this tosave money because we are going to have a unitedstates attorney in here making an arrest no one thinks this is about money this is about angei at other peoples way of living with this phony argument that somehow it is going to undermine the family what we are talking about is an amendment by the gentleman from california that says ok no federal money let the district of columbia make its own decisions and what we have is a majority of members apparently that they hope are going to say no the district of columbia cannot recognize that two men or two women might find comfort in each other and might want to share each others lives and we are so offended by that that we are going to ban it we are going to prevent it we are going to forbid it under some pretext and again i would be delighted if someone later in this debate would explain to me how that undermines the family how does it destroy the family if it is not the power of attraction what is it what is it that would take a happy marriage between a man and a woman and as a matter of fact by the way the attractive power of this particular v8 must be extraordinary because no one is talking about anything that meets the benefits of marriage we are not talking about the tax benefits of marriage we are not talking about a whole range of other things married couples can do we are talking about some minimalist situation in which people might be able to grant health benefits together let us be very clear what we are talking about we are talking about a combination of some people whose primary motivati6n is dislike to the point of irrationality of other human beings and who have decided to use the elevated position of a member of the greatest legislative body in the world and the greatest democracy in the worldand i mean to include the senate in that comparisonthese are people who want to use that elevated position simply to make some other peoples lives miserable because they do not approve of their lives that is what we are talking about this is an effort to impose a punishment on other people this is not a case about money and there is not even a rational beginning about how family that has historically been mr frank of massachusetts how we offend families recognized in our society does it undermine other families"], [0.5348799228668213, 0.4651200771331787, 1, "last week one of my heroes and great friends in politics a gentleman by the name of cecil partee who had served as president of the illinois state senate passed away cecil partee had the greatest sense of insight into politics and politicians he used to say to me durbin every time a politician makes a decision there is a good reason and a real reason listen to the speeches here today we have heard a lot of talk about how important an issue crime is for america i think it is one of the most important i am looking up in the gallery here at hundreds of people who have journeyed to our nations capital who have thought at some moment while they were sitting there or dcuring the course of their vacation or trip about a concern they might have about whether they or some member of their family might be a victim of crime in this city or some other city we are all sensitized to it it gets dark outside you get a little worried you worry about your daughter living in the city of chicago and how safe she will be at night it goes on across america not just in washington or chicago but in my hometown of springfield il and in every hometown represented in the gallery so you think to yourself if this problem is so important and the american people are so concerned about it why did congress get so tied in knots over it this seems pretty simple we know what we want we want more cops out there to protect our families people who commit crimes should go to jail and those who commit violent crimes should stay there we have to give the police the resources they need give the prosecutors the resources they need build the prisons if we need them i think most people would also agree we need to try to grab these kids before they turn to drugs before they turn to violence before they turin to gang activity and try just try to put them on the straight and narrow are we going to fail you bet we are but we ought to try because we know the expense of failure the expense of a life of crime not only in the wasted lives of the criminals but what it costs us as taxpayers you know this all seems pretty simple it seems like the abcs of crime and you wonder how did congress get in such a man or woman dressed in the uniform mess the policeman who put the badge on let me go back to my friend cecil this morning and put his life on the partee we have heard a lot of good line to protect me and my family reasons why people oppose this bill when it comes to issues of crime i do the real reason the rule lost a week not care how big a political action ago was over the issue of assault weap committee the gun lobby has i do not onsand over the strength of one major care how many free bumper stickers lobby group the gun lobby here in they give out to intimidate members of washington had the gun lobby in congress i think we have a moral rewashington released their votes and sponsibility to stick with the police to given members of congress a green stick with the deputies to stick with light we would have passed the rule the men and women who put their lives and the crime bill gone home and said on the line i am not an expert on at least we are trying we are listening crime the real experts are the people and we are trying but the gun lobby on the street protecting us and that is put the pressure on and as a con why today i am going to be voting for sequence many members of the house the rule against monique the brewsaid no we cant vote for the rule sterhunter crime bill put together by and that was the end of it so today we the national rifle association and i have another reprise we have another will be voting for the real crime bill it goaround on the same issue guess is a good one it strikes a balance it is what the players are the same the tough but it puts prevention funds in people who come here and say we there too want a strippeddown bill no pork the toughest cops in my district lets get down to basics vote for the when i sit down with them tell me brewsterhunter bill i want to give a what i said earlier tougher sentenclittle insight for those who are trying ing put them in prisons give us the reto follow this program and wonder sources and then they say congresswhat the players are really saying man that isnt enough weve got to the national rifle association and step into the lives of these young peothe gun lobby support the brewster ple before they go wrong and try to hunter bill because it strips out the as help try with the drug rehab try sault weapons ban this is their last with the activities for youth who gasp their last chance they are put might go astray that is a balanced apting all the money on the line they proach that is a tough but sensible apmay win it i hope they do not i am proach going to vote against them because after you take a look at that brewster hunter bill it reminds me of what my announcement by the speaker favorite governor in the united states pro tempore ann richards of texas once said about another issue she said you can take the speaker pro tempore mr a hog you can put lipstick on it and fields of louisiana the chair recall it monique but its still a pig minds persons in the gallery again that when you take a look at the brewster they are visitors of the house and any hunter bill you can call it whatever manifestations showing approval or you want streamlined no pork get se disapproval of the proceedings on the rious and so forth it i s the national floor are contrary to house rules rifle associations bill removing the assault weapons ban it is monique and we all know it support the crime bill so i hope when this is all over that the speaker pro tempore under a we not only do the right thing on crime previous order of the house the genbut that we also say to the gun lobby tleman from connecticut what has happened to you folks is recognized for 5 minutes there was a time in the history of the mr shays i have met national rifle association when they some of the finest men and women i worked as tight as could be with police have ever met anywhere who serves in groups they used to agree they would this house and i say that sometimes to come together to congress and say we people back in my district and they have sportsmen and hunters who are say youve gotto be kidding i love responsible safe people they love being a member of congress i love the their law enforcement people and want opportunity i have to serve the people to work with them and they would of the fourth congressional district come with a program and congress and i truly have incredible respect for would embrace it and there would not my colleagues on both sides of the be any debate but over the years aisle things started to separate the police i know we are very tired i feel in groups started moving in this direction some cases some harsh feelings are exand the gun lobby started moving in pressed because no one likes to be the other i caught in the position where if they this congressman has decided that vote against a crime bill it is viewed when it comes to a problem in my that they are not wanting to be tough neighborhood and my family when i on crime there is that political axiom wpick up the phone and dial 911 i am that says that controversy is the sot lookini for a national rifle asso enemy of the incumbent that somehow a ion iobbyist i am oolking fo that if you stir things up you get people angry on both sides and then you lose out there is no question there is a lot of controversy i know that members who voted for the rule are being criticized i know members who voted against the rule are being criticized i know we went back to our districts and explained why we did what we did and now we are kind of not boxed in but certainly have staked out our position so now we have to explain what we did last week and now what we do this week we all have the same incredible feelings we are getting people speaking to us from both sides on that issue but i am troubled by a number of things we are going to be criticized if people think there is pork in the bill and we are going to be criticized if people think this is a crime bill and we did not vote for it there is just going to be criticism that way but when i look at what happened last week i know that spending went up in the conference report from 2718 to 33 5 billion but it was not because of any increase in prevention funds it was because we went from 3 4 billion to 8 8 billion in putting more cops on the street i have to tell members i represent a district that knows that the best way to deal with crime in my judgment is to deal with law enforcement to have more prisons and also to have preventive programs there were a group of members on both sides of the aisle who tried to see if we could make this bill a better bill i think they have succeeded they brought the bottom line of the spending from 33 billion down to 30 billion they have brought it down below the level of the trust funds it is more responsible fiscally we have cut one third from the enforcement side which is three quarters of the budget they have cut two thirds from the part that is prevention which is one fourth of the budget we have a situation here where my colleagues on my side of the aisle have rightfully asked for changes and democrats have made those changes we have taken 13 of the categorical grants some grants that people have a difficult timewith and we have combined them into one program so people in the districts can decide what program they want the bottom line for me is that i believe this is a bill that has as many republican fingerprints as democraticfingerprints and i know it is a bill that we all have to compromise on i believe in a full life sentence i do not believe in the death penalty but i am not going to vote against a good bill that includes the death penalty i hope in the end when we vote on this bill we simply vote our conscience and go back out to our districts and explain our vote one thing to the democratic side my colleagues on that siftof the aisle had a situation where they could have gone their own way but would have had to take the assault weapons from it and they have worked with the republicans to keep the assault weapon ban in and had to compromise and had to compromise maybe more than they wanted to but i think if my colleagues will look at the bill they will see that it is a better bill with those compromises if members are unhappy with their leadership and what they have done recognize it was an attempt to keep the assault weapon ban in let us face it the vote last week really centered on that whole issue i hope we get out a strong bill which has the preventive side which my district needs particularly the urban areas and i hope we vote out this bill which provides an increase for prisons of 9 9 billion because it is all real money that still has for enforcement 13 4 billion i hope we vote out this bill and do it today"], [0.5343723595142365, 0.46562764048576355, 1, "i thank the gentleman for yielding i rise of course in support of the torricelli substitute first let me extend a word of congratulations to the gentleman from california the gentleman from florida the gentleman from pennsylvania and the gentleman from washington the house has clearly spoken spoken with a very decisive majority on this issue and all of us must respect the majority voice in this house i opposed the dellums substitute not because of what it said but because of what it did not say i do not think that this congress lives up to its constitutional responsibilities when it passes a sense of congress resolution after american combat forces have been introduced into a dangerous situation what we have just done is to pass a sense of congress that calls for reports not very much more we have not approved the policy we have not disapproved the policy we simply default we dodge our responsibility we do not take a position on the gravest question that a government can make whether you commit american forces to combat theamendment that we just adopted is a classical classical congressional dodge it sidesteps the question of authorization we leave no fingerprints by passing that amendment what we have done is protect our political flank but what we have not done is exercise our constitutional responsibility now i believe in the torricelli amendment and may i say that to my amazement to my utter amazement the administration has been working in support of the dellumshastingsmurthadicks provision it has been working in support of a resolution which says mr president tell us what your policy is that is what that resolution says the president has been on television explaining it they have had all of their cabinet people up here telling us what the policy is we passed a resolution a moment ago overwhelmingly saying mr president what is your policy and the president of the united states supports it not only that that resolution says withdraw as soon as possible and many of you support that position and we all understand that is a reasonable position there are several reasonable positions here but it is not the administration policy but the administration supported it and i just do not understand why they can support that amendment the torricellihamilton amendment authorizes the united states presence in haiti it is the only amendment it is the only substitute before us tonight that does it we should share responsibility when american forces go into a combat situation and we should not dodge the question if we are going to play a rough role a good role a difficult role we have to be willing to step up to the plate and we do that by voting for or against an authorization look my friends you cannot have it both ways members cannot complain about no authorization beforehand and then duck responsibility for authorization after the fact and that is what we have done i believe we have a clear choice do the united states troops operating in haiti today operate there solely on the presidents authority or do they operate there with the support and the authorization of the united states congress i believe we should authorize may i say to those of my colleagues who worry about a date of withdrawal that this torricelli substitute has no certain date of withdrawal it provides the amount of time that the military sought it provides useful pressure to make sure that the job gets done in the time frame that they want it and it permits the president a waiver if circumstances require so our troops are fully protected under the torricelli substitute finally let me just say that the torricelli substitute is the only amendment that limits the scope the purpose of our mission under the amendment just adopted there is no limitation there is no restraint there is no restriction the american forces can do anything they want to they can get involved in nation building there is no limitation none if our experience in somalia means anything at all it is that we have got to watch it when we put these military troops into position because we can have mission creep and so the congress has the obligation here to come in and say these forces are not there for nation building they are there not to run haiti they are not there to create democracy for haiti those are the tasks for the haitians themseles not for us we ought to put language of limitation in a resolution of authorization and we do we clearly define the role of congress proposals that have been pre on this floor the pwident cannot the united states troops in haiti to viously voted on have it both ways

and vice president of the united states but hopefully the doors to this college can be closed so that in the next 4 years what will be recorded here will be the popular vote as determining who the president and vice president of the united states will be as opposed to the electoral vote there are several reasons for that first of all those of us who were here had the privilege of being here in the early spring of last year suddenly realized with horror that as bill clinton george bush and ross perot all had about equal numbers of votes in the polls realized with a sense of horror that this election might not be decided routinely as it has been for roughly these last 100 years in the electoral college with a clearcut majority winner but instead might move from the electoral college to the house of representatives there each state would have one vote it is not a case whereby each member of the house all 435 would have individual votes but each state would only have one vote for the president of the united states in this situation mischief abounds the cpportunity for mischief indeed there have been two instances in our nations history where the person getting the lesser number of popular votes has actually become the president of the united states what further compounds this situation is the house really bas no procedures for addressing this situation the last time as i mentioned was about 100 years ago what kind of constitutional crisis would we have been in if this was the first vote that new members and old members cast how in the world would we settle that mess how would we work our way out of that certainly it would have undercut the credibility of the electoral process and perhaps further aggravated a sense of cynism among the electorate so what i have done is propose a very simple amendment not particularly original but i think important for this time and that is that the electoral college be abolished and that the popular vote decide how the president is selected every other election for every other office holder i might add is conducted that way the significance i think can be found here we do a little bit of math very quickly looking at smaller states first west virginia has five electoral votes somebody who votes for the winning candidate in west virginia in effect has five votes that are reported here so my one vote for bill clinton in effect was multiplied by five however one of those who voted for ross perot or george bush in effect was not represented whatsoever so one times zero equals zero and so my colleagues can see how that works there is another calculation that is quite interesting look at california which has 54 electoral votes in that state the person who was fortunate enough to cast a winning vote for the winning candidate that is bill clinton had their vote multiplied here in effect by 54 i cast a winning vote in west virginia but my vote was only multiplied by five and yet somebody who voted for ross perot or george bush had no reflection whatsoever in the electoral vote here one of the arguments that is used against my proposal is that this would cause a presidential candidate to spend less time in states with small populations to be candid with you i did not notice a presidential candidate spending a lot of time in north dakota or west virginia or any number of other states more so because they had electoral votes as opposed to popular votes indeed i sometimes wonder if once the polls in a state establish that a person will probably win that state by 5 percent whether they drop off that state and move to another this keeps people honest in every state because you have to go after every individual vote rather than going after the winnertakeall electoral votes so i think that is another compelling reason it seems to me that we finally have to look at the reason that the electoral college came into existence it was a compromise between those that wanted wide suffrage and those that wanted only landed gentry and read into that white men who owned property to vote of course that is not the situation today furthermore there was also a time when there were no telecommunications no modern communications vote reporting was tough from county seat to county seat even much less from the state or territory to the capital here in washington well of course now we know that is not the situation and you have the vote totals the same night as they are cast surely we have enough trust in ourselves to think that the popular vote is the way to determine the presidency of the united states finally i hope that this is a wakeup call for not only this house but the country this house incidentally in the late 1960s did pass a constitutional amendment abolishing the electoral college i hope this is a wakeup call because i never want to have to go through the possible agony that was going to be faced and that people were looking at last spring with the realization that the first vote cast might be the house of representatives trying to sort out who should be president of the united states with no absolute guarantee that that person who got the most number of states would win and furthermore even that those who voted for another losing candidate would have their votes adequately represented so i think we should take this opportunity to say enough is enough the electoral college has been good for the last 200 and some years but i think that it is time to finally shut the doors on this institution"], [0.5333153605461121,

one time one of these people from the old country robbed a bank he was caught right away but he did not have the money on him and he didnt speak a word of english the police chief got an interpreter sat them both down in the jail and told the interpreter ask this man where the money is the interpreter asked but got no answer the chief took out his gun placed it on the table and said you tell this guy he better answer or hes in big trouble the interpreter asked again but again he got no answer finally the chief picked up the gun pointed it at the bank robbers forehead and said you tell this guy he better talk or hell be sorry the interpreter delivered the message and this time the robber said in polish i confess i stole 100 000 and dropped the money in a dry well behind the bank the moneys there the interpreter thought a minute turned to the chief and said the robber says hes not afraid to die i think of that story a lot every time i think about last years budget battle those of us who supported the presidents budget felt like we had equally reliable interpreters working against us time and time again we were warned that passing the presidents budget would make the sky fallrelease swarms of locusts and bring a plague down on our house we have heard it year after year decade after decade every time our government tries to do something good for people to improve peoples lives and to lift them up our friends on the other side of the aisle say it is socialism big governmenttax and spend let us recall the republican rhetoric we heard during the budget debate of we were told that the budget bill would lead to a jobkilling recession we were told that clearly this is a jobkiller in the short run and that the impact on job creation would be devastating we were told that the budget would mean higher deficits a higher national debt deficits running 350 billion a year more unemployment higher interest rates and higher inflation and one gentleman even said to those of us who voted for the plan this is now your package we will come back here next year and try to help you when this puts the economy in the gutter well guess what next year is here and each and every one of their predictions has fallen flat on its face the truth is that for the first time in 12 years our deficit is going down instead of up for the first time in 8 years investment is going up instead of down and for the first time in 4 years the economy is creating jobs instead of destroying them the budget we passed last year cut 255 billion in spending i it eliminated over 340 separate budget items and it reduced the size of the federal bureaucracyto its lowest point in 30 years last summer the socalled experts were predicting that if we passed the presidents budget this years deficit would be 300 billion well the experts were wrong because we passed the plan this years deficit is projected to be under 180 billiona 40percent drop and if we stick with this plan we will post 3 consecutive years of declining deficits for the first time since harry truman lived in the white house the best news is it is working for the economy right now interest rates are down and homes sales are up inflation is down and auto sales are up unemployment is down and incomes are up and all told our economy has created more jobs in the past year alone than in the 4 years of president bush combined thats a good start and more needs to be done much more needs to be done but it just goes to show thatwhen you make tough choices you get results but now our friends on the other side of the aisle are up to their old tricks they lost the budget battle so now they are bringing the same old scare tactics to the health care debate i now we are being told that guaranteed health insurance is socialism now or later and a dictatorship in health care we are being told that president clinton wants to deliver a monstrous governmentrun bureaucratic nightmare that isnot reform and in response to the presidents state of the union message last month the republican line was that the presidents health plan means more cost less choice more government control and less control for you and your family once again the president is trying to bring positive change to america and once again our friends on the other side of the aisle are using the same old cliches scare tactics and tired rhetoric well we have a saying for this kind of thing in america fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me the american people are not going to be fooled again the republicans were wrong about the budget then and they are wrong about the health care plan now as the majority leader pointed out a few weeks ago it is not the first time in history that theyve been wrong about health care it is not the first time theyve been out of touch let us recall the great debates over social security and medicare back in 1935 republican congressman john taber said social security was insidiously designed to prevent business recovery and to enslave workers republican congressman daniel reed said it was the lash of the dictator that is what he said about social security in 1965 when democrats pushed for medicare republican congressman james utt said it was socialized medicine republican congressman joel broyhill said it would impair the quality of health care retard the advancement of medicine and displace private insurance medicare and as the majority leader pointed out back in the mid1960s a young republican actor said that if medicare passed wed spend our sunset years telling our children and our childrens children what it once was like in america when men were free the actors name was ronald reagan and he was talking about medicare they did not get it then and they dont get it now well the american people get it they want a health system that covers everyone and provides all americans with health insurance that can never be taken away they want a health care system controlled by people who care about our health not just our wallets they want a system that helps seniors and expands medicare and want a health care system for everyone every day always after 50 years of starts and stops that is the plan president clinton has proposed for americadespite what others try to tell you and i give him a lot of credit for putting health care on the agenda the problem is we have a lot of special interests who dont want change who are trying to distort the plan and i think there is a lot of confusion about what the plan will do and what it will mean for the average family over the coming months i have received time on this floor to talk about health care reform to talk about the issues that confront us and to answer some of the questions im receiving from people back home as i have said before i may not be marcus welby i may not even be doogie howser but i think i can give people some idea about how the presidents health care plan might work and how it compares to other plans and it is important to recognize from the beginning that were talking about a moving target here the presidents plan is likely to change in the months to come it has got to go through the committees and through both houses of congress before it comes to a vote this is just the beginning of the process not the end but that is what the democratic process is all abouttaking the good ideas other people have and incorporating them to make a good plan even better in the end we will have a health care plan and a health care system that we can all be proud of that will save money and save lives and that will work for all of us but as we move toward that goal i do get a lot of questions from back home one question i get asked a lot is david why do you support the presidents plan that is a good question right now there are at least six major health care plans before congress six major plans that are very thoughtful plans proposed by very thoughtful people and they all have some good qualities about them but the presidents plan is the only plan that has one essential feature one essential feature that 79 percent of the american people said in a recent poll must be the cornerstone of health care reform one essential feature that four out of every five americans believe must be part of any plan that passes congress and that one essential feature is this the presidents plan is the only plan that provides all americans with guaranteed private health insurance that can never be taken away not if you change jobs not if you lose your job not if you move start a small business or retire no matter what happens you can never lose your coverage and the presidents plan is the only plan that makes that guarantee so you might ask what exactly is the president proposing in a nutshell the president is proposing a twofold solution first to make sure everyone is covered his plan builds upon what works today in the private sector by expanding the employerbased system we have today his plan would require employers to help pay for coverageit would subsidize insurance for small businesses lowwage workers and the jobless and it would set up insurancepurchasing pools called health alliances to make policies cheaper he would require that all people at a minimum be covered by a standard set of benefits as good as the benefits packages offered by most fortune 500 companiesand no matter what happens those benefits can never be taken away second the president would also try to control health costs he would cap the two big government health care programs so thht they grew only about half as fast as inflation and weed out much of the waste fraud abuse and duplication in the system today his plan would also rewrite the rules for the healthcare market to force private insurance companies to compete on how well they can take care of people not how many people they can drop from coverage when they get sick and in case the competition of the free market doesnt do enough to restrain costs the presidents plan would impose strict limits on how fast insurance companies can jack up premiums by far the most common question i get is the most personal how is all this going to affect me here is what that means in english after reform almost all of us will be able to sign up for a health plan where we work just like we do today you will get brochures that give you easytounderstand information on the health plans in your areaincluding an evaluation of the quality of care and a consumer satisfaction survey and you can choose the plan that is best for you and your family if you are selfemployed or unemployed you sign up at the health alliance in your areawhich is made up of consumers and local business owners who bargain with insurance companies for affordable health care for you and your family many people say to me david i have a good plan through my employer now will i be able to keep the plan i have now the answer is yes one of the features we are going to absolutely insist on during health care reform is that people do not lose the good benefitsthey may already have now if your employer is currently paying 100 percent of the cost of your plan he or she can continue to pay 100 percent we are trying to preserve what is right with our system just as much as we are trying to fix what is wrong many of the people back home also want to know will i still be able to choose my own plan and doctor the answer is yes you will always be able to choose your own plan and doctor in fact you will probably have more choices than you have right now under todays system rising health care costs have forced many businesses to limit the health plans for their employees nearly threequarters of small and mediumsized businesses today offer just one planmeaning you are stuck with that plan and the doctors it covers more than half of america does not really have any choice today at all under the health security plan no boss will be able to tell you which doctor to go to or which plan you can join every american will have the choice among a number of high quality plans you can stay with your current doctor join a network of doctors and hospitals or join a health maintenance organization depending on the area you live in you could be offered many choices within those three main areas your doctors can be part of any plan they want to every year you can switch plans and if your doctor switches plans you can move with him another common question is how good is the standard benefits the president is proposing the standard package of benefits the president is proposing for all americans is at least as good as the benefits offered by most fortune 500 companies and you can never lose it in fact the presidents plan is also the only privatebased plan that specifies what benefits are covered the other plans leave that chore to a commission to decide benefits only after the bill is signed into law under the presidents plan you will be covered for hospital care doctors visits emergency and laboratory services substance abuse and mental health treatments and for the first time ever prescription drugs will be covered in todays system your insurance may cover you if you get sickbut it will not pay a penny to keep you healthy in the first place the presidents plan will encourage prevention by paying 100 percent of the cost for regular checkups wellbaby visits mammogram pap smears and other preventive careto keep people healthy in the first place so we can avoid more costly care down the road many people also ask me if premiums and copayments will go up under the new system the answer is no premiums and copayments will be brought under control we are not going through this long painful process of reform just so that people end up paying more money for less care you know how the system works todayyou may have a plan with a 250 premium but if you get sick just once you may see that premium shoot up to 32 500and there is nothing you can do but pay it under the health security plan insurance companies wont be able to charge you more just because youre sick a lot of older americans who are living on fixed incomes write me to ask if theyll be able to stay on medicare the answer is yes under the presidents plan older americans who receive medicare will still be able to receive their medicare benefits exactly as they do today in fact medicare will be made strongerbecause for the first time ever medicare will cover prescription drugs and no senior will ever again have to choose between the food they need to survive and the medicine they need to live it is important to point out that the presidents plan is the only plan that covers prescription drugs and longterm care for seniors under this plan old people will not be made to pay more just to pay for health care for young people and if you decide that you want different coverage older americans will be able to choose among different health plans that may offer fuller benefit packages and lower payments but many people ask me what if someone in my family has a preexisting condition will they be covered the answer is yes under the health security plan it will be illegal to refuse to insure people just because theyve been sick after reform passes nobody can ever be denied coverage again health plans will have to accept peoplehealthy or not they will not be able to charge you more for being sick and most important they cannot cut you off when you reach a lifetime limit because the presidents plan abolishes lifetime limits for good those are just some of the questions i get and those people who tell me it does not matter what plan we enact into law remind me of the old story about the veterinarian and taxidermist who shared the same office their slogan was either way you get your dog back there is a difference between what plan we choose the presidents plan is the only plan that provides to all americans guaranteed private health insurance that can never be taken away it is the only plan that covers prescription drugs and longterm care for seniors and it is the only plan that gua rantees you will never be denied coverage or dropped from coverage again is it a perfect plan of course not some things will change between now and the time the president signs a bill into law and we are going to be working with democrats and republicans over the coming months to make a good plan even better is it complicated of course it is it has to be health care is 14 percent of the gross national product it is a difficult issueand sometimes it seems were dealing with a whole other language but we all have a responsibility to get this system under control and i am going to keep coming to this floor in the days to come and i am going to continue to answer the questions i get from back home because the american people know whats at stake they feel this health care crisis every day they do not need any more interpretations they do not need any more partisan bickering they do not need any more fearmongering or tired old rhetoric what they need is the truth what they deserve is honest answers m arch 1 1994

colleague from new york because i did listen to every word that my colleague uttered this evening there are a number of remarks that the gentleman made that i would like to respond to but time does not permit let me go to the salient issue first let me raise this rhetorical question how many times i would ask my colleagues have we been asked to vote against rules that waive points of brder how many times more times than i can count it sets history on its head it takes me aback it is shocking to me to hear tonight on the floor of this body that the gentleman is asking us to oppose a rule that does not waive all points of order we cannot walk both sides of the street simultaneously unless your legs are pretty wide open and when they are you stand pretty vulnerable the gentleman from new york is my good friend and i respect him he says one person can rise to raise a point of order i do not stand here in the capacity of one person this is not an ego trip this is no personal issue i stand here as the chairperson of the authorizing committee charged with a responsibility it sets history on its head when you argue to sanction violations of a process that the gentleman from new york and i have already marched into the well on numerous occasions to defend that the integrity of the process must be maintained let us come specifically to the carrier let me say something to my colleague we asked for a point of order to be allowed against a 1 billion appropriation against a 4 8 billion weapons system now that is not an accommodation that is real money the bill says appropriation based on authorization first to simply say that is a prima facie case that that is a weapons system that is not authorized second i would say to the gentleman from new york this weapons system was not even requested in fiscal year now to the integrity of the process if authorized the house authorization bill did not authorize it it does not appear anywhere in the companion report of the fiscal year 1994 authorization bill just passed by the house further in the other body the companion bill of the dod authorization for fiscal year 1994 also did not authorize this weapons system their report does not speak to it to the gentleman from new york i would ask this question that he might answer in his time if the bill says appropriate upon authorization and the house authorization bill did not authorize it the senate authorization bill did not authorize it the only way that it can be authorized in fiscal year 1994 is both bodies to report back in a conference report s1 billion out of scope where is the precedent for coming back to a body 1 billion out of scope i would suggest that logic stands on this gentlemans side if you can authorize the bill in fiscal year 1994 and you say you cannot appropriate until you authorize and you cannot authorize until fiscal year 1995 then query why then encumber 31 billion in budget authority to appropriate in fiscal year 1994 saying that it is sitting there waiting so some businessman says well if i can take this money from 1994 sit it there until we authorize on october 1 we can rush to start signing contracts we on the house armed services committee take our jobs very seriously i will say to the gentleman from new york if we have rules here how can we argue to vote down a rule because it waives points of order we ought to maintain the integrity of the authorizing process but then when it comes to defense we say but let us set that aside do you want a kangaroo court here do you want rules that govern different subject matters in different ways then this would be a bizarre experience there has to be some continuity this would be a bizarre experience so there has to be some way you can say yes in the authorizing process you can say no in the appropriation process but you cannot turn that around you cannot say no authorization and yes in the appropriation that is the rules that were set up before i came here so i am not here on some personal trip that is insulting i am not here on some ego trip some turf war that is insulting either this body operates on discipline it operates on principle it operates on integrity or it does not so this is not a personal fight here this is not some oneman show finally i would say in order to get beyond that i met with the democratic caucus of our committee and i said i serve at your pleasure what do you wish to do i am prepared as the chair of the committee to tell you what i think but you act if you want to blink blink if you do not want us to blink then do not blink they said do not blink that is why i am here i ask members to support this rule give us the opportunity to maintain the integrity of the process"], [0.5330957174301147, 0.46690428256988525, 1, "i think the idea that the gentleman from michigan and the gentlewoman from connecticut have is excellent in encouraging all small businesses to view this just as they would when various insurance agents come to tell them about a plan and that is really what is happening i say you have got the nfib which wants to sell you no plan keep it as it is its not working for you but the devil you know is probably better than the devil you dont knowi guess is the best positive spin i can put on it but then also look at the other plans out there the cost of doing nothing the cost of some of the plans that are presented and then particularly the presidents plan and some of the spinoffs that the developing by trying to accommodate the additional concerns of small business i have been amazed at every time i have dealt with a small business person and recently there were several nfib representative membersnot representatives but members of the group in my office from home i find out when we sit down and talk about it that the presidents plan gives them a better deal there is one gentleman i was meeting with last week who expressed great concern about mandates and how he would be affected under the presidents plan i said well give me some information im not looking for proprietary information but tell me a little bit about your business he worked very hard to provide a 6040 cost share on the premium he paid 60 his employees paid 40 of course under the presidents plan he would pay 80 so he would pay more theoretically the employee would pay 20 but yet what he does not have today but what he gets under the presidents plan is a significant significant subsidy and the result is that inwhich he even i think concluded at the end of our discussionhe would get amuch better policy at a lower cost to himself and to his business much less to his employee better policy better cost arrangement for both concerned lower costs and so that is the kind of comparison that needs to take place i am not asking the people to take my representations or my colleagues representations or even he presidents representations at face value certainly do not take those who are saying dont do it mandates interest me now i guess that yes everyone would be required to provide insurance with the assistance that we mentioned of course what is not mentioned is that everyone is required to participate in some form all of us have copayments under the presidents plan all of us have deductibles there is no free lunch everyone pays at least according to their income on a sliding scale and so everyone is in this system is some way and everyone is making a contribution not just the business but if i were a business person a small business person i would too be a little suspicious and say great ive got osha to worry about ive got wage and hour paperwork to do ive got this and that all of these mandates and what am i getting for it i say here you are getting something first of all you are doing what you know you wanted to do anyhow youre trying to provide health insurance for your employees but youre getting it at a much lower cost and getting a much better policy there is a lot of talk about unfunded mandates this one comes with the funds attached to it this one works there is one question i get and i suspect that each of those of us participating tonight gets it is the final fallback is all right wise you say that this is such a great plan but how can you guarantee to me that the cost wont go up in a couple of years after we get it implemented you know how you folks in congress are well let me tell my colleagues what i can guarantee to them right now i can guarantee to you that if you have health insurance if you buy it for your employees your cost is going up without the presidents plan as the gentleman from michigan and the gentlewoman from connecticut have pointed out you are going up 20 to 50 percent automatically every year my father was a health insurance agent and the thing that he dreaded particularly in the late 1970s early 1980s was taking the premium increase around to the businesses that he was serving because they would not believe him they would think that he was gouging and he said that this is what will happen and a lot of business people today confirmed this for me is they will kick me out of their office and they will cancel the policy i am selling them and they will then shop around and find somebody that will sell them the policy cheaper they will sell them cheaper the first year to get in the door the next year the policy cost goes up sharply and they are right back in the same situation again it is funny how many times i tell that story and i can see heads nodding oh yeah thats happened to me twice already in the last 5 years everyone knows that costs are going up sharply in the present system here we have a plan where everybody is in the pool everybody is paying something where the emphasis is on cost containment and where the costs to the business are capped that is the best guarantee i think we can get"], [0.5327698588371277, 0.4672301411628723, 1, "i yield myself the remainder of my time first i have to differ with my friend the gentleman from texas he has been a consistent and principal supporter of deficit reduction when he said the amendment i am offering does not guarantee defense reduction he was right but i must say i think he overspoke when he suggested that it was unrelated to deficit reduction you cannot in the budget resolution repeal statutory caps i concede that what i can do is to do away with budget authority budget authority is what this process cedes to the appropriations committees to make binding future spending commitments when you reduce budget authority by 2 4 billion as this does you take away 2 4 billion in future spending commitments that is why the national taxpayers union and citizens against government waste have endorsed this because it greatly advances the cause of deficit reduction let us now talk about the reductions that have already held several members here eloquently refuted a statement that no one has made no one has suggested that there have not been cuts in defense spending the question is have they been appropriate yes there have been buts in defense spending partly that is because during the early 1980s when we had a commanderinchief named ronald reagan defense spending was bloated beyond that however there has been achange in the reality that the defense department confronts i guess i should have had some charts i would have had one chart which would have talked about reductions in the warsaw pact threat except the chart would have gone down into the first floor ten years ago we were told that one of the major reasons we were spending money in defense was to prevent the eastern europeans behind the soviet union in a land invasion of western europe nato was created for that we were spending tens and tens of billions of dollars to protect western europe against an attack in which the soviet union led the warsaw pact countries to the west there is no soviet union there is no warsaw pact and several of those countries do not exist anymore no agency of the federal government has seen external reality change for the better as much as the defense department yes there are threats in the world but let us not pretend they are new people said well we have these other threats iraq and iran iraq and iran are menacing countries but they are not new what were iraq and iran in 1984 disneyworld there has been a substantial drop in the nature of the threat we face the capacity of the soviet union to damage us in nuclear war has been substantially diminished although not totally abolished and the warsaw pact has completely disappeared the significant threat is gone so of course we have made some reductions it would have been nuts not to the question is have we made enough people say well there is a shortfall in defense no doubt from the standpoint of the people who run that agency there is a shortfall but we have got some other shortfalls we have a shortfall in police protection in this country we have promised and promised and promised again more police protection but you will spend it up when the pentagon says we need it first we have shortfalls in education shortfalls in health research at the nih shortfalls in environmental cleanup shortfalls in health care for people yes there are shortfalls the nature of government in a time of limited resources is to try to do the best you can to deal with shortfalls but there are people here who get scared politically and who will tell you that the one area where we must immunize them against the threat of shortfall is the pentagon where we are talking national defense that is one thing but we are talking more than national defense we are talking about the greatest charity program in the history of the world the one by which the taxpayers of the united states subsidize again and again and again the richest nations in the world in western europe our western european allies spend a small fraction of what we spend as a percentage of national wealth but that isbecaus6 there are people in this body who believe it is somehow the american taxpayers obligation to subsidize france norway belgium germany italy and other countries because subsfdize them we do they will cut their military budgets they will provide greater services for their own people and we will take up the slack for them no one doubts that we are by far the strongest nation in the world with a considerable margin of superiority over everyone else of course we should be the question is whether we will continue when the rest of the world gets richer and when the threat gets smaller to spend disproportionately on defense there are plenty of places in this function that they can find 2 4 billion we have intelligence the intelligence agencies are the only ones who when they screw up say they need more money when they do not do well that is an argument for giving them moremoney we have the burdensharing where we carry western europe we have weapons systems there and is it a coincidence or was there a high correlation between those who came and spoke for the budget and those who have defense money spent in their districts now the defense department like any other department has a missiofi and it also has goodies to hand out it also has people who benefit from it some of my friends on the other side talked again about the jobs we would lose one of the great inconsistencies in this country is that conservatives who tell you thatthe government is a detractor from jobs the government hurts the economy when the government spends it doesnt hurt anythingexcept for defense where defense is concerned suddenly they become harold ickess and harry hopkins defense for them is the wpa defense spending ought to be treated the same as any other yes it has dropped some from the days when it wasway too high but the threat has also dropped if we do this for the defense department today it comes either out of the deficit or out of other

government tax status act pursuant to the regulations in the interest of equity the committee asserts that such tax treatment should be made retroactive to the date of enactment if this is possible the committee asserts that individual members of the catawba tribe should not be taxed on the per capita distributions and supports the tribe in working with the congress to secure such a provision the committee supports the efforts of the tribe to pursue the other tax benefits for which it bargained the committee is aware that if this measure does not pass by october 60 000 individual lawsuits will be filed by the tribe in the state of south carolina some have been critical of the concessions made by the tribe in this matter but it is a settlement which has been negotiated over a period of years by parties who were well aware of the consequences of these concessions tribal sovereignty is something that this committee is committed to preserving protecting and defending part of selfgoverance is making hard choices such as those made in this instance they have compromised in an effort to obtain this settlement this bill is not and should not be a model for future settlements it is not intended to be a precedent for other tribes the bill reflects choices made by the catawba tribe and the state of south carolina in a unique settlement of claims pursuant to a british treaty and the nonintercourse act the committee will respect the choices the tribe has made i urge my colleagues to support this measure"], [7.450580596923828e-06, 0.5000074505805969, 0, "i rise in support of the conference report on h r 4606 the laborhhseducation appropriations bill for fiscal year 1995 i would like to comment on two specific provisions i am pleased to note that the conferees accepted the senate language regarding the federal employees compensation act this language is virtually identical to my bill h r 3491 the feca fraud deterrence act this will provide the department of labor with the authority to eliminate benefits to individuals who have been convicted of defrauding the feca program and will save the federal government millions of dollars feca is a workers compensation law applicable to more than 3 million civilian employees of the federal government the program pays compensation directly to injured employees provides for the payment of medical expenses and pays benefits to dependents of covered workers in cases involving a workrelated death in the past the criminal and administrative sanctions applicable to persons committing fraud against the feca program were very limited in some cases the department of labor lacked the statutory authority to terminate benefitseven when an individual was convicted of defrauding the program a temporary legislative fix in the fiscal year 1994 laborhhseducation appropriations bill enabled the department of labor to pursue a number of cases involving fraudulent claims which would have cost the taxpayers approximately 4 million over the lifetime of the claims the language in h r 4606 will enhance the deterrent value of the federal employees compensation act enable the govemment to punish those who defraud the program the most important save the taxpayers the cost of supporting those who defraud the program i remain opposed however to a provision in h r 4606 which prohibits the department of labor from implementing or administering the davisbacon helper regulations these regulations authorize the use of semiskilled workers working under the direct supervision of higher skilled journeymen to be employed on federal construction projects the helpers duties include such tasks as service work preparation and clean up fetching materials and at times performing part of the journeymans work a helper works closely with a more skilled journeyman and in doing so learns how to perform much of the skilled work in the spring of 1992 after nearly 10 years of litigation with the construction labor unions the department was authorized to begin implementation of the helper regulations soon after the department of labor was prohibited from implementing the regulations through a rider attached to the fiscal year 1994 laborhhseducation appropriations bill at that time the conferees stated that it was to be a onetime ban and that further action should be taken by the appropriate authorizing committee h r 4606 will knowingly waste billions of taxpayer money paying for inflated wages on federal construction projects h r 4606 will also deny thousands of semiskilled entrylevel workers the opportunity to gain the experience they need in order to move into better paying higher skilled construction jobs over 75 percent of all construction work is performed by contractors who use semiskilled helpers threefourths of the construction built in this country is built by nonunion labor using journeymen assisted by helpers are construction standards in the private sector somehow inferior in quality when compared to federal buildings of course not the whole concept of the davisbacon act is that the prevailing wage and the prevailing job classifications in the geographic area of the project should control in federal construction the use of helpers is prevailing in the private sector but the construction trade unions will not allow the use of helpers because a helper who picks up the trade is a threat to a skilled craftsman the construction unions have unsuccessfully fought the helper classification in the courts since 1982 now each year they come to the congress to make sure that the taxpayers continue to pay inflated wages for the construction of federal buildings and public works and each year the appropriations committees are obliged to prohibit the department of labor from implementing the regulations while the unions have again succeeded in this endeavor the real losers are the taxpayers they are the ones who must foot the bill each yearto the

say come down here pay less folks and save yourself a bundle of money and then they come here and tell us that it is goingto create jobs and the arrogance and the duplicitousness of it is an outrage

the vast majority of americans will not want it either and i thank my colleague for his leadership on this i would like to if i could maybe steer this in a more contemporary direction and that is with unitedstates district judge richeys decision today in the district of columbia he acknowledged how monumental naftas impact might be he issued you might recall today an order requiring that an environmental impact statement be prepared before nafta goes forward the evidence he reviewed was enough evidence for him to know that opening up the borders without regard for environmental standards could have a grave consequence for generations to come for those of our colleagues who have visited the maquiladores area the border area they know the tremendous environmental degradation that has already taken place and that will continue if this goes into effect and judge richey concluded that the only sane thing to do was to take a step back from nafta and study the impact before we plunge ahead the pronafta people have tried to railroad this thing in less than 2 years let me put that in some perspective the europeans have spent more than two decades working out their trade agreement for a common european market and their differences do not even come close to the differences in the economies the standards the political structures between the united states and mexico they have spent billions of dollars trying to put this thing together the disparity between the richest and poorest european countries trying to put this together in europe is bout 2 or 3 or 4 to 1 between the united states and mexico it is in the neighborhood of 12 to 1 so judge richey is absolutely right taking a step back is not only the law under the national environmental policy act it is the right

the gentleman from michigan and the ranking member of the committee on education and labor the gentleman from pennsylvania for bring ing this bill to the floor i rise in support of s 1614 the healthy meals for healthy americans act of 1994 this legislation reauthorizes and improves programs in both the national school lunch act and the child nutrition act these programs include the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children the summer food service program the nutrition education and training program the school breakfast startup grant program the authorization of funding for the food service management institute and the nutrition education and training program the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children provides nutritious supplemental food to pregnant and postpartum women infants ard children through age 4 in current law eligible recipients must be at nutritional risk because of inadequate nutrition and inadequate income this legislation improves upon the current program by permitting a pregnant women to participate in the program immediately if she meets the income eligibility standards instead of having to wait on a nutritional risk evaluation a nutritional risk evaluation has to be completed no later than 60 days however the summer food service program for children provides food for children in lowincome areas during the summer months in effect it is an extension of the school lunch program for poor children during the time that school is out of session the committee is concerned that the program is under utilized over 12 million lowincome children receive free and reduced price lunches every day during the school year in 1992 only 1 9 million children ate a meal at a summer food service site this legislation will eliminate the 1year waiting period for private nonprofit organizations that want to operate programs so that more children can be fed during the summermonths the nutrition education and training program provides grants to instruct students on the nutritional value of food and to train school food personnel in improving their management of these programs considering the current emphasis on nutritional requirements and complying with the dietary guidelines extending this program will help students and school food service personnel better understand the value of certain foods this legislation makes permanent the school breakfast startup grant program congress approved a new school breakfast startup program in 1989 the success of the breakfast startup program has convinced the committee that it is an important tool in meeting the committees goal of providing breakfast to children by increasing the number of schools participating in the breakfast program one of the findings in the recent child nutrition committee print reports that the school breakfast program is important for children because breakfast consumption is related to improved academic performance of children i the food service management institute is also reauthorized the institute was established by congress to conduct activities to help improve the quality and operation of child nutrition programs the food service management institute has been in the forefront in conducting research education and training ard provides much needed technical assistance to school food service authorities programs and activities developed by the institute have been accessible to all states each of these programs has been successful in achieving its objectives for example the wig program has been deemed br experts to be one of the most costeffective federalr programs in existence numerous studies show that the wig program is a sound investment of federal funds that saves billions of dollars in health expenditures through preventive intervention included in this legislation is also the authority of the secretary to waive statutory and regulatory requirements the committee believes that federal assistance for child nutritiomn programs should be provided in a way which eliminates unnecessary administrativei burdens paperwork overly prescriptive regliations and permits flexibility in the implementation ofthese programs mr speaker there is nothing more urgent and crucial ih the development and forward movement of our country than to make sure that our young

raise only the ire of republicans who suffer the most at the hands of the partisan rules committee now have raised the dander of conservative democrats who fear that mr moakley and co will try to stifle their amendments to the taxandspend package having gotten too highhanded in trying to control the agenda the house leadership and the president may now suffer a humiliating defeat if enough moderate and conservative democrats join republicans to defeat the rule under which the bill will be considered on the floor mr foley may instruct mr moakley to try to buy off enough democrats to pass the rule by giving them a few amendments to offer but it may be too late for that aside from the fact that the leadership is not ready to give the rebels serious amendments that would directly challenge the presidents tax plans and by tomorrow the house leadership may decide to hold off on the whole package until they can drill their troops and here is the interesting part madam speaker and

the democrats to keep the republicans from getting an honest vote on the alternative of their choice keep that in mind and i will talk about that in a minute the rules committee has told republican leaders that any alternative will have to comply with the budget control and impoundment act of 1974 the act requires that to offset any tax increase cuts must come only from entitlement spending that prevents the gop from trying to get rid of mr clintons tax increases by substituting cuts in discretionary spending in other words the rules committee has told republicans that they can offer a plan different from the presidents but to do it they have to offer cuts in such politically volatile areas as social security and medicare doing away with mohair subsidies and the like is out of bounds and

is around 29 percent but more importantly than that we are next to last among the major industrial nations as to the amount of taxation the average worker pay toward the contribution of government at the federal state and local area now let me address myself to your agriculture question because i think it is very significant in 1850 in this country unlike any other country in the world including the soviet union just before its demise it took one farmer to feed about 10 to 12 people in the united states we took that ratio and needed a great number of farmers but we took the agriculture extension course we took inventiveness and new technology and through our land bank colleges out there the agriculture oolleges of america we dispersed this information to the american farmer to the point now where the american farmer feeds more than 100 citizens ten times as much productivity than the average farmer of the world e3 1410 it is because american government using the private sector to disperse research and development information and new technologies and new methodologies to the people that do the production in this country and we did it very well we actually have lost the need for a great number of farmers in america but i think to make the blanket indictment of the failure of american agricultural policy over a period of 100 to 150 years would be the greatest mistake we could make quite frankly if we can take the experience of dispersing research and development and new technologies in the agricultural field and apply it to increase productivity in the manufacturing and industrial and communications sectors of the united state that is what is going to build jobs and wealth in america it is that very program do we defend or do we need all those government employeest no i suggest our former colleague who is now secretary of agriculture is going about a hard effort to downsize the department of agriculture all i would say on that is as we close some of those field offices if i may and i do not know if there are 1 200 or 12 000 but i hear the same thing in the back rooms of both parties here i hear the complaints of the members it is easy to stand here on the floor and say let us out expenditures let us cut departments let us cut government but then when you get your call from your local agriculture office and your farmer in your district the
