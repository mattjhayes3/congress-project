leadership in organizing this important discussion on the state of black health in america every april we observe national minority health awareness month this year is particularly significant as we mark 30 years since the groundbreaking health and human services task force on black and minority health report this report sparked the first serious discussion in washington on addressing the deep racial health disparities that exist in this country this year also marks 50 years since the creation of medicare and medicaidprograms that have kept and continue to keep americans healthy we are also celebrating the fifth year anniversary of the passage of the affordable care actthe most significant legislation to improve the health of all americans in more than a generation these legislative achievements continue moving us closer to health equity for allhowever major health disparities still exist the zip code in which you are born still determines your likely life expectancy gross disparities exist from zip code to zip codeeven within the same city or county so today i rise to join my colleagues in the congressional black caucus to bring to light the state of black health in america and call for more action to address persistent and lingering disparities in health access treatment and care since the passage of the affordable care act access to care has dramatically expanded in communities of color the uninsured rate has declined 7 3 percent in the african american community and more people have access to affordable quality healthcareall thanks to the affordable care act when we were crafting the affordable care act i had the privilege of serving as chair of the congressional black caucus and let me tell you we worked day and night with our colleagues in the congressional hispanic caucus and congressional asian pacific american caucus to push congress and the administration to craft the best possible bill since its passage the affordable care act has improved the american health care system healthcare is now more affordable and accessible than ever women can no longer be discriminated against because they are a woman have a preexisting conditionsuch as hiv aidsor have been the victim of domestic violence young people can stay on their parents health insurance until they are 26 and people with serious conditions like cancer no longer face the real fear of hitting their lifetime cap and being denied lifesaving treatment the aca also expands the capacity of the healthcare delivery system to better serve those at risk for and living with hiv aids these are the facts the affordable care act has dramatically increased access to preventative care for women lowincome communities and people of color despite rabblerousing and grandstanding from the right this law is saving livesevery day in communities across americafrom maine to my district in the east bay during the last enrollment period 16 4 million americans obtained health insurance and more than half a million came from my home state of california make no mistakethe affordable care act is working african americans and latinos historically underinsured or uninsured groups have seen the greatest declines in their uninsured rates this is especially good news for african americans who are living with hiv where the key to halting the epidemic is access to affordable and quality care with this increase in coverage we are beginning to close the gap in racial and ethnic health disparities and access to care however much work remains to truly realize health equity in america right nowin america the richest and most powerful country in the worldafrican americans still suffer from disproportionately high numbers of preventable deaths disparities in access to quality health care and underrepresentation within the medical community african americans have the highest mortality rate of any racial and ethnic group from cancer furthermore africanamericans are 40 more likely to die from a stroke than whites and 30 more likely to die from heart disease than whites and while african americans are only 13 of the unitedstates population they account for nearly half of all new hiv infections african americans also account for the highest hivrelated deaths and hiv death rates madam speakerthis is unacceptable in an age where technology and innovation are paving the way to new medical breakthroughs these persistent disparities in healthcare cannot be allowed to continue that is why today i urge my colleagues lets work together and commit ourselves to passing legislation that will end racial and ethnic disparities and achieve health equity the affordable care act was a good start but more is needed for years the congressional tricaucus has championed this effort by introducing the health equity and accountability act heaa congresswoman robin kelly will have the honor in introducing this important legislation this congress and i am proud to colead this effort as cochair of the capac health task force this important legislation builds on the affordable care act and puts us on track to eliminate health disparities in our country the health equity and accountability act would address incidences of terminal and chronic diseases that disproportionally affect communities of color including cancer diabetes heart disease and hiv aids so in recognition of national minority health awareness month i urge my colleagues to support this important bill in order to truly achieve health equity for all the state of black health in america is improving but much work remains before us as our drum major for justice dr king told us of all the forms of inequality injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane i urge my colleagues to join us in securing health equity for all"], [0.0015052556991577148, 0.9984947443008423, 1, "first let me thank congresswoman kelly for those very generous remarks but also for your tremendous leadership and for staying the course and making sure that we are here really speaking truth to power each and every week on behalf of the black caucus also to you congressman don payne thank you very much for your leadership and for really rising to the occasion on so many issues in the very short time that you have been here you have hit the ground running and really have made a tremendous difference i want to just speak for a few minutes as it relates to the review of the congressional black caucus for the last year or 2 years i have to just say that our leader mr butterfield has been a very bold and tremendous leader we have accomplished quite a bit and we have a lot more to do while 2015 has been very challenging i believe that the congressional black caucus has really stepped up and made a huge difference not only for the african american community and communities of color but for the entire country it has also been an inspiring year we have seen the birth and growth of the vital black lives matter movement we have also witnessed powerful and moving protests across the country in places like missouri new york and even in my district in oakland and in berkeley california with people of all backgrounds and ages coming together to demand justice to petition their government to exercise their democratic rights i am so proud of the young activists who are standing up and demanding an end to racism and injustice in many of our communities they are truly bringing the civil rights movement into the 21st century i want them to know that they have allies here in the peoples house for too long congress has ignored or brushed aside issues affecting the african american community and other communities of color it is past time that everyone steps up and does the good work that we were sent to washington to do that the congressional black caucus has done for many many decades we need to start by talking about and looking at what has happened with the voting rights act as you know this year marks the 50th anniversary of this landmark legislation the voting rights act was gutted by the supreme court in its shelby v holder decision and of course republican state legislators have fallen all over to restrict voting rights across the country everywhere these dangerous restrictions come in the form of voter id requirements elimination of sameday voter registration and really severe reduction in early voting efforts we must call these efforts for what they are republican attempts to take away one of our most fundamental rights but we will not let this happen i am so proud of the congressional black caucuscongresswoman terri sewell and john lewis and mr clyburn the entire congressional black caucus our bill h r 2867 the voting rights advancement act sponsored by congresswoman sewell who represents selma alabama would restore the preclearance provisions of the voting rights act for any state that has had 15 or more voting rights violations in the last 25 years in the preclearance process as dr king once said give us the ballot and we will fill our legislative halls with menand of course womenwith goodwill we can fill this body with those who really want to see democracy fulfilled so we need our young people to keep up the street heat and demand that congress act it is past time that we get serious about restoring the voting rights act and ensuring that all americansand that means all americanshave free and unobstructed access to the ballot box also the serious economic disparities that persist in the african american community are very very evident according to a report released earlier this year by the joint economic committee led by ranking member congresswoman carolyn maloney and the congressional black caucus we learned and it is very glaring that more than one in three black children are born into poverty and the african american poverty rate is three times that of white americans the cycle of poverty and inequality starts in our school systems where black students account for 42 percent of preschool student expulsions despite accounting for only 18 percent of enrollment now that is preschool expulsion every time i remember this and say this it really makes me very terrified about what is taking place with young black kids especially with young black boys because there is no way anybody no kids should be expelled from preschool that is ages 1 to 4 that is outrageous i am the mother yes of two fabulous great black men and i am the grandmother of two black boys and i find statistics like that very very troubling for african americans we have allowed our school system to be turned into a pipeline to prison we must act now to address systemic issues facing our education and our criminal justice systems i want to applaud congressman bobby scott and congressman conyers because they have worked for decades on criminal justice reform and we are beginning to see some progress as a result of their very diligent work our criminal justice system is broken it needs to be rebuilt from the ground up so alongside of our cbc colleagues once again we are calling for comprehensive criminal justice reform also i want to mention our effort which i cochair with chairman butterfield our tech 2020 initiative silicon valley is right next to my district in california there are great opportunities there for everyone however the tech industry has not been inclusive of hiring and contracting with and working with communities of color especially the african american community so i am very pleased that the tech 2020 of the congressional black caucus has been initiated we are working with our great leader reverend jesse jackson with an insideoutside strategy many of the tech companies understand what is taking place and that they need to be an industry that is inclusive of everyone so the black caucus along with rainbow push along with the tech industry are working on a variety of strategies to make sure that this industry which provides goodpaying jobs and opportunities is an industry that is inclusive that does not discriminate and that includes the diversity of this great country so i have to just say to congresswoman kelly and congressman payne thank you for giving us a chance to talk about so many of the issues that we have been working on when you look at the issue of poverty cutting poverty in half in 10 years we know how to do it we have legislation the half in ten act h r 258 to do that and the pathways out of poverty act h r 2721 we know how to provide opportunities the congressional black caucus once again is leading on all of these fronts it is a big agenda but it is an agenda that makes our country stronger so thank you congresswoman kelly and thank you congressman payne for the chance to be with you tonight"], [0.0016602277755737305, 0.9983397722244263, 1, "i rise today in support of our presidents actions toward

likelihood of mass shootings like san bernadino or new town but also address the systemic divestment of resources education support in communities of color across this country that lead the scourge of gun violence that play out on our innercity streets everyday in addition to the presidents action this congress needs to make it a priority to make adequate investments in early childhood education and other programs aimed at lifting children out of poverty additionally making meaningful reforms to our criminal justice system and increasing resources to reduce the flow of drugs and illegal guns

the families in flint michigan first i want to acknowledge many members of the michigan delegation led by flints representative congressman dan kildee who are fighting every day to bring justice to these families their work is essential to ensuring the people of flint have the resources that they need to recover the situation in flint is nothing short of a tragedy and a tragedy that could have been prevented michigan state officials sacrificed the health and futures of flints children in order to save a few dollars in water costs this really is a shame and a disgrace i have to ask would this have happened in a city where the residents had the advantage of wealth or do these gross breaches of public trust only happen in cities where politicians believe the residents are expendable sadly i think we all know the answer to that question after the incredible harm that has already been done to these families our elected officials are once again turning their backs on the people of flint these families deserve better the people of flint were already hurting before the water crisis the average family income in the city is just 24 834 a year no one can raise a family on that many of these courageous and resilient families struggle to find highquality child care access healthcare services and afford healthy food and now the costs of this crisis are mounting for families the schools and the entire community we can and we must do more for our fellow americans in their time of need two years since this tragedy began families are still relying on bottled water for daily life imagine using bottled water for everything from brushing your teeth to making a bottle for a hungry baby we can do better by these families they need support including health care nutrition specialized education and developmental care and we need to fix the root of the problem the degraded dangerous pipes and infrastructure that caused this tragedy the shortsighted dangerous actions of michigan officials have already caused unimaginable pain for these families we cannot allow congress to betray these families as well let me just say that i was part of a congressional delegation that traveled to flint michigan to listen to the residents regarding the horrendous impact of these government decisions that led to the poisoning of those children and families the environmental injustice in flint is an example of how many lowincome communities of color throughout our country not just in flint throughout the united states an example of how they are treated differently than affluent communities congressman dan kildee and members of the michigan delegation have introduced legislation that would help these families rebuild their lives and get the care they need for their children the families of flint act h r 4479 is a comprehensive plan to address their most urgent needs it would provide for critical investment in flints water system to replace the lead pipes that poisoned these families this legislation would also provide essential support services to the families of flint to help these children mitigate and overcome lead exposure these are simple commonsense measures for the people of flint addressing this tragedy really shouldnt be a partisan issue every member of this chamber should understand the need for urgent action it could happen in any of our communities yet congressional republicans have not held one single vote or even a hearing on this bill that is just simply outrageous and let me just say that flint is not the only public health crisis that congressional republicans have ignored there are 17 000 americansincluding almost 1 600 pregnant womenwho have contracted the zika virus the president submitted an emergency request of 1 9 billion for zika funding more than 6 months ago and the republicans have failed to act on it now if we dont act soon the cdc will be out of money to combat zika in a matter of weeks congressional republicans also failed to do their job on gun violence every day more than 90 million people die from gun violence this too is a public health crisis but congressional republicans once again have refused to take up any commonsense gun legislation even though 91 percent of americans support background checks to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists and criminals it is clear that the american people need congress to do its job the women in florida who cant leave their homes for fear of a mosquito bite need congress to do its job the families who fear gun violence on their block need congress to do its job"], [0.0016868114471435547, 0.9983131885528564, 1, "i thank congresswoman kelly and congressman payne for organizing this special order and for your continued leadership on so many vital issues and for staying the course and holding down the fort for the congressional black caucus it is so important that our message of unity and our messagewhich really describes what many of the issues are that all of our communities are faced withthat that message goes out both of you have really been tremendous in this effort so i rise this evening to join this critical conversation on race relations in america and to challenge our colleagues to work with the congressional black caucus to realize progress for racial justice and equality i join congresswoman kelly and congressman payne in sending my condolences to the families and the victims of the horrific terrorist attacks in paris lebanon nigeria and also in egypt know that we join in this quest for global peace and security throughout the world now tonights special order is an important part of our work to address the discrimination and racism that still plagues our nation specifically as it relates to african americans but we know that it impacts all communities of color it is manifested in many ways and it affects our entire country as congressman payne said so eloquently we are the united states so when one is affected all are affected all across the country at universities like mizzou and yale in places like baltimore and ferguson and in high schools like spring valley high in columbia south carolina we are witnessing the painful impact of institutional racism in our communities very recently we saw this in my home district at berkley high school in one of the most progressive and enlightened cities in the country black students were subjected to threatening messages on campus but i am so proud of the students at berkley they walked offit was not only black students it was all studentsand marched out peacefully through the city to protest these terrible despicable messages this is unacceptable all students have a right to learn free from violence and from threats as long as black students and any student of color feels unsafe in their classrooms our work for justice remains incomplete this crisis isnt limited to our schools tragically people of color face institutional racism from the moment they are born according to a report released earlier this year by the joint economic committee and the congressional black caucus more than one in three black children are born into poverty this cycle of poverty and inequality continues in our school system where black students account for 42 percent of preschool student expulsions mind you now that is preschool that is students from about 2 years old to 4 years old black students account for 42 percent of preschool student expulsions despite accounting for only 18 percent of enrollment i cant figure out how any student aged 2 to 4 is expelled from school that is outrageous yet 42 percent of preschool student expulsions are african american babies these kids dont even get a start let alone a head start outside of the classroom african americans are overpoliced overcriminalized and underemployed a report published by the new york times in april found that there are an estimated 1 5 million black men between the ages of 24 to 54 who are missing from civic life just missing it these missing men who account for one in every six black men have been victims of mass incarceration or premature death and this crisis of inequality extends to the structures of the community and have persisted from generations over the past four decades the average unemployment rate for blacks has been double the rate for white americans for many black families it feels like this is a permanent recession this must be our call to action that is why i am so proud of our young people throughout the country and students who are standing up to racism and injustice in their communities it is time for congress to listen to the young people saying that black lives matter and black students matter earlier this month i held a forum on racial justice in my district to address these issues more than 300 east bay residents from all backgrounds attended and raised their voices for justice this was the second forum that i have held throughout the last 3 months now i have been able to reach over 1 000 east bay residents so tonight in this dialogue which congressman payne and congresswoman kelly have talked about this dialogue leads to action hopefully our colleagues would think about hosting these types of forums and listen to what people are saying listen to what the impact of some of our policies are on their daily lives we must be part of the conversation and the solution but we must listen we must hear the pain and the suffering that people are experiencing as a result of discrimination and racial injustice now the congress must act to start addressing the systemic racism that degrades our institutions and threatens our communities it is past time for us to get serious about us addressing the lack of opportunity for black and minority families in this country right now today in this chamber there is legislation that can start moving the needle forward we need to empower our communities to build greater trust between law enforcement and communities of color and we need to address chronic recidivism which would be a huge step toward returning some of our missing men to their families and communities to do this congress should pass the safe justice act sponsored by congressman sensenbrenner and congressman scott congress should also pass the stop militarizing law enforcement act h r 1232 to stop the militarization of our nations police forces we also should pass the police accountability act h r 1102 and the grand jury reform act h r 429 so we can ensure that deadly force cases are heard by a judge and that there is more accountability for police officers as we reform our broken criminal justice system and work to help repair those families hurt by mass incarceration we will be strengthening america we will have people who really can make a contribution not only to their families and their communities but to the entire country the federal government shouldnt continue to put up barriers to work for those trying to rebuild their lives after making a mistake and should ban the box totally by federal contractors and by federal agencies we also need to repeal the lifetime ban on pell grants for those formerly incarcerated as it relates to drug felonies the ineligibility for public assistance and food stamps we need to remove these barriers so that people of color primarily african american men and latino men can get back into society get a job and take care of their families once again this is an example of public policy that racism wreaks its ugly head in our own institutions and policies finally we must address the poverty that plagues communities of color all across the country we have the whips task force on poverty income inequality and opportunity which i am proud to chair with our whip mr hoyer we are working with more than 100 of our colleagues now to advance policies that give all families including african american families living below the poverty line both in urban communities and in rural communities a fair shot this effort includes our half in ten act h r 258 which calls for a national strategy to cut poverty in half in the next decade that is more than 22 million americans lifted out of poverty into the middle class in just the next 10 years by being strategic and coordinating our existing programs our pathway out of poverty act h r 2721 would create goodpaying jobs it would lift families out of poverty into the middle class while strengthening our safety net for those who are still struggling ultimately the only way to end institutional racism is to give african americans and people of color a seat at the table and we need to pass legislation and policies that begin to remove these barriers my mentor the honorable congresswoman shirley chisholm used to say if they dont give you a seat at the table bring in a folding chair that is what our young people are doing around the country so i want to thank all of the people across our country who are bringing in folding chairs and ensuring that these important conversations happen we hear you we support you and we will keep fighting for you for ensuring liberty and justice for all which means just that it means for all in doing so we will make the united states a stronger country i thank congresswoman kelly and congressman payne for organizing this very important special order

horrific mass shooting that took place on june 12 at the pulse nightclub in orlando florida is a stark reminder of the urgent responsibility that we have to reduce gun violence in this country this monstrous attack on the lgbt community in a place of refuge and empowerment requires us to act the shooter in orlando used an assault rifle that is virtually identical to the ones used by mass killers in san bernardino umpqua community college aurora and sandy hook elementary school that is no coincidence out of the eight highprofile mass shootings that have taken place in the past year seven involved the use of an assault weapon when an assault weapon is used in a mass shooting the number of people shot increases by 153 percent and the number of people killed increases by 63 percent these are weapons of war that are designed to kill as many people as possible as quickly as possible they belong on a battlefield they dont belong in our communities and i will continue to fight to reinstate the assault weapons ban this morning i want to use the time that i have to talk about two proposals that the speaker should bring up for immediate vote no fly no buy and universal background checks this is really really simple if you are too dangerous to fly on an airplane then you are too dangerous to buy a gun but under the laws that we have in place today someone who is on the fbis terrorist watch list who is too dangerous to get on a plane can still walk into any gun store in america pass a background check and walk out with an assault weapon or any other gun he wants in fact from 2004 until 2014 more than 2 000 suspected terrorists bought firearms legally in this country and they are going to continue doing so until we stop them until 9 11 bombs were the weapon of choice for terrorists looking to strike the united states but in the 15 years since then 95 percent of terrorist deaths that took place in the united states resulted from gunfire it is impossibleimpossibleto understand that house republicans have now voted 13 times to block the no fly no buy proposal that congressman peter king and congressman mike thompson introduced to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists in this country why what are they afraid of that we might actually stop a terrorist from passing a background check before he buys an assault rifle at cabelas bring the no fly no buy bill to the floor today lets have an upordown vote let the american people hold us accountable for where we stand this should be a nobrainer more than 80 percent of americans believe we should prevent suspected terrorists from buying a gun and more than 90 percent of americans believe that a background check should be required on every firearm sale so we can keep guns out of the hands of criminals and those with such serious mental illness that possessing a gun would make them a danger to themselves or others bills are pending to fix our background check system and to require a background check on every gun sale this is one of the single most important and effective steps that we can take to reduce gun violence in this country right now anyone can go to a gun show or get on the internet and purchase a gun without a background check as many as two out of every five firearm transactions today are conducted without a background check it is too easy for a criminal a domestic abuser a terrorist or someone with a serious mental illness to buy a gun through this loophole every day background checks block 171 attempted purchases by felons 48 attempted purchases by domestic abusers and 19 attempted purchases by fugitives it is critical that we strengthen the background check system and require checks on all firearm sales so we can keep more dangerous individuals from acquiring these deadly weapons bring the fix gun checks act to the floor today we held a moment of silence last week for the victims in orlando i know that all of us have kept the victims and their loved ones and the people of orlando in our thoughts and prayers since june 12 but the best way to honor the lives lost in this horrific tragedy is to do something to prevent it from happening to others a moment of silence is not enough we need a moment of sustained action in this chamber and we need it today it will be an insult to the victims of this shooting and their families and every victim of every

other product or industry that has so few measures in place to protect our safety and we need to rethink our approach to guns we cant put the interests of gun manufacturers and the gun lobby ahead of the safety of our communities those of us in congress have the power to do something and it is long past time for us to act we can start with measures that have broad support among the american people ninety percent of americans support comprehensive background checks background checks would help reduce the flood of weapons that come into chicago from gun shows and online sales would it stop every shooting of course it wouldnt but would it save some lives absolutely my heart goes out to the families in dallas and orlando and chicago and so many other places that have had the lives of their loved ones stolen away by gun violence and we need to grieve but after that moment of silence we must direct our sadness and our anger into action the problem of violence in communities may seem insurmountable and no single policy will stop every death but we should start by passing commonsense gun legislation supported by the vast majority of the american people we need a vote on legislation to keep guns out of the wrong hands republicans and democrats and gun owners and nra members agree that background checks for every gun purchase and closing the gun show loopholes and all the other loopholes will help so give us a vote my constituents are crying for action lets act not ignore their cries any longer give us a vote"], [0.0017958879470825195, 0.9982041120529175, 1, "today marks 1

residents support these laws we support these protections lgbt folks are our brothers our sisters our friends our neighbors they are our kids teachers coaches and their friends they give back to our community they volunteer at church they serve in public office in congress we should be focusing on legislation to prevent discrimination and prevent hatred our goal should be a country in which all americans in every state can live their lives free from bigotry and harassment and free of the fear of being targeted with guns because of who people are quite simply i cant imagine a worse way for congress to respond to the massacre in orlando than with legislation attacking lgbt americans the american people overwhelmingly believe that discrimination targeting the lgbt community has no place

all know this story many members have heard me talk about it here on the floor of the house before but in short the city of flint had been a struggling community already because of the loss of jobs then the state of michigan just a few years ago cut one of the three essential elements to keep that city runningstate revenue sharingwhich threw the city into a financial crisis the states response appoint a financial manager an emergency manager to take over the city government to suspend democracy and essentially to act in dictatorial form one of the decisions that that emergency manager made was to move the city from using great lakes water as its primary drinking water source to using the flint rivera highly corrosive riverjust to save money and they did save money the corrosion from that water untreated caused lead to leach into the pipes in flint and into the homes of 100 000 people there are consequences to that decision the lives of childrenthe lives of people in flintare permanently affected by that there are 9 000 children under the age of 6 who could potentially bear scars of this poisoning for the rest of their lives and have their development affected lead is a neurotoxin it affects brain development and its impact is permanent but with help people can overcome the effects of this kind of lead exposure the failure by the michigan department of environmental quality and the terrible mistakes made by the emergency manager cannot be undone the effect cant be changed what we can do is make it right for the people of flint we can prevent another exposure the kildeeupton bill which i worked on with my friend from across the aisle mr upton would do that just preventing the next flint isnt enough we have to make it right for the people of flint and provide them justice the families of flint act would do that it would provide immediate relief in making sure that they have clean drinking water it would provide support to get rid of those lead service lines and improve the water distribution system so that this does not happen again importantly the families of flint act would also provide ongoing support for those families in flint and give them the kind of health care they need to overcome the effect of lead exposure in the monitoring of their health especially it would provide for kids who should have every opportunity to overcome the effect of lead exposure by basically providing to those 9 000 children the same thing that any of us would do for our own children if they had a developmental hurdle to overcomeproviding the kind of behavioral support and the kind of enrichment opportunities that many of these kids because they are born into poverty in flint dont have access to this would provide that for them to make sure that

disaster facing the biggest challenge that the community has ever faced it is our duty our job our responsibility to come together to help them the families of flint act would do that by providing federal help that would be required to have state support equal to what the federal government provides basically rather than litigating who is at fault we would fix the problem and realize that the people who live in flint have a right to have their federal government step up for them even if it were primarily the states responsibility for what took place they are citizens of the united states

communications so that local law enforcement is notified when someone attempts to purchase a gun and fails a required background check my colleague congressman mike quigley introduced a commonsense bill to make this fix which i strongly support other important efforts to prevent gun violence include my bill with congresswoman debbie dingell to prevent domestic abusers from being able to purchase

control of their permitting program to ensure protection of their waters in compliance with federal law in their states the scope and structure of these programs of course are determined by the definition of waters of the unitedstates so when the epa comes out with a new definition of waters of the unitedstates every states program would go under review to ensure that it is compliant with that new definition though michigan has had its authority to operate its own permitting program from the 1970s its program has been under review by the epa for several years so in response to the epas review of michigans program michigan passed a bipartisan law in 2013 to improve its staterun program to align with federal law maintaining these current state permitting programsit is interestingis

the new rule second the epa would have a further 10 days to notify a state in writing if its permitting programs are compliant under that new rule and finally if a state is not compliant the epa must allow states 2 years to comply with the new rule before they federalize a states permitting program when a new rule for definition of waters of the unitedstates comes out it will automatically place every states permitting program under review running the risk of ending these successful partnerships i believe and i think others agree we have to maintain the flexibility so that states can comply

states like michigan to work through the legislative process it took michigan over a year in 2013 to come to a conclusion of that reform in practice to be fair the epa has granted broad discretion
