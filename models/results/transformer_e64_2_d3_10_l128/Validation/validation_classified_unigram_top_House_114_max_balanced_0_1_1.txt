vulnerable among us including the unborn and their mothers who are at risk of violence perpetrated by abortion and for his dedication to protecting conscience rights again the subject of todays special order next week the court will hear oral argument on a landmark case for religious liberty the impact of the courts ruling in this case cannot be overstated but the question before the court is really quite simple can the government coerce the little sisters of the poor and other people of faith to violate their conscience the obama administration is telling these religious sisters women who have given their life in service to god by taking care of the elderly poor that their conscience is irrelevant and that they must follow the federal governments conscience rather than their own this abuse of government power is absolutely antithetical to the american principle of freedom of religion and the first amendment unless reversed obamas attack on conscience rights means that government can impose discrimination against americans who seek to live according to their faith the little sisters have 30 homes for the elderly across the united states each little sister takes a vow of obedience to god and of hospitality to care for the aged as if they were christ himself and they wear religious habits as a sign to others of gods presence in the world yet the obama administration is dictating to the little sisters and others about how they should interpret their own religious beliefs that in a word is outrageous the sisters object to having their healthcare plans used to funnel drugs and devices that they have a moral objection to including drugs that could even destroy a young human life the sisters say that facilitating the provision of these items is a violation of their religious beliefs and the government is saying no it isnt we know better than you under the obama administrations coercive mandate the little sisters and other religious organizations like priests for life and geneva college are put in the impossible situation of being forced to violate their religious beliefs or face obamaimposed crippling fines of 100 per day per employee in the case of the little sisters that would mean about 70 million per year this obscene penalty is completely unfair unreasonable and unconscionable the obama administration is saying we will punish you we will hurt you we will stop you from serving unless you provide health care according to the governments conscience not your own president obama has no business imposing his morality on people of faith but that is exactly what this oppressive mandate does lets make no mistake about it this mandate is very much obamas willful intention the imposition of this attack on religious freedom is no accident it comes straight from the pages of obamacare in december of 2009 in the runup to passage of obamacare senator mikulski offered an amendment which provided the authorizing language for this oppressive mandate and some including senator casey rigorously supported senator mikulskis amendment when president obama spoke in 2009 at notre dame universitywhich i would say parenthetically has also filed suit over the mandatehe spoke about drafting a sensible conscience clause yet today protection of conscience is another highly visible broken promise of obamacare the supreme court has a duty to protect the right of the little sisters of the poor and others to live according to their conscience to ensure that they serve the elderly poor according to their conscience again i thank mr rothfus for his leadership"], [0.00173859519418329, 0.00173859519418329, 0, "i thank the gentleman for yielding i rise today in support of the sunshine for regulatory decrees and settlements act of 2015 i want to thank chairman chaffetz and chairman goodlatte for their hard work on this package of bills that will help push the government out of the way of the american people i am especially grateful that the alert act which i introduced earlier this congress is included as title ii of the bill the constituents that i represent in northeast texas work hard every day to provide for their families and to contribute to their communities but i can tell you from countless conversations that they are fed up with a federal government that has been invading every aspect of their lives they are frustrated with unaccountable unelected bureaucrats who create regulations that have the force of law regulations that typically appear out of nowhere and bring with them huge price tags for the cost of compliance often with little time to prepare and implement them in some cases regulators are unforgiving to those who either cant or dont timely comply by imposing criminal penalties now lets pause to think about that bureaucrats hammering otherwise lawabiding americans with criminal penalties for regulatory violations at a time when the same administration is giving a free pass to millions of illegal aliens for breaking immigration laws giving early release to tens of thousands of prisonersviolent criminalsand turning loose radical islamic terrorists from guantanamo it is little wonder that my constituents are outraged and if it were up to this administration the problem would get worse not better to underscore that point we need only look at the federal register where agencies publish their mandates that document contained 82 000 pages last year meaning that this administration averaged more than 224 pages of new regulations every day of the year americans have every right to demand to know what we are doing here in congress to stop them from being crushed by this snowball of regulations part of the answer should be that current law requires an update twice a year on federal regulations being developed by federal agencies but guess what under this administration these updates have either been late or not issued at all and until now there hasnt been a way to hold these unelected bureaucrats accountable my bill does just that this bill forces the executive branch to make the american people aware of regulations that are coming down the track and it prohibits any regulations from going into effect unless and until detailed information on the cost of that regulationits impact on jobs and the legal bases for itis made available to the public for at least 6 months predictably the president and others argue that this bill is too tough on regulators but do you know what i am here to fight for hardworking americans not for unelected washington bureaucrats ensuring that folks arent steamrolled by new regulations should be a nobrainer transparency shouldnt be controversial it shouldnt be optional and it shouldnt be a partisan issue that is why i was honored to introduce the alert act and why i am grateful that it has been included in this bill"], [0.0018065347103402019,

bill addresses the epa is proposing to bring forward more radical regulations that are going to increase the cost of household electricity for every family in this country the estimates show you will see an over 12 percent increase in household electricity rates if the epa is allowed to move forward when you look at what this legislation does at least it stands up and protects hardworking taxpayers who are tired of all of these regulationsone after the othercoming forward not through legislation passed by congressin open public settings like this that you can watch on cspanbut coming forward through unelected bureaucrats at the epa who want to carry out their own agenda they cant pass it through congress so they try to just ram it through in regulations that arent backed up by science but that would in fact actually lead to more jobs being shipped out of this country where would those jobs go mr chairman they would go to places like china and india and brazil and to other countries that dont have the environmental standards that we have you will actually see more carbon emitted if the epa is successful in moving forward with regulations like this that this bill is addressing i want to commend the chairman for bringing this forward i think you are going to see a large bipartisan vote in support of this legislation because people across the country are saying enough is enough if the proposal is so good by the epa why not move it through congress why not have public hearings on cspan and present the facts and point out and defend the increases that families are going to have in their household electricity rates they want to hide they want to hide and try to just sneak this through with the regulation and not have any public vote on the bill here you have

the taxpayers in each state in my state of louisiana this proposal by the epa that we are trying to stop would yield about a 13 percent increase in peoples household electricity rates we are already

we have been working on in our office now for the last month and that is what is really going on in budget numbers we did a budget town hall about 2 weeks ago in scottsdale and i always like to start it with a simple question that says how many of you are tired of seeing us in congress fight with each other and the hands always go up and they say yes you have to stop fighting with each other and i always try to make the point it is about the money you need to understand how bad the underlying financial data is and what is really going on in the scale of debt and deficits and just the sheer scale of spending but also where that spending is going because we have so many of my brothers and sisters here we go out and campaign and say things like we are going to take care of waste and fraud we are going to take care of this and foreign aid we are going to do this and that and they are not providing an honest picture of where the money is and where it actually goes so we are going to do about 10 of these boards i know it is going to get technical when you run for congress one of the first things that happens if you are a numbers guy the pollster and the consultants sit you down and say you cant use big numbers people wont understand them in this presentation i am going to treat everyone like adultsthese arent republican numbers they are not even democrat numbers though the majority of these slides actually do come from the white houseto understand what is actually underlying in the data and how quickly it is eroding two points of reference for decades we used to talk about how we were going to hit this inflection point when baby boomers began moving into retirement and what was going to happen to the debt curve and what was going to happen to the curve of consumption of the entitlements guess what we are now well into that inflection point it has begun and congress has done very very very little in regards to mandatory spending you are going to see on these boards that that is actually what may take us down as a republic so this is 2010 lets just do this as a reference and remember 2010 was a year when there was still lots of stimulus money lots of other spending out there you see the blue the blue is what we refer to as mandatory spending it is primarily social security medicare medicaid some transfer programs interest veterans and the new health care law okay in 2010 about 63 percent of our spending was in that blue area 37 percent was what we call discretionary that is what we get to vote on here because what is in the blue is in formulas i have been here a little over 4 years i have really had absolutely no influence on that blue area it is a formula you hit a certain age you get a certain benefit but i want you to watch what is happening in that entitlement in that mandatory spending and yes this is the very discussion that gets people unelected because people get very upset but we have to have an adult conversation of what is really going on here so we are going to do a couple of these slides just to sort of create a reference here is where we are this year and you remember on that slide i think the blue area was about 63 percent of our total spending this year it is 69 percent of our total spending and obviously then the discretionary what we get to vote on as members has now gone down to 31 percent do you notice the movement and that is just in the last 5 years so where are we going well right now to give you a different way of looking at this this is our 2015 modeling from the white house this green area is our revenues that is the total revenues coming into your federal government that purple area is our debt that is what we are going to borrow this year to make up for our shortfalls though you will be happy to know that as of about 48 hours ago the administration changed the debt number from 576 billion for the 2015 fiscal year tonow it is going to be 582 5 billion this continues to erode we are going to talk about that at the end here what is actually going on in gdp on economic growth in this country and if we do not develop a growthoriented agenda we cant meet our obligations we cannot keep those promises we have made and with that i stand here in shock of how often we engage in these debates and it is not a growthoriented focus so one thing on this slide i really want you to get blue over here is mandatory spending the red is discretionary with defense defense is considered discretionary we have to borrow either every dime of defense or every dime of everything else other than defense and mandatory or discretionarysocial security medicare medicaid interest on the debt veterans benefits and the new health care law we have to borrow either every dime of defense or every dime of discretionary other than defense and that is in this years budget that is how quickly this is moving away from us so what happens if we look way off into the future like 4 years from now 2020 is only 4 years from now when i first got elected in 2011 i did a presentation here the numbers i am going to show you that happen in 4 years were not supposed to happen until 9 years from now this is to give you an idea of how quickly the numbers are eroding yet i hear almost no one talking about it so we are going to be working on that budget in 4 years do you remember that 2010 slide sixtythree percent of our spending went to medicare medicaid social security interest on the debt veterans benefits and the new healthcare law well it is going to be 76 percent76three quarters of all of our spending we are only going to be voting on 24 percent of the budget and half of that will be defense i dont know if anyone knows because these numbers are small and it is hard to watch what we will be spending in 2020 on discretionary so defense and all the litany of programs you think of are basically going to be almost identical to what we were spending 10 years earlier i will hold that up as one of the successes of the republican house we have been very disciplined on spending on what we had the ability to influence which was the discretionary budget but the formulaic portion of our budget entitlements continues to explode it is almost as if washington d c did not know that there was a baby boom did not know people were going to be turning 65 did not know that 76 million of our brothers and sisters were born in about an 18year period of time and now we are into the third year of baby boomers beginning to retire and that inflection has begun so just as a reference because i often get asked for this slideand we are putting these slides up on our web sitethere is the spending pie chart for this year you will see the blue area is all the way to here social security medicare medicaid the transfer programs also including the new healthcare law interest on the debt veterans benefits two weeks ago when we were doing a budget presentation in my hometown of scottsdale phoenix i had one woman who was absolutely positive if we would cut foreign aid we would be just fine here it is important to understand do you see this little red area here foreign aid would be ultimately nothing but a small sliver within that yes it is something but in many ways it is theater if you have a politician standing in front of you and they are not talking about the mandatory spending and the speed of its growth you are not having an honest budget discussion it is hard because in many places around the country when you stand behind a microphone and hold up these boards and start to say that we need to have an honest conversation about the math underlying medicare medicaid social security and what is going to happen on interest on the debt the new healthcare law and its cost projections blowing through the ceiling and veterans benefits often those members who have tried to have that conversation get unelected but if you have someone walk in to our door here and say david we so desperately need new spending on this we often pull out our charts and say you are absolutely right this would be wonderful do you have a solution to help me refine and deal with and manage the explosion of the cost in medicare and they just stare at you like we are not allowed to talk about that but that is what is going on here so lets do another slide to just sort of see how the numbers really are exploding if i came to you and said hey in 4 years that 3 8and it is actually a 3 75 billion budget we are going to have this year so 3 756 trillionsorry not billion trillion so we are going to spend 3 8 trillion this year in 4 years we are going to be spending an additional 1 trillion on top of that an additional trillion and every dime of that is going into mandatory spending it is not going into health research it is not going into new parts it is not going into building a new aircraft carrier and it is not going into all these programs that we all talk about because it is easy politics every dime of that additional trillion dollars in 4 years from now will be in medicare medicaid social security interest on the debt veterans benefits and the new healthcare law how many times have you heard that this is right in front of us this is what is going on your government is growing at an exponential pace but it is not in the area where we as members of congress get to vote because it is in the formula areas the mandatory spending are you starting to see a theme in this discussion and on the slides i am trying to build an understanding out there with both my brothers and sisters here in congress and the public out there that if we are not willing to have honest conversations particularly with this coming presidential election about entitlements mandatory spending and ways we can manage themand it is not cuts but there are much better ways we can deliver these you put all the programs all the promises we have made at risk because just pretending everything is going to be fine means you are basically dooming them to a really ugly future or the country to an ugly future so this gives you an interesting projection now if we go beyond that 2020 slide if we go 9 years out9 years outwe will be running over trilliondollar deficits and that is using the current gdp projections for the future which we are going to talk about that model on the very end slide there is something horribly wrong in how we are modeling our future income growth into this country the math is real i know it is uncomfortable and it is almost sacrilegious to many of the political people here saying well we are not allowed to talk about that david why are you such a downer dont you want to get reelected why arent you doing happy talk i am optimistic about the country i am optimistic about some things happening out there in the economy despite government but you have to understand in 9 years interest will be 1 trillion and think about this it is almost going to be approaching all discretionary at that time in 9 years we will be about 1 4 trillion in interest our best interest projection is over 1 trillion the chart when you go a couple years out we will be spending more money on interest than all of defense all of discretionary all of education all of parts all of health research everything else that is what we are doing we are creating this trap where as we build more and more debt and build more and more debt and build more and more debt that becomes our achilles heal that becomes our fragility in this country so once again remember that earlier slide where i went over there and marked that now this years deficit projection is 582 5 billion and that is coming from the white house as of about 2 days ago we had someone in our office earlier today we were trying to do some modeling if gdp continues to do what we think is happening right now we could be having a discussion this coming october that the 2015 shortfall was almost 600 billion you do realize that is approaching double what the optimistic projections were last year for 2015 there is something horribly wrong out there it is a combination of lack of economic growth and lets be honest the mandatory spending the entitlements are growing faster than the underlying models we have built so this is an interesting slide just to give you the point of talking about inflection it is a fancy word that a lot of the statisticians like to use and we politicians will use it but there it and it has begun we are well into it do you see where those blue lines start to explode but do you notice something interesting the red lines from about here over basically stay substantially flat that is the discretionary spending that is what we get to vote on that is your defense that is everything else other than the mandatory spending but what is exploding through the ceiling it looks like washington d c failed to understand the demographic issues that were heading towards this country and systematically avoided them because i am sure it had nothing to do with my brothers and sisters often caring more about their next election than having to go through the painful process of educating our voters to understand this is your greatest threat i believe to our republic one more slide to put this in perspective the blue line is interest the red line is allallof defense spending do you notice something that in about 7 years 61 2 years we are now spending more money in interest than all of defense all of defense it is 6 years away actually in reality my math is closer to 51 2 but we will use the 6 years think about that we will be spending more money in interest on unitedstates sovereign debt than we are spending on all defense of the nation it is absurd and this is what we are about to hand to our kids as a matter of fact this is no longer about our kids this is about us now the numbers have eroded so fast it is here and the happy talk that we were doing just 1 year ago particularly coming from the administration has not turned out to be true so one of the things that is going on out there can you regulate yourself to prosperity can you tax yourself to prosperity can you in an arrogant fashion have a bureaucracy that is so inept its ability to even when we do bipartisan progrowth pieces of legislation like the jobs actwe all got together here 3 years ago and did the jobs act you do realize there are still substantial portions of that piece of legislation that are still sitting at the sec that still dont have their rules because of the underlying politics behind them they are 3 years beyond their due date but we still dont have them there is something horribly wrong in this government if we dont have an honest discussion and actually then do something about our tax code our regulatory code access to opportunity and then the difficult one the design within our entitlement state which is something the republicans for the last 4 years 5 years have been putting into our budget do you all remember the television commercial of the paul ryan lookalike throwing grandma over the cliff great politics horrible math because the republicans paul ryan and the rest of us stood up and said that we are willing to actually propose a model that saves medicare and deals with this curve that consumes everything in our path it is really bad politics it is honest math and we get the crap kicked out of us for telling the truth so now we get to look at a slide like this we were projecting 3 1 percent gdp for this year as of a few hours ago the atlanta fed which actually does this really interesting modeling of collecting current statistics and constantly adjusting their gdp projections now has us not at 3 1 percent gdp for this yearand remember every point of gdp isit matters what velocity model you useabout 80 billion to 100 billion of revenue so you start to realize that a couple of points of gdp is a big deal the atlanta feds gdp calculation on their web site now is 0 7 percent gdp coming in in this quarter and the indicators look like we are going to get additional downward revisions on the first quarter we are in trouble yes the politicians will get up here and blame each other and blame each other but it doesnt make the math go away the other thing is alsoand this is one of my pet peeves herewe systematically do not tell the truth and this is a republican and democrat problem some of it is because we use really bad modeling data really bad underlying statistics we underestimate the swings during boom times and slowdowns we systematically have blown our gdp calculation but understand that gdp calculation has a lot to do with what we model as our spending has a lot to do with what ends up happening on our debt if you look at this chart the red is what real gdp turned out to be the blue was our projection and systematically we are dramatically under the projection it looks like this year we are crashing and burning i am desperately hoping the third quarter and the fourth quarter get really healthy but there is something horribly wrong out there is this administration are my brothers and sisters on the left finally willing to have that conversation about the tax code about our regulatory state those very things thatlets face itare stymying future growth and our ability to save this country one last slide just to sort of provide an opportunityfor those of you who have an interest in watching some of these numbers and there are those out there who are also sort of numbers geeks this is that gdpnow yes it is often a pessimistic calculator except for the small problem is the last couple of years it has actually been the accurate calculator of actual gdp growth this is right off the gdpnow web site from the atlanta fed showing it looks like now we are all the way down to a 7 percent gdp growth in the second quarter a little bit else on this and then i will stop this thing i am doing which may be bordering on a tirade if you are particularly geeky last week you would have seen the journal of economic perspectives did an entire report on social security calculations there is a handful of folks here with all sorts of letters behind their names mostly ph d talking about social security is actually in worse shape than we tell people that they are close to 1 trillion additional underfunded in the latest projections and that some of the modeling are simple things like we are actually using really bad life expectancy tables now i have incredible respect for the actuaries over at medicare and social security i think they deal with some amazing data sets but some of the nations finest economists and ph d economists are starting to write public articles saying we are in real trouble here remember last year when the mercatus did their detailed projection on unfunded liabilities and debt for the united states they came in with a number that scared me half to death they actually came in with a number of 205 trillion as if you did gaap standard accounting not government accounting standard accounting for the debt of this nation and our unfunded liabilities go on the internet right now and look up what is the wealth of the world some of the best models say the wealth of the world is about 180 trillion we have universities out there modeling that unitedstates sovereign debt and unfunded liabilities are over 200 trillion our unfunded liabilities are greater than the wealth of the world we are better than this this is the greatest issue in front of us and we spend so little time actually having an honest discussion about the math i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0019022314809262753, 0.0019022314809262753, 0, "i reserve a point of order on the gentlemans

the policy of abortion ondemand we are debating specific legislative reactions to horrific wrongs that have come to light the deliberate dismemberment of unborn children to receive compensation for their organs and other body parts and the failure of abortion facilities to care for children born alive during failed abortions even some who support elective abortion agree that those practices are barbaric and must be stopped the horrific reality of these practices in the abortion industry have become clear over the past few months as undercover videos have been released of planned parenthoods leaders and affiliates discussing painstakingly dismembering unborn children for compensation in these days of 3d ultrasounds and highdefinition screens it is impossible to hide the humanity of these child victims they have fingers and toes heartbeats and organs developed enough that tissue collectors will pay 60 a specimen for them in light of the serious questions raised by these videos the house committees on energy and commerce judiciary and oversight and government reform have each launched investigations while planned parenthood does not receive direct federal funding for abortions these investigations are warranted as a recent report from the government accountability office shows that the organization receives an average of 500 million taxpayer dollars each year for other lines of business money is fungible and the federal funds that planned parenthood receives ultimately subsidize their abortion services given the serious allegations that have been raised about planned parenthoods abortion practices related to the procurement and sale of tissue and organs from aborted unborn children it is appropriate for congress to pass h r 3134 the defund planned parenthood act placing a 1year moratorium on all federal funds while congress conducts its investigation no organization that performs divisive practices like abortion particularly in such a gruesome profitable manner should receive taxpayer dollars and this legislation advances that principle in addition the examples of kermit gosnells convictions for murdering children born alive at his house of horrors and separate reports of unborn children may have been born alive or intact prior to being sold to tissue collectors have exposed the need for strengthening the bornalive infants protection act

committee with only two dissenting votes and was passed by the senate by unanimous consent the legislation before us today h r 3504 the bornalive abortion survivors protection act goes one step further to protect these vulnerable lives by requiring healthcare practitioners present at the time of birth to administer professional skill care and diligence to preserve the life and health of the child this small but important step ensures the protection and preservation of precious newborn life by providing for criminal penalties when that life is lost as a result of negligence these tiny

michigan has been hit by a crisis of massive proportion its impact on the longterm health and future success of its residents remains unclear the fact i find most disturbing is that it is a completely manmade crisis it grew out of the same kind of stubborn faith in austerity measures that has handicapped our ability to govern for years it grew out of a failure to protect the flint river from environmental damage it grew out of both a failure to invest in flints crumbling infrastructure and in the willful disregard for the people of that city a city in which more than 40 percent of the residents live below the poverty line and in which the majority of families are african american my colleagues and i are here on the floor this evening to urge every member of this body to understand one thing if we fail to acknowledge the issues that led to the flint water crisis we will see similar and equally devastating events in more and more cities across the country we need to recognize that tunnel vision for deficit reduction creates more problems than it solves the emergency manager appointed by governor snyder instituted a plan to run flint like a business in order to bring it back from the brink of death in the process he sought out the least expensive options for basic needs like water in doing so he decided to pull from the corrosive and contaminated flint river without ensuring the treatment protocol necessary to ensure the water was clean we now know that although the flint river is in poor shape a little additional spending could have prevented this crisis instead flint went the bare bones route leaving a generation of residents to suffer the permanent consequences congress has once more been so focused on reducing the deficit that we have lost sight of our responsibility to govern only a few months ago did we finally abandon the absurd policy of sequestration which has hampered the functioning of countless programs over the past several years the benefits of austerity and small government are questionable at best flint has proven that and we would all be wise to remember it unfortunately that is not the only lesson that we can take away from this crisis this congress has made undermining environmental and energy regulations one of its core missions in the first 100 days of the 114th congress it voted on more environmental and energy issues than on any other topic and not a single one was aimed at protecting resources like the flint river from the kind of contamination that allowed its water to corrode lead pipes if reducing the deficit has been the first priority for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle allowing corporations and big businesses to take whatever liberties with our environment they choose has to be a close second under the majority of this house our babies would choke on smog before we limit the amount of pollution a single smokestack can spew out our streams and rivers would poison even the fish swimming in them before we would set restrictions on where these companies can dump their chemical byproducts our forests and farmlands would turn barren before we would question the longterm impact of fracking it took years to turn the flint river into the downright dangerous water source that has caused so many problems but for other rivers lakes or streams there may still be time to repair or prevent the damage that we have done flint should move us to strengthen not weaken our environmental protections there is one more lesson to learn here and it is perhaps the most important the infrastructure in flint like in so many other cities is outdated and no one at the local state or federal level seems willing or capable of making the necessary investments today in our oversight and government reform committee hearing one of the topics of concern was that even if individual homes had replaced their old lead pipes the citys pipes would still have caused a major problem that is a matter of infrastructure at the most basic level in my home state of new jersey we spent more than a decade leading the way in the battle against lead poisoning but with the onset of governor christies administration all these advances have also come to an abrupt halt there there are now 11 cities with levels of lead higher than what has been reported in flint right in my state of new jersey this contamination from lead comes from paint instead of water nonetheless it is a reflection of the reduction and diminution of services and resources to make our environment safe for our communities two of these cities are right in my district still governor christies administration has ignored the problem and thoroughly failed our children by choosing not to fund our states lead abatement fund here at the federal level we can take this even further our failure to invest in transportation and energy infrastructure is building up to a crisis of a different kind a time when our roads our bridges and our power grids begin to fail there are so many lessons we need to learn from flint i have a number of colleagues who are here with me this evening who have raised their voices in support of the people of flint and who i know agree with me that this must be a watershed moment we need to change course to prevent this from happening again and ensure the future of our nation before i turn this over i want to take a moment to add that there are a number of organizations coalitions and other associations that consistently are dedicated to protecting our natural resources they defend the clean water act and they fight for the clean air act i hope to see more of them fighting for flint in the near future i yield to the gentleman from michigan who not only represents the

legislation being brought to the house floor tonight the foreign aid authorization act first passed congress in 1961 if you mention foreign aid to many americans it raises their blood pressure members of our communities often are concerned about foreign aid to other countries because they are just not quite sure where that aid is going and what that aid is accomplishing it is important that we as members of the house of representatives legislatively communicate to america how americas money is being spent in foreign countries it is important that we are accountable and that that money that aid is accountable to the taxpayers it may shock you madam speakermaybe it wontbut congress has never passed a law requiring transparency and accountability of foreign aid i will use a different phrase we have never audited our foreign aid to see if it is working and to see what it is doing so people can see whether it is successful or not the american public is uninformed about how much we spend and why we spend that money a recent publish what you fund study rated half of unitedstates agencies in the poor category when it came to transparency of aid transparency is important because it sheds light on where the money is spent it is a lot harder to steal money if everybody knows where the money went and what it was for the american people have a right to know what we are doing with their money there are a lot of success stories but many americans dont know about them so it is important that we post that information and that the agencies that help in foreign aid assistance post that information on the web so we know who is getting the money and what they are doing with that money transparency will help foreign aid it will make it harder for bad actors to steal that aid it will make those who implement our programs work more vigilantly knowing the information will also be posted online it will educate the american public about all the ways our country is helping other people around the world as i said there are a lot of success stories where people are better off because america is helping them transparency by itself however wont save all of foreign aids problems but without transparency those problems will not be solved we also need to evaluate our foreign aid program so we know what works the key portions of this bill are transparency of the aid and evaluation of the aid evaluate that aid to see if it is working and if it is working may continue to do that aid evaluate aidif it is not working then we cut it off and do something else we have all heard about the boondoggles of foreign aid big infrastructure projects are especially prone to waste and mismanagement that is why it is so critically important that as part of this bill being implemented licensed engineers who know how to do these infrastructure projects are more involved with their expert input and operational skills let me give you some examples of where foreign aid has been mismanaged schools are being built by americans overseas but some of those schools never had a student attend them the special inspector for iraq reconstruction found out that at least 8 billion in american taxpayer dollars was lost to fraud waste and abuse 44 million was spent on a residential camp to house international police trainers the camp included an olympicsized swimming pool the problem is swimming pool and all it was never used the 43 million natural gas station in afghanistan was built by the department of defense when it built the same kind of gas station for 500 000 in pakistan let me explain that again american taxpayers built a 43 million natural gas station besides the enormous outrageous cost nobody ever used the gas station in afghanistan so rigorous evaluations of our foreign aid are important because they can tell us whether or not we are really making a lasting impact we have a long way to go and the state department really doesnt have a system in place to keep track of the dollars spent on evaluation of those projects the state department can only tell how much it plans to spend in the future but as soon as it spends that money on evaluations it has no way of tracking where the money went so the state department cant even tell how many evaluations were even done last year on the aid that we are already spending even in its policy the state department is moving in the wrong direction its new evaluation policy lowers the amount of evaluations that must be done usaid has some troubling signs as well usaid spent less money on evaluations in 2014 than it did in 2013 to solve some of these problems with transparency and with accountability of our foreign aid representative connolly and myself have introduced h r 3766 the foreign aid transparency and accountability act this bill requires the president to issue guidelines requiring tough evaluations and on transparency it codifies what is already being done and increases the amount of information required to be posted online including actual expenditures and evaluations so everyone knows what we are doing and whether it is working or not we need to be reporting on more foreign aid in a more understandable way the american people want to know where their aid is going what it is for and if that aid is effective transparency and accountability for our foreign aid this is a commonsense bill and it doesnt cost any money i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.9952587713487446, 0.004741228651255369, 1, "today i rise to recognize the second

provide real accountability at the department of veterans affairs but as i said at our committee markup when he offered an almost identical amendment this substitute fails to achieve true accountability i am supportive of section 3 of his amendment which would limit administrative leave for all employees to 14 days and i agree with this commonsense policy but i would note that this limitation language is already included in my bill h r 1994 my main concern with the substitute lies within section 2 which would dramatically change the standard and the process set up in my bill of removing va employees the substitute would only give the secretary the authority to remove an employee if they represent a clear and direct threat to public health or safety which is almost an unobtainable if not immeasurable bar to reach this undefined standard would make it almost impossible for the secretary to remove any employee under this new authority thereby ensuring that the current stalemate that exists with the civil service rules would continue unfortunately as i said moments ago maintaining the status quo is not acceptable i would submit that the standard of a clear and direct threat to public health and safety would not apply to those employees involved with many of todays ongoing scandals at the va including the cost overruns of the denver hospital the budget shortfall that we are going to vote to fix later today a 3 billion budget fix the manipulation of data at the philadelphia regional office the allegations of inappropriate use of government purchase cards to the tune of 6 billion the allegations of employees at the los angeles regional office once again inappropriately shredding veterans claim information and the many other egregious actions that continue to come to light at va almost every single day members these are the very type of employees that our constituents and our veterans expect to be held accountable but the standard proposed in this substitute would not give the secretary the authority to provide the accountability we all know that va desperately needs i also have some concerns with the procedures that are laid out in the substitute to actually remove these employees i believe that unlike the procedures that i have laid out in my bill which set definitive timelines to remove someone while maintaining the due process and maintaining appeal rights the procedures laid out in this substitute could allow an employee to be on indefinite suspension for months if not years awaiting a hearing for the secretarys final decision it has been mentioned several times by my colleagues on the other side that passage of h r 1994 would return to a spoils or an atwill employment system nothing could be further from the truth let me compare a spoils or an atwill system to the protections offered in first a spoils system would allow the party in power to hire anyone usually partisan supporters that they want to reward for their political support with a federal job in contrast h r 1994 has no effect on the current hiring process second a spoils or a patronage system makes all employees at will and subject to firing for any or even no reason again that is hardly the case in my bill h r 1994 requires proof in the form of poor performance or misconduct additionally my bill requires the secretary to report the reasons for any such removals to congress within 30 days third in a spoils system a fired employee has no right of appeal in contrast under h r 1994 fired employees still have due process rights including 45 days to appeal their firing to the merit systems protection board fourth in a spoils system there is no such thing as paid administrative leave you are fired gone with no pay under civil service rules a poorperforming employee can be placed on administrative leave for essentially an unlimited time as we have seen with several miscreants identified during our investigations h r 1994 on the other hand would limit the secretarys authority to put someone on paid administrative leave to 14 days at which time the secretary must bring that person back to active duty fifth in a spoils system there are no protections for whistleblowers in an atwill system employees may or may not be covered by whistleblower protection employee discrimination et cetera type laws depending on the type of employer however under h r 1994 employees are protected by both of these types of laws plus the procedures and additional protections created under section 4 of my bill employees cannot be removed without osc approval if an open case exists and employees cannot be removed or demoted if they have an open case under the new process that is laid out in section 4 until the office of accountability review makes a final determination so ultimately not only does this amendment set a standard for removal that is not relevant to a majority of the issues that we see at the department it keeps intact the long and arduous timeline before a final approval is complete this is not fair to veterans to the department or to the employee in question to reemphasize i also have issues with the whistleblower protections that are laid out in this substitute or the lack of protections in this substitute the only mention of whistleblower protections made in this amendment says that a whistleblower may receive backpay if the merit systems protection board ultimately decides they were removed for blowing the whistle not only does this not provide any protections on the front end but it would also strip out all of the whistleblower protections i have included in section 4 of my bill we all know that the secretary has a tall task to restore trust and to rebuild the va we have to give him every tool possible to complete that mission this amendment does not come close to giving him the tool that he needs today so once again i urge members to support change and stand with veterans not the bureaucrats and the special interest groups and the status quo i urge members to oppose the takano substitute i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.9934965372085571, 0.9934965372085571, 0, "told us that the energy

standards restrict consumer choice but if you have shopped for light bulbs lately you know that simply isnt true modern incandescent bulbs compact fluorescent light bulbs and leds of every shape size and color are now available consumers have never had more choice the efficiency standards spurred innovation that dramatically expanded options for consumers critics of the efficiency standards claimed that they would cost consumers money in fact the opposite is true when the standards are in full effect the average american family will save about 100 every year that comes to 13 billion in savings nationwide every year but this rider threatens those savings and that is why consumer groups have consistently opposed this rider here is the reality the 2007 consensus energy efficiency standards for light bulbs were enacted with bipartisan support and continue to receive overwhelming industry support unitedstates manufacturers are already meeting the efficiency standards the effect of the rider is to allow foreign manufacturers to sell old inefficient light bulbs in the united states that violate the efficiency standards that is unfair to domestic manufacturers who have invested millions of dollars in the united states in those plants to make efficient bulbs here that meet the standards why on earth would we want to pass a rider that favors foreign manufacturers who ignore our laws and penalizes unitedstates manufacturers who are following our laws but it even gets worse the rider now poses an additional threat to unitedstates manufacturing the bipartisan 2007 energy bill requires the department of energy to establish updated light bulb efficiency standards by january 1 of next year it also provided that if final updated standards are not issued by then a more stringent standard of 45 lumens per watt automatically takes effect incandescent light bulbs currently cannot meet this backstop standard this rider blocks doe from issuing the required efficiency standards and ensures that the backstop will kick in ironically it is this rider that could effectively ban the incandescent light bulb the burgess rider directly threatens existing light bulb
