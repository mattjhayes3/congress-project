on the budget for giving us this opportunity to face americans and define for them what kind of country we would like to be i had the pleasure of organizing the congressional childrens caucus a group of about 60 members who have committed to promoting children first in the national agenda we look forward to hearing from mrs tipper gore the wife of the vice president on the mdrch 25 1999 issues of mental health services for children keeping that in mind i am very concerned with the budget as proposed by the majority leadership because our children must face the challenges of competing in a global environment and the new millennium we have got to invest in children this budget does not children cannot learn if they are hungry tired and improperly prepared the majoritys budget proposal reduces domestic spending in programs aimed at protecting the interests of children allow me to call the roll a program of which many members of this house have testified that they graduated from head start is being cut 501 million a 10 percent cut the wic program that provides for women infants and children being cut 425 million job corps which has allowed many inner city and rural community youth

in the spirit of hershey and bipartisanism i come to request a budget that protects the social security trust fund for americas citizens i rise to request a budget thact will protect the medicare trust fund we must authorize a budget that will protect the social security trust fund while women tend to collect benefits over a longer period than men because of a greater life expectancy women on average receive lower monthly social security benefits since they have lower earnings and are more likely to be widowed or unmarried in retirement the majoritys budget proposal does not protect women or children or the social security trust fund under this budget proposalprograms directed toward improving the quality of life for women and children are the first programs to be reduced and cut in order to give a tax break to the wealthy the majority is suggesting that their budget proposal will save 100 of the social security surplus but 0 of that money goes to the social security trust fund and 0 goes towards strengthening medicare this simply is not true domestic programs are not a priority in this budget resolution offered by the majority we must authorize a budget that will appropriate financial resources to reduce the average classroom size to promote a learning environment and to modernize public schools educating americas children should be our number one priority our

improvement of the human rights these last couple weeks i am not so sure during the weeks approaching the vote for permanent normal trade relations for the peoples republic of china corporate ceos flocked to the hill to lobby for increase unrestricted trade with china they talk about access to 1 2 billion potential consumers in china what they do not say is that their real interest is in 1 2 billion chinese workers workers whom they pay wage on the level of slave labor these ceos will tell us increase trade with china will allow human rights to improve democracy will flourish with increased free trade as we engage with china but as these ceos speak their companies systematically violate the most fundamental of human and worker rights in the new report made in china the role of unitedstates companies in denying human and worker rights released by charles kernaghan and the national labor committee we see evidence of american corporations exploiting the horrible conditions of human rights in the peoples republic of china companies such as huffy and nike and walmart are contracting with chinese sweatshops to export to the united states often with the assistance of repressive and corrupt local government authorities 1 800 huffy bicycle workers have lost their jobs in ohio as huffy shut down its last three remaining unitedstates plants over the last 17 months in july of 1998 huffy fired 850 workers from its celina ohio plant where workers earned 17 an hour huffy now outsources all of its production to developing nations such as china where laborers are forced to work 15 hours a day 7 days a week and earn an average of 33 cents an hour less than 2 percent of what ohio huffy bicycle workers earned walmart makes its line of kathie lee gifford handbags in china there are a thousand workers at the factory where they put in 14hour shifts 7 days a week 29 or 30 days a month one off day per month the average wage of the factory is 3 cents an hour workers live in factory dormitories housed 16 in a room their id documents have been confiscated they are allowed to leave the factory only for one and a half hours a day for half of all factory workers rent for the dormitory exceeds their wages workers earn nothing at all and in many cases owe the company money these people are indentured servants to kathie lee and to walmart some would simply call it slavery the findings in charles kernaghans report illustrates why democratic countries in the developing world are losing ground to more authoritarian countries in the developing world democratic nations such as india are losing out to more totalitarian governments such as china democratic nations such as taiwan are losing out to more authoritarian governments such as indonesia where people are not free and workers do as their told the share of developing country exports to the unitedstates from democratic nations fell from 53 percent 10 years ago to 35 percent today corporate america wants to do business with countries with docile workforces that earn belowpoverty wages and are not allowed to organize to bargain collectively in manufactured goods developing democracies share of developing country exports fell 21 percent from 56 to 35 percent corporations are relocating their manuficturing bases to more authoritarian regimes from democratic countries where workers do not talk back for fear of being punished western corporations want to invest in countries that have poor environmental standards no worker benefits belowpoverty wages no opportunities to bargain collectively and worse as developing countries make progress toward democracy as they increase worker rights and create regulations to protect the environment the american business community punishes them by pulling its trade and investment from developing democratic countries to totalitarian governments and developing countries decisions about the chinese economy are made by three groups the chinese communist party the peoples liberation army which owns many of the export factories and western investors which of these three want to empower workers does the chinese communist worker want the chinese people to enjoy human rights i do not think so does the peoples liberation army want to close the labor camps i do not think so do western investors want chinese workers to make better wages have more democracy and bargain collectively i do not think so none of these groups has any interest in changing the status quo in china i repeat none of these groups western investors the chinese communist party the peoples liberation army none of these has any interest in changing the current situation in china all three profit too much from the status quo to want to see human rights and labor rights improve in china unitedstates trade law forbids the trade of any products of slave labor forced labor the 1992 bilateral agreement between the unitedstates and china prohibited the trade of goods manufactured by imprisoned workers congress needs to know more about working conditions in chinese factories before we vote on permanent mfn for china american people need to know more about how our major corporations are behaving outside the borders of the united states before we vote on permanent mfn for china based on evidence released into the kernaghan report many of us in the congress call on the department of labor and the department of treasury to conduct an extensive investigation into the working conditions and factories in china which are owned by american corporations or where american corporations contract to manufacture their products before we vote on mfn for china these investigations should reportback its findings and a decision should be made as

in what the republican leadership brought to floor in the form and guise of the commerce justice state appropriations as ranking member of the subcommittee on immigration and claims i am mostly concerned about the latino immigration fairness act lifa the phrase compassionate conservatism has very hollow meaning if you just talk the talk and not walk the walk this lifa proposal is the modern day civil rights issue of our time and just 12 days to election day the republicans are thumbing their noses at immigrants who have contributed to our society and are trying to play by the rules i say not deal to this proposal and i urge a no vote this involves amnesty for immigrants who have paid their dues and have been in this country since 1986 parity for liberians guatemanlans haitains and hondurans and restoring section 245 i which allows immigrants to adjust their illegal status pay a fee and remain in this country with their spouses and children these are reasonable proposals and the republican leadership has a blind eye for fairness for justice and equity the republican proposal to provide relief to only 400 000 immigrants who were unable to take advantage of the 1986 law for those entering the country before 1982 is unacceptable it is unacceptable because it leaves and locks too many people out this is a proposal that is thinly veiled as an open door but it really is a feeble attempt to play up to the hispanic vote during the political season the republican legislation is a piecemeal correction of the flawed implementation of the 1986 legalization program basically those individuals who sought the counsel of a specific lawyer and filed suit with him are protected while countless others are left out of those people who are covered in the flawed proposal less than 40 are expected to prevail if the gop acknowledges that the 1986 law was not implemented correctly they should try to right the wrong entirely not pick some winners and losers based on what law firm they signed up to represent them also it is important to understand that this amnesty program in fact is just a long overdue update in the registry provision of the immigration and nationality act the registry provision gives immigrants who have been here without proper documents an opportunity to adjust to permanent status if they have been here for a long enough time and have nothing in their background that would disqualify them from immigrant status the legislation would just update the cutoff date for registry which is now set at 1972 then there is juan gonzalez who has been working for a construction company in houston texas for more than 13 years recently he lost his job because he was not able to present his employer a renewed employment authorization since then his family is living a nightmare juan and his wife luisa are having problems and close to a divorce they lost their home and rented a 2bedroom apartment unfortunately their children are paying the consequences we also need to remain ever vigilant on nacara parity this would address an injustice in the provisions of the nicaraguan adjustment and central american relief act of 1997 nacara nacara currently provides qualified cubans and nicaraguans an opportunity to become lawful permanent residents of the united states the proposed legislation would extend the same benefits to eligible nationals of guatemala el salvador honduras and haiti the bill that the republicans have brought to the floor has completely left nacara parity out i say no deal and a no vote like nicaraguans and cubans many salvadorans guatemalans hondurans and haitians fled human rights abuses or unstable political and economic conditions in the 1980s and 1990s the united states has a strong foreign policy interest in providing the same treatment to these similarly situated people in addition returning migrants to these countries would place significant demands on their fragile economic and political systems like senator jack reed i have worked very hard to ensure that the 10 000 liberian nationals who have been living in the united states since the mid1980s and have significantly contributed to the american economy are not deported this legislation should also include these liberian nations if the latino immigrant fairness act is not enacted hundreds of thousands of people will be forced to abandon their homes will have to separate from their families and return to countries where they no longer have ties the inclusion of the latino immigrant fairness provisions would evidence our commitment to fair and evenhanded treatment of nations from these countriesand to the strengthening of democracy and economic stability among important neighbors the republican proposal creates a v visa for people waiting in the family backlogs but not all including us citizens this counterproposal treats the family members of some legal permanent residents better than us citizens the gop proposal leaves out us citizens applying for their children over the age of 21 ironically the gop fails to help even united states citizens seeking to reunite with their spouses and children if the spouse of the child fell out of status for six months or more in contrast the latino immigrant fairness act 245 i proposal would cover all people in the pipeline to becoming legal equally i say no deal and a no vote the republicans are failing to correct their flawed legislation of 1997 and 1998 it was the republicans who passed piecemeal programs in 1997 and 1998 for some refugees these flaws failed to correct years of uneven treatment to legitimate refugees from central america haiti and does nothing for liberian nationals it is baffling why today the republicans are now turning their backs on the lifa proposal for long time refugees that have been in the unitedstates for years worked hard and paid their taxes when a few short years ago they advanced these same proposals in conclusion there is not compassion here congress should stop trying to trade some deserving immigrant groups for others and move to help all deserving immigrants willing to play by the rules paytaxes and work hard in the united states

entire hour this evening i wanted to spend some time though talking about hmo reform or managed care reform one of the things that i want to really stress is that there is a major difference between the approach that the democrats have been taking on the issue of hmo reform versus the approach of the republican leadership a lot of times i worry that americans and our constituents think that what we are proposing on both sides of the aisle is essentially the same and that everyone is trying to do something to protect patients rights during this managed care reform debate but i just think it is important to stress the differences i really feel very strongly that the patients bill of rights the democratic bill that has been put forward and is cosponsored by almost every member on the democratic side really protects patients rights whereas the republican leadership bills that have been put forward both in this congress and in the previous congress really do not do an adequate job of protecting patients and too often look towards the interests of the insurance industry instead in the last session of congress in the last 2 years in 1997 and 1998 there was some debate on the issue of hmo reform but the issue was essentially left unfinished in the 105th congress in the last congress on the house side the democrats patients bill of rights was defeated by just five votes when it came to the floor it was considered on the floor as a substitute to the republican leaderships managed care bill which did pass and which in my opinion was really not a good piece of legislation and did not do anything significant to protect patients in fact the republican leadership in the house has reintroduced a bill in this session of congress that is virtually identical to what it moved last year on the senate side the senate republicans in the socalled help committee approved a managed care bill which really in my opinion is a sham reform bill and does not allow patients to sue the insurance companies but does allow the insurance companies and not the doctors and patients to define what is medically necessary what types of procedures what length of stay what kind of operations would be performed and would be acceptable under an individual insurance policy i just wanted to if i could take a little time this evening to talk about why this republican bill that passed the senate the republican leadership bill in the senate really does not do an adequate job of trying to protect patients rights if you look at the bill that passed the senate or that came out of committee i should say in the senate this year it leaves out more than 100 million americans twothirds of those with private health insurance it fails to grant key protections needed by children women persons with disabilities and others with chronic conditions or special health care needs and it allows medical decisions to continue to be made by insurance company executives instead of by health care professionals and patients the main difference that i have tried to point out between the democrats patients bill of rights and the republican leadership bills that have been sponsored in the house or in the senate really come down to two points and that is that the republican bills really leave it up to the insurance companies to decide what kind of treatment you are going to get and with regard to enforcement they do not have adequate enforcement because if you want to appeal a decision about your treatment that you felt that you should have a particular operation you should be able to stay an extra day or so in the hospital if you try that appeal there is really no process whereby you can appeal the decision of the insurance company and be successful and certainly if you suffer damages you cannot sue for those damages under the republican bill what the democrats tried to do on the senate side in committee in the help committee when this republican hmo bill came up they tried a number of times through amendments to improve the republican bill all those democratic amendments were essentially defeated but i wanted to give you a little idea if i could about the kinds of things that the democrats were trying to do to improve what was essentially a bad bill that did not provide adequate protections for patients in hmos the committee republicans in the senate rejected on a 108 party line vote an amendment by senator ted kennedy to extend the scope of the bill to all privately insured americans as i said the republican bill leaves more than 100 million people unprotected because most of its patient protections are narrowly applied to only one type of insurance and that is selffunded employer plans the committee republicans also rejected on the same 108 party line vote senator kennedys amendment on external appeals again as i mentioned before the republican bill does not create a truly independent external review of plan decisions so if you feel that you are not getting covered adequately and you try to appeal there really is no effective external appeal under the committee bill the republican bill the socalled external review is controlled by the hmos and contains loopholes to allow hmos to delay or prevent patients from appealing a bad medical decision by an hmo bureaucrat many hmo decisions could not even be appealed under the republican bill just to give you another idea of some of the examples i talked about the issue of medical necessity and how it is defined the committee republicans in the senate rejected again on a party line vote 108 an amendment offered by senator kennedy to define the term medical necessity and to prohibit hmos from arbitrarily interfering with medical decisions again just to give you an example of how this operates this amendment would have prevented insurers from arbitrarily interfering with the decisions of the treating physician on issues relating to the manner in other words the length of stay in the hospital or the setting inpatient versus outpatient care it would have stopped hmos from overruling doctor and going against accepted and best practices of medicine the committee republicanpassed bill does nothing to protect patients when an insurance company bureaucrat tells them they must have a medical procedure on an outpatient basis or be discharged from the hospital prematurely the republican bill allows hmos to continue to define what is medically necessary giving them the ability to deny promised benefits another example the issue of emergency room care many of my constituents have complained to me that their hmo policy does not allow them to go to the emergency room when they think it is necessary or they have to go to a different hospital that is pretty far away if they want to go to an emergency room they cannot go to the hospital near where they live or where they work well senator murray tried to put in an amendment that again was rejected on a party line vote 108 to strengthen coverage for emergency care under the republican bill it is not clear whether a true prudent layperson standard applies to all of the plans covered prudent layperson says that if the average prudent person would think it was necessary to go to the emergency room then you can go to whatever emergency room is close by and readily available well many insurance policies many hmos do not allow that and so the democrats are saying we want to have that prudent layperson standard put into the hmo reform bill instead what happened is that in this case again the ability to apply that prudent layperson standard was rejected by the committee and what that means is that under the republican bill there still is no guarantee that you can go to the closest emergency room or that even if you go to the emergency room and later the hmo decides well you really should not have gone because it was not really an emergency that they can just deny coverage and say you shouldnt have gone to the emergency room therefore were not going to pay for the emergency room care another example that i think is important is with regard to specialists many of my constituents complain that their hmo reform bill does not provide them with access to specialists that they may need in a given circumstance senators harein and reed had an amendment to this republican bill that again was rejected along party lines that would ensure that patients have access to needed specialists under the republican bill patients could be charged more for outofnetwork specialty care even if the plan is at fault for not having access to appropriate specialists within the plan so if you decide that you want to go to a doctor i will give you an example perhaps you want to go see a pediatrician but as many people know today that for children there are pediatric specialists for different areas of pediatrics under the republican bill if there is nobody that has that specialty and you decide that you want to see that kind of pediatrician for your child then you can go out of the network but you have to pay for it again what we were saying with this democratic amendment is that access to specialty care should be provided outside the hmo if there is no one within the hmo that has that specialty and is part of the network but again that was an amendment that was rejected i will only mention one more effort on the democrats part to try to improve this bad bill if you will and there are many others but i will only mention one other one and that was senator kennedys amendment again rejected on a 108 party line vote with regard to liability the republican bill fails to hold limos accountable when their actions result in injury or death i mentioned this before you cannot sue the republican plan would protect most hmos from liability even when someone becomes disabled or is killed senator kennedys amendment in the democrats patients bill of rights would allow 123 million patients who receive coverage through private employers to hold their hmos and health insurance plans accountable under state laws for their abuses this is one of the loopholes if you will in the current law and that is that if you are not covered by certain state laws and your health insurance comes from your private employer oftentimes you cannot sue we were trying to correct that as well if i could just say that basically what i am trying to point out tonight is that there are major differences here and that when we look at what is happening on the issue of hmo or managed care reform it is obviously important that we have an opportunity in this session of congress to get a vote on this issue one of the criticisms that i have of the republican leadership is that frankly it is now april almost may and they have not even allowed us to have any kind of a vote there has not been any movement in subcommittee in the committee on commerce that i am a member of or in the full committee to bring any kind of hmo or managed care reform to the floor so we need to at least start the movement but when that movement starts and when we do have an opportunity to vote on hmo reform we have to understand that there is a major difference between the patients bill of rights which is being brought forth by the democrats and the republican leadership proposal now you do not have to take my word for it one of the things that i think is important is that we look at some of the commentators and what they are saying about the differences between the democrats and the republicans on this issue but i wanted to read if i could all or some parts of an editorial that appeared in the new york times on saturday april 10 earlier this month that talked about the differences between the democrats and the republicans on the issue of patient rights just about everyone on capitol hill professes interest in producing legislation that protects patients from unfair health insurance practices but the prospect of actually passing meaningful protections as opposed to talking about it is uncertain president clinton tried to whip up support for democratic proposals but the republicans are balking at democratic plans as too burdensome on the managed care industry yet it is the democratic proposals that more fully reflect the recommendations of a presidential advisory commission to improve health plan quality the republican senate bill s 326 sponsored by senator jeffords of vermont is too limited to accomplish that purpose the bill which was approved by the senate help or health education labor and pensions committee on a straight party line vote of 108 contains some consumer protections but it is unacceptable because most of the provisions would apply only to 48 million individuals covered by plans in which large employers act as their own insurers leaving 110 million americans in other plans unprotected the republican bill would grant appeal rights to an additional 75 million privately insured individuals but those rights would be quite restrictive appeals to an external reviewer would be allowed only when an insurer refused to pay for a procedure on the grounds that it was not medically necessary or was experimental critics say this would give health plans power to limit appeals by simply asserting that a denial is not based on medical necessity it would exclude appeals where a plan unilaterally decided that the benefit was not covered under the contract even if medical judgments were involved in that contract interpretation the republican bill does not adequately ensure access to specialty care by allowing a patient to see an outofnetwork specialist if the plan has an insufficient number of specialists available both the senate democratic proposal which has white house support and a bipartisan bill sponsored by senators john chafee joseph lieberman and others would be substantially stronger in allowing external review of coverage disputes and defining medical necessity and in giving enrollees greater rights to take health plans to court the insurance lobby has already embarked on a media blitz to defeat any new regulations as too costly but consumer protections under the democratic plan would increase health plan costs by only 2 8 percent according to congressional budget office estimates made last year health plans should be made to deliver what they promise their enrollees and held accountable when they fail i think that new york times editorial really sums up what i am trying to say tonight which is the fact of the matter is that if the patients bill of rights the democratic patients bill of rights would be substantially stronger in almost every aspect of managed care reform over the republican proposal now i just wanted to briefly mention again the important areas where the patients bill of rights a democratic bill of rights really provides for a very good protection for patients once again and most importantly the democratic patients bill of rights allows doctors and patients rather than insurance company bureaucrats to make medical decisions using the principles of good medicine in addition it would first guarantee access to needed health care specialists the democratic bill provides access to emergency room services when and where the need arises the democratic bill provides continuity of care protections to assure patient care if a patients health care provider is dropped the democrats patients bill of rights gives access to a timely internal and independent external appeals process and the democratic patients bill of rights assures that doctors and patients can openly discuss treatment options and not be gagged because the insurance company says that you cannot talk about something that is not covered the patients bill of rights would also assure that women have direct access to ob gyn and finally and almost as important really as the medical necessity issue is that the democrats patients bill of rights provides an enforcement mechanism that ensures recourse for patients who have been maimed or die as a result of health plan actions i sound very partisan this evening and i do not mean to suggest that there are not republican members on the other side of the aisle that are supportive of the patients bill of rights or the types of protections that i think that are needed in a comprehensive hmo reform bill i know that there are members on the other side that would like to see these types of protections provided under the law but the bottom line is that the republican leadership which is in charge of the house keeps producing legislation or keeps proposing legislation both in the house and in the senate that does not adequately protect patients and i think it is very important that we not only move ahead in this session of congress and quickly on hmo reform but that we move ahead with an hmo reform that adequately protects patients rights that is comprehensive and addresses what i consider the major issue that my constituents and most americans seem to be concerned about at this time"], [0.0004748106002807617,

suffered a great loss with the passing of our former colleague henry b gonzalez last week there is no question that henry b gonzalez in his service on the san antonio city council in the texas state senate and as a member of this body including the pinnacle of being the chair of the house committee on banking housing and urban affairs did more for the people he represented than probably most members who have served in this body but more than that henry was a trail blazer for the hispanic population of texas and the united states and he was a trail blazer and a leader for american consumers as well there is not a piece of legislation dealing with consumer rights financial issues or housing issues that was not greatly influenced or does not bear the mark of henry b gonzalez that occurred over the last 30 years henry b gonzalez was the father of the community reinvestment act he was the father of much of the financial services reform that occurred in the 1980s and 1990s and he clearly was the father of the various laws dealing with public housing and housing assistance that were adopted by this body in the 1970s 1980s and 1990s henry b gonzalez was always true to his word he always rose to the occasion and conquered whatever task was put before him as my colleague from ft worth has mentioned there were some who questioned whether or not he would be able to rise to the occasion as chair of the house committee on banking and there were some who questioned whether or not he would be able to go beyond issues related to consumer rights and community reinvestment and housing issues to deal with the tough intricate issues of financial regulation particularly in the midst of the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and yet henry b gonzalez was the person who was able to show the leadership to drive a force through the middle to pass the firrea and fidicia legislation and pass other legislation which brought this country out of its worst banking crisis since the great depression so i do not think there is any question that henry b gonzalez did what he was asked and served with great distinction for the people of the 20th district of texas and the united states i would just close by saying this i had the honor of serving with henry b gonzalez in two ways one as a member and also as staff and i can remember while in graduate school as a young staffer on the hill long before the conservative opportunity society and members really knew what special orders were about it was henry b gonzalez who came to the floor every day and closed the house and would speak extemporaneously for 60 minutes about whatever issue he happened to be interested in drawing back on his extensive knowledge of history and captivating the audience that was there the new cspan audience that was out there later as a member of the house committee on banking when henry was th8 most senior member with all due respect to the chairman but still the most senior member on the committee and i the most junior member on the committee he brought me along and i will never forget as the chairman of the committee knows this well henry b gonzalez who built his career who has the longest record for a filibuster in the texas state senate fighting the socalled states rights issues and the jim crow laws that at the end of his career it was henry b gonzalez and i who were fighting for states rights and the rights of texas to determine its home equity laws we were not successful that day in the house committee on banking as the chairman will remember but in the end henry prevailed and the issue went back to the state of texas it was a great honor and privilege to serve with henry b gonzalez he will long be remembered not just in the 20th district and not just in texas

security we have medicare as well as housing programs nutrition programs and programs that really protect our lowincome seniors seniors today have less fear of being taken advantage of because of consumer laws and senior abuse laws that protect them but there is one area where we clearly have failed and that is to ensure that prescription drugs are affordable affordable to the people who need them the most our seniors the latest surveys indicate that 86 percent of medicare beneficiaries take prescription drugs and that the elderly in the united states who make up only 12 percent of our population use onethird of the prescription drugs sold in this nation the need for prescription drugs to treat such diseases as arthritis diabetes high blood pressure heart disease is simply a fact of life for seniors or a fact of death a few years ago a survey of seniors reported that 13 percent of older americans had to choose between eating or buying medicine in sonoma and main counties the district i represent the two counties north of the golden gate bridge two individuals that i have come to know roy and ivera cobbs of sebastopol have had to make some very difficult decisions around their prescription drugs what thley decided was she would take her prescription drugs and he would not because they could not afford both that is not the way we are supposed to be treating our seniors also in sonoma and matin county the area agencies on aging and green thumb have told me some other stories they tell me about cases where seniors just do not buy food because they have to have prescription drugs or they take part of their prescription every other day instead of every day or once a day instead of twice a day as prescribed by their doctors because they cannot afford to pay for the whole dosage and for the reason some seniors cannot pay for them keeps our seniors from having the best health care they can this reason i believe is solely on the shoulders of the nations largest drug companies because they engage in discriminatory pricing if you are a favored customer like an hmo like a large insurance company you pay less much less for prescription drugs but if you are an older person on medicare you pay a premium price for your drugs in the district i represent sonoma county seniors pay on the average of 145 percent more for the most commonly used drugs than favored customers pay for the same drugs for one drug they pay 242 percent more than favored customers i know this because i asked the minority staff of the committee on government reform to look into prescription drug pricing in sonoma and matin counties i released the results to that report to my community and its central conclusion can be summed up in the report subtitle drug companies profit at the expense of older americans as members can see by these charts for sonoma county alone the study looked into five commonly used prescription drugs charted their price at local pharmacies and compared those prices to what the federal government pays for the same drugs the federal negotiated price is nearly the same you must know as that charged to favored private customers large insurance companies and hmos senior citizens and other individuals who pay for their own drugs pay more than twice as much for these drugs than do the drug companies most favored customers for some drugs listed in the report the price is even more outrageous synthroid for example a hormone treatment costs sonoma county seniors 1 738 percent more than it cost the manufacturers favored customers by looking at these charts we can see that for medicare patients those who need the cholesterol drug zocor their costs are significantly greater than the favored customers this comes out to 115 for medicare patients and 34 for the favored customers that is 231 percent different the difference is not in price because the hmos the large insurance companies and government buyers are able to negotiate and

budget deficit in american history i consistently voted against irresponsible spending bills and for legislation to balance the budget and bring our fiscal house back to order today were reaping the benefits of our fiscal restraint we are now in our third year of budget surpluses and unprecedented economic progress the united states is enjoying the longest economic expansion in history the lowest poverty rate in twenty years and the lowest unemployment rate since the 1970s whereas in 1992 we suffered under the weight of a 290 billion budget deficit today we are buoyed by a 211 billion surplus and yet it seems that our republican colleagues have forgotten the lessons we learned just eight short years ago and are spending the surpluses as fast as they come in last year the republicans tried to enact their tax cut agenda at a cost of 929 billion over 10 years this sweeping bill failed because it was obvious that such a large package shoved aside all other priorities and put the nations fiscal health in jeopardy this year republicans have devised a more clever political strategy of breaking up their tax agenda allowing them to focus attention on the same attractions of each part of their agenda while obscuring the total cost but the cost is the same so far this year republicans have pushed through tax cuts that would eat up 739 billion of the budget surpluses when you add this to other tax cuts and spending increases they vow to bring up the republicans will have spent 88 billion more than is available once social security and medicare are protected today congress is on its way to invading medicare as well while we are currently in an era of surpluses we must not forget that medicares fiscal future is troubled according to the most recent trustees report part a will begin running cash deficits again by 2010 totaling neariy 7 trillion by 2040 despite these looming deficits the republicans have introduced yet another tax cut that robs the medicare program of roughly 100 billion in dedicated revenues over the next ten years and 464 billion through 2024 the social security benefits tax relief act repeals a portion of the tax on social security benefits thereby eliminating a dedicated source of revenues to the medicare trust fund without this income medicare part a will go into the red again five years earlier than under current law the result will be a significant threat to the viability of the medicare program for future generations and an even greater squeeze on hospitals and other health care providers dependent upon medicare payments h r 4865 purports to replace the lost revenue to the medicare trust fund from the projected onbudget surplus however while the revenue loss to the medicare trust fund is guaranteed the budget surplus exists only in projections and faces many other competing demands furthermore the revenue loss to the medicare trust fund would be permanent while the projected budget surpluses are temporary once the projected surpluses run out the medicare trust fund will be left with a large hole unless a future congress is willing to raise taxes or cut other programs perhaps most egregious like other republican tax cuts h r 4865 only benefits the wealthiest americans the national council of senior citizens calls h r 4865 an irresponsible political gesture to upper income persons which will have severe consequences for the social security system and the solvency of the medicare part a trust fund the massive amount of general revenues that would be consumed by this bill will leave fewer resources extending the solvency of the medicare program and creating a medicare prescription drug benefit the democratic substitute amendment on the other hand provides the same tax relief as the republican bill but offers it to more seniors at about half the cost whereas the republican bill only benefits the wealthiest 20 percent of social security recipients the democratic substitute would provide tax relief to 95 percent of seniors rather than eliminating the tax for all seniors the democratic substitute keeps the tax in place for only the very wealthiestsingles earning more than 80 000 and couples earning more than 100 000 a year the democratic substitute is also more fiscally responsible unlike the republican bill the democratic substitute protects social security and medicare by conditioning the tax cut on a certification from the secretary of the treasury that the onbudget surplus is sufficient to replenish the lost tax revenue thus it cant go into effect in years in which there is not enough of an onbudget surplus to replace lost revenues we are at a historic fork in the road if we continue down the path of irresponsible tax cuts for the wealthy there will be nothing

this house with the actions or should i say the inaction of this body we are more than twothirds of the way through this session and the republicanled congress has had no major accomplishments this is despite the efforts from within their own party and by democrats working together to pass meaningful hmo reform school construction legislation and even a minimum wage bill instead the republican leadership has been playing games with the budget giving tax cuts to the wealthiest 1 percent of the people in this country and their special interest friends blocking meaningful attempts at gun safety legislation and taking money away from class size reduction and new teacher initiatives as a freshman i arrived last january prepared for action and believed that with gop promises of less partisanship that we could all work together to help the american people yet the last 10 months have been partisan and without any intelligible agenda instead the special interests and their whims have dominated leaving the american people out in the cold rather than passing a meaningful tax bill complete with estate tax and marriage penalty changes and modest tax cuts the republican leadership pushed through a tax package thatbenefited only the wealthy and corporate special interests almost 1 trillion to the wealthiest in this country in fact if you are not in the top 1 percent of wage earners the tax cuts would not mean anything to you or very very little now maybe all the constituents in republican districts make that kind of money but the working class people in districts like mine do not why not provide a family of four living in a place like new york city a high cost place like new york city in the bronx in queens in my district earning 40 000 annually some tax relief what is wrong with that well it is probably because they will not be contributing to the republican leaderships political action committee this year or next year what about our patients bill of rights we finally voted today on a motion to go to conference on the bipartisan patients bill of rights it has been 4 weeks since the house passed by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 275 to 151 the norwooddingell bill the senate appointed conferees back on october 15 and yet it is only today november 2 that the house gop leadership is finally bringing up a motion to go to conference as far as i can see this delay strategy by the gop leadership is their attempt to stop the momentum that was obtained by very strong bipartisan vote in favor of the norwooddingell hmo reform bill why are we stopping what members of your party want what the american people overwhelmingly want why are we stopping it we cannot even get on the runway or get off the charts a prescription drug bill to reduce the cost of prescription drugs to our senior population let me tell you a story that i heard recently i received a letter from two constituents mr and mrs done and gertrude schwartz of long island city in queens he is 89 and she is 84 years of age recently he went to have a prescription filled for his wife he bought 100 tablets of prilosec an extremely popular drug among our seniors it cost him 394 89 394 for 100 tablets of a vitally needed prescription people are making life and death decisions as to whether they will pay the rent buy needed groceries or skip a day of taking a needed prescription drug or simply not buying the prescription drug at all and we are here in congress doing nothing as far as i can see to help them then there is the budget debacle we are 34 days into a new fiscal year and still we do not have a budget what is the republican solution to send the exact same d c appropriations bill that we have seen vetoed twice to the floor again today without removing the riders that caused the vetoes in the first place it makes absolutely no sense to me the republican leadership did not even bring to the floor the laborhhs appropriations bill for a debate they went straight to conference without any democrats represented at all at any point in time but having said all i have said it is education that is most troubling to me we passed ed flex which impacts the elementary and secondary education act before we even considered esea reauthorization then the republican breakup of esea into pieces passing the flawed teacher empowerment act and i want you to know this was not supported by one not one teachers organization we just passed a dramatically underfunded title i bill when crafting tax packages the republican majority will not even consider adding school construction assistance even though our deteriorating school infrastructure and classroom overcrowding is a national crisis then we have social security republicans say they want to save social security well we will just go back to history a little bit here back in 1935 in the early thirties nearly 40 percent of americans were dying in poverty it was a democraticled congress and a democratic president who signed into law the current social security system this despite fierce opposition from the republican party in fact all but one republican in the house voted for a motion to recommit title ii of the bill to conference and would have thereby struck the social security act and killed social security as we know it today only one republican in that entire conference now we are to expect that the republicans are going to protect and save social security something they never wanted in the first place in fact let me just show you some of the comments made by majority leader dic armey when he ran for congress proposing to abolish the social security system ultraconservative economics professor dick armey who has based his campaign on his support for the abolishment of social security the federal minimum wage law the corporate income tax and the federal aid to education that is from united press international october 31 1984 again we see mr armey in 1984 said that social security was a bad retirement and a rotten trick on the american people he continued i think we are going to have to bite the bullet on social security and phase it out over a period of time see that is the republican side of this issue they never wanted it in the first place i do not see how we can expect them to save it the american people do not want this they do not want a partisan congress living up to its donothing billing i urge you to work with the president and the democratic leadership to craft budget bills we can all support i implore you to let the majority rule

the children in kindergarten classes with 60 kids and two teachers tell those children going to school in buildings that arestill burning coal that they do not need to have school modernization

giving the attention to such a complex sensitive and yet important subject that it deserves and also thank the gentleman from colorado for his expertise and for his knowledge of immigration which i think provides a great contribution to those of us here in the house who certainly can benefit from his personal knowledge firsthand knowledge of immigration as it impacts his state of colorado i would like to call the attention of my colleagues to the destructive effect of our current immigration policy it is having a destructive impact on recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens and also how a more enlightened immigration policy would benefit american minorities and in fact the overall american economy each year close to 900 000 legal immigrants enter the united states of these about 300 000 have less than a high school education and their competition forscarce jobs does have a destructive impact on the opportunity of american workers with no more than a high school diploma who are disproportionately and unfortunately recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens among reports of a growing prospering economy are other more troubling reports on a growing gap between the welltodo and the working poor the national unemployment rate is about 4 percent where for those with less than a high school education it is more than twice as high over 8 percent in many cities where there are high recent immigrant populations the unemployment rates are in double digits for those with less education where is opportunity for these individuals and their families numerous polls indicate that black and hispanic americans know this only too well this is no surprise given that they are hurt disproportionately by our immigration policy today we cannot pretend that the adverse impact of mass immigration on minorities does not exist we can and should find solutions to protect the jobs and wages of recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens how often do we read about the longterm unemployed or the working poor or single mothers with no mention of the serious impact of immigration on their employment wages and working conditions how often do we hear comments about the growing gap between the welltodo and the working poor that do not mention that almost half the relative decline in wages of those who do not finish high school is caused in fact by competition from immigration think of a single mother barely surviving in a minimum wage job who sees her annual wages depressed by 2 000 because she must compete with more and more unskilled immigrants she very well might be a recent immigrant herself seeking a better life for herself and her children or she might be able to trace her roots in this country back generations and is simply seeking the american dream that has been denied her ancestors think what she can do for herself and her children with that lost money buy a used car so she does not have to take a bus to work put a down payment on a modest home or even fix the furnace before winter comes worse think what would happen if she actually loses her job because of the neverending competition from new arrivals it is certainly not the immigrants themselves who are to blame and who understandably want to come to america it is our immigration policy that is to blame but who knows how many people have been hurt by the unintended consequences of our outdated immigration policy a series of recent studies have all documented the effects of immigration policy on lowskilled american workers and recent immigrants the national research council of the national academy of sciences concludes that immigration was responsible for about 44 percent of the total decline in relative wages of high school dropouts between 1980 and 1994 the rand corporation reports that in california the widening gap between the number of jobs available for noncollegeeducated workers and the increasing number of new noncollegeeducated immigrants signals growing competition for jobs and hence a further decline in the relative earnings at the low end of the labor market the unitedstates commission on immigration reform chaired by congresswoman barbara jordan finds that immigration of unskilled immigrants comes at a cost to unskilled unitedstates workers the hudson institute states that unitedstates immigration policy serves primarily to increase the number of unitedstates residents who lack even a high school degree america must stop recruiting workers for jobs that do not exist or exist only at the lowest wages the brookings institute published a paper concluding that immigration has had a marked adverse impact on the economic status of the least skilled unitedstates workers the center for immigration studies calculates that immigration may reduce the wages of the average native in a lowskilled occupation by over 1 900 a year cis also found that the poverty rate for persons living in immigrant households of 1997 was 22 percent almost double the 12 percent rate for persons in native households it concluded that reducing the flow of less skilled immigrants who enter each year would have the desirable effect of reducing job competition between more established immigrants and new arrivals for lowwage jobs reducing the supply of this kind of labor would create upward pressure on wages and benefits for the working poor including immigrants already in the country over time this should reduce poverty among immigrants who work these studies reinforce what common sense already tells us in addition add three other facts together first immigrants will account for half of the increase in the workforce in the 1990s second the skilled level of immigrants relative to americans has been declining for years thirtyfive percent of immigrant workers who have arrived since 1990 do not have a high school education compared to only 9 percent of nativeborn workers some 300 000 illegal immigrants without high school educations arrived last year and will total 3 million this decade third close to 90 percent of all future jobs in america will require more than a high school education the mismatch is clear nearly half of all immigrants today are not prepared for the jobs of the future current immigration policy has many americans and recent immigrants competing with hundreds of thousands of newcomers without high school degrees for a fixed number of lowskilled jobs this is a recipe for disaster for millions of bluecollar workers and their families no one should complain about the plight of the working poor or the persistence of minority unemployment or the levels of income inequality in america without acknowledging the unintended consequences of our present immigration policy of course immigration is neither all good nor all bad immigrants benefit america in many ways but we should design our immigration policies so that it enhances rather than diminishes opportunity for american workers we should protect the jobs of working americans and we can make a better life for all americans wherever they were born just as american minorities would benefit from a reduced number of lowskilled immigrants the american economy and american firms trying to prosper in this era of global competition would benefit enormously from an increased flow of more educated immigrants american industry is pleading for more skilled and educated workers the chairman of the national association of manufacturers recently stated that the shortage of skilled employees is not a distant threat anymore the skills gap is now catching up to us and could threaten the amazing growth and productivity gains of the past decade finding an adequate supply of qualified employees is the number one issue for american industry today nam found that 88 percent of manufacturers are experiencing a shortage of qualified workers 60 percent find that current workers lack basic math skills and that 55 percent find serious deficiencies in workers basic writing and comprehension skills these problems can be solved with more educated workers and because immigration accounts for such a high percentage of workforce growth almost onehalf an emphasis on more educated immigrants would be an important part of the solution the result would be a more productive american economy and more productive american businesses as the productivity of the american economy increases so will the prosperity of all americans american citizens and legal residents will benefit in another way from more educated immigrants to borrow a line from a new book by george borjas skilled immigrants earn more pay higher taxes and require fewer social services than less skilled immigrants the national academy of sciences states that over his or her lifetime each immigrant with less than a high school education will cost american taxpayers 89 000 that is the government benefits consumed by each immigrant will exceed taxes they paid by 89 000 to citizens concerned about how we are to rebuild our schools and protect and preserve social security in the next century these numbers should set off alarms more than 300 000 immigrant workers with less than a high school education entering our country this year will require 27 billion more in government services and benefits than they will contribute in taxes that is 27 billion for example that will not be available to rebuild our schools and protect and preserve social security and medicare next year another 300 000plus immigrants will enter the country with less than a high school education over their lifetimes they will claim another 27 billion that could provide education and training to recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens who have less than a high school education and who are disadvantaged in our economy common sense tells us that we should align our immigration policy with the needs of america the economy is crying out for more educated workers and one of the easiest and most costfree ways of providing these workers is through immigration reform doing so would mean more economic opportunity for all americans now i am

man without pretense if another mayor had turned down a state dinner at the white house because of his wifes bowling engagement it would have been a serious breach of etiquette to ralph perk and the city of cleveland it is a badge of honor mayor perk served as mayor from 1972 to 1977 at a time when the city was developing some financial difficulties but ralph perk was able to work with the federal government and the nixon white house to secure funding to alleviate a number of those difficulties he is credited with establishing a regional sewer district and he is also credited with paying off the bonds using city funds to pay off the bonds of the financially strapped cleveland transit authority to create what is now the greater cleveland regional transit authority although it has been more than 20 years since ralph perk served as the mayor of our fair city he has never been nor will he ever be forgotten he was a true cleveland original a man who loved his hometown with all of his heart and served it with great spirit and dedication he will be sorely missed mayor perk was reelected as mayor in both 1973 and 1975 in 1977 there was a nonpartisan primary and he was defeated by two other individuals one was a member who served in this house ed feighan and the other is my very distinguished greater clevelander the gentleman from ohio who then went on to serve as mayor of

no place in a free world social security is a rotten trick and i think we are going to have to bite the bullet on social security and phase it out over time this is the house majority leader dick armey what my friend from north dakota has said is right the majority has never felt good about medicare as my friend has said in 1965 when medicare came into being there really wasnt a need for prescription drugs because prescription drugs were in their infancy and it didnt matter the vast majority of the time whether someone was going to live or die be comfortable or not now how can we the only superpower in the world a nation that is leading the world in research and medical products how can we have a medicare program a program for health care for senior citizens that does not include the prescription drug benefit we cant do that i also say to my friend the reason we are here is this morning a senator came over and gave this presentation and said what my friend from north dakota said sure we want to do something about medicare but i have gotten letters from my constituents saying im against the big government plan this is exactly what we hear on the radio advertisements and the television advertisements that are paid for by the health care industry they want the american people to think that the program the democrats are propounding is a big government plan there could be nothing further from the truth what does this have to do with big government a woman by the name of gail rattigah from henderson nv writes i am a registered nurse who recently cared for an 82yearold woman who tried to commit suicide because she couldnt afford the medications her doctor told her were necessary to prevent a stroke it would be much more cost effective for the government to pay for medications that prevent more serious illnesses and expensive hospitalizations these include but are not limited to blood pressure medications antistroke anticoagulants and cholesterol medications the governments current policy of paying for medications only in the hospital is backward get into health promotion and disease promotion and save money this is a registered nurse from henderson nv i want everyone on the majority side to know they are not going to be able to come over and make these statements as if there is no opposition to it what my friend from tennessee says is wrong he states he has gotten all of these letters saying i am against the big government plan that is because of the radio and tv advertisements from the powerful health insurance industry but the real people are like the 82yearold woman who wanted to commit suicide because she couldnt get medication also i want to spread across this record that my friend from tennessee who came and said we need the republican plan makes the statement that he wants to involve senator breaux in this the majority cant have it both ways they either support the bush plan the plan of the person running for the president of the united states on the republican ticket or they dont support the nominee it appears what my friend from tennessee is doing is trying to have it both ways because the senator from louisiana does not support governor bushs plan the majority realizes that their medicare plan simply can not work because of their nominees 1 6 trillion tax cut proposal senator breaux pointed this out quite clearly today my point is i say to my friend from north dakota people who come here and make statements on the floor need to have substantiation i say the senator from louisiana does not support the bush medicare plan i also say the majority has introduced a proposalso we understand it but it is a medicare prescription drug benefit in name only a new york times writer states all indications are that this plan is a nonstarter insurance companies themselves are very skeptical there havent been many cases in which an industrys own lobbyists tell congress that they dont want a subsidy but this is one of them i take just another minute or two of my friends time the gop plan subsidizes insurance companies not medicare beneficiaries health insurance companies continue to say the republican plan is unworkable the majority tries to give this to the insurance industry but the insurance industry doesnt want it because it wont work charles kahn president of the health insurance association of america has stated we continue to believe the concept of the socalled drugonly private insurance simply would not work in practice i dont know of an insurance company that would offer a drugonly policy like that or even consider it mr president i say to my friend from north dakota we know there needs to be something done about the high cost of prescription drugs no 2 we know there has to be something done with medicare to help senior citizens of this country be able to afford prescription drugs that is all we are saying and we want everyone to know the program put forth by the minority is a program that helps senior citizens it is not something that is means tested but a program that helps all senior citizens not people who make less than 12 000 a year it is a program that is essential it is essential because people as we speak such as gail rattigan who is a registered nurse who wrote to me write that people are considering suicide if they are to take one

under tough constraints on this legislation but this is one item that we really need to tend to here today i am glad to see that we will have the opportunity to do so i have been a strong proponent of va medical research and i offered an amendment during the full committee on appropriations markup that would have increased that account by 23 million i want to take just a minute today to explain why i support increasing the va medical research account and why it is so important for us to find a way of doing so the original request from the va to omb was to fund the research account at 397 million outside supporters of the program believe the program should be funded at 386 million these recommendations are both well above the current bills level of 321 million most of us have heard about the seattle foot that remarkable artificial limb that has been depicted in television commercials by a double amputee playing pickup basketball or by a woman running a 100yard dash it is not obvious that she has two artificial legs until the camera zooms in at the end of the commercial the technology for this prosthesis was developed by va researchers in seattle research at va hospitals is important because it is clinical research mainly the researcher who is almost always affiliated with a neighboring teaching hospital also treats patients veterans the va research program is the only one dedicated solely to finding cures to ailments that affect our veteran population it is not interchangeable with other research efforts at the durham north carolina va which is affiliated with duke university there is a great range of research being done from working to find a cure for aids to finding a shingles vaccine to important advances in brain imaging and telemedicine this work of course assists veterans but it also helps the population at large the va does a great job of leveraging its funds dr jack feussner the director of the va medical research program testified that for every dollar of increase that the program has received over the last 5 years it has received 3 from other sources therefore if we were to add 23 million here today it could translate into 92 million more for research what will these additional funds be used for eleven million dollars is needed just to maintain current services to keep up with medical inflation another 12 million could be used for any number of research projects the va is starting a research oversight program vital to the integrity of the humanbased research programs it could be a model for other federallyassisted research this program needs 1 million to bring the program back to the high water mark of 1998 would take 43 million dr feussner has listed four areas that would benefit particularly from additional research dollars parkinsons disease endstage renal failure diabetes and posttraumatic shock disorder additional research into the treatment and cure for hepatitis c would also be looked at carefully we also need to increase the commitment to training the next generation of clinician and nonclinician investigators to keep that program on track would take an additional 10 million now difficult decisions will need to be made on these upcoming amendments and there are several of them they all offer an offset of some sort most of the offsets i would not support if they stood alone but the overall allocation for our vahud subcommittee is just not sufficient and these difficult tradeoffs must be made i am hopeful that at the end of this process an additional allocation will be available and that we will be able to fund va medical research at close to 386 million and that any offsets that we adopt can largely be restored however it is very important to raise the appropriations level here today

now that is happening every day in our court system now now this amendment provides that the bill would take effect only once the judicial conference of the united states has certified in writing that

courts are asked to take on a new massive workload that this bill would generate there should be no doubt that 1875 will have a dramatic impact on the workload of the federal courts because its very purpose is to transfer to the federal system a large proportion of the classaction cases that are currently handled at the state level the federal courts if the underlying bill should pass will be

the bankruptcy reform act for numerous reasons however the most important reasons include the following first and of preeminent importance to the nations agriculture sector this member supports the provision in h r 833 which permanently extends chapter 12 of the bankruptcy code for family farmers chapter 12 bankruptcy allows family farmers to reorganize their debts as compared to liquidating their assets chapter 12 bankruptcy has been a viable option for family farmers nationwide it has allowed family farmers to reorganize their assets in a manner which balances the interests of creditors and the future success of the involved farmer if chapter 12 bankruptcy provisions are not permanently extended for family farmers this will have a drastic impact on an agricultural sector already reeling from low commodity prices not only will many family farmers have to end their operations but also land values will likely plunge downward such a decrease in land values will affect both the ability of family farmers to earn a living and the manner in which banks making agricultural loans conduct their lending activities this member has received many contacts from his constituents regarding the extension of chapter 12 bankruptcy because of the situation now being faced by our nations farm familiesalthough the unitedstates economy is generally healthy it is clear that agricultural sector is hurting second this member supports the provision in h r 833 which provides for a means testing needsbased formula when determining whether an individual should file for chapter 7 or chapter 13 bankruptcy the vast majority of bankruptcy filersapproximately 70o ochoose chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code which erases all debts some chapter 7 filers actually have the capacity to repay some of what they owe but they choose chapter 7 bankruptcy and are able to walk away from these debts for example the stories in which an individual filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy and then goes out takes a nice vacation and or buys a new car are too common moreover the status quo is costing the average american individual and family in increased costs for consumer goods and credit because of the amount of debt which is never repaid to creditors as a response to these concerns the means test of h r 833 will help ensure that high income filers who could repay some of what they owe are required to file chapter 13 bankruptcy as compared to chapter 7 this needsbased system takes a debtors income expenses obligations and any special circumstances into account when determining whether he or she has the capacity to repay a portion of their debts however this bill still preserves the right to file bankruptcy for an individual or family who legitimately need a fresh start which was the original intent behind bankruptcy legislation third this member also supports the positive steps that h r 833 takes in ensuring that those who owe child support and alimony payments are not

am told has recorded the amount of time minutes and hours and days since the event at columbine high school and it is meant i suppose well i know it is meant as a political gag in order to try and embarrass the congress for no t having quote moved ahead on gun legislation i can understand the desire on the part of a lot of people especially as we move to the very end of the session to grasp at straws to do the most outrageous things in order to try to get the attention of the general public and in order to try and score some sort of political advantage but i must say as the representative from columbine from that area the school is half a mile from my home and my neighbors have children there and we suffered through this event together i must tell my colleagues that to have this kind of political shenanigan pulled at this late date to try and remind us of when columbine occurred let me tell my colleagues mr speaker there is not a parent in my district there is not a parent of a single child who was murdered at that school or injured in that school who needs to be reminded of when that happened there is not a single living soul in my district that needs to be told when that occurred how long ago because it is etched indelibly in our memories and in my mind to suggest that any action taken subsequent to that time by this congress could possibly have changed the situation there is of course both ludicrous and hypocritical it is especially hypocritical because of course this congress did attempt to address the issue of gun safety there was a bill there was a bill it made it to the floor h r 2122 now maybe it was not a perfect piece of legislation there were certainly things about it that i had concerns about but let me just go it just to remind all of us what exactly it was that we were talking about in that particular piece of legislation under current law background checks are not conducted at gun shows concerning transactions by private vendors but instead are only required of federal licensees this allows for a loophole of sorts in the acquisition of firearms there was an amendment proposed as a matter of fact by a democrat by the gentleman from michigan that amendment i believe was the most accommodating option both in keeping guns out of the hands of the criminals and in protecting the rights of gun owners across the country certainly it was controversial there were many people in my own district certainly people in my own constituency that said it still went too far as a matter of fact i was the only member in my delegation to vote for this it was in fact the best possible option of all the options i think we had available to us by the way the dingell amendment would have in fact closed that loophole would have required someone that was a private vendor to do background checks on people purchasing guns the argument revolved around the length of time that would be allowed for these checks to be completed and that sort of thing and those were arguable points i will not say that they were not it was not as i say a perfect bill but it was a democrat amendment that achieved about 45 or 50 democrats in its support originally and then it became part of the bill the next amendment dealt with large capacity devices they prohibited the manufacture of large capacity clips ammunition clips another one prevented juveniles from possessing semiautomatic assault weapons another one made it mandatory to provide trigger locks and safety devices when guns were purchased another amendment qualified current and former law enforcement officers to carry a concealed weapon whereby allowing them to continue to serve our communities as safety personnel in a way this is something that my friends on the other side have been pushing for all the time that 100 000 cops well this is a way of putting a lot of police on the beat these are retired former law enforcement police officers who could be carrying weapons and protecting the community another amendment in that particular bill said that when guns were pawned for more than a year they would not be returned to their owner until they pass an nic background check this amendment makes sure that during periods when the firearm is under the possession of the pawn shop that the original owner does not undergo circumstances which would hinder them from possessing the firearm likewise it allows for checks to be done on the pawned weapon so as to make sure it has not been stolen then the juvenile brady part where the amendment would prohibit persons who commit violent acts of juvenile delinquency from possessing firearms as adults all right those are the parts of the bill the most significant parts of the bill h r 2122 that came to this floor after a great deal of debate after originally supporting that my colleagues remember what happened my colleagues may recall how that all played out i often think of that cartoon the peanuts cartoon and that character when lucy is holding the ball that charlie is coming to kick just ashe gets there she pulls it away and he falls back that is in a way what the democrats did with that bill they put this bill out there the dingell amendment was part of it we assumed of course that we would get some support although it may not have been perfect because when was the last perfect piece of legislation that passed this body every piece of legislation is made up of compromises on both sides of the issue certainly it was not perfect for me but i also knew that it was going to be the best chance we had of getting this kind of legislation out of this congress so did the other side and that is my point they also knew that that was the best chance we had so what happened after all the rhetoric about gun legislation and i asked the people across the street holding press conferences and unveiling these clocks telling us how long it has been and people holding up replicas of tombstones saying rest in peace gun control measures i want to ask them where they were on the day that h r 2122 came to the floor i will tell my colleagues what happened when that bill came to the floor it failed it failed with 198democrats voting no 81 republicans voting no let me say that again the chart depicts this 198 democrat no votes 81 republican no votes the final vote 147 aye 280 no the 147 broke down in the following manner republicans 137 democrats 10 now i do not know i have heard of awards that are given annually maybe monthly or something by various members for the pork of the week award there are all these things that are picked out and people individuals get sometimes these awards that are not really all that much appreciated i am not sure but perhaps we should come up with a chutzpah award because i cannot think of a better word a fine jewish word to explain what we are talking about here when somebody can actually stand up here in this body and tell us thatwe have prevented the movement of this kind of legislation of gun control legislation when this is the fact of the matter 198 democrat noes 198 republican noes 81 who stopped it why did they stop it mr speaker the answer i believe is the answer i gave at the beginning it is the motto of the democratic class of 1999 in the house of representatives the motto is issues not solutions we want problems to carry forward i received just a little bit before i came over here a communication from mr william maloney mr maloney is the colorado commissioner of education this is not a political position he is appointed by an elected board it was a communication that i did not prompt i did not request and it is in response to the events i hate to even characterize it as a press conference because a press conference would indicate that there was something newsworthy about it but it was the event to which i referred earlier this thing where they unveiled this clock that is supposed to remind us all how long it has been since columbine mr maloney puts it very very clearly and very succinctly and articulately remember mr maloney is the commissioner of education in colorado it is a nonpartisan position he says the following about their antics and i will say antics rather than activities we would deeply regret that anyone would address the columbine tragedy without any consultation with those who were most deeply involved to do so in a simplistic fashion is to disrespect the full dimension of this tragedy and the diverse and earnest efforts being made to deal with it i suppose i cannot say much more than that and perhaps do not need to i hope the point has been made issues issues not solutions certainly not everything that has been proposed not just on gun legislation but anything else not everything would have completely solved these things but many would have come close if there would have truly been that bipartisan desire to get the job done there is plenty of partisan wrangling that goes on during the course of one session of congress even though i am a freshman i am certainly well aware of that to a large extent i think it is fine healthy and appropriate we have of course very legitimate clashes of ideas that are articulated on the floor of this house we disagree on the size and scope of government that disagreement that very basic disagreement that usually separates the two sides plays itself out in many interesting ways i will never forget the day here on the floor of the house when the final vote was taken on the tax relief measure i was proud to be a republican perhaps more so than any other time since i have been here in the past 11 months because we were actually doing something that was very very characteristic i thought of republican principles so it is absolutely appropriate for us to be divided on those issues have battles on those issues fight it outon this floor go to a vote everybody doing what they truly believe in their heart of hearts should be done because of their commitment to what is good for the country sometimes other things happen other things happen here and decisions are made and events occur that really are not based on those heartfelt opinions and ideas it is based on sheer pure politics i would say to my colleagues that when we look at the issues as we approach the next election be very very very discerning be discerning and try to determine whether or not they are being brought to us for purely political reasons or because in fact there is concern about the way they would have affected the outcome of america i yield to the gentleman from colorado springs colorado"]]}
