from the great state of massachusetts mr bill delahunt i am so glad mr delahunt is here we were talking earlier i had to chuckle there for a minute because mr delahunt always takes the opportunity and the privilege to share with us the printed word and it is good to have him here mr ryan will be joining us a little later if i could just take a moment here to let the members know that the great debate took place here on this floor a number of amendments were proposed to make sure that we pass a budget that is just and fair for every american but i must bring to the members attention because i think members do not realize what is happening or if they do realize what is happening i want to make sure that it is in the record that they know we talk about debt a lot in our 30 something working group and talking about debt and doing something about debt are two different things the republican majority continues to spend in a recordbreaking way that is bankrupting this country and changing the philosophy of this country which is payasyougo democrats we are the only party in this house that can say that we balanced the budget we have actually done it we have actually had surpluses as far as the eye can see republicans can only talk about well we would like to cut it in half and we would like to cut it back a quarter or what have you but i just want to make sure that folks understand that there was an article written on tuesday of this week entitled another possible bump to the debt ceiling 2 7 trillion budget plan pending before the house would raise the federal debt ceiling by nearly 10 trillion less than 2 months after the congress last raised the federal debt borrowing limit the provision is buried on page 121 of a 151page blueprint it serves as the backdrop for congressional action this week i think it is important and i usually have my letters here from the secretary of the treasury but i think it is important that the american people and the members of this house understand that what they are doing to this country recordbreaking debt i just want to make sure before we start off and then i am going to be kind of quiet here tonight because i know that we have a lot to share it is almost too much to share but i just want to share this with the members one more time we are talking about who are we borrowing from we are borrowing from japan at 682 8 billion china 249 8 billion the uk 223 2 billion the caribbean 115 3 billion taiwan 71 3 billion opec nations including saudi arabia and a number of nations that we have issues with 67 8 billion germany 65 7 billion korea 66 5 billion canada 53 8 billion and climbing if we do not stop this republican majority from continuing to raise this debt ceiling and burying it within the federal budget on what they believe their members have to vote for and this budget vote has been postponed and postponed and postponed not because the republican majority did not have time to deal with it they just did not want to do to their constituents what the majority wants them to do as long as we are here and we have breath in our bodies we are going to share with the members of this house that we will not allow this to be a back room with the lights off in the middle of the night proposition for the american people that they do not have any choices in but the special interests do i just in closing again history making this is not the kendrick meek report debbie wasserman schultz bill delahunt or tim ryan report this is facts not fiction the unitedstates department of the treasury backs this up 1 01 trillion borrowed in 224 years since 1776 to the year 2000 versus 1 05 trillion that was borrowed from 2001 to 2005 and counting from the president and the republican majority congress we are saying that we want to pay as we go we are saying that we want to make sure that we are fiscally responsible and we are saying that we are not going to allow the republican majority to be able to have these countries look at america in a different way than they were prior to this administration and prior to this republican congress i yield to the gentlewoman from florida ms wasserman"], [0.0018151402473449707, 0.998184859752655, 1, "mr ryan i dont give the president total credit for all of this he couldnt do it by himself you have to have a rubber stamp congress to give you full power full power to be able to take the country down the track it has gone down and the bottom line is that a republican majority from the leadership on down to the newly elected member of the republican conference has to take credit for giving the president the kind of power that he has right now we are fighting wars abroad for democracy when here at home we dont celebrate that very democracy that so many people speak of we have individuals that are on their third and fourth deployment i am on the armed services committee so i get the reports i get the letters from my constituents saying my husband my wife my mother my dad my niece my uncle my nextdoor neighboris on his way back to iraq again abec se we went alone we didnt go with a true coalition so i think it would be hard if i was a part of the republican majority to try to muster up some talking points for the floor right now to be able to say well okay some of this stuff is not believable so lets try to attack some members of the democratic caucus lets try to muster up and embellisha record on possibly being weak on terrorism or being weak on national security thats where the republican majority is now they are gasping for political air right now but you know what is so important about this issue and this discussion about national security is that it is supposed to be nonpolitical and unfortunately it is and that is because the majority hasnt allowed bipartisanship in this house for so many years and so they can hang it around their neck and say it is our war it is our failure as it relates to national security and border security dont act like it is a crisis right now you allowed it to happen under your watch you have been the rubber stamp congress now mr ryan and ms wasserman schultz let me just tell you what the rubber stamp congress has accomplished borrowing 1 05 trillion from foreign nations in 4 years in more than 224 years of this countrys history with 42 presidents 1 01 trillion they were able to borrow in 4 years and this republican congress and the president has allowed that to happen these are the countries here that own a part of the american apple pie japan china the u k the caribbean taiwan germany and opec nations you know this whole oil thing that we will talk about in a minute korea and canada they all have their hands in the pockets of the unitedstates taxpayers not because of the unitedstates taxpayers but because of the republican majoritys outofcontrol spending oil companies oh wow at this time in history when they unearth what happened under this republican majority and this presidency they will see these record breaking profits there was a meeting in the white house i have the article to prove it and i talk about it all time it was a special meeting that took place in the white house and the vice presidents aides and all met and then the policymakers came here to the congress to the rubber stamp congress now let me set this up here because we believe in the 30something working group in thirdparty validators washington post wednesday november 16 2005 white house document shows that executives from big oil companies met with vice president cheneys energy task force in 2001 something long expected by environmentalists but denied as recently as last week by the white house last week industry officials testified before congress document obtained by the post on november 2005 shows that officials from exxon mobil phillips shell oil companies and bp of america met in the white house complex with cheney aides to develop a national energy policy parts of which became law and parts of which are still being debated in congress that was 2001 look what happened 2002 34 billion recordbreaking profits 2003 53 billion 2004 84 billion 2005 113 billion in profits for oil companies meanwhile average americans are spending through the nose and trying to make it to work and to drop their kids off look what happened here this is what happened under the republican majority and a rubber stamp congress so shall it be written and so shall it be done e85 we talk about alternative fuels flex vehicles every magazine i open talks about flex vehicles here is the bottom line the republican congress have allowed these oil companies to be able to do anything they want to do when they want to do it this is an actual pump here at an exxonmobil station it says you cannot use your mobil credit card to buy e85 meanwhile we can continue to feed off the saudi arabian middle east what got us in this thing in the first place policies you can use your oil card there you can buy a bag of chips you can buy a carton cigarettes but e85 that is produced in the midwest versus the middle east you cannot use your mobil credit card for that and on retirement packages and i dont know very much about lee raymond but the bottom line is he is a retired executive from exxonmobil with a 398 million retirement package and a 2 million tax break this is what happens with a republican majority again the republican majority rubber stamp dont worry about balancing the budget democrats we tried to balance the budget we have done it before we have tried to do it under this republican majority not one republican vote to balance the budget on rollcall vote 87 march 17 2005 ranking member spratt and the budget committee put it forth again failed not one republican vote on rollcall vote 91 in 2004 their will and desire is not there the american people deserve balance minimum wage yes there was some bill that came up before we left for the break to talk about minimum wage a bill that the republican majority knew that the senate would not take up and would never make it to the presidents desk but because we were hammering them on it they said lets pass this they added all kinds of stuff it is called the potomac twostep this chart the bottom line is these are not minimum wage increases these are increases for members of congress this is our pay this is what we make oh look at them since 1997 there hasnt been an increase in the minimum wage and you not a minimum wage worker right now and i am not talking to the members of congress i am talking to the american people the bottom line is if the minimum wage goes up and that means if you are a salaried worker then your wages will go up but the bottom line is that it is a fact that the republican congress has said not over our dead body we are going to get our increase but we are not going to give the american people a minimum wage increase it goes on and on and on i am going to close with this the prime minister of iraq and the president of iran mr delahunt brought this picture out last night i dont care whichever way you cut 300 billion of spending over 2 000 troops thousands and thousands of american troops injured here in washington d c stay the course no plan the secretary of defense says if you talk about or say anything about redeployment of troops or withdrawing from iraq you are fired no question from the congress no response from the congress the secretary of defense is not called to the hill immediately the republican congress what are they saying they are saying nothing so accountability is not there they are embracing and guess what this is a la the unitedstates taxpayer through the republican majority because of a lack of diplomacy and a lack of plan and going to a war of choice versus after osama bin laden in afghanistan andgiving those troops in afghanistan the support they need so ms wasserman schultz mr ryan i rest my case the bottom line is that was not a message for democrats or republicans it was not a message for independents or the green party or other party affiliations that is a message for americans the bottom line is whatever you may feel if you are a member of the republican executive committee or you have always voted republican or you always voted independent you have to have issues with what the facts are i yield to ms wasserman schultz"], [0.0019168853759765625, 0.9980831146240234, 1, "i thank the gentleman from new york for yielding i congratulate him on his as always excellent leadership on behalf of the middleclass working families in america i salute him for his excellent presentation today today the house is considering the ultimate values debate the question bafore us today is do we want to cut taxes for the ultrasuperrich or instead do we first want to give hardworking americans a raise do we want to live in an aristocracy or do we want to live in a democracy do we want to perpetuate wealth or reward work the estate tax is central to our democracy it is rooted in our commitment to create a strong and vibrant middle class and to give every american the opportunity to achieve the american dream after the gilded age in which the elites of the time held power and wealth that far far far outstripped what the average american had america decided to go in a new direction one of americas great republican presidents theodore roosevelt made the argument for an estate tax saying that the really big fortune the swollen fortune by the mere fact of its size acquires qualities which differentiate it in its kind as well as its degree from what is possessed by men of relatively small means therefore president theodore roosevelt said i believe in a graduated tax on big fortunes properly safeguarded against evasion democrats believe that we must create wealth we recognize that that we must reward entrepreneurship and risk and we must encourage hard work that is why democrats supported a targeted estate tax relief for small businesses and farmers and fami lies that would ensure 99 7 percent of all americans dont pay any estate tax this is in the spirit of theodore roosevelt targeting the vast fortunes that differ not only in the quantity of wealth but in the kind i salute congressman earl pomeroy for his leadership in giving congress an alternative that is morally and fiscally responsible unfortunately once again the republican leadership just as they have blocked a vote on the minimum wage are blocking mr pomeroys option to bring his proposal to the floor which is responsible which is paid for and which is fair to all americans under mr pomeroys proposal only the top 3 percent that means 99 7 percent of americans most people in america would not pay any estate tax but it would leave that 3 percent the very very superwealthy to pay their fair share there are very few people involved but a great deal of money we will have a chance to vote on it in the motion to recommit unfortunately we will not have the time to debate it as an alternative we have these questions that have come before us when we are talking about this we are talking about giving 800 billion to a few families in america democrats stand for fiscal responsibility payasyougo budgets and no new deficit spending republicans instead have put forth the bill that will cost the american people again almost 800 billion 800 billion that we dont have that we are going to have to borrow our national debt is becoming a national security issue countries that now own our debt it is over 1 trillion already and this doesnt include this 800 billion those countries that now own our debt will not only be making our toys our clothes and our computers they will be soon making our foreign policy they have too much leverage over us with this bill today the republicans are giving tax cuts to the wealthy and asking the middle class to pay for it by writing checks to china and japan for the interest payments on the debt and ultimately the payment on principal it isridiculous it is ridiculous let me get this straight we are at war in iraq many of the same people who wanted to support the staythecourse that the president is on in iraq which has around a 400 billion price tag on it that is off budget they dont want to pay for that and that is a huge figure and now the republicans are saying not only that not only are we not paying for the war it is off budget we will just heap that debt on to future generations they are saying we are going to give twice as much as that to a few families in america it is so unfair this same week that we are taking this up as i said earlier this is the ultimate values debate how can a person of conscience say to the congress we do not support an increase in the minimum wage instead we are going to give 800 billion to the wealthiest people in america the minimum wage is 5 15 an hour it hasnt been raised in 9 years this is a shame it is a disgrace it is unfair and what does the leader on the republican side say about the minimum wage mr boehner says i have been in this business for 25 years and i have never voted for an increase in the minimum wage i am opposed to it and i think the vast majority of the republican conference is opposed to it so thank you mr boehner for making a differentiation for us you are for 800 billion for the wealthiest families in america and not an increase of over 5 15 an hour for americas working families so instead of giving 7 millionamericans a raise by increasing the minimum wage again the republicans are proposing 800 billion that is nearly 1 trillion as a gift to the wealthy this is robin hood in reverse we are stealing from the middle class to give to the wealthy pope benedict just recently put out his new encyclical god is love and in his encyclical he quoted saint augustine when he wrote this is in the popes encyclical you can find it there he talked about the role that politicians have and that a government should be just and we should be promoting justice and he goes on pope benedict does to quote saint augustine he says a state that is not governed according to justice would be just a bunch of thieves this is the pope saying this in an encyclical quoting a saint a state which is not governed according to justice would be just a bunch of thieves i ask this congress is it justice to steal from the middle class to give tax cuts to the ultrasuperrich it is not just and it is an injustice we cannot afford americans can no longer afford president bush and the republicans it is time for a new direction we can begin by rejecting this estate tax giveaway to the wealthy and insist on a vote to increase the minimum wage that would be a real values judgment"], [0.00206756591796875, 0.9979324340820312, 1, "it is an honor to come and address the unitedstates house of representatives i want to thank democratic leader nancy pelosi and our democratic whip mr steny hoyer and also our chairman mr james clyburn and i think it is also mr larson who is our vice chpir and the rest of the ranking members and other members of the democratic caucus an hour ago we were talking about the issues of fiscal responsibility we were talking about trying to make sure that the american taxpayer gets what tfiey deserve out of this government this government that they have elected to cometo washington d c to represent them to make sure that they get the biggest bang for their tax dollar i think it is important to point out that we are having some real financial issues right now some may say on the majority side ahid i do respect the members on the majority side and i know that there are a few members on the majority side that feel the way we feel here on the minority side on the democratic side of the aisle that we have to get our fiscal house in order and we are not there yet i can say here boldly and honestly that we are not there there are a number of thirdparty validators that are talking about the fiscal irresponsibility on the majority side and by this president that has put this country in financial jeopardy you have individuals saying we want to cut the deficit in half but meanwhile back at the ranch they want to borrow from countries like china they want to borrow from countries like saudi arabia and give those countries a piece of the american pie i think it is important that in the last hour when we talked about innovation we talked about putting america first we talked about not cutting student loans to everyday americans we talked about assisting that next generation and the generations that we expect to be able to stand up and make this and continue to make this country free and put us ahead as it relates to inventions as it relates to innovation we are talking about on this side of the aisle that we embrace and we appreciate our troops and our veterans but meanwhile in the presidents budget it talks about cuts in veterans affairs it talks about higher copayments for veterans i must say i am a democrat but guess what i represent republicans indepenlents green party and democrats back in my district and they feel the way that i do r have not had one constituent say congressman i want you to go to washington d c and make sure that you borpow as much money as possible so that i can pay it back with interest congressman i want you to go to washington d c and be irresponsible with my tax dollars and make sure that we do not have accountability as it relates to unbid contracts congressman i want you to look the other way when it comes down to making surethat you have the proper oversight so that we do not have this culture of corruption cronyism and incompetence that we are seeing on the majority side and in the white house right now i think it is very very important the perception that the american people and the reality that they are seeing right now this is not the kendrick meek or the 30something or the tim ryan report this is what is being printed every day in the papers it is not that the congress is taking a bold step to make sure that the children of america have what they need making sure that we have the kinds of innovation that the president spoke about making sure that the veterans do not have to pay a higher copayment for health insurance that we promised them as a country we salute one flag right now not because of coincidence because individuals have died for that opportunity we have individuals that have served and served in many theaters to make sure that we can salute one flag and the bottom line is we should not turn our backs on those individuals what mr ryan and i are going to talk about in this 30something hour is the tax on corruption the corruption tax that the american people have to pay and the american children have to pay and men and women that have worn a uniform have to pay guess what it is not just democrats it is not just republicans it is not just independents it is the american people it is not just the folks that vote it is not just the folks that do not vote it is not the folks who are seeking status that have green cards in this country that are legally here it is happening right now mr speaker and mr ryan i just want to say before i yield i feel good about the fact that we were talking about the k street project 2 years ago night after night week after week we talked about it we were honest and upfront with the american people that something was fundamentally wrong when you have a k street project talk about it put a press release out about it about how we have this relationship with the special interests what about a relationship with the american people mr speaker so now we have a lobbyist here in this town that has admitted to guilt mr ryan that has said i have broken the law we do nothave to have a trial because the evidence is so strong we do not have to have a jury pool we do not have to have pedple come in and waste 6 months of their lives on a jury pool and a jury selection i will admit to guilt days after this particular lobbyist said i am guilty i am willing to help the

to make sure that members dont go back home in november and giving political speeches saying that oh well i didnt know we were doing that or i didnt know that we were breaking a record in borrowing from foreign nations we want to make sure that the congressional record reflects that those of us on this side of the aisle actually brought it to the floor in a form that a middle school or a fifth grader can understand and it is important that we break it down to this point so that no one can say that they misunderstood they didnt quite know what they were voting for i made a mistake or whatever the case may be because now in this day in this congress we are making history in all the wrong places and in all the wrong ways i think it is important that we point this out i want to make sure that i get that washington post article that talked about a special meeting at the white house the innovation agenda i want to make sure that the members go on housedemocrats gov and get a copy of the innovation agenda so that hopefully folks can be enlightened on what we have been talking about and promoting not just yesterday not just last month this has been around and the only reason why it is not implemented now is that the republican majority will not allow legislation to come to the floor outside of the original thoughts of president bush or the republican leaders i think it is important that we understand an innovation agenda we talk about education and creating the workforce for the future making sure that there is math and science education that we work on that and we provide the necessary dollars for it invest in research and also development that promotes publicprivate partnerships where many ceos you will see on housedemocrats gov have already become a part of what we are talking about and encouraging that to happen affordable guaranteed broadband access throughout the country need it be if you are in the heartland of america you are on the east coast you are on the west coast you are down south you are up north you should be able to have an opportunity at this broadband initiative that we have for all americans achieving energy independence we talked about that withir 10 years not maybe one day not counting on the oil companies to do it but the congress setting the stage this house setting the stage for that to happen providing small businesses with the tools that they need to be able to create jobs i am just going to take about 10 minutes here breaking this thing down if not shorter of talking about how we are making history in all the wrong ways the republican majority i must say has done an outstanding job on behalf of president bush you have got to hand it to them if there was an oscar an emmy or a grammy to give out the republican majority would get it as it relates to rubberstamping everything the administration hands down i hold here and this is no secret to many of the members and it should not be a secret to the staff that works here in the house of representatives this chart this chart of the fact that in just 4 years president bush and the republican majority has borrowed 1 05 trillion from foreign nations we have the republican congress right under the presidents picture because he couldnt do it by himself fortytwo united states presidents 224 years were only able to borrow 1 01 trillion from foreign nations how could that be one may say how can you do this in 4 years 1 05 trillion from foreign nations in 224 years 200 years shy of what the president has been able to do 1 01 trillion let me tell you that is staggering that is not something that it happened in the forties or it happened in the thirties once upon a time calculate it fortytwo presidents 224 years we are not just here as the 30 something working group and dreaming up something those numbers are from the unitedstates department of treasury who do we owe who has their hands in the pockets of the american taxpayer i dont care if you are a republican independent you dont vote yet or whatever the case may be a democrat you have to have a problem with these nations owning a piece of the american apple pie japan like it or not i know it is painful for some of the members to hear this but this is the reality under a republican majority japan 682 8 billion that they own of the american apple pie thanks to the republican majority rubberstamping the bush policies china 249 8 billion of the american apple pie that they own right now not because of the american people lack of making the right fiscal decisions but it is because the republican majority has allowed it to happen with the american taxpayer dollar the u k 223 2 billion caribbean nations 115 3 billion taiwan 71 3 billion opec nations oh my goodness opec nations we cant do enough for them but they are buying our debt 67 8 billion germany 65 7 billion korea 66 5 billion and canada 53 8 billion the reason why you see the american flag in silhouette as it relates to the united states of america excluding alaska and hawaii and puerto rico and other unitedstates territories but just to show this silhouette of the mainland of the united states of amerida the reason why we have that if you want to do away with the debt elect a democratic majority because we have done it the republican majority they are saying well were going to cut it in half

kind of stuff but when it comes down to the printed word when it comes down to the budget that is handed out from the white house and when it comes down to what this republican majority does it is 2 000 from what the 911 commission called for and what we called for as house democrats versus the presidents proposal and you can look it up on line that only asks for 210 agents democrats fought for the funding on almost five different occasions again for the record ms wasserman schultz h r 1268 a motion to recommit and 2 000 vote number 160 and that happened on 5 5 05 also you look at house bill 2360 was blocked it was an obey amendment vote number 174 that was on 5 17 05 it failed 223 to 185 on a partisan vote h r 1817 a motion to recommit 2005 again vote number 188 again failed on partisan lines you start talking about on border security and closing the gaps on nine separate occasions over the last 5 years democrats put forth motions here on this floor because that is the only thing we can do being in the minority we are not able to bring the bills to the floor because the majority is blocking those bills from getting out of committee and they are noted right here and i am not going to go through that at this particular time but all of this is on line housedemocrats gov if anyone wants to go on and get this information also when you start talking about aviation security democrats offered a motion to require air cargo to be screened within 3 years the motion was rejected by republicans again 2005 vote number 188 5 18 05 democrats have spoken repeatedly on the issue of transit security making sure that we authorize including a 2 8 billion initiative to improve transit security and a 1 billion initiative to improve rail security substitute amendment defeated again so when you start look looking at the record and what the record says versus what is said here on the floor by the republican majority and the rubber stamp majority i wish the rubber stamp republican majority would stop fighting us and start saying to the president guess what we no longer want to rubber stamp everything that you send here i just wish the republican majority would just leader up and say hey mr president so you start reading the paper could someoneget me a newspaper please because i want to just have it as a prop because as americans start reading the paper they are reading about how republican members of the house and the senate the president flies into town they get on the plane and leave town some even get in their car and go i was on the other side of my district well let me tell you something if the president of the united states is in my district i think i would know i think it would be some sort of news flash or some sort of email that would come to me and say you know the president is coming in your district today will be in an elementary school maybe you want to be there he is the leader of the free world maybe you want to be there the reason why they are taking flights while the president is coming in the reason why they are finding something else to do while the president is in their town is the fact that they dont want to be caught in the same situation with the president of the united states because they have not stood up to the president and said no you cant put us in a financial situation as far as the eye can see as it relates to deficits and foreign countries running the world you cant pick up the paper today not talking about a republican running from the president of the united september 12 2006 co states and dont want to be around when the president is around or explaining why they are not there that is some excuse i hope i never get to the situation where i have the president of the united states coming into my district and i have to explain that i am somewhere else while the president is there and the bottom line is this people cannot face the music when it comes down to dealing with the policies of this administration and better yet you being in the position there is only 535 of us being in the position as i come in for a landing ms wasserman schultz to be able to bring about change on behalf of the american people to say this is not going to happen to say i know you want to start a war in iraq but we still got this business over here with al qaeda who had everything to do with 9 11 who trained the individuals that carried out the 9 11 plot but meanwhile while we are over therelooking for osama bin laden and we have him cornered i got this unfinished business the president said over here in iraq because i got a problem with this leader over here we got to take him out but what about the after player what is going to happen once you get to baghdad how are you going to bring stability who is going to be in the coalition calling up a couple of friends ill send 25 troops ill send 30 troops you are not allowed to talk about it everything is secret we have the then sitting attorney general comes to the unitedstates congress over on the senate side and tells the senate you are either with us or you are with the terrorists 0l 2340 what kind of mess is that so when it comes down to article i section 1 and if the american people want the kind of representation they need i am not talking as a democrat even though we were given an hour by the deqiocratic leader and we are all members of the democratic caucus this is america i guarantee you if the shoe was on the other foot ms wasserman schultz i cannot help but imagine the kind of chaos and protest and finger pointing and them and they and all of the things that will be said some of the stuff will have to be stricken from the record because the republican side will be carrying on about the democrats but they cannot say it they cant do it they cannot even kind of paint a picture because they have been in charge of the whole thing since it started so if the american people want a new direction if the american people want accountability if the american people want a house and a senate that will carry out article i section 1 of the unitedstates constitution and a lot of blood is on this constitution but if they want that then they will vote for a new direction in november i am done ladies and gentlemen with begging the republican majority to stand up on behalf of the american people because i am looking at what the oil companies are getting they are getting theirs i am looking at what these contractors are getting either it be katrina or the war in iraq they are getting theirs i am looking at the issue of health care and all of the people that are running to the bank with all of the dollars and all of the influence and all of the access into this congress they are getting theirs meanwhile we are sitting around here talking about the minimum wage and we cant even get a doggone bill passed off this floor to be able to provide the american people with a minimum wage meanwhile we are giving ourselves a nice fat pay raise

only share with the members but also the american people about many of the issues that we fight for for them here in this unitedstates house of representatives i must say that there are a number of things that we can talk about this evening but i just want to start off because i know that not only the democratic leader but also the entire democratic caucus is looking to hopefully put america in a new direction we want to make sure that we provide the leadership on behalf of all americans as you know i want to start off tonight but as you know we have been sharing it with the members so that hopefully it will have some sort of lift here in the house it has not had thus far but weare willing to provide the leadership even in the minority even though the majority is not willing to pick up the philosophy that we are pushing here on behalf of the american people making sure that we have more affordable health care this is on housedemocrats gov also lower gas prices to achieve energy independence which we have our energy plan on housedemocrats gov and our innovation plan that has been there for some time and filed legislation here in the house that has not been heard we want to talk about homeland security we have a real security plan also on that website that is there for the members they have to have the will and the desire to be able to take up these plans and these initiatives and if we were able to work in a bipartisan way these plans would already be passed not only in the appropriations act but also here on the floor the two other things that i want to mention as it relates to cutting the cost of college cost as you know the cost to go to college has gone up this republicanled congress last not helped in that area they have not helped the everyday average american to be able to meet the increases that they have been asked to pay and also in a new direction for america is making sure that we follow through with fiscal responsibility pay as we go not just on a credit card not just saying because we can give tax cuts to millionaires and we will just puv it off on future generations or we will go to foreign nations and borrow a record number of dollars these nations that i am holding up here they own a part of the american apple pie not because of what the american people have done it is what the republican congress has done and allow these countries to buy our debt because we are not fiscally responsible i think it is also important to make sure that we encourage working families people that are making minimum wage i just want to make this point then i am going to give it to my friend mr ryan from youngstown ohio as you know we have had time after time again three or four occasions in the 109th congress that we have asked the republican majority to join us in raising the minimum wage to make sure that the american workers are able to keep up with the costs of not only living but inflation but it has been well said and mr ryan will point it out with his chart that he has there in a moment that the republican congress is in no way and in no shape ready to give minimum wage workers an increase since 1997 they have not had an increase but here in the 30something working group we actuallytake time to find out the facts because we want to make sure that we are not telling the american people nor members of this house something that is inaccurate i must say that in 1998 members of congress received 3 100 in a pay increase and we are not minimumwage workers in 1998 minimum wage workers zero mr ryan in 2000 members of congress received a pay increase of 4 600 guess what same year minimumwage workers zero 2001 members of congress received 3 800 minimumwage workers zero in 2002 members of congress received another pay increase 4 900 almost 5 000 pay increase remember we just got one in 2002 i was not a member yet but it happened minimumwage workers zero 2003 members of congress 4 700 pay increase just got one last year getting another one in 2003 of course minimumwage workers zero punch in and punch out every day they work a 40hour work week catch the early bus trying to raise their children members of congress 2004 3 400 pay increase same year minimumwage workers zero mr ryan thanks to the republican majority 2005 it is great to be in congress too bad every american cannot be and minimumwage workers cannot be 2005 members of congress 4 000 tell you the republican majority takes care of their own and us too 2005 zero for minimumwage workers proposed increase for members of congress 3 100

time this evening for the congressional black caucus to make preliminary comments on the presidents proposed budget when the congressional black caucus met with president bush on january 26 we presented a cbc agenda that would close disparities and create opportunity we outlined six areas in which significant barriers exist that prevent african americans from enjoying the same quality of life as white americans we requested the presidents support and asked him to demonstrate it both verbally and substantively unfortunately the budget that the president sent to congress yesterday falls far short of the substantive goals that we hoped the president would have set forth to eliminate disparities the first area we presented to the president was in the area of closing the achievement and opportunity gaps in education in his budget the president proposes eliminating the perkins loan program which provides lowinterest loans to low and middleincome college students this proposal would have disastrous effects on african american college students many of whom rely heavily on federal financial aid programs to offset the cost of obtaining higher education as it is african americans attend college at a lower rate than white americans if the president succeeds in his plan to eliminate the perkins loan program a college education would simply be unaffordable and unattainable for many african american college students african american college enrollment rates are 10 percent lower than white college enrollment rates college graduation rates are even worse for african american students only 46 percent of african american freshmen ever graduate from college compared to 67 percent of white freshmen according to the education trust the typical american college or university has a graduation rate gap between white and african american students of over 10 percentage points a quarter of institutions have a gap of 20 percentage points or more in a recent study by the luna foundation for education the foundation found that the single most important financial variable influencing whether or not a student will attend college is the amount of needbased financial aid being provided in spite of these disparities the president seeks to not only eliminate the perkins loan program but he is proposing to eliminate the gear up and the trio programs as well the sole purpose of the gear up program which our congressional black caucus colleague the gentleman from pennsylvania introduced and the trio program both of those programs are designed to prepare lowincome and disadvantaged students for college in other words the president through his budget wants to eliminate the very programs that would help close the achievement and opportunity gaps in education in fact one out of every three programs that the president proposes to cut or eliminate in his budget is in the department of education so the president has not been responsive at all to the cbc agenda in that area the second area we outlined to the president was in the area of health care providing quality health care for every american the presidents proposed budget slashes at least 45 billion from the medicaid program which provides health coverage to 50 million lowincome children working families seniors and others who would otherwise be uninsured the presidents proposed cuts to medicaid would have devastating effects on the working poor and would have particularly devastating effects on african americans according to families usa african americans are generally less likely to receive employerbased health care because african americans are more likely than whites to work in positions where health care benefits are not offered work for companies typically small companies that cannot afford to pay for employee health insurance and to be unable to afford health insurance premiums when coverage is offered the third area we asked the president to respond to was in the area of economic security building wealth and business employment the african american unemployment rate is consistently more than double the average national average in inner cities that number is even larger yet the president proposes cutting the budget for the department of labor by 4 4 percent including workforce investment act state grants further while the african american homeownership rate is over 20 percentage points behind that of white americans the president proposes cutting funding for the department of housing and urban development by almost 3 7 billion we asked the president to address disparities in foreign policy eradicating poverty hunger and armed conflicts around the world especially in africa and the caribbean which is a major component of the cbcs agenda unfortunately the presidents budget offered no solutions on how to strengthen the economic stability and selfsufficiency of countries in the african diaspora the caucus supports reducing the heavy burden that debt has on many countries and reengaging with the united nations regional organizations and countries throughout the world to help promote civil society global health fair trade and peace while we applaud the president for his proposal to fund the global initiative to fight hiv aids we implore him to also provide financial assistance to end the fighting in african countries that are engaged in civil war and in genocide we asked the president to help address retirement security for african americans and the disparities that exist there during the last several weeks preaftent bush has traveled the country selling his social security reform proposal to the american people because african americans rely heavily on the survivor disability and retirement benefits provided by social security the cbc is extremely interested in the details of this proposal contrary to the presidents claims african americans receive a higher rate of return than whites due to their heavier reliance on the full range of benefits offered by social security the cbc has made it clear to the president that we are against any proposal that would result in future benefit cuts or divert payroll taxes from the social security trust fund african americans are 8 percent of all retired beneficiaries 13 percent of survivor beneficiaries and 18 percent of all disability recipients social security is the only source of retirement income for 40 percent of older americans and if those benefits were reduced the poverty rate for older african americans would double almost overnight social security is one of the most effective programs in the history of the united states and is essential to the livelihood of african americans we asked the president to ensure justice for every american the cbc supports criminal and juvenile justice reform that focuses greater emphasis on prevention and rehabilitation reduces recidivism by successfully reintegrating former inmates into society and ends arbitrary mandatory minimum sentences we also strongly support preserving affirmative action until all the effects of past and present discrimination have been eliminated while the presidents budget does include 75 million for a prisoner reentry initiative much more rehabilitation needs to be done for prisoners while they are in prison in addition we are disappointed to report that the presidents fiscal year budget proposes to cut funding for the justice departments civil rights division even while we all know that more enforcement is necessary and despite that fact our election system does not work properly the presidents budget proposes to eliminate grants to states for election reform in summary the budget that the president sent to congress yesterday reflects priorities and values that are not in line with those held by the majority of american families or by the congressional black caucus today the president told reporters that his budget sets priorities he went on to say our priorities are winning the war on terror protecting our homeland and growing our economy i would say to the president that while we fight the war on terror americas families also want to fight the war on poverty while we protect our homeland we must also ensure that american families are able to buy affordable homes while we must grow our economy we must also provide retirement security for american families in times of economic downturn these mr president are americas priorities i hope the president will work with the congressional black caucus to turn these priorities into realities the following is a

people are fa6ed with today with a budget that is squarely not responsive nor responsible to the needs of the american people with an administration that quite frankly on so many important issues has demonstrated that they are completely out to lunch and out of touch the point is that the american people deserve better there is a day of reckoning coming and i assure you that that reckoning is coming this year in the year 2006 i think this is going to be one of the most important elections that we have had in a long long time because all of the facts that you have just pointed out in terms of fema in terms of what is happening in the middle east and here lately in terms of those who were asleep at the switch when the deal was cut in terms of the port security all show a considerable lack of judgment and a lack of responsibility to the american people that has been a characteristic within this administration especially in the area dealing with one of the most precious responsibilities we have which is determining and being responsible for how we spend the taxpayers money for this administration in the last 5 years to have squandered a surplus the facts are there they are plain as one can see when the clinton administration left office there was a surplus of billions and billions of dollars and now in this last year the deficit has been shot up over 4 trillion there is a reckoning for that and i am here to tell you that as a member of congress the american people are looking for members of congress to stand up for them and to do what it is we need to do that we were elected to do it is congress that is charged with the responsibility of oversight it is congress whose decision it is by the constitution to determine how the tax dollars are spent that

kitchen table tonight scratching their heads how are we going to pay this without money they do not have the luxury of putting out a debt ceiling they do not have the luxury of going and borrowing unlimited amounts from foreign governments for our most basic services when you combine that with the trade deficit and you combine that with our willingness to turn our security for our ports over to foreign countries and especially countries with arab and islamic roots and connections when we are in a terrorist war with islamic and arabic countries let it be said and let it be plain we do not wish to discriminate against anybody because you are arab or islamic but does it make good judgment to turn our security over to a country that has had a record of financial transactions supporting terrorists or a country where two of the terrorists came from that attacked this country that is sort of like after the bombing of pearl harbor turning over the security of pearl harbor to the japanese the only reason i am mentioning that is to show that the same mindset that allowed this to happen for our ports the same mindset that allowed the fema to happen to have those trailers setting

other body i am blessed to be on a couple of committees where there is bipartisan spirit at least some of the time and we are able to get a few things done and this is one of them the perkins act aims to prepare youth and adults for the future by building their academic and technical skills in preparation for postsecondary education and or employment the bill we are considering today enhances perkins by ensuring both secondary and postsecondary students participating in the program are acquiring rigorous academic and technical skills and will have the opportunity to transition into further education and or successful employment the perkins act governs widely supported programs of both the secondary and postsecondary level for example nearly all high school students complete at least one vocational education course and approximately 26 percent of students are considered vocational concentrators those students who focus on a single occupational area in my home state of delaware we have five career and technical high schools that enroll a total of 5 500 of the 29 500 total high school students at the postsecondary level the perkins act supports a broad array of options primarily at the community college level including delaware technical community college in the 19992000 school year over 50 percent of all students enrolled at the less than 4year postsecondary level reported that they were majoring in vocational areas todays conference report seeks to build upon reforms made in past reauthorizations and seeks to enhance this popular program to ensure its success in years to come the legislation before us today makes significant reforms to academic achievement and accountability to ensure students have the skills necessary to enter the workforce or continue to an institution of higher learning as i mentioned there are five career and technical high schools in delaware while all these schools met adequately yearly progress under the no child left behind act there is more to be done in academic achievement in these schools and schools across the country today we will improve vocational and technical education by increasing the focus on academics in conjunction with the skill attainment that is incumbent of the program one of the unique attributes of vocational and technical education programs is their ability to show students a path that could end in a certificate credential employment military or postsecondary education the techprep program within the perkins act is intended to focus on a welldefined link between high school and at least 2 years of postsecondary education research has shown however that funds are rarely if ever used to meet this goal rather funds are often used for purposes within the larger vocational and technical education program therefore the conference agreement revises requirements of the program in order to ensure articulation agreements between secondary and postsecondary institutions are in fact being implemented along this same track we include a new requirement for state development of career and technical programs of study for career and technical program areas these sequences of course will incorporate a nonduplicative progression of both secondary and postsecondary elements which will include both academic and vocational and technical content local recipients at both the secondary and postsecondary level would adopt at least one model sequence of courses as developed by the state i believe this will also help drive program improvements by ensuring that states clarify the progression of academic and vocational technical courses needed for the postsecondary education training or employment of a students choice it is clear that we are making some significant and positive changes for the schools and students impacted by this program one of the biggest changes that i think we are making is for congress to finally make the switch from vocational and technical education to career and technical education in my opinion this was an important statement for the congress to make while the president has proposed another avenue for high school reform in the perkins act i believe strongly that the reforms we consider today go a long way in driving program improvement and ultimate success for students across the country the dialogue surrounding high school reform is important and is happening in earnest i trust that the conference agreement will complement these efforts as a result of the changes in the bill i believe it will help states community colleges and other postsecondary education institutions and local educational agencies to better meet the needs of students participating in career and technical education i urge my colleagues to support this

bill to h r 4239 the animal enterprise terrorism act it reflects a compromise bill arrived at after considerable effort of a bipartisan group involving both house and senate judiciary committee staff over several months from hearings in the house and from other reports we have learned that current federal law designed to protect animal enterprises have been proven to be reasonably effective in protecting animal enterprises however serious gaps and loopholes have been identified in current law with respect to protecting employees and associates of animal enterprises present law protects employees of an animal enterprise but we have found that employees board members and family members of businesses and nonprofits affiliated with or doing business with such enterprises are complaining that they are now being stalked harassed intimidated or threatened with some individuals even being physically assaulted and had their homes businesses or cars vandalized since the animal enterprise terrorism law was enacted in 1992 there have been some1 100 complaints of such incidents with property losses reported of being more than 120 million those complaining include farmers scientists biomedical and biotechnology industries research universities teaching hospitals financial institutions magazines newspapers and other advertising groups and others who are viewed as assisting or enabling targeted animal enterprises the evidence is that in many instances extremist elements among the animal rights groups are taking advantage of the fact that the animal enterprise laws do not cover affiliates and associates by using threats harassment intimidation and fear and other extreme tactics to pressure them into severing their activities with such enterprises s 3880 is designed to cover these gaps or loopholes by providing to employees businesses and associates of animal enterprises similar protections to those already covered in other words the bill prevents a person from doing indirectly to an animal enterprise what they are prohibited to do directly now citizens engaging in legitimate animal enterprise activities and anyone associated with them are entitled to be protected from criminal acts and to be able to go about their daily a tivities free from threats to their person or property and that of their family and associates state laws are generally good at providing those protections however the interstate nature of the planning and execution of the criminal harassment tactics used by some individuals or groups skilled at exploiting gaps or weaknesses in the laws have made it difficult for states to get at problems effectively that is why this bill is deemed necessary while we must protect those engaged in animal enterprises we must also protect the right of those engaged in first amendment freedoms of expres sion regarding such enterprises it goes without saying that first amendment freedoms of expression cannot be defeated by statute however to reassure anyone concerned with the intent of this legislation we have added in the bill assurances that it is not intended as a restraint on freedoms of expression such as lawful boycotting picketing or otherwise engaging in lawful advocacy for animals in addition we also wanted to recognize that there are some who conscientiously believe that it is their duty to peacefully protest the operation of animal enterprises to the extent of engaging in civil disobedience if a groups intention were to stage a sitin or liedown or to block traffic to a targeted facility they certainly run the risk of arrest for whatever traffic trespass or other laws they may be breaking but they should not be held more accountable for business losses due to causes such as delivery trucks being delayed any more than a boycott or protest against any other business to violate the provision of the bill one must travel or otherwise engage in interstate activity with the intent to cause damage or loss to an animal enterprise while the losses of profits lab experiments or other intangible losses are included it must be proved that such losses were specifically intended for the law to be applied if there is no damage or economic loss or damage or loss is less than 10 000 the offense is a misdemeanor not a felony this bill does not satisfy everyone but it does represent a reasonable compromise in

statutory provision commonly referred to as the solomon amendment was first enacted in 1994 and has subsequently been amended over the past several years however the basic underlying premise of the provision is that a college or university that denies military recruiters access equal to other recruiters would lose their federal funds the supreme court found that the solomon amendment does not

the ports middle east peace initiatives hour that is not a level playing field president made is to put in jeopardy the security of our portsand other critical landside homeland security functions this oman agreement explicitly paves the way for companies like dubai ports world to gain control of our ports those who disagree with this argument refuse to acknowledge that the fact that in the bestcase scenario with the president utilizing every national security waiver at his disposal the final decision on such a matter will be left out of unitedstates hands and left to an international tribunal i would think the republican leadership could at least agree that we should not outsource our core homeland security functions and decisions in a country like oman where meager rights for workers fall well below the international labor organizations standards where the sultan can change any law by decree and where there are no independent unions congress should be especially vigilant we must ensure that any trade agreement with oman or any country contains hard and fast labor standards the oman fta does not this is a loser on homeland security for job security and for the best

ambiguity there may be in present law when we began working on this bill on a bipartisan basis at the subcommittee level there was a concern when drafted that the bill went too far and actually criminalizes current legitimate timehonored practices by lawabiding merchants who legally purchased authentic goods and repackage them in various ways to enhance sales of such goods we forged an

that would temporarily increase the borrowing authority of the federal emergency management agencys national flood insurance program this bill was introduced by my friend and colleague from ohio mr ney in response to the terrible destruction that has resulted from hurricane katrina communities across the gulf coast from louisiana mississippi and alabama have been wiped out massive numbers of people are virtual refugees in their own country and though it will take weeks to determine the full extent of this tragedy it is likely thatjthousands of our fellow citizens lost their lives for those whosurvive the task has turned towards recovery one of the first things many will be thinking about is whether or not their homes and possessions will be covered by insurance though standard homeowners insurance policies do not cover flood damage many residents of the areas affected by katrina were required to purchase flood insurance because their homes were located on a floodplain as a result femas national flood insurance program nfip will soon begin the difficult task of assessing damages and paying claims under the national flood insurance act of 1968 fema has the authority toborrow up to 1 5 billion from the treasury in order to pay flood claims fema has exercised its borrowing privileges in the past and has always repaid the treasury in full this 1 5 billion will be used to ensure that the program has sufficient funding on a cash basis in the short term clearly this will not be enough h r 3669 will allow the national flood insurance program to borrow an additional 2 billion if necessary to make payments on initial claims while the full extent of the damage is assessed this borrowing authority is temporary like all other such funds requested by the nfip from treasury this money will be paid back in full once the nfip has had time to recover from the hurricane in the meantime the financial services committee will continue our oversight of the nfip and work to address any changes that may be necessary in light of katrina we in the congress have put in a great deal of work over the past several years to ensure the viability of the program culminating in the bunningbereuterblumenauer flood insurance reform act of 2004 this act expanded the use of mitigation grants and requires homeowners to participate in flood mitigation programs to prevent frequent flood losses we are now faced with a situation that will surely test the nfips ability to quickly verify policies assess damages and pay claims i look forward to working with my colleagues on the committee particulary mr ney and mr baker to ensure that americans continue to have access to affordable and effective flood insurance i urge my colleagues to join me in assisting

massachusetts act of 2005 this legislation authorizes the national park service to enter into a cooperative agreement with the commonwealth of massachusetts on behalf of springfield technical community college over 30 years ago in 1974 my predecessor congressman edward boland and senator kennedy were successful in creating the springfield armory national historic site this bolandkennedy legislation set in motion three decades of cooperation between the national park service which manages the armory museum and springfield technical community college the national park service and springfield technical community college are neighbors that together occupy the national historic site the springfield armory was the first national armory in the united states in fact the armory was founded in 1777 when the site was selected as the location for a magazine and laboratory for the development production and storage of guns and powder during the american revolution following the american revolutionary war in 1794 congress officially established the springfield armory george washington visited the site which also happened to be the site of shays rebellion for much of the 19th century the springfield armory developed manufactured and supplied most of the small arms used by the united states armed services the springfield armory national historic site has a rich heritage that is an integral part of our nations history in 1968 the armory was deactivated as a military installation and in 1974 congress established the national historic site the national park service has operated the armory museum on these grounds and it houses the most outstanding and historically significant arms collection in the country the future and fate of both the armory museum and springfield technical community college are inextricably linked many of the historic buildings on the site are actually located on the colleges properly not national park service land although a visitor to the campus would not be able to tell where nps property ends and college property begins the land outside the portion of the site administered by nps isknown as the preservation control area these collegeowned buildings are subject to strict architectural and preservation rules many of these historic buildings owned by the college must be preerved and maintained pursuant to standards defined by the secretary of the interior but these historic buildings are in a state of great disrepair and the college cannot easily move to maintain and preserve them absent the full participation of the park service not only does this deterioration of the facilities hurt the college but also undermines the attractiveness of the national park service area including the armory museum my legislation seeks to recognize and update the partnership that has existed over these many years between the park service and the college by authorizing the park service to enter into a cooperative agreement with the commonwealth for nps to provide financial assistance to the college for the purpose of maintaining preserving renovating and rehabilitating the many historic structures within the springfield armory national historic site the park service frequently enters into such cooperative agreements where the object of the agreement is of direct benefit to the park service and its mission or for other public purposes if these great historic buildings on the site can be renovated with the assistance of the park service it will bring forward a more vibrant and attractive historic site and museum the park service and the college will be able to partner on many joint educational ventures that utilize these revitalized historic facilities the springfield armory national historic site is a treasure to the city of springfield the commonwealth of massachusetts and to the nation the site is in desperate need of renovation enactment of this legislation is the first step toward ensuring the
