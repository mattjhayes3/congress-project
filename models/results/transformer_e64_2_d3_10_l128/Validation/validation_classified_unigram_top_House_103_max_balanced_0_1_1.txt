mr lasater was known to use cocaine and distributed cocaine freely at many parties and he was convicted convicted by the arkansas authorities of trafficking in cocaine he received a prison sentence and his prison sentence was partially reduced after he got out of prison he was in a halfway house for a few months he was pardoned exonerated by thengovernor clinton his friend during the time that he was incarcerated in this halfway househe really was not in a penitentiary he was in a halfway house most of the time during the time he was incarcerated a lady named patsy thomasson who is his chief financial officer took over control of his businesses and she ran his businesses as the chief financial officer while mr lasater was away at prison when he got out and was pardoned by president clinton ms thomasson continued to be the chief financial officer of his companies and she also became the chief officer of what was called the phoenixthe phoenix group a subsidiary of the phoenix group was the phoenix mortgage co and mr lasater became the president of the phoenix mortgage co so the relationship between patsy thomasson and mr lasater and bill clinton was of long duration and continued even after he went to jail and was out as a matter of fact mr lasater paid an 8 000 drug debt drug bill for cocaine use that bill clintons brother had incurred so he paid off a drug bill for bill clintons brother so there was a very close relationship between the clintons and mr lasater now patsy thomasson to give you some more background my colleagues now is one of the chief officers at the white house she is the personnel director at the white house she conducts quote unquote the drug testing of personnel at the white house now yesterday the people of albuquerque nm awoke to another tale of corruption that may involve the president president clinton the front page of tuesdays albuquerque journal reports that ajoint federal state narcotics investigation of the presidents friend mr dan lasater was called off before it was completed a former arkansas state police investigator j n doc delaughter told two journal investigative reporters that the investigation included lasater a close friend of the president and highdollar contributor to mr clintons campaign and the presidents brother roger clinton delaughter said the investigation was cut off prematurely for political reasons the state police investigators say he briefed the clintonappointed arkansas state police director tommy goodwin twice by telephone about the lasater clinton investigation on both occasions tommy goodwin the state police investigator was using a phone in then governor clintons personal office mr delaughter who was then on the force was not sure whether or not governor clinton now president clinton overheard the conversations but it is very clear that governor clinton now president clinton was very close to the arkansas state police director who was getting the information about the investigation delaughter said and i quote moneys could have been seized and planes could have been seized because we had evidence that cocaine was being used on planes used by mr lasater as i said before mr lasater quite frequently flew then governor bill clinton around in these planes delaughter told the newspaper that he and another investigator were barred from interviews with lasater roger clinton and another lasater associate in other words his superiors on the state police said you cant go and investigate this they stopped him cold in his tracks eventually lasater was convicted of possession and distribution of cocaine as i said before he was sentenced to 30 months in prison but served only 10 months most of which was in a halfway house before being released on parole lasater was later paroled by his friend thengovernor bill clinton now right in the thick of all this is patsy thomasson who is now the personnel director at the white house she took over the daytoday operations of the lasater companies while lasater was in prison as i speak to you tonight she is responsible for the daily administration of the clinton white house the newspaper is careful to point out that there is no evidence to support any indictment of ms thomasson or establish a direct connection between the illegal activity that led to the conviction of lasater and the presidents brother now harkening back to an earlier washington scandal one has to wonder what did ms thomasson know about the illegal activity which surrounded her and when did she realize that her boss lasater was a largescale drug pusher the albuquerque journal found no one in that firm no one in that firm other than ms thomasson the chief financial officer had any doubt about what was going on in the lasater companies i quote the newspapers story former lasater employees interviewed by the fbi said tney left or joined the firm between 1982 and 1985 because of its reputation tor cocaine use as the chief financial officer for lasater during that period are we to believe that ms thomasson now the chief personnel director at the whitehouse haa no clue about what was going on in the company the albuquerque journal reported that the fbi received sworn statements from lasater employees therethat were there at christmas parties at which cocaine was available in ashtrays cocaine was freely available at lasater company outings in lexington ky hot springs ar and elsewhere according to lasater employees reporters dick lynch and mike gallagher quote federal grand jury testimony which said that cocaine was served like hors doeuvres but we are asked to believe that the chief financial officer even though everybody else in that firm knew about it knew nothing of this and we are talking about ms thomasson ms thomasson patsy thomasson was a key player in the lasater operations the newspaper cites numerous public and court records which show her as president of the various lasater enterprises including new mexicos angel fire corp which lasater purchased in 1984 and sold in 1987 articles of incorporation show that thomasson as an incorporator of the phoenix group which was the successor to lasater co records of the sale of angel fire in 1987 to a texas investment partnership bear patsy thomassons signature she was tied to mr lasater all the way through all of his operations at the time of this sale the customs service and the fbi were busy investigating money laundering and drug trafficking she signed the partnership agreement the two agencies formed an organized crime drug enforcement task force and named lasater as the chief target of the probe pasty thomasson was given power of attorney power of attorney by mr lasater in january 1987 while he was in prison and surprisingly appears to still be acting as a registered agent for lasaters phoenix mortgage co calls by the newspaper to patsy thomasson at the white house were not returned i understand ms thomasson has taken leave of absense from her position as the director of administration for the president i continue to be concerned about the presidents association with people like mr lasater pardoning him after he was convicted of dealing in drugs giving him 65 million i believe in state bonds during the time he was being investigated and later indicted by the arkansas state police and the federal authorities for drug trafficking i continue to be concerned about his association president clintons with people like mr lasater and ms thomasson in the very limited hearings that we had on

request for an increase in his white house budget when all is said and done the appropriations committees response funds white house activities at precisely the same level they were funded in 1992 george bushs last year yet as a candidate bill clinton talked about a 25percent cut in the white house staff many anericans are wondering at current levels whether we are not paying too much already particularly in light of the continuing allegations of grave misconduct by members of the white house staff yet bill clinton the man who promised a 25percent cut tb the american people has this year proposed an 8percent increase for the white house budgetv i congratulate my colleague the kdntlelnan from florida who did not see fit to give mr clinton more money but is instead proposing that we hold him to at least some of the spending cuts that he proposed as a candidate in light of what the white house staff has been up to it seems to me they hardly deserve a raise just 18 months ago the clinton white house started out with travelgate it consisted in the firing and smearing of honest career employees in the white house for the benefit of the clintons relatives and campaign workers even the white house press corps were scandalized by such a noxious mixture of cronyism political manipulation of law enforcement and scapegoating the likes of which washington has not seen since the spoils system was first set into motion by andrew jackson all of this certainly set the tone for what we have now come to know as the prototypical clinton scandal the cornercutting the greed cronyism and above all the deceit there has been more serious misconduct by the clinton white house than travelgate but certainly nothing more contemptible than firing and smearing longtime apolitical lowlevel government workers in order to benefit the presidents cousin and his wealthiest friends no less disgraceful was the tampering with the fbi by the white house counsels office the office in which i once served as senior associate counsel to the president the white house counsel is supposed to be preeminently responsible for preventing ethical lapses by the president and senior white house officials instead it was this white house counsels office that was the very source of the scandal including flagrant qbvious misconduct by white house lawyer william kennedy who did not contact the attorney general who did not contact fbi director sessions but interfered directly in the operations of the fbi to target specific individuals yet kennedy remains in the white house two reprimands and several additional scandals later as a seemingly permanent sourceof ethical trouble for this president and the other white house staff as we all know mr kennedy like webb hubble and vince foster and hillary rodham clinton was part ofthe same law firm that represented arkansas wheeler dealers in whitewater and madison savings and loan and dozens of other transactions including the clintons own personal finances one of the most unsavory aspects of this staff arrangement is the cronyism from the first it turned the highest echelon s of the white house legal staff and the justice department into little more than the washington branch office of the kose law firm the predictable result was the president and hillary rodham clinton felt they could treat the white house lawyers as their personal lawyers bu t federal law prohibits government employees including the white house counsels office from performing private services for the president yet shortly before his death vince foster was working in his white house office in the west wing on government time at taxpayer expense at preparing the delinquent whitewater tax returns not only was this improper because it was the personal investment business of the clintons rather than official business but it also covered a period well before the clintons took office most observers who have commented on this fact have speculated on its relevance to mr fosters death as a former member of the counsels office i am at least as struck by its obvious impropriety using a fulltime government lawyer to work on the clinton familys personal business affairs is clearly improper i recall very well the extraordinary pains that for example president reagan took to ensure that none of the white house lawyers worked on his personal business his tax returns were prepared by his own private lawyers and his accountants even his blind trust which unlike the clintons was set up before his inauguration was prepared at his personal expense obviously the clinton white house does not follow the same ethical guidelines what does this mean from a budget standpoint obviously it means today in 1994 we are already paying for too much white house staff yet the size and the composition of the white house staff whose budget we are debating foday is itself another mystery the clintons have repeatedly denied requests from congress for a list of white house staff members and salary levels"], [0.0019661104306578636, 0.0019661104306578636, 0, "some years ago there was a movie with bob hope and phyllis diller called boy did i get a wrong number i think i have got a pretty good case of boy did i get a wrong number tonight i got a mailing at my office within the last couple of days from the speaker of the house not the acting speaker but the real speaker of the house the gentleman from washington and it was headlined how you robert s walker can help president clinton succeed i opened it up and it has got a lot of fascinating stuff in here about how i can help the president mainly how i can help the president by sending money to the democrat congressional committee and also by sending back their survey but i was fascinated by some of what was in this letter it was addressed to me i mean it says dear robert s walker and then it says to me you are one of a select group of democrats from around the nation whom im asking to take part in this important survey now obviously this is a computer glitch that got this to me but it did reveal some very fascinating things for example there is an underlying paragraph here that says unfortunately newt gingrich and his rightwing allies succeeded in cutting our congressional majority in last years election and all i could say was yippee and so that was the right thing i also kind of had the feeling at that point that i ought to start flapping my right wing but the fact is that they are admitting here that the gentleman from georgia has in fact gotten his message across to the american people and that we are in fact beginning to win new majorities but then it goes on and it tells the american people a couple of fascinating things it says here because the success or failure of the clinton administration depends upon which party has control of the congress righto i say to my colleagues if you wanted to have the clinton administration succeed what tom foley is telling you in this letter is you want democrats in the congress if you dont want the clinton administration to succeed with higher taxes and more spending you want to change the congress the gentleman from washington is absolutely right and i am pleased that he sent me this letter then he went on down here this is a fascinating little p s that they put on the letter it says if the republicans gain more control in congress it will severely cripple bill clintons agenda well let me tell you after spending some time at home over the last several weeks and listening to what people are having to say about bill clintons agenda my guess is that this is an admission by speaker foley that the republicans are going to take control of the congress let me repeat that to you it says if republicans gain more control in congress it will severely cripple bill clintons agenda america at this point wants to cripple bill clintons agenda they have decided that this tax and spend is not what they want tom foley is telling you america what you should do tom foley is saying elect republicans to congress because if republicans gain control of the congress we will stop bill clintons agenda thanks speaker foley for this letter this is a very revealing document i appreciate it now i did notice that you asked me to send a contribution i do not think you are going to get one you asked me to return the survey i do not think i am going to do that on a serious note i am a little concerned about the fact that it arrived at my rayburn house office building because solicitations of funding in a federal office

buildings at historically black colleges and universities this bill was introduced on august 6 1993 and was approved by the natural resources committee on november 10 1993 many of the historic structures located on historically black college and university campuses are threatened and a significant effort is needed to preserve and protect them the department of the interior in cooperation with the united negro college fund has launched a project to preserve these structures in 1988 a special survey to identify candidates for inclusion in this program generated responses from 46 hbcus nominating 144 structures for consideration the department and uncf eventually selected 11 of the most historically significant and critically threatened structures on such campuses the department and uncf estimate that it will cost 20 million to preserve these particular structures and uncf has agreed to match a departmental contribution of 10 million for this purpose under the hbcu historic preservation initiative however no funds were requested or appropriated for this purpose for fiscal year 1994 h r 2921 as reported by the committee on natural resources authorizes the use of appropriations from the historic preservation fund to provide grants for the preservation and restoration of historic buildings and structures at eligible hbcus in fiscal year 1995 a total of 20 million would be authorized 5 million of which may be used only for fisk university and 10 million of which may be used only for grants to those hbcus identified for inclusion in the interior departments hbcu historic preservation initiative for each of fiscal years 1996 1997 and 1998 15 million would be authorized federal funding for structures listed on the national register of historic places must be matched equally unless the secretary determines that an extreme emergency exists or that such waiver is in the public interest the bill as amended also stipulates that structures receiving federal funds may be altered later only with the concurrence of the secretary these structures represent the hopes and achievements of a group of people denied equal opportunity and justice and who succeeded despite the imposition of almost insurmountable legal and social obstacles in many cases the buildings were constructed by the students themselves many of them former slaves and came under constant attack particularly during the civil rights struggles of the 1960s and 1970s as symbols of africanamerican pride and progress national park system resources representing africaffamerican themes are notably scarce these institutions provided the only avenue to a better life for many africanamericans and provided this country with some of its greatest leaders including many current members of congress the inadequacy of the africanamerican theme representation in the national park system makes this program to recognize the importance of hbcus to our nation critical

1977 remains available until appropriated of the funds appropriated for historic preservation through the hpf the amounts cited in this bill may be used for preservation specifically at hbcus this bill does not authorize new spending but allows already authorized funds to be spent on these significant and underfunded resources the testimony received at the hearing from the many presidents of hbcus provided moving and eloquent affirmation of the significance of these resources and their importance to the africanamerican experience many of our colleagues have expressed strong support for this legislation and several were able to attend the hearing and voice powerful personal confirmation of the education and cultural values represented by these structures with enactment of this

referring specifically to north korea many have in the last few weeks read extensive media coverage on north korea and the situation that we have on the korean peninsula this is a situation that must be taken by every american citizen very very seriously it is a situation that directly involves 37 000 american soldiers and it involves probably 14 000 to 16 000 american civilians and if a conflict were to break out on the korean peninsula it would involve the entire world not only from an economic point of view but certainly the stability of peace in the world as we know it so i would ask tonight that you bear with me as i discuss a little about korea we are going to talk for a few minutes about the history of korea we are going to talk about the politics ofkorea we are going to talk about the military readiness of korea we are going to talk about the nuclear situation over in korea and finally talk about a few solutions what direction should this country take in regard to north korea let me start out by defining north korea which in my opinion is a lot like a grizzly bear i am from colorado and bears are a big thing back there a grizzly bear and grizzly by the way stands for the word horrible the horrible bear that is why the grizzly bear got its name grizzly bears are sometimes predictable and sometimes not so predictable but there are some things you can do with the grizzly bear in order to judge that behavior the best that we know bow first of all obviously you never pick on the cubs second of all you prepare yourself for a confrontation if you are going up into the high country of alaska or canada where grizzly bears are known to roam you prepare before you enter into those mountainous territories so you are not unprepared when the grizzly bear approaches it has always been thought that the grizzly bear can sense fear if the grizzly bear does not sense fear the grizzly bear turns and runs it the grizzly bear senses fear you have got a real problem on your hands korea is not a whole lot different than that north korea in my opinion now to start this evening let me mention a couple of articles that i think would be very helpful for the average joe and average jane out there that want to know a little more about what is happening in korea i thought time magazine june 13 1994 had an excellent article in addition to that so that you have a geographical understanding of what north and south korea are about and what military options might be available i suggest that you look at the map contained in that july 13 time magazine article in addition i know that many of you may not subscribe to the heritage foundation an excellent foundation here in washington but they have a memorandum it is no 224 memorandum no 224 called defusing north koreas nuclear threat this is written by darryl plunk darryl plunk is an expert in korean matters i know darryl in fact i was in korea i just returned from korea about a month ago i spent time with darryl over there he is well respected i think his article addresses very clearly the kind of challengethat we face on the korean peninsula both of those articles i would recommend to you for some very basic knowledge on what our situation is in korea let us start out by looking at a little geography to assist us here i have brought down a map as most of you know south korea is down on the southern end obviously it is divided by what is called the dmz the dmz runs right along in this area above that is north korea north korea is a very mountainous type of terrain it has a lot of weather similar to the state of colorado right now however the peninsula up there is going through the monsoon rains north korea the access across the dmz is limited again that map in time magazine lays that out very well for you up here on the northern tnd of north korea the largest border on the peninsula is with the country of china we are going to come pack to china and discuss china a little more when we talk about economic sanctions to give you a little history north korea is a dictatorship in my opinion it is a communist dictatorship i noticed the north koreans have recently continued to refer to themselves as a socialist society it is a clear communist type of dictatorship in north korea the dictator in north korea is a gentleman by the name of kim iisong kim iisong is estimated to be 82 or 83 years old and he was installel into power by josef stalin in about the late 1940s in 1950 in june 1950 much to the surprise of the united states congress much to the surprise of the president of the united states president truman this dictator kim ilsong who is the dictator that rules the country today under the pretext of military exercises launched a surprise attack against south korea there is no need to say much more about that attack because we all know about the korean war ironically it was never declared as a war there were still 114 000 fatalities from our country alone so the same dictator that ordered it is the dictator we are having difficulties with today why do i bring that history up it is important history to understand that this dictator has taken it upon himself before to immerse his people into a very intense war and we cannot underestimate his courage if you call it that his insanity if you call it that or his just pure stubbornness if you call it that to launch a military attack now let us move very briefly to the military comparisons between north and south korea again i do not mean to keep referring to that time magazine article but i think it is necessary because that article is very simple and lays out some of these comparisons when you look at the numbers of troops north korea outnumbers the south koreans and american troops 2 to 1 now in south korea we have a united nations command we also have the unitedstates forces we have the south korean forces the combined command in the forces the commanding general over there is a very competent verycapable very tough general by the name of general locke i had the opportunity when i was in korea to spend many hours with him and his staff i came away from there feeling very confident about the military leadership we have got if in factwe provide those military people with the necessary arsenal and tools to carry out their job now let me give you some comparisons north korea 1 200 000 troops south korea and the united states about 235 000 troops south korea has the probability of calling out reserves of 2 million more people north korea the latest numbers i saw has the potential of calling out 6 million people in reserves main battle tanks 3 700 in north korea and approximately 1 900 in south korea artillery 10 000these are multiple rocket launchers10 000 in north korea about 4 600 in south korea air defense guns and this is an important statisticair defense guns and surfacetoair missiles 18 000 in north korea and about 1 500 in south korea let us talk for a minute about the importance of air ballistic missiles korea does not need a nuclear missile to launch an attack against south korea in fact i personally would be surprised if they used a nuclear weapon my primary concern with north korea is that they are going to sell these nuclear weapons but they do not need a nuclear weapon to launch a very devastating very deadly and horrible war on the korean peninsula take a look the most strategic point you have got in south korea is the community of seoul the capitalof south korea onehalf by the way of the countrys population onehalf of the countrys gross national product and less than 30 to 40 miles away from north korean ballistic missiles you do not need even more than one missile to launch into a city of 15 million people to create a panic can you imagine a missile going off in the dmz landing in seoul the kind of panic it would wreak in fact i think panic is going to be our biggest problem if in factand god forbidbut if we do have a military confrontation panic will be our biggest problem these ballistic missiles are located along the dmz several key areas up here and they have a significant ballistic missile system now a lot of people look at the korean peninsula and we should all be justifiably proud about the job the kind of operation we did in the persian gulf iraq was rumored to be this huge force that we would suffer huge casualties that this was an army of might the united stateswent into the persian gulf with the pride of our american people our american service people and we got a quick and decisive victory not so in korea not so at all north korea will have a real fighting force it is ironic that several years ago the north koreans tried to attack the blue house which is the same as our white house in the united states the home of the president in south korea twenty north koreans 20 north koreans attacked the blue house they were completely surrounded very quickly those 20 north koreans had no chance absolutely no chance of survival except through surrender no chance and every one of those north koreans fought to their death even under those circumstances this force has got a heavy militia now we clearly have air superiority north korea has some of the most sophisticated tunnel systems in the world they have a philosophy that the peninsula should be reunified they have unaltered loyalty to their dictator kim flsong by the way kim i1songs son about 52 or 53 years old while the loyalty is not as intense for the son there is still a following of the father son in north korea so this will be a force and unlike the persian gulf this will be if the conflict occurs a conflict in which we suffer immense casualties which will re quire a tremendous amount of resources devoted to that peninsula to sustain that action or hopefully not but to retake the peninsula should the north koreans be successful enough about the military issue let us talk about the issue that has heated up and where we are today let us talk about the nuclear issue we have always been concerned about a nuclear arms race over in east asia east asia is a very important economic center for the entire world the security for eastern asia has been provided primarily by the united states since the end of world war ii for the most part that economic security blanket and military security blanket has provided a great deal of stability east asia has been fairly stable granted we had the vietnam war and so on but i am talking about the korean peninsula and japan and taiwan we have seen very prosperous economies the economy in south korea is a tremendous economy there is good leadership in south korea north korea has a very very poor economy but the nuclear issue and what concerns us is that east asia would get into a nuclear race several years ago we had a number of countries well over 100 sign what is called the nonproliferation agreement what that agreement calls for or preventshopes to prevent through the enforcement of an association called iaearemember those initials iaea because you will hear those a lot as we talk about the nuclear issue the nonproliferation agreement was a hope that we all had that we could stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons and instead we could bring this world together as an economic center so to speak and that the wars and the fears of nuclear war or the fears of a nuclear weapon falling into the hands of a third world country or a country without stability could be minimized well the only way that the non proliferation agreement works obviously is if the participants of the nonproliferation agreement agree with its terms north korea has refused over and over and over and over again to comply with the agreement that it signed on the nonproliferation agreement our president in response to this noncompliance in november of last year made a very clear statement to the north koreans you must never have excuse me i am wrong it is not you must not it is you can never have a nuclear weapon well our president has spoken some very strong words remember my comparison to the grizzly bear if you come face to face with a grizzly bear and you stand there and you look right at him you do not have a gun you have no choice you stand and you look strong the grizzly bear in all likelihood unless you have a cub there will walk away but if the grizzly bear senses that you are going to back off the grizzly bear knows weakness it is the same thing with north korea north korea understands two things they understand strength and they understand weakness if you have a president who makes a strong statement he needs to be able to back that statement up since novemberand i am not trying to be partisan because i think when we talk about foreign affairs we have to lift ourselves above partisanship and worry about the welfare of this country and the welfare of the entire world but since that november statement our country has shown in my opinion a great deal of weakness in its negotiations with north korea example north korea we know has about nine suspect sites for the development of nuclear weapons in korea now remember we have limited intelligence in north korea we really rely very heavily on satellite intelligence and satellites of course cannot pick up what is going on on the ground and we have to have good weather north korea is the most closed society in the world it is very difficult to get ground intelligence out of north korea it is very difficult to do ground intelligence out of north korea very difficult to do this so of the nine sites under the nonproliferation agreement a team from the iaea is allowed to go in and inspect these sites the north koreans have said no then they said yes then they said maybe then they said no then they said okay then they said no then they said come on over then they said no then they said come over and look at a couple of sites then they said no then they said come on over and we will let you look at seven sites but not the two suspect sites this last week they said you can never look at the two most highly suspect sites where you think we are developing nuclear weapons i saw a comparison it said it is kind of like walking through the customs when one comes into this country walk through customs and tell the agent yeah you can go ahead ive got nine suitcases you can go ahead and look at seven of them but im going to point out to you which seven suitcases you can look at the other two suitcases which i pick you cant look at it is clearly flying in the face of the nonproliferation agreement which is really much broader than the nonproliferation agreement because we are talking about a country like korea who soon will have the technology to do what korea is doing and if we do not have an agreement that is enforceable we will have an arms race throughout the world an arms race that the next generation the next generation will have a very difficult tirm dealing with so this agreement means a lot more than just relationships between the united states and north korea or south korea and north korea it really talks about the beginning of an arms race let us talk about some of the ideas dealing with the failure of north korea to comply with the nonproliferation agreement or the inspections i say first of all if you look at north korea they always pay attention as i said earlier when you speak from a position of strength we unfortunately in the last year and a half or couple of years have shown some weakness on foreign affairs in haiti in somalia in bosnia and in north korea and so the north koreans i think believe they can play cat and mouse with us in fact i think they rather enjoy it its a very dangerous game back to the grizzly bear its kind of like poking a grizzly bear when its asleep if its in hibernation and youre sure its in hibernation no problem if its not you better watch out so the nonagreement of north korea and some of the options that are available to force them back into the agreement should be discussed one of those is and i hear it from my colleagues and that is to take a preemptive strike we know for example up here in yongbyon up in that area right in here that there is a nuclear site up there a nuclear reactor there in fact that is the one my colleagues have been reading a lot about where the rods have been removed in the last couple of weeks and there are some that would suggest we take a preemptive strike that we certainly have the capabilities to take that facility out in my opinion a preemptive military strike would be crazy it is not well thought out a preemptive military strike against north korea can assure us of one thing and that is a war on the korean peninsula a war that will have devastating results a war in which many of our 37 000 troops and many of the thousands of subsequent troops that we sent over to korea will lose their lives will pay the ultimate price so a first strike is not a good option even if we carried out the first strike from a military point of view it may not be successful if the key ingredients that we are tying to destroy are stored deep underground and the probability is that they are stored deep underground even if we are successful and we hit a nuclear facility the unfortunate thing is if we set loose radiation the trade winds tend to go this direction would go over seoulremember the population center of south koreaand eventually make its way down over tokyo ind over japan so a first strike preemptive strike against nuclear facilities is not a good option in my opinion will simply start a war well what is the next thing well we heard the president talked a lot in the last few weeks and we heard some very educated scholars and some very welllearned people on korea suggest economic sanctions there are two factors for economic sanctions to work first of all china has to agree that it will not veto the economic sanctions in the united nations security council and second of all even if china does not veto those economic sanctions that china will agree to enforce the economic sanctions remember i said earlier that north korea is the most isolated country in the world they do not have a lot of trade like the united states does for example they are not like taiwan where they trade all over the world or japan they trade primarily with one country and that country is china here is the border remember we looked at the border earlier if that border is not secure if china does not exercise the economic sanctions along that border then economic sanctions will cost this country tens of millions of dollars we will have very minimal impact upon north korea and we will not accomplish what i think is the key goal china in just the last couple weeks the president and this is incredible to me the president the secretary of state have said on and off again that china they think they are going to get china to cooperate with us china is not going to cooperate with economic sanctions they are not going to let this occur just in the last week and a half or so ago china has said that north korea are the quote blood brothers does that sound like the kind of talk that is going to get cooperation from china especially after we have already given to them the mostfavorednation status so we really do not have much to swap with them i do not think china wants to see a conflict on the korean peninsula but their relationship with north korea goes deep remember we were about to overrun the koreans when we finally launched our counterattack in the korean war in 1950 the reason that it was stopped the reason that the korean war came to a stalemate is because china dumped its troops in to face us from the north china has a long history with north korea and they are not about to put that aside to assist the united states with economic sanctions now japan is beginning to play a very important role in this many of my colleagues have probably heard the events of the last couple of days where korea has come out and given a very clear warning to japan back off if you dont back off we have got missiles that can hit your countrys mainland this is more of a confrontation between the south and north than between the united states we have a good ally in japan we have a good understanding with japan but look at the politics in japan for a few minutes first of all there are about a half a million korean citizens who are now living in japan and these descendants of korea came from japan over the years between say about 1910 and 1945 when japan occupied the korean peninsula and brought slave labor into japan and as a result there have been descendants through the generations so about 500 000 korean descendants live in japan they are very loyal to the korean peninsula and they send a great deal of money about a billion dollars estimated as high as 1 8 billion in sympathetic money to korea to north korea every year now the japanese the leadership as my colleagues know they have had a lot of turmoil in their leadership and it does not appear that that leadership is entirely stable they are going through some very trying times we have very capable leadership in japan but japan is getting a little i think getting a little cautious about being involved in economic sanctions against north korea and japan we have said to japan look you of anybody ought to be concerned about this you will be if youre not already well within the range of nuclear korean missiles and those korean missiles could soon contain a nuclear warhead you have got to participate with us we have got to stop this before it gets out of hand but when it comes time to really do something about it as i said earlier japan is very cautious i think they are going to have a very difficult time stepping in there and telling their citizens who are korean descendants that they can no longer send money to their families in north korea well what kind of options do we really have we have talked a little about the history we have talked about the military we have talked about the consequences of a war on the korean peninsula if there were a military conflict in korea what kind of options do we have and again i would refer my colleagues i think to mr plunks article heritage foundation no 224 and by the way it is dated june 2 1994 it lays out some options i would like to add a little to some of those options first of all our president needs to be very strong in his message to the north koreans i believe that our message our president has to go further than he has gone now our secretary of defense mr perry i think has done a fairly commendable job in dealing with the north korean situation since he has come into office but it has to go above mr perry it has to go directly to the president the president has told north korea that their country would be destroyed as they know it i am not sure they take the president seriously i do not think they took the president serious since november when he said they cannot really have a nuclear weapon and then flipflopped around as to whether they should have one a few of them are ok or so forth our president needs to make it very very clear that north korea should not miscalculate what the intentions of the united states of america are first of all i think the president needs to assure north korea that we would not take a preemptive strike against their country but in the same statement the president needs to make unequivocally clear to north korea that should north korea launch an attack against south korea and the united states that we will use whatever weapon in our arsenal is necessary to destroy their country in other words north korea a military conflict would be a gross and fatal miscalculation on your part so we need a firm statement from the president we need to be prepared militarily again if you are going out into the mountains up in alaska or canada into that high country you need to be prepared if you are prepared you are not going to have any difficulty north korea understands strength we have got an excellent command force over in korea the south korean forces that i met with and commanding officers i felt were very capable but we need to shore up our defense we need to immediately in our opinion begin to move more naval force into the area and i think we need to do this very prominently so that people see what is going on i think we need to shore up our capability with our air superiority i think that we have to have a carrier task force an additional carrier task force moved into the area i think that we have got to prepare our troops for war and i think our troops are prepared but i think that north koreaneeds to get the message that should they decide to engage in a war that the united states of america is not only ready for the war but ready to end the war very quickly on our terms if you have a strong defense i do not think there is any better way to stop a military conflict than that defense it used to be in the cold war we talked about deterrence and there is a difference between deterrence and defense deterrence is where let us say there is a fellow named mel mel is sitting out here and mel has a missile and i have a missile now mel is smart enough to know that if he uses his missile against me i can still use my missile against him so mel and i just kind of stay at arms length with each other that is called deterrence deterrence will not work in korea what will work in korea is a strong strong de fense i think what we need to do in addition is the president needs to make a personal trip i think the president needs to visit china i think the president needs to visit japan now the president found time to visit oxford university mr president the most serious international problem that we have right now is korea the two most important allies that we have in korea are japan and china and i support you 100 percent in working with those two partners but maybe you ought to go sit down with them maybe you ought to tell them the importance of their cooperation in nonproliferation of nuclear weapons in east asia maybe we ought to make it clear to japan that it cannot continue to allow its citizens to send 1 billion or 2 billion a year to korea if in turn they expect our young american soldiers to go over and be willing to give their lives in defense of japan i think that our president has got a lot of groundwork to cover i think he is capable of doing it there has been a lot of criticism about the presidents military background there has been a lot of criticism and i happen to think a lot of this criticism is justified on our presidents weakness in foreign policy but our president does have the capability to communicate and if ever there was a time for communication if ever there was a time for us to get behind our president and hope that he could communicate in the clearest of terms it is now on the korean peninsula to the people of this country and to my colleagues in here this is a very very critical situation it is a situation that we cannot allow to continue without clear policy and a clear message and a showing of strength we do not want a war on the korean peninsula any more than you want to run into a wounded grizzly bear on a trail up in the mountains you do not want that to happen finally and let me conclude with this one of the things that i think is very important for us is to approach north korea and say whats up we know you know what is going to happen if you continue to push these nuclear weapons you have got a lot better future for your country and a lot better future for the people of your country if you join the market look at what has happened in russia look how much chinahas improved look at your own blood brothers down in south korea look what its done to their economy when they come into a capitalized type of system you dont have to ct~ange from communism to capitalism open up your doors open up your doors to the rest of the world stop your isolation it is a winwin deal for you north korea if you stop the isolation come into the world start trading with the world youre going to have north korea countries throughout the entire world giving you foreign aid youre going to have countries throughout the entire world wanting to invest in your country to put money into your country what is wrong with a country like north korea when they have such isolation not long ago i had an opportunity to give some graduation speeches and i talked about the difference between an 18yearold in north korea who would probably never taste ice cream in his lifetime has probably never seen a tv certainly has never flown on an airplane unless it is a military aircraft has never owned a car probably has never driven a car has never had an opportunity to go to department stores and pick out clothes has never had an opportunity to go down and buy a soda pop or enjoy some of the finer points of life compare that with the south korean 18yearold who has had those opportunities ice cream is abundant tvs modern life it is there north korea can provide that for its citizens and keep the hierarchy that it has they can preserve that leadership all that leadership has to do is open up to the rest of the world i hope that that is what north korea does every american should hope that that is what north korea does it would stop the proliferation at least starting on the korean peninsula it would show that there is an effective way to deal with nuclear proliferation and military confrontation without missiles i hope that is what happens but we as a country must prepare that that may not be what happens we as a country must be prepared not only for the best of times but for the worst of times right now the pendulum seems to be tipping toward the worst of times on the korean peninsula do not go to bed tonight thinking that there is going to be an attack tomorrow but do go to bed tonight thinking about the consequences if there is an attack tomorrow and the importance of our president of the leadership of this country to step forward and make sure that a military confrontation on the korean peninsula does not take

taxes by 402 billion 402 billion = billion in new taxes and 74 billion in hidden taxes that they are not owning up to 402 billion their net spending cuts over 5 years are 3 billion and that includes 112 billion in defense cuts so if you take the defense cuts out that were going to take place anyhow you are actually increasing domestic spending by 109 billion you tell the american people you are going to get control of spending you are going to cut this deficit and you are increasing domestic spending 109 billion and increasing their tax 402 billion more than double the largest tax increase in unitedstates history and if that aint recessionary folks i do not know what is let me just give some information here that my democrat colleagues may not be aware of the nashville center for policy analysis says that this plan will lower capital formation in the united states by 1 8 trillion that is money that we need to have invested for plant and industry expansion that will create more jobs but no and because of this slower growth that you are going to create they estimate 1 4 million fewer jobs over the next 5 years but that is not all this economic loss is equal to more than 1 000 for every man woman and child in the country or more than 2 600 for the average household by 1998 the clinton plan will cause wage income in the united states to be 160 billion lower than it would have been that means that about every fulltime employee is going to take a 1 600 pay cut and on average workers will lose 8 in aftertax income for every dollar lost by investors this is the program you are going to present to the american people i cannot imagine that we created 21 million new jobs in the 1980s we had economic growth and here you are you are going to put 1 4 million people out of work with these huge tax increases not to mention the companies you are going to drive overseas with the btu tax increase truckers the airline industry farmers foundries every industry is going to be adversely impacted by the 15centagallon gasoline tax and fuel tax that is going to be loaded on the back of arilines yet you are going to go right ahead with it i hope you know what you are doing it certainly does not appear as though you do right now let me just give a constructive alternative that we have proposed and i hope the committee on rules will allow us to bring to the floor tomorrow and that is a freeze plus 2 percent i wish my good friend the gentleman from minnesota would listen to this part of my talk a freeze plus 2 percent if we froze at last years spending levels plus a 2percent growth over the next 5 years we could reach a balanced budget by 1998 using cbos figures as far as income is concerned if we go back to a 3percent growth in tax revenues as we have had traditionally we would actually have a surplus by the year 1998 without a tax increase i hope all my friends across this country that may be paying attention to this debate will listen the republicans have the kasich plan which is far superior to the democrat plan in that it does not increase taxes and it gets to a lower deficit figure in 5 years second we have a plan that is a 2percent above freeze that gets us to a balanced budget without a tax increase so if you do not want your taxes raised america if you want to cut the fat and waste out of government spending if you want to take a meat cleaver to government then vote for the republicans because they are the ones that are trying to do something about it they will tell you we do not have a plan we have two plans the kasich plan and the 2percent plus freeze and both of them do it without massive tax increases they tell you we need more money they tell you we need 400 billion more in taxes ten years ago we were bringing in 500 billion in tax revenue and today we are bringing in 1 2 trillion we have almost tripled the amount of taxes coming into this country in 10 years and yet they want 400 billion more is that not amazing we have almost tripled the tax revenues coming in in 10 years and they still want 400 billion more and they are still not going to reach a balanced budget in 5 years our plan a 2percent plus freeze

tells us and i find this unbelievable but i do believe it because it is their figures and they are based on their analysis that during the life of an individual 8 out of 10 americans will be the victim of a violent crime that is truly shocking but we all know it do we not look at what is happening in our communities this next oneis fascinating we just heard how during the 0year period that spending at al levels of government has gone up fivefold and welfare spendinghas 630 percent this next chart tells us about the miserable failure of liberalism in this country this chart shows starting hack here you can see in the 50s here is the poverty rate the poverty rate if falling falling falling falling and falling look when it levels offand goes back up this happens when lbj comes into power and launches the war on poverty look at the dramatic increases in spending the more spending goes up look what is happening to this line the line is level it goes down it goes up a little bit then herwe axre in 1990 whereit starts heading up of course these are the last years we have figures for so i cannot tell you more recently but the factof the matter is we have spent in this 30year period i believe 3 5 trillion that put us deeply in debt to alleviate poverty we have created a dependent culture that just saps up more and more of out taxpayer dollars this is resulting in broken homes and more violent crime of enormous proportions this is why we have got to have further time to really talk about this on another occasion next is births to unmarried women look at this line right here in 1960 it was about 5 percent of unmarried women who gave birth look over here in 1990 we are almost at 28 percent a fivefold increase what is happening to these children these children are emotionally deprived for the most part you saw that statistic on the 560percent increase in violent crime the fastest growing component of those violent crimes is juvenile crimes that is what we are creating by the social policies that are entirely misplaced here is the chart that illustrates the increase in welfare spending it is never enough all these trillions of dollars and we still havepeople in power in the federal government from the president on down who tell us oh we have got to spend more that is what president clinton was quoted as saying on the front page of the washington post last friday we have got to raise some more revenues and get this economy going which is totally inconsistent why so that we can spend more this is completely unbelievable then he has given us a plan and let us go back to this chart for a minute a plan which is going to add 1 trillion to the national debt cumulatively and which is going to end us up after the largest tax increase in history at the end of the clinton 5year plan with an annual budget deficit of s228 5 billion some plan the famlily we see federal taxes look at this increase in the average family with median income a family of four in 1948 paid about 2 percent of its total income to the unitedstates government in taxes the same family in 1986 paid 24 percent of its income to the unitedstates government in taxes and that figure went up where by 1990 it looks like over 25 percent now from 2 to 25 percent is a twelvefold increase a 1 200percent increase in taxes to the federal government that is truly dramatic this last chart which i think is very illustrative and maybe we can end on this note represents the federal budget deficit the annual deficit going clear back to the 1940s these are inflation adjusted now of course look at what we have during the world war ii years we have annual budget deficits one of them here looks like about 1943 we have an annual budget deficit inflation adjusted of about 680 billion this is truly staggering but look at what happens here of course during the war years this goes on then we get right to here which appears to be about 1947 you can see what it is it is about 180 billion a dramatic reduction just by way of comparison our budget deficit this year is 320 billion for the fiscal year ending september 30 we are not in world war ii under the clinton plan in 5 years we are going to go from 320 to 228 5 billion look at what happened here you go in 5 years from an enormous budget deficit here at over 500 billion and my word you are up to here where you have nearly 100 billion in surplus now can you see the chauge there it is a 600 billion change we went from deep deficit to surplus we are not in world war ii right now why can we not act more quickly why can we not eliminate these tax increases out the spending bring the economy back up by reducing the deficit reducing the regulation reducing the burdens on the family strengthening our families provide incentives for people to help themselves in the inner cities and in the suburbs and pull these families back together transmit family values make us stronger and better and make us

and how unitedstates forces are employed against aldeed 2 what kind of unitedstates force was kept in reserve to support the contingent conducting the raid do unitedstates forces routinely depend on nonunitedstates forces to provide backup capability during military operations why did it take up to 7 hours for the un multinational contingent to reach the rangers pinned down in support of the downed helicopter 3 it is widely reported that the armored reinforcements going into somalia were actually requested by general montgomery backin early september is this true and if so why were they denied 4 president clinton expressed concern on monday for the adequacy of the protection for unitedstates forces in somalia has the joint staff centcom or anyone else in the command chain expressed concern prior to this past weekend about inadequate available capability to protect our forces 5 what capabilities will the mechanized company with one platoon of tanks give the unitedstates forces in somalia tanks are usually very vulnerable when used in city or builtup area as they lose their standoff and mobility advantage why do we think 4 or 5 tanks will give unitedstates forces a decisive advantage 6 why where the ac1z0s operating in june out of djibouti withdrawn 7 it has been suggested that the force levels we have in somalia are on the minimal end of the scale for what is required to support continued operations given this past weekends experience do we have enough forces in somalia even after the small reinforcements on the way do we have enough forces to enjoy a decisive advantage have we moved away from the decisive force doctrine 8 who authorized the change in the employment of the unitedstates quick reaction force qr from the original concept of a garrisoned reaction capability to their current use as a daytoday military force when the tactical mission changed did anyone reassess force requirements for the new mission 9 given the vulnerability of our

lines of communication on the ground and air mobility now appears to be in question how will our forces conduct future operations i do at this point want to read something from todays october 7

on their editorial pages and all of their reporters i have never met a conservative reporter i take it back yes at the l a times one long ago at the l a times none at the other and none at the capital citys paper the reporters with the washington times thank god on its heels all the time this is the post listen to this the president suggested in an interview with copley news service published yesterday that the united nations had changed its mission unwisely failed to provide military operation to back up peacekeepers and staffed the units with troops untrained for their jobs who refused to venture outside their areas and refused to take orders doesnt this sound like vintage clinton the president also referred to u n actions as if he and his u n ambassador has had no role in formulating or approving them the united states sits on the security council and can veto any risolution the clinton administration supported the resolution that established the peacekeeping effort in line with clintons campaign rhetoric of relying more on multinational institutions to address international problems when the united nations included efforts to hunt down aideed and his key aides for the murders of pakistani troope the clinton administration voted for the resolution but in the interview clinton expressed doubts about the operation he said the copley interview we were asked to come in and in effect be the police officer in this thing to start this thing going and then the u n shifted course and said we ought to stay there until nationbuilding takes place clinton said he did not want our young people in harms way in the absence of the united nations aggressively proceeding with a plant to turn this country back over to the somali or to have a longterm peacekeeping strategy

interracial understanding is of utmost importance one way we the american congress may foster such understanding is to authorize the establishment of an africanamerican museum similar in design to that of the american indian it would provide for scholarship relating to africanamerican life art history and culture as well as being a site for exhibitions which better educate the millions of visitors who come to the smithsonian annually only recently have we realized the prominent role the africanamerican culture has played in the melting pot of america over 12 percent of the american population is of african descent this significant portion of the american population with its distinct history and culture cant be ignored museums have only recently acknowledged the great need to collect africanamerican materials consequently the country has already lost many important africanamerican artifacts and documents the new smithsonian africanamerican museum would further alert communities to the value of many items not previously recognized as significant therefore i urge my colleagues to support the resolution i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.9968289921525866,

been slated for significant interior upgrades and renovations to accommodate a modern museum and create a world class aesthetic environment for over 10 years there have been proposals initiated by africanamericans to urge a presence of africanamerican art on the mall several bills have been introduced and bills have been reported by committees last congress the public works and transportation committee favorably reported h r 1246 which would have authorized the construction of a new building to house the africanamerican museum while that bill did not pass congress i believe it set the groundwork for the bill before the house today h r 877 as reported by the committee on public works and transportation authorizes the establishment of an africanamerican museum this museum would follow the recommendations of the africanamerican institutional study committee these recommendations include three central features first a freestanding africanamerican museum should exist at the smithsonian second the museum should be housed in the arts and industries building and third the board structure should be modeled on that of the national museum of the american indian h r 877 reflects those recommendations and is fitting with the budget constraints for federal activities the board of trustees will have the authority to acceptgifts raise funds and set a budget this bill

on guam and the land history of guam this bill is about a commitment from the administration to seek workable solutions to these problems with the congress and the people of guam this bill is about good faith efforts and patience those good faith efforts extend back to guams venerable statesman mr antonio borja won pat guams first delegate to congress they include the efforts by my predecessor mr ben blaz to find solutions these efforts include my work with the house committees and the government of guam to find the common ground where our interests converge the effort to find solutions and justice for the people of guam begins here today it is a good sign and a good start that this bill addresses lands excessed 15 years ago because we are saying to guam that we can make a break with the past and we can begin the difficult task that confronts us as the prospect of more federal excess lands heightens the tensions on guam and increases the demands for a comprehensive land solution while this bill is not that comprehensive solution it does show that solutions are possible ultimately the best solution is to give guam as much authority as possible to resolve land issues on guam where land issues are most clearly understood just last week i convened a land conference on guam to begin the task of forming a consensus on land issues while there was frustration and disappointment expressed by the people of guam there clearly was also hope for the future our action today conveys that there is reason for that hope and there is reason to believe that change is possible i sincerely thank chairman mitler chairman de lugo and chairman vento for their work on this bill and i urge my colleagues to pass h r 2144 this is a momentous occasion for the people of guam and i

recognize that land issues throughout the nation are difficult and raise thorny issues of local control private property rights public interest constitutional rights and condemnation procedures in this regard it is important to understand that guam is not just a microcosm of the confluence of these interests and perspectives inevitably some will see this bill and the interest that is has engendered only in this fashion we do not argue with that perspective but there is more there is lots more guam does have a unique history with respect to land and guam shares along with other pacific islands a view of the land which intimately connects to our fiber as a people as a culture and when we call refer to ourselves in the ancient waywe say taotao tanopeopie of the land because of the

not been used for decades the land has been declared excess by military strategists over 15 years ago it is about time that we return it to the people of guam it is about time that we do the right

budget amendment i would like the members of the house to focus just for a second on what is special about this debate on the bartontauzin amendment this debate today focuses not necessarily on whether or not one supports the concept of a balanced budget amendment i believe agreat majority of this house does this debate focuses on how we are going to achieve that balanced budget amendment this amendment the bartontauzin amendment is very much like the stenholm amendment the only difference in the balanced budget features of this amendment and the stenholm amendment is the year 2000 date for the accomplishment of the balanced budget goal but the major difference the thing we ought to be focusing on today is the feature of the bartontauzin amendment that provides for some restraint on tax increases as a vehicle for achieving balanced budgets now what restraint is in here the restraint that is in here is a simple provision that says in achieving the balanced budget that all of us or a great majority of us i think want to achieve that we ought to do it without raising taxes any higher than any greater than the income of americans is growing at the time we raise taxes in other words government should not grow faster than the pocketbooks of americans americans individually and american businesses it says in effect that we can raise taxes if we need to in short the amendment we debate today says that while the government of the united states may in fact have to raise taxes it ought not do it except with a supermajority any faster than the rate of growth of income in american pocketbooks and businesses in short it says balance the budget over the term allotted principally by reducing spending wherever you can if we were to poll americans across the width and breadth of this country today i think they would agree with that principle so we are debating an amendment today that really incorporates the stenholm balanced budget amendment with the addition that the balanced budget amendment ought to be achieved with as little as possible in tax increases and as much as possible in spending cuts if members agree with that principle they will want to vote for this version of the balanced budget amendment those who have said they are concerned about this version ought to be concerned because this is a real amendment if we really want to achieve a balanced budget for america we ought to be concerned that this amendment will do it and other amendments may not do it so if we have a concern about the effect of the unitedstates constitution commanding those of us representing this nation in this body to abide by responsible spending limits then we ought to be concerned abut this amendment it will require this congress and this nation to put our fiscal house order without unnecessarily raising taxes again on the american public people have asked us why should we do this at all let me give the members an illustration of the most important reason why i think it is important for congress to enact not only the balanced budget amendment but this version of it with a limitation on tax increases it is incumbent because we need to examine the reason the mandate is normally sent to washington in town meetings across my district folks ask why do you guys keep spending money over and above the income of this government why do you keep putting us in debt why do you keep crowding out money we could be using for useful purposes in america by paying all this interest on the debt conservatives and liberals make this same request why dont you put your house in order quit paying all this interest and spend the money we send you on projects that are good for america instead of paying interest on debt to countries all over the world who buy our tbills the answer is that most congressmen come to washington with a simple mandate the mandate is go to washington get as many of those federal dollars we send you backinto your district and spend them at home the truth is that we all carry out that mandate pretty doggone good the truth is that most of us end up bringing more money home than our folks have sent up here that is why we are out of balance we carry out the mandate pretty good i think what americans want to do in this balanced budget debate is to ask us to give them a chance in voting for a constitutional amendment that would send a new mandate to all of us who come up here and the mandate would be very simple do what you can about bringing projects home do what you can about carrying out the necessary spending in government but dont spend more money than we send you each year at some point stop this crazy borrowing trend that is crowding out the funds we need to carry on a progressive and good economy for our country in short i think the message americans have been sending us in town hall meetings in our mail and in messages to members of congress is that while we want you to do a good job in making sure that projects come home and federal programs are still carried out we also want you to carry out a new mandate and the mandate is dont spend more money than we have sent you and quit raising taxes on us in order to accomplish the purpose of a balanced budget amendment the bartontauzin amendment is the only one that carries out those two mandates of urging americans to live in this government within our means and second to stop raising taxes unnecessarily because this continuous spending spree is about to sink this country into debt from which we cannot recover"],
