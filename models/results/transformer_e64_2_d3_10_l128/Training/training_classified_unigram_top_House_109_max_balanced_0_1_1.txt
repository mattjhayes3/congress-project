the republican budget includes a deficit for 2006 of 372 billion and a deficit for 2007 of 348 billion these deficiti mean that under republican policies the five largest deficits in history will have occurred in five consecutive years over the next five years 20072011 the budget resolution calls for deficits totaling 1 1 trillion since this administration took office it has requested and the congress has provided four increases in the statutory debt ceiling totaling 3 trillion under this budget by 2011 the statutory debt will increase by another 2 3 trillion for a total increase of 5 3 trillion it will leave the statutory debt at a record level of 11 3 trillion the presidents reckless economic policies have doubled our nations debt further i am concerned by the amount of the debt that has been accumulated by foreign bank individuals and governments in 1980 17 percent of the federal debt held by the public was in foreign hands by 2006 45 percent of the debt held by the public was ovned overseas unfortunately this trend seems to be increasing rapidly during the past year approximately 90 percent of the debt we have accumulated has been purchased by foreign banks individuals and governments i support the representative john spratts alternative budget which would reach balance in 2012 the spraft budget also has smaller deficits than the republican budget and accumulates less debt by contrast the republican budget never returns to balance and even refuses to show how big its deficits will be after 2011 the spratt budget backs the twosided payasyougo paygo budget enforcement rules that require that the cost of any new mandatory spending or revenue legislation be fully offset during the 1990s twosided paygo rules played a critical role in turning record deficits to record surpluses the spratt budget also requires a separate vote to increase the debt limit and prohibits using fasttrack reconciliation procedures to make the deficit worse the republican budget cuts appropriations for domestic services by 9 4 billion relative to current services and by 3 2 billion below the level passed by republicans in the senate meanwhile the budget continues medicare subsidies close to 60 billion for managed care providers of medicare even though they are supposed to save medicare money not cost more the resolution also includes 228 billion over five years for additional tax cuts part of a 3 trillion tenyear republican tax cut agenda the republican resolution cuts appropriated funding for education and related programs below current services providing the same inadequate level as provided by the president for 2007 that repub ican level cuts funding for the department of education by 2 2 billion below last years comparable level and eliminates 42 education programs the spratt budget provides 4 6 billion more than the republican budget for education appropriations and over five years provides 45 3 billion more than the republican resolution the spratt budget rejects the deep cuts proposed by the republican budget and preserves programs such as vocational education perkins loans safe and drugfree schools state grants and the gearup college readiness program the spratt budget also makes a down payment on college affordability by cutting student loan interest rates after a temporary one year gain the republican budget after five years cuts funding for veterans health care by 6 0 billion below current services the spratt budget includes 6 0 billion more than the republican budget over five years for veterans health care the spratt budget also rejects the increase on health care fees on military retirees who are enrolled in tricare the republican budget asks additional sacrifices from those who have served and sacrificed for our country the spratt budget rejects the misguided republican policies and keeps our commitment to our veterans the republican budget cuts funding for health by 18 1 billion below current services over five years the same insufficient level provided by the president the republican level means cuts to priorities such as the centers for disease control 18 of 19 institutes at the national institutes of health and rural health activities the spratt budget provides 18 billion more over five years to fund health priorities cut by the republican budget including medical research at nih and graduate medical education for childrens hospitals the spraft budget also takes steps to address the problems with theimplementation of the medicare prescription drug benefit including extending the may 15 signup period through the end of year and protecting seniors from any enrollment penalties the spratt budget also takes steps to help the uninsured and creates a reserve fund to increase medicare payments to physicians which are currently scheduled to be cut for the environment and natural resources this republican budget imposes a 25 0 billion cut relative to current services over the next five years and imposes a 2 9 billion cut for next year alone this is the same level as the presidents budget which cuts funding for the environmental protection agency including the clean water state revolving fund the army corps of engineers and the national park service the house republican budget resolution actually makes the deficit worse offers no plan to bring the budget back to balance and adds to the growing burden of the national debt meanwhile the republican budget makes harmful cuts to critical services for the american people including education veterans services health and environmental protection i ask my colleagues to oppose this budget and support the spratt alternative budget"], [0.0016597509384155273, 0.9983402490615845, 1, "we appreciate the opportunity once again to come to the floor of the house of representatives as the 30something working group myself along with kendrick meek mr meek from florida and also ms wasserman schultz from florida we have been coming here now for a couple of years talking about the condition of the united states our fiscal situation our investment situation or lack of investment in the united states of america and also what we believe is the democraticf caucus and leader peloij and steny hoyer and the issues that we are trying to put forward it has been a very interesting week here for the democratic caucus we had a wonderful guest george lucas the famous writer director producer of the great star wars movies and he was here to talk about the innovation agenda that the democratiq party is beginning to put forward and we have an innovation agenda to keep america competitive in the 21st century as we look at what has been happening here in the united states this kind of breaks down into two or three separate categories one if we want to be a strong country we have got to start here at home and we got to start making the investments here in the united statep research and development education health care alternative energy technologies must start here and we must begin to grow our economy here if we are going to be of any good to anyone else here in the world unfortunately our friends across the aisle on the republican side have failed miserably in their attempt to try to balance the budget here in the united states of america we have as citizens of this country regardless of what political party you belong to we have as a country an 8 2 trillion national debt 8 2 trillion dollars each citizen in this country owes 27 000 to our national debt if a baby is born today that baby owes 27 000 to the united states government to help us pay our debt if you are a senior citizen you owe 27 000 to the united states government and if we keep going down the path that we have been on and here it is 8 2 trillion as of valentines day 2006 and your share of the national debt is 27 500 we have a real situation in the united states of america so not only do we owe this not only does each person owe that what do we do so if we are running a 400 billion annual deficit or 300 billion what do we do to fund business in the united states of america we have got to go out and borrow the money and this president in the first 4 years of his term borrowed more money from foreign interests than every single administration prior to his in the last 224 years this president borrowed 1 05 trillion from foreign interests in 4 years more than every other president before him is that making america stronger mr speaker i do not think it is i think it weakens our country and here it is this president in a republican house and a republican senate has borrowed 1 05 trillion from 2001 to 2005 and all of these presidents did not borrow as much from foreign interests as this one has and that puts us that puts us at a position of weakness because guess who we are borrowing the money from to pay the bills we borrow some from unitedstates interests but this is a chart that outlines who else we are borrowing this money from 682 billion we have borrowed from japan 249 billion we have borrowed from china 67 8 billion from opec are you kidding me we are borrowing money from opec to help fund and plug the hole in our annual deficits here meanwhile they are making money hand over fist this is a very dangerous situation that we are in because here is the end result here is where the rubber meets the road as we all take out loans to pay for our homes or our cars or our kids education unfortunately you cannot just borrow the money at zero percent interest you have got to pay interest on the money you borrow so the interest on 8 2 trillion is a lot of money so what does that mean for our annual payments that we have to make just on the interest this chart is the 2007 budget in billions of dollars this big red bar that gets up to 230 billion is what we are going to pay in the 2007 budget projected on interest on the debt just the interest we are not paying it down we are just paying the interest on it and this nice lavender bar that barely gets up over 50 billion is what we are going to spend on education and then homeland security and then veterans the irresponsible policies of this administration put our fiscal house in disorder because we are spending so much money on just paying the interest on the money we owe the chinese and the japanese and the opec countries that is a great deal for those countries great deal for them but what about us a stronger america starts here at home so until we fix this problem there is no issue we can go on addressing because it straps our hands behind our back because we want to make investments in education research and development pell grants to lower the cost of college tuition put research money into figuring out an alternatie energy source so we are not dependent on some of these opec countries but check this out this is the interest on the debt that i just showed this is what we could spend every day in this country if we did not have to pay all this interest on the debt we could invest 1 million a day into every congressional district i represent a district in northeast ohio youngstown ohio akron ohio niles ohio warren ohio portage county kent state university is in my district this is an older area in the northeast of the great state of ohio the great buckeye state 365 million i could have to go back to this area and invest in the schools head start all kinds of other different things just from my district and every other member in here would get 365 million a tremendous difference give it to the chinese banks the chiinese government give it to the japanese banks the japanese government give it to opec or give it to the kids who are trying to go to school in youngstown ohio of which 80 percentlive in poverty that go to youngstown city schools i know what i would like to choose some other things here we could provide health care to 79 925 more veterans if we would not have to pay the interest on the debt like in the late 1990s when we made the very difficult decision here and i am glad the gentleman from florida is joining us for this point a very difficult decision in 1993 when president clinton got into office we were running budget deficit after budget deficit every year and our democratic house and a democratic senate with a democratic president balanced the budget in 1993 without one republican vote i am hot saying some republicans would not vote for it now but at that time when the heat was on without one republican vote and it led to balanced budgets surpluses as far as the eye could see investments into education hope scholarship the whole nine yards and the greatest 6conomic expansion in the history of this country more important the private sector because interest rates were low the private sector was able to go out and create over 20 million new jobs we cannot create jobs here in government that is not our duty that is not our responsibility this is the chart reagan reagan reagan bush bush bush all in the red and clinton in the late 1990s after the 1993 budget was im plemented we started having surpluses in the late 1990s projected out as far as the eye could see because of fiscal discipline that is what our job is here balance the budget keep interest rates low invest in the education and research like this country has always done and the private sector will join and take over some other things if we did not have to pay the interest on the debt we could enroll 60 000 kids into head start you want to talk about being compassionate you want to talk about if you practice the christian faith being a christian i think somewhere that means making sure we can invest into those poor districts those poor children and i am so glad that mr meek is joining us because we started out here and that we being me talking about the impact of the budget deficit and the fiscal situation that we are in right now and the damage that it is causing to the american economy and the lack of investment because we are paying the interest on the debt to many of these countries overseas so thank you very much fot

not have a good credit record am i right let me just tell you something right now as it relates to the united states i am looking at japan you can put japan in the state of florida and the state of florida will swallow geographically japan but better yet look what they are holding of the unitedstates apple pie the bottom line is this is about the incompetence cronyism and in some cases corruption of these individuals being able to get access into this institution and into the executive branch to be able to get what they want i want to drive the point on here i want to make sure this is crystal clear it has to be crystal the bottom line is the only way that we will be able to have a paradigm shift not only in thinking but in policy and action on behalf of the american people and unless the american people like you say the majority they do not have to be the majority the american people can make that change they can say that we are willing to allow the democrats to lead so that we can hopefully start taking care of some of these issues that we have to take care of here at home with our troops in iraq and afghanistan and throughout the world so that we can get the respect of not only the world but our country our own country veterans they signed up for all the right reasons allowing us to salute one flag as we see it now are being asked to do more financially meanwhile 1 5 trillion in tax cuts for the wealthy while we have individuals while we are having veterans affairs centers closing in rural america and in urban america they are closing some of them are only open on wednesday now but meanwhile we have individuals we have the president every time he gets a chance he is talking about let us make the tax cuts permanent for people who are not even asking for it so this is very simple this speech on what the majority republicans say well trust us we know what we are doing we showed the letter from secretary snow i think we already know this we did not write this letter the guy has said the fifth time the secretary is saying we will not be able to operate the government that is one letter here is the other one here fortytwo presidents this president and republican majority has borrowed 1 05 trillion but better yet saying let us make a bad idea permanent let us drive this number up let us put a two here instead of a one it does not make

lobbyists thriving i never blame the special interests for what happens here but i am going to tell you right now they have a tax shelter right now where 100 billion in unitedstates taxpayer dollars are not going into the coffers because they have an offshore deal with this administration and with this majority meanwhile we are sitting around here trying to figure out how our veterans are going to get health care meanwhile we are trying to figure how small businesses will be able to afford health care for everyday americans to be able to buy into and meanwhile we have troops still without body armor and the things they need to be able to fight on behalf of this country so we ask everyday americans to go out there and suck it up meanwhile the majority the republican majority based on incompetence some may say corruption in some cases as it relates to the white house i mean every day i am sorry every day we turn on the television what is new what is going on at the white house what is being held back from the american people what is being held back from the congress who came to the hill today and conflicted a story that they told just months ago about the fiscal outlook on the country meanwhile you have members that come up to this well on the majority side and say we are doing fine i do not know what these democrats are talking about but it goes against logic we have

the bottom line is that we have a republican majority that rubber stamps everything that the administration hands to them they cant even put the paper on the desk fast enough before they rubber stamp it when you start talking about the fact that by the constitution we are supposed to carry out oversight that is not a value of the republican majority li 1915 oversight of what no see they are too busy taking care of the special interests you would think that some members were more concerned with trying to make sure that special interests got what they needed because we do not want to forget the k street project where you pay to play and you get access into this republican majority house so when you look at the rubberstamping of what has happened here i cannot help but have this stamp here because that is how we got here but what is very very unfortunate is the fact that we have ourselves in a situation in a fiscal situation that is going to take a generation almost to recover from we have ourselves in a situation in iraq we do not know how many years it may take for us to recover from that and i am using the presidents words now we have ourselves in a situation where the white house now wants to invite members over to have tea and cookies right now and trying to be niceynice to say we want to hear from you now but we have men and women caught in the crossfire and we have millions and billions of dollars that have been wasted and stolen in iraq i am going to say stolen because of the rubberstamp republican majority anything that the administration sends down how can we rubberstamp it matter of fact i think the republican majority walks around with a little mini rubber stamp in their pocket saying oversight this is the way you want it and how you want it the american people have to send a very strong message to this republican majority here in the congress that we have three branches of government for a reason not two branches of government that deals with legislation and policy but three branches we have the judicial branch that is separate and aside but when you look at the legislative branch we are supposed to carry out oversight only a couple of members of the republican majority actually gets that and tries to practice it but they are in a superminority and so the reason why we come to the floor is to shed light on the lack of oversight when it was a democratic house and a democratic white house there was oversight cajl bill clinton up and ask him i think we know that republican majority the reason why you are going to see people around here scratching and fighting and begging and trying to do anything and throwing out the sods and trying to get press releases out because the white house is very very concerned that they will no longer be able to send legislation to the unitedstates house of representatives and that it passes through committees that may have a half a meeting on it and come to the floor not allowing democrats to do anything to improve the legislation because they are too busy rubberstamping the process and it will disrupt that it is all about power and influence and i can tell you right now the republican majority has gone too far with this because that is the reason why we are in the situation we are in now and they are known they have to shake it and they know it and they deserve the rubber stamp because that is what they have been doing since the president has been in the white house i am coming to ms jacksonlee i just want to give you a perfect example of what happens in a rubberstamp congress exhibit a how can you borrow 1 05 trillion in 4 years i do not even know how that can be achieved in 4 years the republican majority has handed president bush he cannot do it on his own we have the republican congress right under him from 2001 to 2005 1 05 trillion now here is the other kicker that comes in and with interest fortytwo presidents 224 years 224 years 42 presidents were only able to borrow 1 01 trillion i rest my case on that i rest my case on the fact that the republican majority has given the bush white house everything they wanted on the backs of the american

trillion in new debt mind you at a time in which in 2000 the american budget was running a surplus but in that time we have run deficits on average a little north of 400 billion and we have added 3 trillion to the nations debt how did we do it we have tried to fight two wars with four tax cuts and this congress has served as an atm to the special interests showering them with billions in tax breaks and handouts the prescription drug bill is a classic example where we are now adding close to what the american people were once told would be a 400 billion prescription drug bill is now worth 800 billion and 139 billion in extra profits to the pharmaceutical companies over 10 years yet all of the sudden when it comes to rebuilding the lives of our fellow citizens in new orleans and on the coast we are talking about cutting education health care areas of environment and energy for the rest of america 50 billion and all the while we are trying to do that this congress under a republican majority wants to shower the wealthiest 1 percent those who earn over 200 000 with more tax cuts and more debt yet what are we saying to the rest of america you are going to get cuts in education health care environment energy national security areas homeland in the area of police yet the interesting thing while all of this is happening here in the united states we are trying to turn ourselves into a pretzel trying to cut 50 billion from our education and health care what are we doing in iraq at this time what are we doing in iraq we are actually renovating and building 110 primary health carb centers vaccinating 3 2 million iraqi children rehabilitating 2 700 schools training 36 000 secondary school teachers in iraq we fund 3 120 dommunity development projects in iraq and we have

presidentroosevelt had the g i billevery president said how do we bring this peace home to america and how do we make sure we invest in america so we reap the benefits as a country only this president at this time in this war is thinking about rebuilding another country while cutting back in the united states president lincoln thought of the land grant colleges we are going to cut pell grants

way to invest in america you want to make the 21st century the american century like the 20th century you have to invest in america what have you done you have turned the budget into a pretzel all to protect tax cuts for the wealthiest of americans theyare patriots too when it comes to americas future every american must have skin in the game when it comes to rebuilding the coast that is the families and the communities of new orleans mississippi and alabama the choice shouldnot be cutting pell grants and college loans cutting student nutrition programs cutting health care for our elderly

can definitely do better a stronger america around the world begins at home you are making the wrong choices for americas future i hope as we deal with this budget and the time coming up for this

american people have awakened all of the polls show it the american people are glued in to what is happening here in washington and right they should be i want to start off by saying that so that individuals who are tuning in who would like to know just what are the blue dogs more than anything else we pride ourselves on being first and foremost good stewards of the taxpayers dollars we provide the sterling leadership in the democratic party for responsible fiscal responsibility for 5 years we in the blue dog coalition have been begging and pleading that this congress develop a plan to pay as you go mr speaker 5 years ago when the clinton administration left office we had a surplus billions and billions and billions of dollars were left in surplus now 5 years later under the bush administration we are trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars in debt make no mistake about it our debt and our deficit is the number one problem and issue facing the survival and the future of our democracy and we are concerned about this national debt but at a time when we are expressly concerned about it and pushing forward for responsible measures onthe democratic side it is the height of hypocrisy it is the height of being insensitive it is the height of indeed smoke and mirrors for this republicanled congress and this republican president to under the guise of giving a tax cut for billionaires and millionaires across this country say he wants to cut spending cut spending of the most vital services the most important needs in this country as a matter of fact in the history of this country in this 20th century we have just been hit with the worst hurricane season in modern times katrina was the worst that anybody can remember billions and billions and billions of dollars worth of damage an entire city entire region almost totally destroyed over 250 000 american citizens without homes we all remember those pictures down in new orleans in the flood our hearts went out to those people well our hearts must continue to go out to those people and the reason it is the height of hypocrisy is here is the president of the united states and this republican controlled congress who says that they want to offset a 70 billion tax cut for the wealthiest people in this country on the backs of those poor victims of this hurricane on the front page of the washington post this morning the answer from fema is to throw 150 000 american citizens who have become homeless on the street the answer from the white house and the answer from this congress has been to cut the very programs that will help these victims the most the most effective programs that have helped them has been the food stamp program and under this budget this republican held congress and this president proposes to cut food stamps by 850 million not only at a time when we have people who are homeless without jobs without hope but according to the agriculture department just this year alone we have added 2 million more citizens to the hunger roles the republicans answer cut the very program that has been designed to help them by 850 billion medicaid under this budget planned by the republicans and president bush they want to cut medicaid by 12 billion when 45 million americans mostly senior elderly citizens are going without any kind of health insurance and our farmers cut them by 2 billion farmers who have been devastated by the flood who have been hurt by the flood now is not the time to cut the farmers and our veterans 3 billion lord knows we have not been doing right by our veterans we have cut them we have cut them we have cut them and the presidents answer is cut the veterans this republican congresss is to cut the veterans is that not a reason why they have had difficulty in getting the votes why they have had to pull the bill last week and the american people need to wake up and understand and put the calls in to your republican congressman to let them know that america does not want to cut the basic services for the needy while trying to add a 70 billion tax cut for the millionaires and the billionaires they do not need the money but the children do this budget will cut childrens nutrition by 2 billion and 5 billion in child support heating oil is cut at a time when the oil companies are getting record profits and their execputives are sitting fast student loans 14 billion at a time when going to college costs so much there will be tens of thousands of american children who will not go to college if this republican budget reconciliation bill passes that is why this is so important that is why it is important listen to me america and if you know other people tell them to tune in we are here to tell you the facts this blue dog coalition is one of the most influential groups on capitol hill and the reason why is because people trust us we have earned that we have earned that distinction folks like charlie stenholm john tanner they have pioneered and set the curve respect across party lines respect across this country the blue dog coalition we are speaking the truth tonight william shakespeare said it well when he wrote that great play julius caesar when he said et tu brutus yours is the meanest cut of all and that is what these republicans are doing in this bill it is mean it is cold and it is wrong and the american people deserve better and we are going to give them better so mr ross and my fellow blue dogs we are here tonight to speak the truth we are here tonight to let the american

interest than the republican budget i cannot imagine that my good friend on the floor of the house would not welcome the opportunity of putting that interest into the needs of the american people we need affordable housing we can go to any city any rural community and not see people standing in line to access affordable housing section 8 touchers which allows affordable housing for families of four and five and six hardworking american there are 25 000 people on the list in houston texas alone millions of people are still on the list because they do not have affordable housing f 1245 finally i congratulate the gentleman from virginia and the gentleman from north carolina on this budget because it also invests in homeland security with all of the talk of the republican budget they do not fund immigration and customs officers they do not fund border patrol officers to secure our borders and provide for internal security the cbc budget does the obc budget puts 150 million in for border and customs needs this is a strong budget for the american people vote for the congressional black caucus budget save 27 5 billion in interest i think you will like that in your pocket and in your savings account i rise today to offer another choice to those americans who are disheartened by the current budget proposal being offered by this republican congress today we offer them the choice of accepting the congressional black caucuss cbc alternative budget truly it is the budget of hope and compromise it is the budget that closes the disparities in americas communities the cbc alternative budget provides both social and economic equality for americans instead of allowing the richest americans to pay fewer taxes at the expense of vital programs needed by lower and middle class americans surely this administration and the republican leadership in congress will pay lip service to the needs of these americans but this budget does more it demonstrates in writing that under our current budgetary situation it is possible to maintain necessary social programs while practicing true fiscal responsibility the cbc alternative budget is particularly strong in its support of educational programs the greatest key we possess to close disparities in our society this administration and the majority in this congress promised to leave no child behind but clearly they have reneged on their promise the republican budget eliminates 48 education programs that receive 4 3 billion this year these eliminations include wiping out 1 3 billion for all vocational education programs 522 million for all education technology programs and 29 million for all civic education programs the republican budget eliminates other large programs including the even start family literacy program 225 million and state grants for safe and drugfree schools and communities 437 million in fact the presidents budget cuts 2006 funding for the department of education by 1 3 billion below the amount needed to maintain purchasing power at the current level and by 530 million below the 2005 enacted level of 56 6 billion this is the first time since 1989 that an administration has submitted a budget that cuts the departments funding the cbc alternative budget in stark contrast provides a much needed boost of 23 9 billion to education and training including 2 5 billion for school construction the cbc alternative fully funds the fiscal year 2006 authorization level for no child left behind nclb and provides for an expansion of the head start program in addition the cbc alternative doubles federal funding for historically black colleges and universities and hispanic serving institutions again closing the disparities often witnessed in higher education in that regard the cbc alternative increases the pell grant allotment for college students because as we all know a mind any mind is a terrible thing to waste clearly the cbc alternative emphasizes this ideal more than the republican budget resolution few things are more important to americans than their home and their communities while the president and this republican congress take steps to make it harder for average americans to reach homeownership the cbc alternative invests heavily in this vital sector it funds home ownership initiatives that help families build real wealth in the city of houston alone we have 25 000 people waiting on a list to obtain affordable housing these homes will provide them the stability and equity to build their lives and eventually achieve their own prosperity we shame ourselves when we deny them the opportunity to do so the cbc alternative also restores 1 122 billion for vital community block grants which were gutted in the republican budget resolution without the ability to build up our communities how can we change peoples realities without community development we allow these disparities to continue unabated the cbc alternative budget does not remove any money from the overall defense and homeland security budget instead it takes 7 7 billion out of the ballistic missile defense program which has so far proven to be a failure and redirects the money to additional support for the troops in iraq homeland security needs and veterans programs and benefits among the items of support for the troops in iraq is 75 million of body armor personal support equipment and other protective gear for troops and vehicle armor all of which we know the troops are in urgent need of the cbc alternative provides an additional 2 05 billion for homeland security including funds for improving rail and port security which have always been high risk targets for attack this alternative budget provides 4 65 billion for veterans funding so that when our brave men and women return home from fighting the war on terror they will know that their nation is ready and willing to take care of them the cbc alternative also funds the important sector of immigration as the ranking member of the subcommittee on immigration border security and claims i worked with the cbc to get funding for 150 million for immigration and customs enforcement ice agents and border patrol agents truly we are undermanned in this vital sector in addition as a member of the house science committee i worked with the cbc to fund an additional 500 million for general science space and development and support the research and development efforts of nasa the national science foundation nsf the national institute of standards and technologies nist and the department of energy in addition to research and development the cbc alter native also supports additional safety measures for the space shuttle program which should be at the forefront of nasas efforts after the columbia space shuttle tragedy space and science represent yet another way to eliminate disparities through knowledge and discovery this cbc alternative budget is proof positive that we can properly fund social programs while still paying down more of the hational debt than the republican budget again i say that this budget represents hope instead of the despair we feel when looking at the republican budget resolution it id a hope for ending the disparities that continue to divide us and keep us to this day from achieving our full potential as a nation"], [0.0019272565841674805,

our values that is balanced in terms of our priorities and balanced fiscally he has always conducted the process of creating a budget in a way that has ififormed members has done so with great dignity and great fairness and great respect for all points of view i wish we would all join in acknowledging the great leadership of the gentleman from south carolina our ranking member on the committee on the budget in 1994 the first item in the republicans contract with america was the fiscal responsibility act republicans pledged to restore fiscal responsibility to an outofcontrol congress requiring them to live under the same budget constraints as families and businesses more than 10 years later an outoftouch republican majority has taken fiscal responsibility to a new low it is clear that in the 10 years the republicans have become addicted to deficits the budget deficit for this year is a record 427 billion the february budget deficit my colleagues of 114 billion for the month of february a deficit of 114 billion is the highest monthly deficit ever and the first time it ever went over 100 billion in one month in 2001 president clinton left president bush with a projected 5 6 trillion in surplus in just 4 years president bush has turned that record surplus into a record deficit of nearly 4 trillion a 10 trillion swing in the wrong direction make no mistake these deficits are the direct result of republican policies huge tax cuts for the wealthy a refusal to pay as you go poor planning for a war of choice in iraq the list goes on and on and on america is awash in red ink because of republican budget irresponsibility tragically this republican budget is yet another missed opportunity to return to fiscal discipline not only is this budget fiscally irresponsible the republican budget is dishonest it does not cut the deficit in half as republicans claim in fact it makes the deficit worse republicans leave out the realistic cost of the war the cost of expiring tax provisions the true cost of fixing the alternative minimum tax and the cost of any changes to social security the budget is dishonest in another way it fails to show any def7 icit figures at all after 2010 in our new partnership for americas future democrats have made a commitment to honor the value of accountability including eliminating deficit spending and holding those in power accountable for their actions with a high 6thical standard democrats support honest accountable budgets that pay as you go the democratic alternative offered by the gentleman from south carolina achieves balance by 2012 the republican budget never reaches balance it heaps tons of debt onto our children and grandchildren and it will eventually lower our standard of living we cannot let that happen to our country and on top of all of that the republican budget undermines the solvency of social security while republicans ignore the real crisis of ballooning budget deficits the president falsely claims there is a crisis in social security but just because the president says it does not make it so he is simply wrong according to the nonpartisan congressional budget office social securitys trust fund will grow every year until a high of 8 3 trillion in 2032 and continues to be solvent until 2052 i want to call your attention to this chart my colleagues the left bar represents the deficit in the general fund between now and 2035 a staggering 15 trillion the bush administration has taken us onto atrajectory of reckless budgeting that will take us to 15 trillion in deficit in 2035 from 2006 to 2035 15 trillion in deficit this bar here the second bar social security 2006 to 2080 twice as long more than twice as long the social security deficit is 2 trillion it is clear that there would be plenty of money to deal with the social security trust fund if the president were not using the social security trust fund as a slush fund to give tax cuts to the wealthiest people in america instead of doing that we have a moral and legal obligation to pay back to the trust fund the money the president has taken out we cannot let the president do this by running enormous deficits the republicans want to force the government to break its promises to the elderly how on earth are they going to pay the social security trust fund back if they have gone broke on the other side by running up these deficits in the general fund democrats will keep americas promises to our seniors democrats have done it before and we will do it again when bill clinton was president we had 3 years of surpluses and with the surpluses imagine think of it zero deficits 427 billion in deficit for this year over 100 billion in deficit for the month of february alone this year and when president clinton was president the 3 years at the end of his term we had zero deficits and with the surpluses that were produced he was able to pay nearly 400 billion off of our indebtedness strengthening the solvency of social security likewise the democratic alternative that wag offered today included payasyougo rules that would block new tax or spending legislation that is not paid for not only is the republican budget fiscally reckless and dishonest it is morally irresponsible the leaders of five protestant denominations the episcopal church usa the evangelical lutheran church in america the presbyterian church usa the united church of christ and the united methodist church recently called president bushs budget unjust they reminded us of the words of the prophet micah who said what does the lord require of you but to do justice to love mercy and to walk humbly with your god does this budget do justice for americans you be the judge is it doing justice to our children to give tax cuts to march 17 2005 people making more than 500 000 a year while underfunding head start no child left behind student loans and grants and other education initiatives by 2 5 billion is that doing justice to our children is it doing justice to our communities to give tax cuts to the wealthy while funding for community police and local fire fighters who are vital to our homeland security by cutting them by 280 million is that justice is it doing justice to those who serve in uniform to give those tax cuts while underfunding health care benefits for veterans by 14 billion short of what is needed over the next 5 years is that justice for our veterans and is it doing justice to give tax cuts to the wealthy while launching a shameful attack on the poor this budget cuts 20 billiofi from medicaid a cut that governors on a bipartisan basis oppose and which the other body today has just rejected let us hear it for the other body it undermines the community development block grant initiative with all considered restructuring and a massive 35 percent cut it makes huge cuts to the earned income tax which takes 2 million children lifts 2 million children out of poverty but this budget the republican budget makes cuts there no the republican budget does not do justice it does great damage to our country instead of being a statement of our values the republican budget is an assault on our values and it is

strong fiscally conservative democratic blue dog coalition i rise this afternoon to discuss our nations debt as you can see here today the united states national debt is 8 413 298 480 959 and some change if you divide that enormous number by every man woman and child including those babies being born today every united states citizens share of the national debt comes to the tune of 28 120 in the blue dog coalition we have coined the phrase the debt tax not to be confused with the death tax or estate tax the debt tax debt is one tax that cannot go away until we get our nations fiscal house in order that is what the democratic fiscally conservative 37memberstrong blue dog coalition is all about trying to restore some commonsense and fiscal discipline to our nations government as you walk the halls of congress and as you walk the halls of the cannon and the longworth and the rayburn house office buildings you will come across these posters which signify that you have walked by the door of an office of one of our fellow blue dog members we are concerned about this because from 1998 through 2001 this nation had a balanced budget and yet under this administration and this republicanled congress we have seen record budget deficits the largest deficits ever ever in our nations history in 2004 the deficit was 412 billion in 2005 it was 318 billion in 2006 it was 372 billion and in fiscal year 2007 it is projected to be 350 billion one of the largest deficits ever in our nations history one of the first bills i filed as a member of congress when i got here back in 2001 was a bill to tell the politicians in washington to keep their hands off the social security trust fund the republican leadership in this congress refused to give me a hearing or a vote on that bill and now we know why because the real deficit projected for fiscal year 2007 is not 280 billion or 350 billion depending on whose numbers you want to believe it is really 545 billion so where does the difference come about it is because this republican congress and this administration is counting the social security trust fund and that is wrong when you and i go to the bank to get a loan our banker wants to know how we are going to pay it back when are we going to pay it back and yet this republican congress continues to give us the largest budget deficits ever in our nations history while borrowing money from the social security trust fund with no provision being made on how or when that money will be paid back where is it going come from they cannot tell us when is it going to be paid back they cannot tell us social security has kept over half the seniors in america out of poverty it is time for this republican congress to keep their hands off the social security trust fund now why is this debt so important total national debt from 1789 to 2000 was 5 67 trillion let me repeat that from 1789 until 2000 the total national debt was 5 67 trillion but by 2010 the total national debt will have increased to 10 88 trillion this is a doubling this is a doubling of the 211year debt in just 10 years another reason that deficits should matter is because interest payments on this debt are one of the fastest growing parts of the federal budget and the debt tax debt tax is one that cannot be repealed until we get back to the days of a balanced budget not only is our nation borrowing 1 billion a day this number is going up by about 1 billion a day our nation is borrowing 1 billion a day more important than that our nation is spending a half a billion dollars 500 million every single day simply paying interest on the national debt that we already got before it goes up another billion dollars a day i represent a very poor district in arkansas we have a lot of hope in creating economic opportunities by building new highways we need 1 6 billion to complete interstate 69 it sounds like a staggering number until you think about it if we did not have this debt we could build interstate 69 with 3 days interest on the national debt our government will spend more money in the next 4 days paying interest not principal just interest on the national debt than what it would cost to completely build interstate 69 through arkansas interstate 49 will also be critical to creating economic opportunities and jobs for my district we need 1 5 billion to finish it again a staggering number until you think about we are spending 500 million dvery 24 hours simply paying interest on the debt we already got before it goes up another billion dollars today we could complete interstate 49 with just 3 days interest on the national debt hot springs arkansas we need about 200 million to complete the expressway around hot springs 80 million to get it up the hill and up the mountain and another 100 to 200 million to get it back down and totally completed 80 million would be nice 200 million would be better we could complete the hot springs expressway with just a few hours interest on the national debt el dorado arkansas the largest town in my district not located on a fourlane highway desperately needs fourlane access we could fourlane unitedstates highway 167 for about 400 million put it another way we could fourlane unitedstates highway 167 from little rock to el dorado and connect on down to louisiana to 120 with less than 1 days interest on the national debt interstate 1530 200 million to complete that project that is also under construction a lot of money but just a few hours interest on the national debt in fact we could build 200 brandnew elementary schools every single day in america just with the interest we are spending on the national debt we cannot meet americas priorities as it relates to reducing our dependence on foreign oil in fact we will spend we will spend more money in iraq in the next 8 hours than we will spend on research and development of biorefineries in the next 365 days health care education making the kind of advancements to our nations infrastructure that we so desperately need the kind of investments that we saw under roosevelt with the wpa program to help get us out of the great depression or with eisenhower with the interstate program these kinds of priorities for america will continue to go unmet until we get our nations fiscal house in order that is why as a member of the blue dog cqalition i am here to talk about this debt and this deficit because america has many priorities many priorities that continue to go unmet as our nation continues to borrow 1 billion a day as our nation continues to spend half a billion a day 500 million a day simply paying interest on the national debt meanwhile americas priorities continue to go neglected now why should deficits matter other than all of these reasons i have already given you deficits reduce economic growth we all know that look how much better the economy was in the 1990s when ve had a balanced budget deficits burden our children and our grandchildren it is wrong for us to borrow money from other countries to give tax cuts to people here earning over 400 000 a year and leave our children to pay the bill how would you like to go to the bank and tell your banker you want to borrow money to build this new house but you are not going to pay for it you are just going to leave the bills for your children you know mr banker i have got two wonderful children i am going to make sure they get a wonderful education grow up get a good job they are going to pay for this house the banker would try to have you locked up as being mentally insane yet that is how we are running our country today in fact deficits do matter because they increase our reliance on foreign lenders foreign lenders who now own over 40 percent of our debt where is this money coming from that we are borrowing 40 percent as we know some of it is coming from the social security trust fund with no provision on how or when it is going to be paid back well where is the rest of this debt coming from we are borrowing 1 billion a day where is it coming from is it coming from your hometown bank i do not think so it is coming from foreign central banks and foreign investors in fact the united states of america is becoming increasingly dependent on foreign lenders to fund our lifestyle which is give me tax cuts if i make over 400 000 a year borrow the money from china and let my kids worry about paying it back that is thd way this republican congress is running america foreign lenders foreign lenders currently hold a total of more than 2 trillion of our public debt compare this to only 23 billion in foreign holdings back in 1993 the top 10 list the top 10 current lenders america continues to pass tax cuts for folks earning over 400 000 a year with money that we are borrowing because we are borrowing 1 billion a day with money they are borrowing from whom here is the top 10 japan the united states of america owes japan 640 1 billion china 321 4 billion as my friend and a founder of the blue dogs mr tanner has so eloquently stated and pointed out before if china decides to invade taiwan the united states of america will have to go to china to borrow more money to defend taiwan the united kingdom 179 5 billion opec imagine that we wonder why gas is approaching 3 a gallon our nation has borrowed 98 billion from opec to fund tax cuts for folks in this country earning over 400 000 a year korea the united states of america has borrowed 72 4 billion from korea taiwan we have borrowed 68 9 billion the caribbean banking centers 61 7 billion hong kong 46 6 billion germany 46 5 billion and are you ready for this rounding out the top 10 countries that our nation borrows money from to fund our outofcontrol deficit spending to the tune of 1 billion a day we have now borrowed 40 1 billion from mexico now when an american family sits down around the dinner table to pay their bills and budget for their household they include all of their family obligations their mortgage their car payment their credit card bills their education expenses you name it those hardworking folks take into account the cost of a 4year education for their children not just for one year of it they take into account their car payment and how many years it is going to take to pay for that car not just to drive it for a year when they mortgage their homes they take into account how long and by what means they will be able to afford their housing not just live in it for a year and you know what they expect the same from their government and yet as we can see july 11 today los angeles times editorial entitled another mission accomplished i am not going to read all of the editorial but the first two paragraphs are worth reading the release of the white house midsession budget review is an annual event normally marked by a few wonkish observations and the routine updating of various spreadsheets not by a fulldress presidential dogandpony show president bush plans to preside today with members of congress and invited guests in attendance by all indications including his own in his weekly radio address last saturday he plans to turn this into a celebration just in time for the fall campaign this is proof if anyone still needs it that this administration is desperate for something to boast about on mr bushs watch tripledigit budget surpluses have turned into annual tripledigit budget deficits there is no information in the midsession report to alter that utterly disparaging fact yes the report is expected to project that this years deficit will be somewhat less gargantuan than last years probably somewhere between 280 and 300 billion versus a 318 billion shortfall in 2005 that is not much to crow about that is an editorial that appeared today in the los angeles times entitled another mission accomplished it goes on but the point is that this administration is so desperate for some good news that they are having a celebration to celebrate that our nation is not going to borrow 318 billion as it did in 2005 it is only going to borrow between 280 and 300 billion in fiscal year 2006 i submit to you that our nation borrowing nearly 1 billion a day is nothing to celebrate now contrary to this administra special orders for the blue dog coalitions rhetoric in light of these new tion now for quite a while on a weekly numbers touted today we have yet to basis to try to deliver the message to get government spending under con the american people in an honest and trol instead of talking about 1 year straightforward way about the fiscal we should have a real plan to deal with situation of our nations government the realities of our longterm debt and i was glad to hear him deficit just like american families do talk a little bit about iraq iraq is a for their financial obligations situation that we are having a great a perfect example of this is how we debate in this country about and i are handling our obligation in iraq i think that he made the point that we believe we all support our troops i all very strongly support the men and hope we do i have got a brotherinlaw women once we established the miswho spent christmas refueling air sion and sent them over there to perforce planes over in afghanistan my form and carry out that mission it is first cousins wife gave birth to their clear that we support them it doesnt first child during his service in iraq mean that we cant have an honest and we honor all of those who have and open dialogue and debate about the who continue to serve our country in policy iraq afghanistan and elsewhere is appalling to me as a where i disagree with this president person who wore the uniform during is on the point of accountability this the vietnam era to see those members president this republican congress is of the house of representatives and sending 279 million of your tax money the unitedstates senate or anybody that might to iraq every day and yet if you ask oppose the policy that the united him to be accountable for it if you ask states government has to have them him for a plan on how that money is called unpatriotic so i appreciate the being spent and how it will win the gentleman from arkansas bringing up peace and ultimately bring our men that point and women in uniform home he will i also came here today tell you you are being unpatriotic to talk a little bit about fiscal responthat is where i disagree with this sibility and to assist my friend from president arkansas in talking about the national we just entered our fourth year in debt i find it appalling to this war and i believe if we are going hear the partisan political rhetoric to send 279 million of your tax money that goes on in these chambers rhetto iraq every day this administration oric which celebrates a federal budget and this republican congress should be annual deficit of 300 billion held accountable for how that money is now most of us that have run a busibeing spent ness know that at the but we are still finding it piecemeal end of the day your revenues have to we are still excluding the cost of the match your expenditures or else you war from our annual spending process either have to borrow money with a we are passing a number of supple longterm plan to pay it back or a mental appropriation bills to pay for it shortterm plan and show your banker that mask the wars true cost it is how you can pay it back that year time it is past time that this adminis this administration and tration be up front with the american this republicanled congress over the people and include these important last 5 years have run our government costs in their annual budget estimates into a

what you need is a 12step program on spending it is called intestinal fortitude it is called having a spine it is called having some guts to do what is necessary but the first thing you did was get rid of the discipline and payasyougo so now you are stuck but more importantly the nation is stuck and so we see this little plea on the morning that we are going to give away almost 1 trillion to the richest people in the nation you have a plea here that maybe the president will stop the bridge to nowhere how about congress stopping the bridge to nowhere how about doing what you were elected to do you dont need a line item veto this isnt about statutes this isnt about vetoes this is about what the congress is to do you walked in here fresh newly elected and you got handed 5 trillion and now you cant stop yourself you cant stop yourself you can stop yourself from giving the people an increase in the minimum wage that hasnt increased since 1997 you cant give those people 70 cents more an hour but you give it away to the richest estates and then you can plead that but for the line item veto we would somehow get to a balanced budget every dollar you are going to spend today tomorrow and every dollar you spent yesterday and the day before came out of the social security trust fund i am sure that america while you are putting away a rainy day fund on borrowed money i am sure america is delighted that you are putting away the estate tax on their social security earnings on their trust fund you are taking their trust fund that belongs to all americans called the social security trust fund and you are raiding it for the trust fund of the heirs of the richest estates in america what a wonderful example today what a wonderful example for young people to learn about our obligations to future generations this is a theater of the absurd you have run the country into the ditch financially you got a 1 trillion war going that you cant figure out how to stop you have stolen most of the money from social security trust fund every year we have a deficit we have a 8 trillion debt and you want to talk about the line item veto you know the government is spending money like a drunken sailor andronald reagan said well at least the sailor was spending his own money you are spending the publics money at a rapid illegal unconscionable immoral rate and you ought to stop but the line item veto wont do it lots of things have changed since 1997 but the value of the minimum wage isnt one of them because of congress failure to act on behalf of the lowest paid workers in america the minimum wage is still just 5 15 per hour 5 15 per hour think about that at 5 15 per hour you would have to work 11 day just to fill a tank of gas at todays gas prices at 5 15 per hour you would have to work for at least 30 minutes just to afford a single gallon of milk democrats have a simple and reasonable proposal we want to raise the minimum wage to 7 25 per hour over the next two years doing so would directly benefit 6 6 million american workers the vast majority of those workers are adults hundreds of thousands of them are parents with children under the age of 18 we have all heard the wellworn economic arguments against raising the minimum wage and we all know they simply arent true the truth is that raising the minimum wage wont hurt the economy and can even help it but forget about economics thats not what this issue is about this issue is about doing whats right and it is just wrong that in the wealthiest and most advanced country in the history of the world millions of adults work fulltime all year and yet still earn an income that leaves them deep in poverty it is just wrong for the republican leaders of this congress to refuse to allow even a vote on raising the minimum wage but what makes all of this far worse is that today once again as it has done so many times during the past several years the leaders of this house are going to push tax breaks for the wealthiest people in this country you know starting in 2009 only the largest and wealthiest 7 500 estates nationwide will pay the estate tax the republican plan to gut the tax on these 7 500 estates

if this estate tax repeal goes through this is the same lee raymond who left his job with a 400 million retirement package why is the republican leadership so worred about people like lee raymond why is the republican leadership constantly looking for new ways to help the absolute richest people in the country when is the leadership of this house going to do something for the lowestpaid families in america if you are born with a silver spoon in your mouth and you stand to inherit millions or even billions of dollars that you did not work to earn then this congress wants to serve you but if you get up every day and go to work to earn a living then dont expect any help from this congress the message all of this sends could not be clearer the republicans value wealth not work if you hold up your end of the bargain and contribute to your community and our econ omy by working hard every day then you should not have to live in poverty it is well past time for this congress to treat

not gotten out of hanhd mr speaker it is a growth that grows frbm 3 to 4 7 percent quarter afi 6ei quarter with an inflation rate that is 2 percent or less and unemployment rates that are in the 5 percent and less range that is where we want not too hot and not too cold a nice steady accountable growth and i would point out this that growth that we have in our economy is growing in spite of the fact that 3 5 percent perhaps of our gdp is going off the top to the litigation that goes on in this country we have to overcome that and still grow at a rate of about 3 to 3 5 percent to match a targeted growth rate that will deal with population growth and to deal with inflation and help us develop our infrastructure in this country to accommodate the future as our infrastructure depreciates that is what it is going to take to grow and what it is going to take to balance the budget should we have the will to do that would be to go into the nondefense discretionary spending recognizing that we have three large entitlements in our budget and those are the spending that just goes on year after year that is growing at a rate of about 6 2 percent a year and that is aggregate and that is social security medicare and medicaid those three entitlements are essentially unless we change some of the larameters are the right now the un touchable budget items and eventually this congress will have to look at them but those three entitlements will grow at about 6 2 percent of their aggregate the interest rate will grow perhaps even faster than that in the outyears you add all those things up and if you recognize that to make changes in that for this year is very difficult to do and also recognizing that we have defense spending that is critical to our national security and we need to take that off the table from a cut perspective and what is left is the nondefense discretionary spending that is the items of all everything else that we spend that i have not identified as being an entitlement of social security medicare medicaid defense spending that nondefense discretionary spending we will call that other to balance the budget we would need to simply cut the nondefense discretionary spending by 5 percent areal 5 percent cut and that would be 0 95 on the dollar that would be asking americans to get along with 0 95 out of every dollar that they have right now today not grow in relation to inflation and not grow with any kind of a cola now if i were looking at this from a business perspective i would advocate that we just simply balance our budget in that fashion but i am also aware that the votes on the floor of this congress will rot accommodate for that so i will be seeking to put together a budget that looks at some of the other components and gets us to the point where we can reasonably practically and in fact part of the equation here is politically balance this budget it cannot and should not be done by simply raising taxes by doing so it would stifle growth and it would get a reverse effect beyond in the opposite direction that my colleagues who just got finished speaking would say i am just going to go backwards through some of the remarks that i heard made over this past hour and address some of them i certainly cannot address them all but the argument that all of the money that was spent all this is a quote all that money is wasted meaning the money that was spent for reconstruction in iraq all wasted with no oversight no oversight mr speaker i take exception to a statement such as that i went over to iraq with three of my colleagues last august and returned here about august 20 with the very mission in mind to take a look at where the 18 5 billion that we allocated out of this congress had been spent where the practices were where the projects were how the money was being spent and what was the return on that investment and i brought a chart along with me coincidentally not knowing that would be the subject matter that was brought up here on the other side of the aisle this evening a chart that illustrates where these project dollars have gone i would point out that these red dots on this map of iraq represent 2 200 more than 2 200 completed projects in iraq and these projects will be road projects they will be sewer projects water drinking water potable water projects they will also be some bridge projects and some pipeline work for the oil pipe lines that are there you will see along on this border with iran the red dots along there many of those are border defense stations and what you will not see are the 250 planned border defense stations that are under construction or in planning around these othei borders that we have there is another 1 100 projects that are either in planning or under construction that do not show up yet on this chart i will have a chart that reflects the projects that are planned the projects that are started then this one reflects just the projects that are completed over 2 200 and i visited a number of these of course it would not be possible to visit them in their entirety but i stopped up here in this region around kirkuk and there went to the mother of all generators i forget just how many kilowatts that generator does put out but i remember what it weighed 750 000 pounds brought in on two large loads and then the other loads would be the rest of the generating plant across about 10 7 kilometers excuse me it was more than that it was a long stretch at least across the northern part of iraq with that kind of a long trail ofa convoy to deliver the generator and the turbine that drives that generator down to this location just south of kirkuk and that being one of two huge generation plants that are now in a position where they are up and running in iraq this one is fed by a natural gas pipeline some of them are using different types of fuel but up in this area around kirkuk there is so much oil that it actually seeps to the top of the ground in some places where i come from the area we call it the prairie pothole region where we have these potholes of water that are collected because of the dips that are cut out in the prairie from the last glacier well the water that collects there reminds me of the oil and certainly the oil is in smaller quantities that collects in the depressiois within the desert up there around kirkuk i and that is not the largest oil location up around kirkuk but down here in the southern part in the basra region there is far more oil and i look at the system of collection the well system the collection system the refinery system distribution system all of it is old tired dilapidated has not been reconstructed or modernized in at least 35 years and yet the oil production out of iraq is greater than it was we keep hearing no they are not producing as much oil now as they were then not true the royalties that iraq was receiving prior to the war were 5 billion a year the royaltiesthat are coming from the oil that is pumping today are 26 billion a year that does not necessarily reflect that they are pumping five times as much oil but it reflects that they are selling perhaps more oil than they did then and pumping more oil than they did the electricity that is being generated in iraq is anumber that is close to twice as much electricity at their peak days as it was on a standard day in iraq at the beginning of the liberation back in march of 2003 and as i measure project after project benefit after benefit it cannot be said that and i will quote again all that money is wasted how could all that money be wasted when we have 2 200 completed projects 3 300 projects altogether people that have potable water that never had it before people that have flush toilets that did not flush before they did not have water to flush in them looking at the infrastructure that is there in places in baghdad where they had the sanitary sewer and i would point out for the lay person listening that a sanitary sewer is not really all that sanitary that is what you run your sewage through and yet that sewer was an easy place for some people to pull a waterline through in those days before the ltberation of baghdad so their drinking water in many areas was delivered through a black piece of plastic pipe that was pulled through the sewer itself and they would pull it through and then the distribution runs out to the locations where it was being used and that is all fine as long as you keep your waterline in condition and it does not ever get a leak in it and you do not ever let the pressure go down but both of those things invariably happen and when that happens the pressure goes down in your drinking waterline and the sewage then is drawn into that drinking waterline and it then pollutes the drinking water that has happened in a number of areas in baghdad we are reconstructing that we are providing them with clean new sanitary sewer systems and sewer plants to be able to handle their systems in a modern fashion and an environmentally friendly fashion so the iraqi people that were living without services now have services i will say that the electrical service that was up to 10 11 perhaps even 12 hours a day in baghdad at the beginning of the liberation is down to less than that now perhaps even as low as 4 to 6 hours a day but the rest of iraq was getting 2 to 4 hours a day and now they are up to 10 11 12 hours of electricity a day the next wave is to increase the generation capacity and the distribution so that baghdad can get back up again to a level that they were before but overall there is more electricity being provided into iraq today than there ever was the demand is perhaps twice as great as it was because you know what happens when people get electricity they figure out a way that they can put another appliance to work and plug it into a wall and use it like air conditioners that did not exist in any significant numbers now they are there in significant numbers tapped into that electricity we also know that satellite televisions were against the law in march of 2003 and today iraq is replete with satellite dishes onrooftop after rooftop in fact i did a survey from the air by helicopter over the top of a region up in kirkuk where many homes were built in about the same style and i had done so over the rooftops of mosul in the fall of 2003 and there my survey showed that about twothirds of the homes then already had satellite tvs and now iam seeing that in some of the neighborhoods in kirkuk there actually are more satellite dishes than there are roofs so you will see sometimes two or even three satellite dishes on a single roof that look like they are singlefamily dwellings from the air everyone in iraq has access to satellite tv which means access to the outside world there is access to internet cell phones those things have grown dramatically landline telephones have grown dramatically the number of newspapers are up to over 175 newspapers in iraq television stations up and running communication is flowing free enterprise is robust in the streets of baghdad people that are running shops out there making furniture out alongside the streets set it out on the side of the street and sell it and yes a bomb goes off once in a while and it is sad and it is tragic but the people of iraq clean things up and they grieve and they go back to work because they are optimistic about the future of iraq they are more optimistic about the future of iraq than the surveys show people are in the united states of america what went wrong her6 where people that we say do not have hope have more hope than those of us folks that have the great blessing of living in the united states of america with all of this hope that we take for granted and cannot apparently appreciate so the effort that has been put forth there it is not all that money that is being wasted not by a long shot mr speaker 3 300 projects all of them worthy and worthwhile and no they were not all cheap there was money that was spent for security and there were some projects that were sabotaged that had to be reconstructed again there is a project over here on the tigris river south of kirkuk where there were nine pipelines that went across the tigris river and those pipelines were cut in the liberation operations with the unitedstates air force and we went back to patch those pipelines together did so they were sabotaged again they were put across the river on a bridge and so we undertook the effort to put them all underneath the bottom of the tigris river they are backfilling that now and it is nearly completed and those lines will be opened up and running by i believe the target date is february 28 so another big day to turn those valves on and get that oil flowing south into parts where it can be converted back to cash and be able to help the funding in the great country of iraq this emerging free arab country that has now at least brought forth the name of a prime minister and i do not think formally has elected him yet but on that day that that happens and they seek this duly elected parliament iraq becomes the most representative arab nation in the world when they sit down at the united nations and their representative speaks on behalf of the iraqi people it will truly be a voice of the iraqi people quite unlike the voice of much of the rest of the arab world where the voicethat speaks for the countries that represent those parts of the arab world in the united nations often is the voice of a tyrant that would cut the tongues out of its oin citizens if they spoke up in criticism of the regime that is there in many of those countries but this country can become the lodestar of a free arab people an inspiration to the rest of the arab world an that is a chilling concept but it also inspiration that can cause the rest of should tell us that there is no negothem to see what iraq is stepping into tiated settlement we must defend ourwhat they are earning along with the selves the israelis have had to guard coalition forces efforts and sacrifice to every theater every bus stop every be able to be that inspiration for the hospital every school every synarest of the arab world and if that day gogue and still the infiltrators come in comes and i pray it comes mr speak and detonate their bombs and blow er we may well see freedom echo their women and children to pieces across the arab world in the same fash that happens out of a deep hatred ion that it echoed across eastern eu that we dont understand in this counrope when the wall went down in ber try and i dont claim to understand it lin november 9 1989 on that glorious but i know that hatred is directed at day that symbolized the end of the us we saw it september 11 we saw it cold war a victory for the united on 18 to 20 other attacks including the states and the forces of freedom uss cole we saw it in the unitedstates emand the forces of freedom could not bassy bombings in africa we have seen be stopped almost the first attack also on the twin towbloodlessly they echoed across eastern ers in other efforts shut off by good ineurope and we saw country after coun telligence work in this country try be liberated we cannot rest our choices though are guard every theater every bus 0 2320 stop every school every hospital since that time we have noticed every church every synagogue and pull that those who knew freeddm the least back into the shores of the united hungered for it the most the people on states and somehow think that we can the east side of the wall stepped up to protect every center in this country help all of our efforts our coalition and we wont be able to and we will see forces in iraq in greater numbers than the attacks come and we will see our the people on the west side of the wall women and children and our men blown the people on the west side of the into pieces wall had the privilege of living with or we can take this battle to them freedom since the end of world war 11 we can fight this war where they are the people on the east side of the wall but going out just to kill the enemy remember the days they werent free mr speaker isnt enough it is not a they remember the day of november 9 solution it is something that has to be 1989 when they had that opportunity done in certain areas of the world and to grasp their own freedom and within under those circumstances where there a couple of years that freedom did echo are training camps and active leaders across eastern europe and it needs to that are plotting and planning to atecho across the arab world tack and kill americans that must be so i submit that there done is a vision and mission in this overall but to go out and think that we war on terror and we need to do a far could kill all of our enemies is the better job of articulating why we are in equivalent of realizing that we had a this war i would point out that the lot of flies on our porch and in our loss of americans on september 11 was kitchen and then go out to the barn right at 3 000 americans that is more with the fly swatter and think we are americans lost there than was lost de going to take care of all those flies in cember 7 1941 in that day that would the barn with the fly swatter no you live in infamy can swat flies in the barn all day every we cannot forget september 11 we day and you will never accomplish the cannot forget that we were attacked task you have got to change the habiwithout cause we didnt provoke any tat that breeds that many flies you one who attacked us they attacked us have to clean the barn because they hate our way of life they and you need to leave an environment attacked the very center of western in there that doesnt breed those flies civilization and then they will leave you alone on and no amount of negotiation un the porch and in your kitchen as well derstanding no amount of sitting so i submit that the plan of the around and talking is ever going to re united states and the mission that has solve this disagreement these people been laid out by our commanderinwant us dead they have demonstrated chief president bush is to create a new that and we saw the celebrations in habitat to promote a new habitat in the streets in other parts of the world the region this is a habitat called as the twin towers fell that should freedom we happen to know that tell us that they will give us no quar where there is freedom there isnt a ter habitat that breeds terrorists we have if anyone doubts that take a look at never gone to war against another free israel take a look and see the cir people it has never happened in the cumstanoes there when the israelis history of this country and i dont thought they could trade land for think it has actually happened in the peace and yet they are still attacked history of the world hamas won the election there that so to the extent that freedom can be means the terrorists the people who promoted and we give people that opare sworn to annihilate the land of portunity to reach out and grasp and israel are running the government of earn their own freedom is also the exthe region that may or may not be a tent to which we can be safer as a peonation called palestine ple western civilization can be safer and the people in that part of the world can learn some tolerance for christianity for judaism for capitalism for free enterprise for this whole idea of western civilization that they seem to take such exception to there are good people in that part of the world and those good people need to be empowered and we need to be supportive bf them the allegations that were made here on the other side of the aisle about corruption in iraq with millions of unitedstates dollars we dont know that and i wont tell you that you can go into an environment with a 18 5 billion mission and spend every dollar that would be competitive with a project in the united states because i know that some of that money had to go for security and some of that money had to go for a high price to get the work done because who would go into that environment and do that work but that work was necessary and to the extent that anyone hag defrauded this government yes we need to search that out we need to have oversight but democrats in this congress are not absolved from that responsibility i did not hear a single solution come out here on the other side of the aisle not one all i saw was complaints lamentations objections because all things that go wrong are all republican responsibility according to the other side of the aisle and of course if they were just in power then everything would be all fine but we dont know what they would do because they havent proposed a solution not a single specific solution they are absolutely without an agenda but they have enough energy they have enough air velocity in their lungs to every night come down here and beat up on the people that are out here trying to move america ahead one statement was said that i will agree with made by the gentleman from florida he said i am so glad that i am not a member of the majority well to the gentleman from florida i want to say i am so glad you are not a member of the majority as well and so are the majority of the american people who have seen to it that there is majority in charge in this congress we do have our work to do i wont shirk that responsibility i step up to it gladly but we need to have our eyes wide open we need to promote a responsible budget and i will be promoting a balanced budget and a path we can get to a balanced budget in a way that we can get the votes in this congress to get it done if we do that we can ensure financial security for our children and our grandchildren but that financial security that can come with fiscal responsibility here in this congress and a solid progrowth tax policy isnt security if we have to be continually under attack from an enemy that the other side of the aisle would not have the will to challenge"], [0.9903321620076895,

the ottoman empire during the genocide vividly documented the massacre of the armenians by stating i am confident that the whole history of the human race contains no such horrible episode as this the
