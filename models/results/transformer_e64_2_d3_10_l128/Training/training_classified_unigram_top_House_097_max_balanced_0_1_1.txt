appropriated by congress for fiscal year 1981 most of the families who benefit from these programs survive on incomes that are less than 25 percent of the area median income many of these families will be hurt by proposed cuts in programs operated by agencies other then hud most significantly the administration proposes a new budget authority for the assisted housing program which is more than

serious deficiency in the existing rcra system present epa regulations by the way in opposition to the clear legislative language of the statute have been drawn in such a way as to unequivocally exempt 92 percent of the nations hazardous waste generators from virtually all hazardous waste controls on the basis that they are small generators the net effect of this exemption is to explicitly allow generators of up to 2 200 pounds per monththat is over a ton of hazardous waste per monthto dispose of their hazardous wastes into solid waste landfills or local dumps i distinguish between hazardous waste landfills and solid waste landfills that are not capable nor prepared to accept these types of materials these facilities are not designed to contain hazirdous wastes are incapable of protecting ground water supplies and are the leading cause of the nations abandoned and leaking dumpsite problems according to epas own data over 50 percent of the priority superfund sites are such solid waste landfills or local dumps that have previously accepted hazardous waste materials the office of technology assessment the independent bipartisan arm of the congress estimates that this exemption allows up to 2 7 million tons or 6 billion pounds per year of hazardous waste to be disposed of in sanitary solid waste landfills this amount of waste is equivalent to 6 6 percent of the total waste stream in this nation the battelle institute a study that was also undertaken by epa has issued a similar estimate they say it is 7 percent of the solid waste stream that goes under this exemption the ota report also states that the scope and severity of the generation of hazardous wastes by small generators were greatly underestimated by the epa while the gentleman from texas emphasizes epas estimate which has been criticized by ota is 1 percent of the national waste stream the exact percentage in my opinion is irrelevant whatever percentage is put into the equation we are still talking about billions of pounds of hazardous wastes potentially being put into our drinking water supplies moreover epa in may of 1980 committed to a lowering of the small generator exemption based upon the vgwy 1 percent estimate that the gentleman now refers to as the basis for his proposal of inaction the only thing that has really changed is epas policy on this very important issue epa now believes that the exemption is not a significant problem despite the overwhelming additional evidence to the contrary epa has even denied the waste disposal industrys petition to close this loophole the agepey also asserts that its previous study of the small generator exemption is sufficient yet they support this amendment which does nothing more than to study the problem for an additional 3 years this is really a classic example of a calculated policy of inaction groping around for a justification earlier this year the public and the congress were outraged and appropriately so when epa lifted the ban on the disposal of containerized liquid hazardous wastes into hazardous waste landfills that is landfills that are supposed to be prepared to accept those materials other provisions of this legislation deal with needed restrictions on the types of wastes that can be placed into hazardous waste landfills however unless similar restrictions are placed on hazardous waste disposal at solid waste landfills the environmental consequences will be disastrous this is because 92 percent of the hazardous waste generators can now freely dispose under this exemption of their hazardous wastes at local dumps which are totally unsuited for receiving this type of material consider the irony of the following situation the current small generator exemption of 12 tons per year translates roughly into a volume of 60 drums if a nonexempt big generator were to dispose of a load of 60 drums into a sanitary solid waste landfill there would be public outrage however if a small generator as defined by epa disposed of 60 drums of the same material it is legal although the fact of the matter is that the harm to the environment would be indistinguishable in devising a remedy for this serious loophole the committee examined the report and the recommendations of ota and the policies of 20 individual states that have already restricted or totally eliminated the small generator exemption i am going to for a specific purpose read the list of the states arkansas california illinois indiana kansas louisiana massachusetts michigan missouri minnesota new hampshire new jersey new york north dakota ohio oregon rhode island south carolina vermont and washington parenthetically i note that the state of texas department of health is on the verge of lowering its own small generator exemption according to information that we have from the assoelation of state and territorial solid waste management officials i took the time to read this list for a very important reason i do not know how any congressperson from any of those states can support the amendment of the gentleman from texas and then go home to his constituents and say that we in our state have removed this exemption but i voted against making this a national standard such that state x which is immediately adjacent to us allows these 12 tons per year to be dumped in their landfill infiltrating into the aquifer that knows nothing about state boundaries which is now polluting our water this is a totally indefensible position in addition the ashland chemical co is already operating a small generator and waste collection and treatment service in 34 of its 60 major markets many of which are in states that already restrict this loophole let me deal finally with one of the arguments that i know is superfically very perbuasive the question about small business and the impact on small business of removing this loophole the argument is that this is somehow antismall business that is pure nonsense i would ask any of the congresspersons from those states that have already taken this action if they have had a whole lot of small business people beating down their doors prior to the initial consideration of h r 6307 saying that retail clean ers are going out of business gasoline stations are going out of business because these 20 states have already taken that action the answer is they have not the reasoning is we are not talking about mom and pop retail operations generating 12 tons a month of dioxin of pcbs or phosgene or phenol we are not talking about small businesses average neighborhood stores we are talking about rela tively large generators of these wastes now is the time to act on this matter and not to sanction as the gentlemans amendment would a fourth study on this issue one that would take 3 years to boot the committee provision steers a moderate course based upon the experience of the states by lowering the level of the exemption within a 2year period to onetenth of a ton per month while reducing the administrative and managerial requirements prior to disposal i would strongly urge support of the bill as presented and opposition to the amendment of the gentleman from texas"], [0.004639327526092529, 0.9953606724739075, 1, "i want to report on hearings held recently by the house small business oversight subcommittee which i cha r on todays business failure epidemic and the devastating toll it is taking on small business the subcommittee invited leading experts from the academic business and bankruptcy worlds to testify to find out why so many businesses are failing and what it means for our economy the hearings were held against the backdrop of the gravest crisis faced by american business since the great depression this is what we see capital investment by companies is off sharply data resources inc forecasts that business investment will be off 8 percent this year over last year despite the massive tax incentives to invest enacted last year aftertax profits of corporations in the first quarter of 1982 were almost onethird lower than a year earlier the sharpest drop in the postwar period the new york times reported earlier this week that corporate profits have reached the lowest levels in perhaps 5 years many companies are saddled with heavy shortterm debt the ratio of shortterm debt to total debt is at a new high business balance sheets and corporate liquidity are more fragile than at any other time in postwar history since the first quarter of 1981 industrial output has dropped more than 7 percent our nations factories ran at a dismal 69 8 percent of capacity in june of this year 15 percentage points below the rate at which capital goods makers start getting orders for equipment to add capacity small business proprietorship income is expected to be nearly 15 percent lower this year than in 1980 according to data resources inc and businesses are failing at a rate not seen since the great depression todays figures as reported by dun bradstreet the business information concern are truly alarming the failure rate today is almost 90 per 10 000 listed companies just short of the failure rate of 100 per 10 000 companies recorded in the great depression year of 1933 put another way 11 businesses are failing right now for every hour of the business day business failures have only become a serious problem since 1981 looking back over the postwar period we find that business failures ranged between 1946 and 1980 from a low of 5 per 10 000 listed companies in 1946 to a high of 64 per 10 000 in 1961 the business failure rate average for those 35 years was 40 3 per 10 000 listed companies beginning in 1981 however business failures began to shoot up in 1980 l11742 companies or 42 per 10 000 companies failed in 1981 the figures jumped to 16 800 or 62 per 10 000 companies for 1982 the prediction is 25 000 or 88 per 10 000 listed companies the average for 1981 and the first half of 1982 is 75 per 10 000 companies an 86 percent increase over the 194680 average in the past 2 years the business failure rate has jumped 110 percent the second largest 2year jump since 1920 the only time it was higher was in the 2 years immediately after world war ii when business failures returned from the depressed war level to normal todays figures are indeed grim we should remember that the dun bradstreet figures cover only failures which involve losses to creditcs the number of business failures today is really much higher since thousands of businessmen simply decide to close their businesses because they see only an unprofitable future these business closings which are really failures reflect a lack of confidence in the business environment and are not reflected in dun bradstreets statistics as president reagans recently released report on the state of small business tells us the dun bradstreet figures are a valuable indicator of business distress the hearings looked at this distress not only in numerical terms but in human terms what we are seeing today is a great human tragedy we must not forget that business failures mean lost jobs ruined lives and dashed dreams they mean lost pensions lost life savings and lost tax revenues they also take a human toll in the lost selfesteem felt by those directly affected they mean an end to the american dream of opportunity and owning ones own business that has been such a powerful art of this nations dynamism last march when it was becoming clear that 1982 would see a record number of business failures i wrote to 2 dozen unitedstates bankruptcy judges and trustees to find out why this was happening i wanted to hear directly from them because they are seeing every day what is happening why it is happening and what needs to be done to end this terrible spiral of failure i received 19 replies from throughout the nation which i included in the hearing record this is the picture that emerged from the letter business are failing in all sections of the country and in every economic sector large and small businesses and young and old businesses are failing business are failing in record numbers and the failure rate continues to rise the business failures experienced today are much worse than those experienced during the last severe recession of 19741975 business are failing today because of high interest rates and the deep recession the revised federal bankruptcy code is not a cause of the increased number of business bankruptcy filings let me read a few of the responses unitedstates bankruptcy judge peter m elliott of los angeles wrote i would say that the major cause of small business failures is high interest rates unitedstates trustee william p westphal sr of minneapolis wrote the two primary causes for the increase in bankruptcies generally as well as for small business in particular are the extremely high interest rates and the length of the current recession unitedstates trustee scott h bush of dallas wrote the tentacles of the current recession reach to all communities at all locations even the glorious sunbelt has not been insulated the current recession is much more severe than the 19741975 recession unitedstates bankruptcy judge charles b mccormick of chicago wrote the increase in small business bankruptcy filings must i feel be blamed on the common elements of high interest tight money inflation the loss of jobs due to plant closings and the farming out of work to foreign countries and the other ills that greet one in the media every day unitedstates bankruptcy judge william l norton jr of atlanta wrote i do not see incompetency or mismanagement or dishonest actions in individuals or businessmen which some credit grantors or others ascribe to debtors in the bankruptcy court as being the cause of prevalence in bankruptcies i see the overwhelming number of individual and business debtors in this court who sincerely and honestly want to pay their debts and have been and are attempting to pay such debts i see many businesses and persons in my court who i feel there but for the grace of god go i as the letters i received show high interest rates and the prolonged and deep recession are placing an extraordinarily heavy burden on all businesses and small budinesses in particular this is the same message we heard from our academic witness at the hearing according to edward i altman a professor of finance at new york university and a leading expert on predicting business failures the devastating effects of reduced profits and high interest rates that have remained around 20 percent or more for several years are continuing to reduce the ranks of our smaller firm population because of high interest rates pro fessor altman continued businesses today pay more than 40 cents of each dollar of cash flow for interest charges up from 20 cents of 4 years ago no wonder so many marginal firms are succumbing to the economic reality of bankruptcy he said this is unfair small business relies almost exclusively on banks for financing they cannot shop around or bargain for the best interest rates as can large corporations many small businesses are paying at least prime rate or above prime for their loans that means close to 20 percent interest what makes these rates even more crushing is that the real interest rate is at least 10 percent the highest in recent memory the impact can be seen everywhere joseph w duncan the chief statistician for dun bradstreet presented to the subcommittee his firms latest business failure figures they showed continuing and sharp increases throughout the nation and in all industries the sun belt and mountain states are as hard hit as the farm states midwest and midatlantic region the failures touch not only the weak manufacturing wholesale retail and construction sectors but also the previously strong service industries what does the future hold only more grim numbers and more tragedy the subcommittee was tdid unless the economy improves and interest rates decline significantly i am afraid that the already staggering number of business failures will swell to levels comparable to the early 1930s the normally cautious professor altman predicted in 1932 the nadir of the great depression 31 822 businesses failed for a catastrophic failure rate of 154 per 10 000 listed companies the risk he added is that increased business failures will lead banks to tighten credit further and thus accelerate the business failure spiral if banks ration credit to only the most creditworthy firms professor altman said the marginal firm will stand little chance of surviving it is also probably true that the marginal firm is oftentimes also a small firm todays problem goes beyond high interest rates the problem stems from the mix of economic and fiscal policies currently being followed that have driven our nations economy into the worse recession since world war ii and created the severest liquidity crisis for business since the great depression as professor altman warned the real risk is not whether the economy will turn around and stage a recovery but how long the recovery will last if the turnaround is relatively short like the one we experienced in late 1980 then thousands of firms particularly smaller ones will not have sufficient time to get back on a positive cash flow basis the consequences are obvious and ominous we will see a ripple effect throughout the economy as failing large companies topple small firms doing business with them thousands of people will lose their jobs this is happening right now unitedstates trustee james eichstaedt of los angeles told the subcommittee that the bankruptcy last april of the wickes cos the large retail chain has cost several thousands jobs and seriously squeezed the small firms that did business with wickes with so many large unitedstates companies in such desperate financial straits we can count on it happening again and again and again if new economic and fiscal policies are not adopted that will bring interest rates down to affordable and stable levels and encourage the economy to grow e"], [0.0046517252922058105, 0.9953482747077942, 1, "had he lived lyndon b johnson would be 74 years of age this month august 27 i rise to honor his memory to recall his vision for america and to remind my colleagues that it is not only possible for our country to rise to greatness it is necessary to do so lyndon johnson never believed in a diminishing future he believed in growth in dynamism in progress he never believed that this country must live by some sort of economic fatalism he believed that we could control our own destiny he never believed that this nation could or should abide the waste of unemployment the scourge of poverty the numbing blight of ignorance nor the casual inhumanity of injustice lyndon johnson had a vision for his country he believed we could conquer our problems that we could alleviate poverty and indeed his programs did open whole new worlds of opportunity through the vision and unparalleled political skills he commanded president johnson brought decent medical care to the old and the poor he demanded that we no longer tolerate hunger among the people of this the greatest food producing nation in the world he established vast new programs to improve the nations schools to insure that every child got a sound education and to make available a university education to all who could benefit from it he insisted that the poor even the longterm unemployed could be placed into useful jobs through all these and many other efforts he was responsible for a vast reduction in the incidence of poverty in our country where there was no hope he opened hope and where there was hope he insisted that there be genuine opportunity compare that to the experience of today under our present leadership we have not progress but retreat there are millions of newly unemployed there are millions of newly poor no longer do we seek to insure that the poor are decently housed and fed far from it our leadership demands that the hungry should go more hungry our leadership is not one with a vision of what our country could be but one that sees a diminishing futurea world with shrinking hopes not one of growing possibilities lyndon johnson was excoriated as a free spender but the leadership of today the current administration will incur deficits that are 60 times as great as any that johnson would even dream of he was called a radical ex perimenter but he never abandoned the basic principle of sticking with programs that were practical that were proven whose results could be measured compare that to the pie in the sky claims that we heard for supplyside economics nonsense that we are paying dearly for today the present administration likes to say that there is no need to produce new housing for the poor or for anybody else because the marketplace will take care of everything but lyndon johnson knew that this was not so and could not be so if there are millions of people who cannot even get into the marketplace the market serves only people who bnve the means it does not serve those who have no means johnson would have wanted to know how many were without housing what could be done to get them into housing and how to get it done compare that to the breezy callousness of todays antihousing administration there is no way for me or for anyone else to describe the whole complex dazzling being who was lyndon johnson it might be said that he never believed that there was a problem that could not be licked whatever it was he would argue threaten worry demand plead work and pester anyone and anything in his considerable reach until he was satisfied that the matter had been disposed of it might be civil rights it might be interest rates which today are treated as given from godly writbut which he knew were made and broken by men just like him it might be education or any one of a thousand things whatever it was he believed the problem could be solved and he intended to do it compare that to the casual callousness of today when human needs and human miseries are ignored and when not only is no positive action taken every effort is taken to destroy what little help people have available he would never understand would be terribly grieved to see the sorry spectacle that we have today in which misery is compounded in which inequity is heaped upon unfairness in which shameless dishonor is dismissed as practical politics he would be horrified by policies that are nothing more than warmed over 19th century darwinism nothing less than callous disregard of even so basic a thing as providing for economic growthfar from it policies that destroy even that possibility lyndon johnson reached farther than he could grasp but he drove this country to its greatest heights his programs were the most comprehensive humane and effective domestic efforts ever attempted they were also the most effective there is no way to describe the kind of new dreams that were not only made possible but that were achieved thanks to president johnsons efforts he could not understand and would not tolerate a government that was indifferent it is a mercy that he never lived to see the inlifference the outright emptiness that characterizes the present occupant of the white house a man who was a doer could never understand one whose sole mission seems to be to undo do nothing do

competition among the greatest amateur athletes in the wvorld the games are designed to benefit the athletes unfortunately the 1984 summer olympic games in los angeles may well be the games where the concerns of private outside interests are more important than the athletes unless congress acts to protect the interests of the athletes the unitedstates government and the american people a new event world scandal may be added to the 1984 summer olympic games at the present time there are two coinage proposals before the congress designed to raise money to help finance the massive costs of the 1984 games and to help train american athletes for those games these proposals are signficantly different and it is important that the differences be known i am a strong supporter of the olympic program and our olympic athletes i was the author of legislation last year to provide gold medals to our entire olympic team and i was proud to stand on the steps of the capitol when the members of our team were awarded these medals by the president of the united states while these gold medals in no way made up for the disappointment of our athletes not participating in moscow they nevertheless were designed to recogn17e these men and women for their athletic excellence because of my feeling toward our olympic athletes i introduced legislation on june 11 of this year designed to raise money to train athletes the legislation h r 3879 provides for the minting of 90 percent silver dollar coins that would be sold directly to the public by the unitedstates mint half the proceeds of the sale would be used to reduce the national debt and the other half would go to the united states olympic committee to train our olympic athletes the legislation calls for the minting of 25 million silver dollars the coins would be sold at a price in the 20 to 25 range at that price my legislation wbuld raise between 100 to 275 million if all the coins were sold given the success of the recent carson city silver dollar sale i fully anticipate a sellout of the olympic coins my legislation provides for a general accounting office audit of both the sale of the coins and the use of the proceeds by the united states olympie committee to make certain that the money goes directly to the benefit of athletic training the week after introduction of my bill a second bill which i call the lazardoccidental bill was introduced this legislation calls for the striking of 29 different coins by the unitedstates mint with all of the coins being sold directly to a marketing group composed of the investment banking firm of lazard freres and occidental petroleum who have been given a license by the los angeles olympic committee to sell olympic coins the bulk of the proceeds from the sale of these coins would go to the private marketers in fact the private interests can earn as much as 94 million profit on this deal a portion of the funds raised by the 29 coin bill would be given to the los angeles olympic organizing committee laooc and an even smaller amount would be funneled to the united states olympic committee the legislation does not allow for the general accounting office to audit any portion of the transaction and in fact it virtually turns control of the unitedstates mint over to lazard freres and occidental i am deeply concerned that the lazardoccidental bill will lead to scandal not only will our athletes be tainted and the american people disillusioned but the bill actually may provide little or no money for training our athletes in february 4 months prior to the introduction of any legislation the laooc quietly awarded exclusive worldwide marketing rights for olympic coins to a concern composed of lazard freres and occidental lazardocaidental gave the laqoc 5 million of which 1 million is nonrefundable the laqoc is also entitled to keep all th interest earned on the other 4 million in march the laooc gave the unitedstates olympic committee a check for 500 000 as their share of the nonrefundable 1 million in effect the laooc and the unitedstates olympic committee sold their rights in any coins to lazard freres and occidental petroleum this is morally and ethiically wrong and casts doubt on the ability of the lagoc and the olympic committee to speak objectively on this issue secrecy seems to surround the details of the relationship between the laooc and lazardoccidental for the past 3 months i have tried without success to obtain a copy of the contract between the laooc and lazard freresoccidental i have received a copy of theletter of understanding between the parties but despite assurances from those representing the coin marketers that i would get a copy of the contract it has never been presented i can well understand why they would not make the contract available to me because the letter of understanding is so shocking that the complete contract is probably too hot to be made public lazardoccidental are no strangers to the world of marketing olympic and sportsrelated coins last year they had the exclusive rights to marketing soviet olympic coins in the free world it is ironic that they were pushing these coins in the american market at the very same time our athletes had made a decision not to participate in the moscow games while i stood on the capitol steps as our olympic athletes received medals for boycotting the moscow games lazardoccidental were busy raising american money to stage those games as with the agreement with laooc information about the financial aspects of the sale of soviet coins is hard to

the cour here today because it is my firm conage and the honesty and the brilliance viction that in times like these we of her analysis should be spending more of our federin these unhappy al dollars than ever on these programs days of reaganinduced inflation and instead of at best just holding the outrageously high interest rates we line without further cuts as some of are here for the purpose of debating the better budget alternatives do i the budget for the fiscal year 1983 cannot fathom how naive we must be more americans than ever need the to try to convince ourselves that thos help that the federal governments programs cut so drastically by last unemployment benefits program and years budget can be expected to hold other programs and services designed up again this year even without furto aid the poor and the unemployed ther cuts in view of even higher uncan give yet the budget resolution employment and inflation than last and the substitutes being offered show year in my view just holding the a continued zeal for government line at last years spending as a cospending for guns over people or promise to further cuts is simply unresimply do not go far enough in the alistic and shortsighted effort to restore humanity to a feder however i rise in support of the al budget that has ravaged the social fauntroy substitute to house concurprograms so desperately needed by so rent resolution 345 because when many millions of americans compared to the house or senate were it not for the ruthlessness of budget resolutions and other proposed the reagan administration budget substitutes the fauntroy substitute policies of last year perhaps this constitutes the only equitable and years budget resolution and some of rational approach to balancing the the substitutes that are being offered federal budget to reducing inflation to it might be acceptablebut with in and most importantly to creating jobs creasing unemployment nd while we and revitalizing our economy by are faced with social programs emas changing our national priorities from culated byv iast years budget none of killing to living the budgets or substitutes go far indeed it is the only budget proposenough al before us which cuts the socalled defense budget authority below its present level and it is the only one which does not reduce medicare in addition it reduces the 1983 fiscal year deficit to 97 8 billion while properly increasing more than any other proposal the budget authority for health education job training employment and other needed social services when i stood here in the well last year while we were debating the budget resolution i made reference to the fact that the congressional black caucus was the first among the reagan nonnonbelievers to accept the reagan challenge to come up with a better budget than the one that he had proposed the caucus not only accepted that challenge but met it fashloning an alternative that was designed to put the 1982 budget in balance while still providing equitable tax relief and without compromising the integrity of essential social programs today we are again debating the budgetthis time for fiscal year 1983 again i believe that it is the fauntroy substitute that stands out as the best alternative to the substitutes that are being offered it is a substitute that will create new jobs and jobcreating programs for highways mass transit and for rebuilding the infrastructures of urban areas it is a substitute which creates hope for millions of poor and unemployed americans by extending and expanding benefits for unemployment and restoring benefits for medicaid food stamps and welfare programs to rational levels it is a substitute which preserves vital social educational job training and medical assistance programs for the millions of americans who are poor and unemployed the fauntroy substitute accomplishes these things while managing to shrink the federal deficit for 1983 and for years beyond but briefly let me deal in particular with two areas covered by the fauntroy substitute which have not been fully highlighted here as a member of the committee on public works and transportation and as a representative for a district whose residents rely heavily on public mass transpnrtation i believe that this countrys long history and commitment to transportation has been a key factor in our nations economic growth and development with skyrocketing interest rates unprecedented high unemployment and increasing deterioration of existing mass transit systems state and local governments cannot possibly now bear an even greater portion of the costs of transportation and mass transit than they have shouldered in the past if federal support for transportation is not continued soon some of our nations citizens will not be able to pay the cost of a bus ride in fact without aid to deteriorating mass transit systems eventually there may be no buses at all now in the area of public worksand economic development specifically as was true last year this year it is only the fauntroy substitute that adequately addresses our nations needs it does this by offering grants loan guarantees and technical assistance to states and localities all of which help create new jobs and improve the quality of life only the pauntroy substitute recognizes that programs such as these serve vital functions of revitalizing areas in which many poor and minority people live and stimulate investments that lead to new jobs the fauntroy substitute retains the 1983 authorization in existing law of 3 7 billion which is a 21 million increase over the administrations request to merely maintain the 1982 level the fauntroy substitute retains the 1983 authorization in existing law of 500 million representing a 70 million increase over the administrations request to merely fund this program at the 1982 level the fauntroy substitute also continues to fund programs such as section 312 of the rehabilitation loan program at the 1982 funding level of 69 million while the administration proposes to eliminate this program altogether furthermore the fauntroy substitute recognizes the wisdom of and necessity for retaining funding at the present level for the economic development administration the governments disaster relief program and the appalachian regional commission it is only the fauntroy substitute that recognizes for a complete economic recovery there must be a strong commitment to funding for housing highways mass transit and other infrastructure programs to create jobs and finally it proposes an 8 billion jobs vocational education and training package essential to the welfare of all americans the fauntroy substitute supports continuation of the federal role in transportation by proposing a 5centagallon increase in the federal gasoline excise tax to be used to provide jobs to rebuild transportation systems all across the country by improving roads highways and bridgesso many of which are badly in need of repairand to expand and upgrade and help to operate mass transit systems in urban areass stems which provide the only means of transportation for millions of americans the fauntroy substitute maintains funding levels for amtrak northeast corridor improvements and for other essential rail systems at congressional budget office current service levels realizing that rail transportation is a vital adjunct to the nations transportation system which needs federal help to become profitable in its own right furthermore the fauntroy subsitute provides rational and fair reductions for several transportation programs to meet the requirements of a balanced budget without compromising the quality of these programs i am certain that each subsitute that is being offered to the fiscal year 1983 budget resolution is being offered in good faith and with the conviction of its sponsors that it is a better alternative nevertheless the fact remains that the fauntroy substitute is the only one being offered today that demonstrates a clear understanding and appreciation for those americans most dependent on the services and programs that the republican substitute and other substitutcm seek to cut once again this year rendering them virtually useless to the millions of americans they were originally designed to aid the fauntroy substitute is the only alternative that heeds the cries of our constituents nationwide to restore these vital social programs and services to serve our economic and transportation needs while still retaining fiscal responsibility therefore i urge all my colleagues to give the fauntroy substitute their support thank you"], [0.004808306694030762, 0.9951916933059692, 1, "once agali we are confronted with a budgetthe latta budgetthat slashes funding for our nations health programs we should not be fooled by the rhetoric surrounding this budgetthe revisions do not alleviate the devastating impact of the cuts on our nations most vulnerable citizensthey just shift them to those less able to afford it this latta budget slashes programs for the poor this latta budget is a disaster this latta budget is no improvement over the latta proposal we rejected just 2 weeks ago latta continues to propose deep cuts in health of 4 9 billion in fiscal year 1983 and 20 7 billion over 3 years while they talk about restoring the medicare cuts they still propose to cut social securitys medicare program by 3 2 billion in fiscal year 1983 that may be considered a restoration for those who proposed the irresponsibly absurd level of cuts in the last latta bill but it is in fact a deep cuta cut that will require us to shift even more costs to the aged and disabled medicare beneficiaries how do they finance this socalled restoration one way is by drastic cuts in medicald shifting even more costs to the states on top of the federal cuts we enacted last year and cutting funding for children the aged poor and those in nursing homes finally they have done nothing to improve their earlier proposal for flrt funding for discretionary health programs for 3 full years the result will be a severe cut in real purchasing power for biomedical research and critical public health programs lets look at these proposals in more detail they propose a 3 2 billion cut in medicare and for that they are trying to take credit for how nicely they are treating medicare the fact that that is an improvement over their last proposal simply highlights how ridiculous their last proposal was 3 2 billion is a deep cutand our aged and disabled constituents will not be fooled by rhetoric about restorations when their annual deductible increases under this proposal they will not be fooled when their cost sharing for home health services increases under this proposal they will not be fooled when they pay more and more out of pocket for physician services to make up for lattas arbitrary cuts in physician payments so i urge my colleagues not to be fooled by this rhetoricfurther shifts of costs to the elderly are unwarranted medicare is already so restrictive that it pays just 45 percent of the health bill of the aged we should not endorse this proposal that shifts this administrations budget problem to the aged person needing medical care for medicaid the latta budget is even worse apparently the designers of latta made a rather cynical decision to give to the aged with one hand by restoring a limited portion of the medicare cut while taking away with the other hand from those aged who are the very poorest by slashing the medicaid program let us look at these medicaid cuts in detail just last year medicaid was cut severely and those cutsof nearly a billion dollars a yearwere extended for 3 full years states are now desperately trying to cope with this years cat they face a further cut of 4 percent that is already programed into fiscal year 1983 now latta proposes a new cut of 1 3 billiona cut even larger than the controversial proposal we enacted last year more than 1 billion of this cut is nothing more than a pure shift of costs to the statesi think we all know that the states cannot afford this shift on top f the cuts we enacted last year i have sent to each of you preliminary estimates of what these cuts cost each statebut let me provide some examples to give you a sense of the order of magnitude of this harsh proposal pennsylvania would lose 36 million under two of the latta provisions on top of the 43 million cut already programed into fiscal year 1983total reduction to pennsylvania 79 million illinois would lose 35 million under two of these latta provisions on top of the 32 million reduction they already face going into fiscal year 1983total reduction to illinois 67 million i would be glad to share copies of this state data so that you can see the impact of each of your states the implications are clearthis budget attempts to solve the federal budget problem brought on by this administration by abrogating responsibility for it and shifting it to the states we cannot accept that policy how would the administration achieve these shifts of costs to the states it is interesting to try to determine this every explanation of how the cuts will be achieved changes as soon as the specifics are criticized omb is now in the acttrying to confuse the picture of how the savings will be made they are banking on the fact that by shifting gears every few hours they will fool enough people here so that they can get votes for the latta budget before we in the congress understand what the cuts mean but i do not believe members will be fooled the billions of dollars they intend to cut have not changed and i think we all understand that the real way they intend to achieve these cuts are the ways shown in all the descriptions that accompanied the latta proposal when it was released what were those changes first they would shift 600 million to the states by reducing the current federal medicald matching rate for all socallerl optional services and optional eligibility groups by 3 percentage points this means that states will either have to increase the amount of money they put into medicaid or cut back on current coverage i want everyone to understand who these optional groups are and what these optional services are the op tional eligibility groups are not just the medically needy but include all elderly and disabled persons in nursing homes with income in excess of 25 a month they are considered mandatory eligibles only if they receive less than 25 per month from all sources these are the people latta defines as optional for purposes of cutting federal funds under medicald states would have their federal support slashed for the large majority of medicaid aged and disabled individuals in nursing homes what are the socalled optional services they include nonskilled nursing home care prescription drugs dental care eyeglasses and hearing aids this 3percentage point cut in matching will force states either to find additional funds of their own or to eliminate coverage for these services and people that is how latta proposes to solve the federal budget problem for our nations discretionary health programs latta proposes flat funding of 8 billion per year for 3 full years real purchasing power will decline and the result will be serious shortfalls in critical programs biomedical research at the national institutes of health will decline funding for important and costeffective programs like childhood immunizations maternal and child health services family planning and nursing programs will be at risk this budget is totally unacceptable for health the aged and disabled medicare beneficiary cannot afford to have this budget pass the states cannot afford to have this budget pass lowincome children aged individuals and nursing home patients cannot afford to have this budget pass our public health efforts cannot afford to have this budget pass i urge all of you to defeat the latta substitute and to support the jones budget"], [0.0048179030418396,

eligibility limitations under the program rather than basing the limit on the area family median income the revised version of the bill would utilize the statewide family median income a statistic which is already kept by the department of housing and urban development i believe the use of the statewide figure would be more equitable lnd would eliminate the possibility that families with identical incomes in neighboring communities in the same state would or would not qualify for the program based upon the statistical area in which they happened to reside this concept continues to recognize however that incomes around the country vary from state to state and takes that into account in determining the proper income limitations as in the prior bill eligibility would be for those at or below 130 percent of the family median income but as i have said the statewide not area median would be employed there are no other changes to the legislation high interest rates are making it virtually impossible for firsttime homebuyers even those with very reason able incomes who have saved diligently to afford a home besides the dev astation caused to these families by their inability to participate in the american dream of homeownership construction and building trades persons homebuilders realtors building suppliers and those in financial institutions have suffered greatly as millions of the postwar babyboom generation have reached adulthood the problem has only gotten worse and the administration unable or unwilling to propose concrete solutions has done nothing unacceptably high interest rates show no sign of significantly decreasing any time soon the firsttime homeowners opportunity act would provide mortgage assistance in fiscal year 1983 to more than 100 000 firsttime home purchasers whose family incomes are no more than 130 percent of statewide median this assistance would be utilized to reduce the cost of an phainsured mortgageby direct payments by the federal government to the mortgage holderto as low as 9v percent but would be limited to no more than the amount necessary to reduce monthly payments for the mortgage insurance and real estate taxes to 30 percent of the homeowners income the limitations requiring the homeowner to expend 30 percent of income on housing costs means that the mortgage will not necessarily be subsidized to as low as 9 percent thus saving federal expenditures and allowing us to serve a greater number of firsttime buyers payments would continue for 10 yearsunless the homeowner sold the homebut could be continued after 10 years if the secretary of hud determined that the family was still financially unable to assume the full cost of the mortgage assistance would be recaptured upon sale of the home but would be limited to 50 percent of the net appreciation of the value of the property purchasers of new and existing singlefamily homes and individual condominium and cooperative unitswhich do not result in the displacement of a tenantcould utilize the program the maximum sales price would be 110 percent of the maximum pha mortgage which will mean a price limit of 74 000 in most parts of the country the minimum downpayment would be 5 percent of the purchase price to illustrate the dramatic effect this program can have on the lives of firsttime homeowners take the following example to purchase a 60 000 hme a modestly priced dwelling by todays standards and to carry a 57 000 mortgage at 15v percentthe current fha interest rate limitfor 30 years cost 767 including mortgage insurance adding real estate taxes and hazard insurance means the monthly housing cost is likely to be over 900 a family earning 35 000 applying 30 percent of its income to housing could not afford such a mortgage without the assistance this program would provide on the other hand with the help the firsttime homeowners opportunity act would offer a family with an income of approximately 25 000 applying 30 percent of its income could afford the same mortgage and home and could therefore have a chance to participate in the american dream the 400 million appropriation authorized in this legislation

which i am offering is long overdue my amendment would prohibit the use of any authorized funds for the procurement research development testing and evaluation of the f alb it does not delete any funds the money targeted for the p alb would be available for other aircraft programs which meet our real defense needs this amendment addresses a pentagon pipedream of a souped up super technological fighter which is hidden in a hazy world of misplaced priorities and misplaced loyalties to a plane rather than to the defense of these united states these loyalties moreover are to a plane that does not stand the test of its original promise orprojections in 1975 congress approved a lowcost lowperformance alternative for the navy and marine corps this was the f alb today we have a high cost lowperformance edsel hidden in a smokescreen thrown up by dod but even through the smokescreen we can see one thing risingthe exorbitant costs for the f alb it is not as if there arc no alternatives to the p a18 one part of the defense smokescreen consists of stonewalling by the department one year ago congress heard the plaintive voice of dod proclaim that there were no alternatives to fulfill the four roles envisioned for the f alb since then the marine corps has eagerly embraced the av8b the light attack role while the navy has gladly accepted a policy of f14 squadrons for all its big deck aircraft carriers there are two roles remaining for the f ala the navy light attack and the marine corps fighter but once again dod is wailing that there are no alternatives available in the best traditions of stonewalling the navy has even gone so far as to deny that it has conducted studies of f alb alternatives however i have in hand three studies conducted by the navy on alternatives to the p ala studies which indicate that the alternatives are not only feasible but preferable let me quote from these socalled nonexistent navy studies on the light attack mission one study states the f18 represents major degradation in our attack capability as compared to present aircraft with f18s designed payload 4 rockeycs a7 radius of action is twice as far with four times the f18s design load the a6 radius of action is twice as far many targets that might be critical could not be reached with fis for targets that the fi8 could reach its smaller payload would require more attack aircraft exposure to enemy defenses although the fpis is faster in a fighter configuration than either a6 or a7 it is not supersonic nor significantly faster when carrying weapons and if adequate fuel is provided to allow the fl8 to leave the target at supersonic speeds after weapon delivery the f18s usable weapon payload is even further degraded this same report addresses the marine fighter mission and says the remaining prospective f18 mission is the marine corps fighter mission since the p14 is probably more capable than is necessary for the classic marine corps air defense mission the f18 appears an adequate replacement for marine f4s however the tradeoff is between providing the f14 and greater fighter capability versus providing a less capable av8b3 fighter variant that would offer support logistic advantages plus the tactical advantages of an allvstoi marine corps fighter and lightattack force the navy would still like to claim that the f alb is essential to the future effectiveness of the navy and marine corps but their own analysis reveals that the analyses of alternative aircraft procurement strategies recently forwarded by cnm chief of naval material to cno chief of naval operations show that the navy can more fully satisfy its aircraft requirements and more rapidly build up toward 15 air wings if the f18 is cancelled 11 4448 co and a7s or a6s used for the navy attack aircraft the effectiveness analysis shows that it would also result in a more effective force it is difficult to make a case on cost or effectiveness grounds for continuance of the p18 program in further unqualified support of the f ala the f alb program manager admitted at a recent press conference that the f14 was a better fighter than the f ala and that the a6 was a better attack plane the prime rationale for the f alb is not the aircrafts necessity rather the department of defense supports the f ala because of its supposed affordability i submit to my colleagues that nearly anything is affordable at 40 billion our military personnel could have calvin klein designer uniforms at that price but i doubt if it would enhance our defense capabilities are we to allow the navy and the department of defense to continue their spendthrift ways on the f ala and bankrupt other more essential naval programs the problems with this plane are many it has a limited radius half that of the a7 the acceleration threshold had to be reduced to meet the planes true capabilities it has not yet completed the mandated two lifetime fatigue test nor have the alloys added to the engine as a result of a crash been tested however these problems significant in any other plane pale in comparison to the continued cost escalation of the f a18 this aircraft was originally purchased because it was supposed to give us the quantity of aircraft the navy needs it was supposed to be a low cost daylightonly aircraft the f a18 got its first taste of megabucks with the addition of radar missiles in 1974 since then the addiction of the navy to goldplating has taken hold of the f ala aircraft however the navy is now showing selfrestraint recent costcutting measures for the f ala include the substitution of aluminum for silver in the detonating cords to explode the canopy i am glad but surprised that only aluminum will suffice with a near 40 billion price tag i would have thought that the cords should have been made of gold to match the plane with spending of this sort is it any wonder that the program has grown in cost so that despite an increase in the quantity of the dod purchase the unit cost has doubled in 5 years the navy claims that the cost growth is strictly due to inflation however this claim simply does not stand the test of careful analysis recently most members received information comparing program costs of the f ala to those of its contemporary the f16 this information demonstrated that the f a18s costs have increased nearly three times as much as the f18s

billion increase in the military budget this year we are talking about almost doubling it in the year 1986 to shock the members in a different way in the decade of the 1970s this country and many of us served in the house during the seventies we spent 1 trillion on the military function in the first 5 years of the 1980s we are anticipating spending between 1 3 to 1 5 trillion with cost overruns and what have you it is conceivable in the first 5 years of the 1980s our military budget expenditure could exceed 2 trillion if we project that out to the year 1990 it is clear by most con~servative figures that this country will be spending between 2v2 trillion and maybe 2 7 trillion or 2 8 trillion so in a 10year period we are talking about more than doubling close to tripling the military budget now the qu tion that the average citizen in this country ought to be asking is how do you finance this large substantial sustained increase~ in the military budget members of the committee there are really only three ways you can do it either you go to the american people and you say that the nature of the world is so frighten ing so dangerous so unstable that we must now askthie american people for new taxes in order to finance this incredible burden but not one politician in this body the other body or down at the other end of pennsylvania avenue is actually advocating levying new taxes to finance this increase so let us throw that out as an option the second alternative is to engage in substantial budg6t deficit spending but this administration has trapped itself in the rhetoric of the balanced budget it cannot insult my intellect nor the intellect of the american people by suggesting that a democratlc party budget deficit is inflationary and a republican party deficit is not inflationary we know that is absurd so to engage in deficit sepending is a travesty they have t6 show by the next election that they had moved toward a balanced budget or they have lost credibility so they cannot engage in deficit spending for any substantial period of time to finance this incredible increase in this military budget to 367 lbillion by fiscal year 1986 so what is the third alternative the third alternative is to reach into the nonmilitary side of the budget and engage in substantial cuts in order to finance this incredible increase in the military budget and that is the assertion that i make on the floor this afternoon this administration suggested a budget authority cut of 48 4 billion on the nonmilitary side and led the american people to believe that we are reducing federal expenditures a couple of weeks later you make a budget schedule that increases the military budget by 53 3 billion that has to be a wash the argument that i assert aggressively is that these budget cuts are not designed to fight inflation our own congressional budget office indicated that cutting 2 5 billion from the budget would only reduce the inflation rate by between 0 1 and 0 2 of 1 percent so what is this all about it is about financing an increase in the military budget which becomes the least politically risky and the safest way to do it because levying taxes has political implications engaging in continued budget deficits has political implications but ripping off the poor ripping off workingclass people ripping off senior citizens ripping off the children and middleincome citizens of america is becoming the safest way to engage in financing military budgets the american people need to desperately understand that is what this is all about so the question then becomes is there a rationale for the expenditures and for this incredible amount of money i do not believe so and later in this debate we will be making a significant argument that challenges the assumptions of those who perceive the prob lems of the world as being military problems that can be solved in a military fashion there are those of us in this body who frankly and legitimately believe that the problem of the 1980s bring new imperatives call for new policies there are 160 nations in the world many of them eager for freedom and to simplylook through the narrow confines of the parochial prism of united statessoviet ideological relations is an absurdity we have to begin to look at the economic social and political realities of human mnisery in the world and that does not dictate this incredible expenditure of the military budget to rip off millions of human beings who have a right in a free and open democratic society to believe that their government would not abandon them should not be the people upon whose back we build an incredible military machine there have been a number of economists who have pointed out that there are really

year it should be obvious that the federal government does not have the money i have absolutely no objection to programs of this nature and local and state governments and perhaps private enterprise might wish to consider maintaining and expanding this program state and local governments generally have to operate within balanced budgets lack the massive moneyabsorbing bureaucracy of the federal government and allow local people to have more control over their own programs second it is pure hypocrisy for congress to decry massive budget deficits and overspending by the federal government and to sponsor balanced budget amendmentswhile at the same time playing to the grandstand with proposals that add to the federal deficit third it is wildly inaccurate to claim that federal progrpms pay for themselves and do not end up costing the taxpayers if overspending by the federal government paid for itself as is claimed for virtually every domestic program contained within the budget we would not have 100 billion deficits or trillion dollar national debts today fourth such resolutions are in themselves meaningless because congress will either appropriate the funds or it will not therefore one must assume that the purpose of such proposals is simply another liberal ploy to encourage partisan and philosophical demagoguery prior to the november general elections liberalsand many conservatives are quite aware that they will be painted as ogres haters of the elderly and uncompassionate individuals if they vote against such grand sounding proposals fifth spending on the federal level for this and similar programs actually worsens the lot of those it is designed ostensibly to help federal overspending robs the elderly and forces their backs against the wall by creating inflation inflation destroys the purchasing power of the elderly more than any other group because so many are dependent on fixed incomes so while the seen hand of federal largesse may have the public relations image of helping the elderly the unseen hand of federal deficits debt and inflation soon destroys any positive effects that earlier help may have had sixth such resolutions actually make prostitutes of many politicians becaue they in effect sell their votes for the programs in return for the votes of specific groups on election day in other words the unspoken agreement is that the various lobbing groups will urge their member to vote for congressman x because he voted for the program pushed by that lobbying group the problem is that the money of current taxpayersand future taxpayers considering the national debtis being used to buy the votes finally this process and the lack of courage on the part of many politicians are the reasons why our nation is in such an awful economic mess today we must realize the federal government cannot give something to anyone or any group that it has not first taken away from someone else this is especially true where deficit spending is concerned because it obligates money from future taxpayers with our national defenses desperately in need of rapid rebuildingit has been postponed for more than a decade due to committments for social spendingand our economy in dire straits the amerian people deserve more than irresponsible rhetoric and demagoguery from congress unfortunately in the case of this vote they

people who have spoken here today and i predict it will be true for those who speak here tomorrow and during the debate on the amendments that we all agree that something has got to be done about the deficit something has got to be done to reduce the amount of national income being absorbed by government something has go to be done to reduce interest rates by reducing the amount of money that the federal government borrows but i also assert that when you get beyond that basic agreement fundamental differences that divide this house and divide this country become very clear in the major budget substitutes that will be voted on next week there are clear differences as to how we achieve those goals i would like very briefly to take the budget which was reported by the house budget committee and compare it to the bipartisan recovery budget which will be offered by the gentleman from ohio on behalf of the republicans and the conservative democrats who seek to control the deficit by controling spending i would like also to compare based on tentative data the budget that will be offered by the gentleman from ohio on behalf of himself and conservative democrats to the socalled coalition budget which will be offered by the gentleman from wisconsin i think when you look at these comparisons you will see very clearly what the choices are before the house if you take the data contained in the vehicle reported by the house budget committee you can break the basic policy changes into five different areas what we do about nondefense discretionary what we do about targeted entitlements what we do about other spending reductions what we do about defense and what we do about taxes we are going to hear a lot of discussion in this budget debate about economic assumptions as we did in the last but what is relevant is not what we assume about the world but what we do about the realitics that we face i think in looking at what we do in these five functional categories you will clearly see the difference in the area of nondefense discretionary the bipartisan recovery budget cuts nondefense discretionary spending 72 percent more than the jones house budget committee vehicle over the period 1983 to 1985 in the area of targeted entitlements the only section other than revenues that will be reconciled that committees will be forced to make changes in under the reconciliation process the bipartisan recovery budget cuts targeted entitlements 139 percent more than the jones house budget committee budget over the 3year period in the area of other spending reductions the bipartisan recovery budget reduces other spending 489 percent more than the house budget committee in the area of defense the jones house budget committee budget cuts defense 69 percent more than the bipartisan recovery budget in the area of taxes the jones house budget committee budget raises taxes by 55 percent more than the bipartisan recovery budget and in the end achieves the same bottom line basically these differences are repeated when you compare the aspin coalition budget and the bipartisan recovery budget that will be offered here if we look at nondefense discretionary and other spending reductions the bipartisan recovery budget cuts nondefense discretionary spending 62 percent more than the aspin coalition budget over the 3 years that the budget is in force in targeted entitlements the bipartisan recovery budget cuts targeted entitlements 119 percent more than the aspin coalition substitute in defense excluding pay the aspin coalition budget cuts defense 83 percent more than the bipartisan recovery budget in the area of taxes the aspin coalition budget raises taxes by 42 percent more than the bipartisan recovery budget over 3 years o 1640 my point in making these comparisons is this the house next week is going to have to choose between two real options one option is embodied in the budget presented by the house budget committee and slightly modified in the coalition aspin substitute that option says let us raise taxes and slash defense so that we can continue spending as usual in washington the real alternative is the bipartisan recovery budget which says let us focus our attention on spend ing so that we can meet our legitimate defense needs and so that we can let the american people keep more of what they earn those are the options that we must choose between do we want to raise taxes and slash de fense to continue spending or do we want to control spending so that we can meet our legitimate defense needs and let the american people keep more money in their pockets to provide positive incentive for people to work save and invest those who have talked about how much trouble the economy is in would have ns deal with those economic problems be raising taxes and by increasing spendng i believe that those are the policies that brought us to this sorry state and i do not believe that going back to the policies of the 1960s and 1970s will solve our problems i think it is important that we pass a budget that gains control of spending and gains control of the deficit that puts strong downward pressure on interest rates but i think the focus has got to be on the problem and the problem is spending taxes were doubled over the last 6 years and yet the deficit grew every year our problem is not inadequate taxes our problem is excessive spending in the bipartisan recovery budget we have an opportunity to do something about that excessive spending so i hope that we will have a good debate in which everyone will look at the issues what do we do about domestic nondefense spending what do we do about meeting the legitimate defense needs of our nation how much burden do we place on the shoulders of the working men and women in america in those three areas the differences among these budgets will be very clear i would like to make one additional point and that is that we have heard and we will hear a lot of talk about equity are cuts fair do we treat entitlement and discretionary programs fairly in terms of choosing where to make reductions but i would submit to my colleagues that there is another issue of fairness and that issue has to do with taxes how much burden are we going to put on those who are pulling the wagon as well as the burden that we are going to put on those who are riding in the wagon and in the ultimate fairness test by controlling the growth of taxes and focusing revenue increases on reducing the deficit rather than increasing taxes to go on spending i believe the ultimate fairness issue is going to be settled on the side of the bipartisan recovery budget may 2l 1982 so i look forward to the debate and i believe when the american people look at the three choices when our colleagues look at these three areas of difference in defense in nondefense domestic spending and in taxes i believe the bipartisan recovery budget is going to be adopted"],

attention today we should ^be saying you have led the way now well proceed many of us would like to claim bold leadership in addressing the issue of cutting government spending we cannot we are following the orders of our constituents who preceded us on this issue we now have the responsibility to carry out those orders congress own committee funding is a good place to start i support the 10percent reduction it is a significant cut yet it would not ii 1091 cripple any necessary committee action we know that some committees and subcommittees should be cut even more others should be cut less or not at all as wielders of the ax we must make discriminate chops statistics documenting the growth of government spending are so numerous as to strain our capacity for retention some point to the growth of congressional staff as a prime example of the ballooning bureaucracy well it is true congressional staff growth and the increase in committee funding levels over the past 10 years is well documented by figures the figures however only address the symptoms the disease itself remains we need to be wary of the quick cure and if we are to be responsive to the budgetcutting demands of our constituents we must look beyond the figures documenting congressional stnff growth to the reasons for this growth there is where the doctoring is really needed one reason for the growth of committee staffs can be traced to the burgeoning bureaucracy in the executive branch executive branch personnel and funding levels have increased enormously over the past two decades new programs have been instituted with corresponding new staffs task forces have been established to study specific problems old programs have been expanded and staffs increased to handle the work load it is quite understandable that congressional committee staffs have increased commensurately just to monitor and conduct oversight investigations of increased executive branch activity we must also cut back the executive bureaucracy president reagan has promised to reduce the size of the federal work force to reduce the size and number of federal programs i believe that he is committed to this kind of a spending cut in the federal bureaucracy when this happens it should be easier for us to also reduce the sizes and budgets of our special committee staffs responsible for doing the work generated by some of these executive agencies another important reason for the growth of committee staffs can be traced to the legislative reorganization act of 1970 this act partitioned the committee staffs into majority and minority parties and gave each an unwritten but implicit mandate to develop partisan positions let us look at the hard statistics on this point from 1960 to 1970 the funding levels for investigative committee staff increased by 320 percent this figure is certainly large enough in and of itself but from 1970 to 1980 investigative committee staff funding increased by 526 percent this is a sizable increase in the rate of committee staff growth and it happened immediately after the legislative reorganization act went into effect this act partitioned the committee staffs into majority and minority parties and gave each an unwritten but implicit mandate to develop partisan positions let us look at the hard statistics on this point from 1960 to 1970 the funding levels for investigative committee staff increased by 328 percent this figure is certainly large enough in and of itself but from 1970 to 1980 investigative committee staff funding increased by 526 percent this is a sizable increase in the rate of committee staff growth and it happened immediately after the legislative reorganization act went into effect there will be an attempt here today by the minority to cut committee funding even more than the substantial 10percent cut proposed by the distinguished majority leader anything more than the 10percent cut would be a severe blow to the efficiency of the house committee system the purpose for such a cut is more than simply to spend less money we know that the senate now controlled by the minority has not seen fit to cut its own committee funding to this extent we know that the senate and the white house while being budget conscious in spending levels for their own staffs are still leaving themselves sufficient funds to carry out their mandated duties efficiently at the same time though there are those who would demand that the house sustain a burden of budget cutting greater than its share to the possible detriment of its efficiency and its ability to do its job i can only assume that this effort is a partisan one designed more to hamper the effectiveness of a house still with a democratic majority than to be responsive and responsible to the budgetcutting demands of the american public our president has told us that the issue of reducing federal spending at all levels is nonpartisan our constituents tell us the issue is nonpartisan commonsense tells us the issue is nonpartisan yet the structure of our committee system created by the reorganization act of 1970 makes it partisan as do some of the efforts on the floor of this house

the tide of the mergers of the savings and loan establishments from the small and midsized communitqs many times we have all heard president reagan talk about getting the federal government off the backs of the peopleof giving back to state and local governments decisionmaking powers that rightfully belong with themof allowing decisions to be made on the grassroots level mr reagan is to be applauded for recognizing the importance of freedom of enterprise however many times we have seen this administrations policies perhaps unintentionally work against those stated goals in the savings and loan industry decisionmaking and managerial responsibilities are moving out of the communities directly affected this transfer of responsibility is an indirect result of high interest rates let me illustrate with a few examples from my own district in arkansas in my district two savings and loan institutions in helena ark havebeen merged with institutions in little rock and pine bluffboth outside of the first congressional district in west memphis marianna and batesville savings and loan institutions have been merged into one little rock savings loan associationagain out qf my district other savings and loan institutions remain in the first congressional district whose decisionmaking powers have be absorbed by other larger associations since january 1 1981 29 savings and loans in arkansas have completed or announced mergers arkansas has thus far escaped savings and loan failures and mergers with savings and loans from outside the state but these examples of the problems facing savings and loans can be found elsewhere five texas savings and loan institutions were merged with a los angelesbased savings and loan this year is this giving the community power over its fate all of the mergers in arkansas i have mentioned are the result of declines in net worth or were encouraged by declines in earnings and net worth as the result of mortages held by those institutions at such low rates as 7v4 percent while those institutions are paying much more for that money one little rock savings and loan institution which has remained profitable has done so by making no home loans in more than 3 years eleven smaller savings and loans have bceen merged with that institution this year that statement illustrates for you the effect that is wrought on the homebuilding industrythe savings and loans which will provide financing for homes are disappearing passage of this bill would only be a beginning to the solution the longterm solution is to bring down high interest rates and we are all working toward reduction of the deficit to accomplish that end but this bill is necessary now to stem the tideto stop the decisionmaking responsibilitys flow outside of the communities affectedto do something to bolster the housing industry now if the conduit for home financing is destroyed by lack of action by the congress the homebuilding industry will be destroyed in arkansas

amendments were published in the record on monday and since that time we have started to have time to go through the various amendments i am somewhat shoked to learn that the latta proposal the principal information that is coming outand if this information is in fact wrong i hope it will be corrected during the debatebut the indications are that the latta proposal contains some 92 billion in nondefense cuts over the next 3 years in the area of medicare and area that is absolutely vital to our senior citizens it appears that there is 23 billion cut in medicare and this is a 50percent deeper cut than that propoed by president reagan in his budget proposal which was rejected by both the house arnd the senate this means that 29 million elderly people would be forced to pay more for health care under this pr posal than they are currently it also appears that there will be some 22 billion in cuts in low income housing programs it also appears that the poorest of the poor on food stamp programs will also receive cuts along with the elderly the blind and the disabled because of some 8 billion cut in the food stamp program women infants and children a program that is designed to aid pregnant women who are poor who have been medically certified to be at nutritional risk is cut in a sufficient amount to require some 400 000 women to leave this program this is a program that has reduced infant mortality by a third i think the supporters of the latti proposal ought to think about the ramifications of that this is a program which has returned to us three federal dollars in saved hospital costs for every 1 we have invested in providing for a healthy baby and a healthy child now that the latta proposal has cut 92 billion out of social programs that is not enough they raise taxes by 95 billion now you would think that that would get you toward a balanced budget but it does not because in 1985 we find out after cuttine the poorest of the poor in this country after attacking the elderly through medicare after attacking the blind and disabled the healthy and those on food stamps after attacking the poor on low income housing and after attacking poor pregnant women in this country that they are still 57 billion in deficit so you are not going to see a diminishing of interest rates you are not going to see an economy that picks up and bounces along in fact the latta proposal even attacks housing it tries to reverse the billion dollar program that was voted on the floor of this houre to try to encourage the housing industry so people in this country can afford housing so i think all members of the congress especially perhaps the republican members of the congress will be most interested in reading very carefully the latta proposal because i think they will want to understand that if this proposal will do the same thing for the republican party in its standing in the polls that grammlatta did for the standing of the republican party in the public opinion polls it is very interesting and maybe now we understand better why the president of the pnited states has public relations people trying to convey the impression that he is a fair person that he is the image of fairness he wants to appear to be fair and yet he supports this kind of effort that is a direct attack on the poorest of the poor let me say to my colleagues that there is another way there is another way to achieve the economic goals that we aspire to there is a way to achieve lower interest rates there is a way to achieve economic recovery but you need not decimate poor people in this country anc interestingly enough without drelmating poor people in this country you can arrive at a balanced budget by 1985 because in fact if this congress will simply have the will of its convictions the courage of its convictions to go on a payasyougo basis then in fact we can achieve a budget surplus by 1985 the other proposals want to raise defense spending by 23 billion as does my proposal except that i am willing to pay for it and the other proposals are not as a result of that the members will see by this chart that every other proposal continues in the red all the way through 1985 the republicans remain in the red by 57 billion the house budget committee remains in the red by 42 billion and the senate remains in the red by 64 billion after the republicans have slashed poor people and medicare and everybody else they still cannot balance the budget and yet they are going to raise our taxes so i think the members of the house and the people in this country ought to consider whether in fact they want a change of direction what the rules committee has done by making my substitute amendment in order is to allow this country for the first time to tear up the national credit card it is allowing this country for the first time to go on a payassyougo basis it is allowing this congress for the first time to stop spending money today and sending the bill to the taxpayers tomorrow it is doing that not because i say so tiose are the cbo figures this is the onl budget that emerged from cbo with no changes because there are no gimmicks there are no smoking mirrors there is in fact a sound fundamental principle that if we are going to spend money we are going to pay for it we just heard the chairman of the subcommittee on social security say that under each and every one of theseother proposals we really do not fund social security and that come august of next year a year from now what we are going to find out is that we are going to be somewhere between 8 billion and 10 billion short if you vote for the payasyougo substitute the first one on the agenda for monday morning in fact social security will be fully funded in fact it is the only provision that does that because each and every other provision uses the deficit to make up the difference and it is that practice that has kept interest rates at an alltimte high it is that practice that has kept nemploythent at an alltime high and it is thiat practice that is causing more tbankruptoies than we have seen in recent times so there is a fact another way and i would hope that the members will pick and choose if they do not want to provide cola for social security they do not have to vote for it if they do and they vote for amendment no 1 they will be directing the committee on ways and means to raise sufficient revenue to cover the cost of that cola if they do not want to provide for a 5percent real increase in military spending they do not have to but if they do they will be directing the committee on ways and means to pay for that increase if they want to treat other colas alike the railroad retirement or the veterans benefits they will then also be required to provide the revenues or the savings or the offseting savings to pay for these programs sothat is the choice there is a choice which says that if we have the courage of our convictions whether you agree the government should spend money for purposes that i support or whether you agree the government ought to spend money for other purposes the time has come to start raising those revenues and to place this congress on a payasyougo basis and then what we find is that by 1985 the governu qent can in fact run a surplus without decimating education programs without decimating the defense establishment without decimating nasa or without decimating nutrition programs but by prudently making a determiratlon whether this new expenditure s worth the pain of raising taxes i suspect that making that political decision will greatly reduce the appetite of this body to spend money for programs that do not meet the national interest test so it is clearly a departure from the manner in which the budget process has been run in the 8 years that i have been here but i think also clearly it is a fundamental provision that must be built into the budget provision if we are in fact going to establieh any credibility with the american public because let us not forget what happened last year we had the largest social cuts in history and the largest tax cuts in history and the result was the largest deficit in history the highest unemployment and the most prolonged high interest rates and business failures i do not think the members want to go home and try to explain that i

would terminate if there were a remarriage before the former spouse is age 60 the purpose in a divorce case is to get things settled so that they can go their different ways and not be bothering each other they split property if a couple worked together in a community property state like texas and they bought a farm or a ranch or a small business then when the divorce is finalized they split that property the provision in the amendment says if a spouse remarries she would have to give all property back you cannot do that under state provisions under state law you cannot say if a person remarries they have to give their part of the business back or they will have to give their part of the farm back this really concerns me because the fact that she remarries or not should not have anything to do with the rights that she had vested in her at the time that she was working and living with her husband who was in the military these are the three concerns i have other than that i think the gentleman has a very good amendmont and i would hope he would give some type of commitment that he would look into those concerns"], [0.000282973051071167, 0.49971702694892883, 0, "i wanted

point out that this measure is 1 5 billion below the presidents request i have been a supporter of this administrations efforts to achieve economic recovery and i will continue to do so i support a policy of strong national defense and have consistently supported the president in the past on spending measures for the department of defense including funding for foreign aid support for the caribbean basin which is contained in this appropriations bill in a period of budget austerity i do not believe however that we can afford to support increased defense spending at the expense of all else i firmly believe h r 6863 provided fair and adequate funding to maintain a strong defense posture while it also recognized the importance of necessary domestic programs i supported the original passage of h r 6863 because i believe it established a crucial balance in national spending priorities while maintaining a level of funding that was 1 5 billion less than the presidents request i agree with many of the points and programs supported by the president in the veto message however the president objected to several programs which i support of particular concern to me is the administrations request to reduce the 210 6 million funding for the senior community service employment programa program where senior citizens assist other elderly individuals through community service in virginia this translates into the loss of funding for jobs for 593 senior citizens this figure does not even reflect however the scores of elderly residents who will lose the benefits offered by this community service i also have reservations regarding this proposal to reduce fundiug for education assistance universities nationwide are suffering due to the lack of commitment by the congress to fund authoriz d student loan programs i support these loan programs as a means of allowing young people the opportunity to attend college i disagree with the administrations opposition to 148 8 million for educational programs designed to assist the disadvantaged or objections to the 46 5 million appropriated for education for the handicapped i also disagree with the administrations position denying 39 million for the unitedstates postal service this will directly impact secondclass mailers such as small daily and weekly newspapers and their abilities to continue to publish and distribute h r 6863 also included 112 5 million for federal highways 37 million for urban mass transportation 10 million for alcohol drug abuse and mental health programs and 11 5 million in childhood immunization and other health programsall of which i support moreover i feel strongly that an important factor was overlooked when the president decided to reject this bill some 200 000 americans working for the federal government will face furloughs as a result of the presidents veto if funds are not appropriated by september 15 these individuals were not targetted by the veto however they will be victims of furloughs without pay if these funds are not appropriated this action poses unnecessary hardship for these employees and their families which is completely unjustified i believe we have the responsibility to legislate fairly and take actions to prevent the disruption of government services and programs on which american citizens depend i submit that we cannot afford this veto and urge the presidents action on h r 6863 be overturned e"]]}
