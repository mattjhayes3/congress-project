revenue service engaged in a pattern of conduct that is incompatible with his duties as an officer of the united states as follows commissioner koskinen failed in his duty to respond to lawfully issued congressional subpoenas on august 2 2013 the committee on oversight and government reform of the house of representatives issued a subpoena to the secretary of the treasury jacob lew the custodian of the internal revenue service documents that subpoena demanded among other things all communications sent or received by lois lerner from january 1 2009 to on february 14 2014 following the senates confirmation of john andrew koskinen as commissioner of the internal revenue service the committee on oversight and government reform of the house of representatives reissued the subpoena to him on march 4 2014 internal revenue service employees in martinsburg west virginia magnetically erased 422 backup tapes destroying as many as 24 000 of lois lerners emails responsive to the subpoena this action impeded congressional investigations into the internal revenue service targeting of americans based on their political affiliation the american people may never know the true culpability or extent of the internal revenue service targeting because of the destruction of evidence that took place wherefore john andrew koskinen by such conduct warrants impeachment and trial and removal from office article 2 john andrew koskinen engaged in a pattern of deception that demonstrates his unfitness to serve as commissioner of the internal revenue service commissioner koskinen made a series of false and misleading statements to congress in contravention of his oath to tell the truth those false statements included the following number 1 on june 20 2014 commissioner koskinen testified that since the start of this investigation every email has been preserved nothing has been lost nothing has been destroyed number 2 on june 23 2014 commissioner koskinen testified that the internal revenue service had confirmed that backup tapes from 2011 no longer existed because they have been recycled pursuant to the internal revenue services normal policy he went on to explain that confirmed means that somebody went back and looked and made sure that in fact any backup tapes that had existed had been recycled number 3 on march 26 2014 commissioner koskinen was asked during a hearing before the committee on oversight and government reform of the house of representatives sir are you or are you not going to provide this committee all of lois lerners emails he answered yes we

letter to senator wyden of the senate committee on finance commissioner koskinen said we are transmitting today additional information that we believe completes our production to your committee and the house ways and means committee in light of those productions i hope that the investigations can be concluded in the very near future at the time he sent that letter he knew that the document

inspector general for tax administration found over 1 000 of lois lerners emails that the internal revenue service had failed to produce those discoveries took only 15 days of investigation to uncover the treasury inspector general for tax administration searched a number of available sources including disaster backup tapes lois lerners blackberry the email server backup tapes for the email server

and when i say the war on coal people think of that as if we can actually go and attack a natural resource i am not worried about attacking natural resources i am worried about the impact it has on american families in particular i am worried about the impact it has on families in my district in georgia you cant see this chart but it is a chart that represents section 111 d it is the language that the president used to create his new carbon emission targets i am not saying that congress passed a law to do this because congress didnt pass a law the president just decided he was going to do it i am not saying that the house and the senate got together and debated it because we didnt get together and debate it the president just decided this was the way it was going to be it is 292 words that were already in statute the president has turned it into a 130page regulation that he is implementing on the countryhundreds more pages of technical support documents going behind that this is what president obamas constitutional law professor had to say again this is a regulation that the president is implementing without any action of congress whatsoever laurence tribe the harvard law professor who was president obamas constitutional law professor said this in december of last year to justify the clean power plan the presidents energy plan the epa has brazenly rewritten the history of on obscure section of the 1970 clean air act that is these 292 words i talked about passed by congress in 1970 professor tribe goes on to say frustration with congressional inaction cannot justify throwing the constitution overboard to rescue this lawless epa proposal a clean air act passed in 1970and i will get into some charts that show the successes we have had of previous clean air acts in 1970 1990 the president wants to do things differently than the law of the land allows and he is frustrated as described by professor tribe that congress refuses to do what the president wants us to do i am going to talk about why it is we dont want to do what the president wants us to do we dont want to do it because it is destructive to the american economy and it is destructive to american families we dont want to do what the president wants to do the president hasnt come up here to lobby congress to try to get congress to do what the president wants us to do the president to quote professor tribe is throwing the constitution overboard to rescue this lawless epa proposal we will come back to professor tribe i want to talk about it in terms of my constituency i am right there in kind of the northeastern atlanta suburbs there it is only two counties but they are two of the fastest growing counties in the state of georgia they have also just been named two of the healthiest counties in the state of georgia this is what we are talking about in georgia this is our georgia public service commission that group of elected officials in charge of keeping energy prices affordable for georgia families that group that is tasked with keeping energy supplies reliable in georgia that group that is tasked with regulating energy in the state of georgia it is not the epa it is not president obama it is the georgia public service commission they say this about the presidents rule this rule will be unduly burdensome on georgians placing upward pressure on electricity rates an outcome that is not acceptable to our organization or the citizens that we serve these are not republicans and democrats these are folks who are concerned literally about how families are able to keep the lights on how do you keep the lights on we talk about getting the mortgage paid we talk about getting the car note paid how do you keep the lights on the georgia public service commission is concerned about the burden of this new rule the clean power planthat is what the president calls his planhas nothing to do with clean power it has to do with a war on americas energy security he says this the clean power plan is illegal unfair and unwise that is georgias attorney general that is the one elected official in georgia that is tasked with enforcing the laws of the land as they exist in georgia a statewide elected office he calls this plan illegal unfair and unwise it is not just president obamas constitutional law professor laurence tribe calling it unconstitutional we hear it from our georgia state attorney general as well this is from one of our power suppliers in georgia you may think of power suppliers well of course they want to pollute that is what those big energy companies dononsense oglethorpe power is the group that supplies power to all of the electric coops in the state i know you have electric coops in your state as i do in mine these are citizenowned utilities these are citizenowned companies that make sure the lights stay on oglethorpe power provides the power to those citizenowned groups this is not some big investorowned utility this isnt some dirty power producer this is the group of citizens that represents every single one of us in the state of georgia who receive our power in this way this is what oglethorpe power says consequently there is substantial probability bordering on certainty that oglethorpe power will suffer economic injury if the epa finalizes the proposal in its current form or in any substantially similar form it is a bad idea to do it because congress wasnt involved in it it is a bad idea as professor tribe suggests to do it because the constitution doesnt allow it is a bad idea as georgias attorney general says because it is unfair and it is unwise and it is unlawful it is a bad idea to do it as oglethorpe power says because it is going to burden every single american family particularly these georgia families that oglethorpe power serves if that goes into effect who is going to get hit the hardest i will just use my state of georgia because i get so tired on this house floor of pitting one group of folks against another there is that part of me that remembers when president obama was first running for office and he promised to be the president that had the most transparent administration in american history and he promised to be a uniter bringing america together as we have not heretofore been together in recent times that is not what i see what i see is division what i see are politics of division each and every day so often along economic lines i would argue what is the right metric is not how much money you make in a day it is how much money you are able to make tomorrow the opportunity is the metric on which we ought to measure do you have opportunity for tomorrow do you have choices that you can make to make your life better quoting an energy economist who testified before the energy and commerce committee just this week he said this lowerincome groups will bear the burden of higher energy costs imposed by the epas plan but will be among the least likely to invest in or benefit from the energy efficiency programs that the proposed rule envisions i want you to think about that the president has big plans in this unlawful rule this unconstitutional rule this undebated rule but he has big plans it is twofold number one he is going to get american families to invest in energy efficient products in their home which in theory if i am using less electricity in my home i am going to be spending less money on that electricity the presidents plan is if i can get families to have more efficient products in their home i can drive up the cost of electricity to the home but families are still going to be out about the same amount of money that is not the way the economists see it look at families with their aftertax income of less than 10 000 a year now that is not altogether uncommon in the great state of georgia and certainly those are the folks who already have a tough time keeping the lights on thirty percent or more of their income on average is dedicated to energy costs thirty percent or more of everything that family has is dedicated to paying their energy costs this rule proposes to run those costs up dramatically now you move up to folks who are making aftertax incomes higher than 50 000 and you are down below 5 percent of their income that they are spending on energy costs the folks who can handle an increased rise in energy prices are also going to be those folks who invest in the more energy efficient system it is those folks who are trapped at the bottom of the income ladder who dont have those opportunities to invest in more energyefficient products who are going to be hit the hardest by rising energy prices there is not a man or woman in my district700 000 strongwho doesnt want to see clean air but the presidents rule isnt about clean air it is about picking winners and losers in energy production the president doesnt like coal he doesnt like coal miners he doesnt like coal processors he dont like coal power plant operators this isnt about clean air it is about coal is going to have an economic impact on constituents in my district let me go back to the words that folks use this is the georgia chamber of commerce they obviously have an obligation to grow the economy in georgia let me just tell you that you cant pay taxes if you dont have a job right it is an essential point of basic government economics you need people to work you need people to be successful because if they are not successful they cannot pay their taxes the georgia chamber of commerce is dedicated to success in our part of the world they say epas regulations will impose billions of dollars in costs on the united statesand georgias economy but fail to meaningfully reduce 0o2 emissions on a global scale if epa adopts policies that substantially increase the cost of energy thereby decreasing the competitiveness of the united states investments and emissions will be sent to other less efficient countries with higher c02 emission intensities as a result overly restrictive and costly united states policies to reduce emissions will not only be offset around the globe but could actually result in a net increase i want you to think about that i want you to think about that we just had this conversation in respect to the keystone pipeline the president vetoed bipartisan language passed in this house passed in the senate to build the keystone pipeline this pipeline has been in the approval process for longer than it took to build the entire hoover dam the entire hoover dam start to finish was built faster than we can even get an approval this law wasnt to mandate the building of the pipeline this law was to mandate that the approval process come to conclusion the process still hasnt come to a conclusionthe president wont do itas if if america decides not to build the keystone pipeline oil will not be harvested in the independent nation of canadanonsense canada didnt ask us whether or not they should bring the oil out of the ground they asked us to help them get the oil to market they are americas largest trading partner they said america will you help us with this pipeline the answer should have been absolutely yes if not yes perhaps the answer could be no but instead of a yes or no we had 7 years of delay well that oil is going to come out of the ground it is going to be shipped to a port in canada it is going to be shipped overseas to china i promise you it is not going to reduce emissions it is going to increase emissions because they are not going to process it in china as responsibly as we process it here what is the president asking of us we are talking about how this is going to raise the cost of producing goods again just in georgia between 2005 and 2012the last 7 years mr speakerwe have reduced carbon emissions in georgia by 33 percent the presidents targets have georgia needing another 44 percent in reductions by 203044 percent according to the georgia environmental protection divisionagain these arent the folks who are in charge of polluting the air these are the folks who are in charge of protecting the air our georgia epd which is our equivalent of the epa they are tough on polluters they are tough on folks who dont want to be good corporate citizens they say the cpp this is the presidents proposal does not provide flexibility to georgia in fact the cpp is inflexible and punitive to states that have taken early action i want you to think about that if you were sitting around doing nothing if you didnt come from two of the healthiest counties in the country as i do if you werent worried about protecting the planet about our stewardship responsibilities to the earth if you werent worried about any of those things the president is going to set some targets for you again these are the unlawful unwise constitutional targets but he is going to set some targets for you that you need to achieve if you have been working as we have in georgia to do the right thing ahead of time he is still setting those targets for you giving you no credit for the good things you have done in the past asking you to do even more in the future it is not going to be economically feasible georgia number six in the nation is being asked to do the most by the white house in this unwise unlawful unconstitutional rulemaking lets talk about the dollars and cents that are required here for the nation we are talking about between 360 billion and 480 billion to implement the presidents proposalagain the unlawful unwise unconstitutional proposalbut the presidents proposal 360 billion to 480 billion according to the economic projections that is going to be about a 12 or 13 percent increase in electricity prices across the countrya 12 or 13 percent increase in utility prices electricity prices across the country now in georgia that translates into about 400 a year we have a pretty mild climate in the great state of georgia but it is about 400 a year per family in my district it is about 94 million a year you put all of my constituents together all those folks who are the boss of the seventh district of georgia together we are talking about almost 100 million lost to implement the presidents plan now my question is for what my folks are responsible folks they are dedicated to their stewardship responsibilities they are dedicated to doing the right thing for the right reasons we are not a district where we try to figure out who is to blame we are a district where we try to figure out how to fix it how do you fix it but the current worldwide carbon emissionsagain this isnt about clean air this is about carbon dioxide in the air carbon dioxide is in the air it is a natural part of the air it is a required part of the air carbon dioxide emissions across the country across the world rather if we talk about developed nations we generally talk about the organisation for economic cooperation and development the oecd carbon emissions of those developed nations are projected to be relatively flat for the twogenerational future two generations from now still flat you are not seeing those increase you look at nonoecd nations those emissions are projected to double and then triple from 1990 when we passed the clean air act you see level emissions coming from both oecd and nonoecd nations about 2000 you begin to see those lines diverge and there is no expectation that nonoecd nations are going to change their carbon dioxide emissions there is a funny thing about the earth mr speaker we are all in this together i dont know if you have reflected on that there is no escaping this big ball of rock that we are all floating through space on we are in this together we will succeed or we will fail together for the price tag of 400 per american family for the price tag of 100 million a year just in my one congressional district for the price tag of more than 400 billion a yearthat is about 10 percent of everything we spend in this country about 10 percent of the federal budgetis the cost of implementing the presidents unwise and unlawful regulation and what we get for that what we get for that investment of american treasure what we get for disadvantaging american businesses relative to foreign businesses what we get for raising the costs of american products so that other products around the globe can be cheaper what we get for thatgolly i dont know if you can even see itis this little bitty red line in terms of carbon reductions what i have charted here are metric tons of carbon being produced carbon dioxide being produced around the globe this is the entire globe here i have 1990 i have 2010 i have 2020 i have 2030 the benefit of disadvantaging american workers the benefit of disadvantaging american manufacturers the benefit of raising prices for every single american family is that the amount of carbon produced on the entire planet will drop the distance of this little bitty red line i dont think you can see it now that is 2020 2030 perhaps the line gets visible enough to see it is virtually nothing virtually nothing the president talks about this unwise unlawful unconstitutional proposal as if it is designed to save the world it is not it is not designed to save the world it is not designed to reduce carbon emissions around the globe it is designed to put coal out of business in america we are the saudi arabia of coal we have coal we have clean coal we have coal now if we pulled up the charts of the energy information administration they are not going to tell you that coal production in america is going to go to zero it is not it is falling off dramatically we are putting coal mining families out of business in record numbers if you go into coal mining country it used to be all democrats all the time you know there is not one member of this chamber from the democratic party that represents coal country today because coal miners threw every one of them out not because they as individuals were bad members but because the president was driving those individual families out of business those families said we are doing honorable work we are doing lawful work we work hard for a living and we are providing a national service they are absolutely right 500 billion annually in american treasure for virtually no reduction in carbon around the globe now if we were actually going to talk about clean air and i wish we would i wish we would get out of the business of picking winners and losers and talk about clean air i wish we would get out of the business of having an ax to grind about energy producers and get to talking about clean air if we were going to talk about clean air we would talk about things like nox and sox that is nitrogen oxide sulfur oxide nox and sox we passed the clean air act of 1990and i will remind you that was a republican president and a democratic congressthat bipartisan legislation where the president just didnt decide what he wanted to do he came to congress and worked with congress to craft the law it went after what at that time was so frequently referred to as acid rain you would get this nitrogen oxide this sulfur oxide in the air it would come out of the air when it rained it had an impact around the country nox and sox we went after in the clean air act amendments of 1990 the dark green line represents the sulfur the yellow line represents the nitrogen 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2011 and 2012 we came together as a nation we targeted these pollutants in the air and we changed the way we produced power in this country we didnt abolish coal we made it cleaner coal we didnt abolish electric power coming from these big power plants we changed the way the scrubbers and the smokestacks worked and we positively impacted air quality in this country we didnt pass the clean air act of 1990 because we had an ax to grind we passed the clean air act of 1990 because we had a problem to solve and as you can see by this chart we solved it we didnt just spend money to feel better about it we solved it we werent just trying to pick winners and losers we were trying to solve a problem i want to quote the associated press they are talking about coal in this country talking about the presidents rule talking about carbon production they say thisthey say it is leaving this nations shores but not the planet the fossil fuel trade which has soared under president obama soared because we have had record exploration going on on private land as you know the president has completely eliminated exploration on public lands those permits are not going out the door private exploration has soared under president obamas administration they said this fossil fuel trade threatens to undermine his strategy the presidents strategy to reduce the gases blamed for global warming it also reveals a littlediscussed side effect of countries acting alone on a global issues as the unitedstates tries to set a global example by reducing demand for fossil fuels at home american energy companies are sending more dirty fuel than ever to other parts of the world exports worth billions of dollars each year let me go back when we were working together when we were working together in congress working together with the administration we changed the way we produced energy we changed the way we burned this coal to drastically reduce the pollutants coming from that coal in a classic example of federal overreach again acting alone unlawful unwise and unconstitutional the president has said i want to do more and in doing more according to the ap which is no conservative defender in doing more what the president is doing is telling these energy companies dont try to do better dont try to be cleaner we are going to put you out of business in america so bring these products out of the ground and ship them overseas where do you think our overseas competitors rank in terms of reducing these pollutants where do you think where do you think india ranks where do you think china ranks where do you think these nations competing with american workers rank do you think they are producing it as cleanly as we were in 2012 maybe you think they are a little worse like they were in 2000 maybe you think they are as bad as when we started way back in nonsense they are way back here off the chart altogether if you believe in a stewardship responsibility to the planet if you believe we have a multigenerational obligation to care for our environment then you know that only nations with a robust economy have a robust environmental protection program you think about that you will not find a single nation living in poverty that has advanced environmental protections you cant afford to care about the environment if you cant keep the lights on you cant afford to care about the environment if you cant feed your families we do both in this country in the name of protecting the environment the president is forcing these natural resources overseas which has the combined negative effect of polluting the planet to a greater degree and making american workers competitive to a lesser degree you are shipping cheap energy overseas which makes that manufacturing more productive you are raising energy prices in america which makes our manufacturing less productive i am all about making a difference i am all about solving a problem the president wants to spend half a trillion dollars more than 10 percent of what we spend in this country every year focused solely solely solely on reducing carbon emissions by the size of this line that you cant even see and the people who are going to pay the price for that literally the price are going to be american citizens with higher energy bills and american workers with fewer job opportunities we have two models that we can choose from we can choose from the model that we used in the clean air act of 1990 where we came together in a bipartisan way and we solved a problem together we identified the problem we solved the problem and we have measurable results or we can go it aloneand by alone i dont mean america going it alone i mean the administration and the epa going it aloneunlawful unwise unconstitutional spend a half a trillion dollars more than the size of our budget deficit this year making us less competitive trapping more american families in poverty to achieve absolutely no result at all i will end where i began an obscure section section 11 d 292 words that were never intended to allow the president to do what the president is doing where the presidents own constitutional law professor laurence tribe says the presidents desires cannot justify throwing the constitution overboard to rescue this 130page proposal this 130page proposal which promises to do virtually nothing to change global emissions but promises to disadvantage the american economy in a global economy we can solve our energy challenges we can find energy independence in this country energy security in this country we can solve our environmental stewardship responsibilities we are doing things cleaner and better today than we ever have and we will continue to do so the value of divided government as it is today the value of folks who hold different ideas as we do today two ends of pennsylvania avenue mr speaker the president and the democratic party on one end and republicans and congress on the other the value of that divided government is that it allows us to do the big things the big and necessary things if it is all republicans or all democrats folks just tend to try to jam their own ideas through whether america likes it or not that is not the way to build a stronger nation divided government requiresnot just allows but requiresthat we come together to solve problems every time the president goes it alone every time congress goes it alone we miss an opportunity to come together and solve a problem to justify the clean power plan the presidents power plan the epa has brazenly rewritten the history of an obscure section of the 1970 clean air act frustration with congressional inaction cannot justify throwing the constitution overboard to rescue this lawless epa proposal we have an opportunity to do better and more importantly we have the ability with the men and women in this chamber mr speakerthe men and women who serve this entire institution this entire nation good men and women on both sides of the aisle who care about american workers and who care about the american economy and who care about not just americas environment but the global environmentwe can come together and we can do better but this proposal by the president

firsthand that it is not always politically correct to stand for your values but we should never back down from protecting the unborn i applaud these brave wvu students for their actions their willingness to stand for life reminds me of my days at dartmouth college when i served as the president of the dartmouth coalition for life i remember standing in the cafeteria and handing out educational materials about protecting the unborn and the development of life while i may not have won any popularity contest by standing up for my beliefs that life is precious and abortion is wrong i sure got my fellow students thinking about the prolife issue my prolife commitment was cemented even further when i became a father i have three children and actually today my youngest daughter turns 7 months old i am pleased to represent the state of west virginia where the prolife movement is thriving and the rights of the unborn are being restored in fact just this past february our west virginia state legislature passed our own paincapable unborn protection act by wide bipartisan margins in the state senate of west virginia the exact same bill banning abortion after 20 weeks passed the state senate of west virginia by a vote of 295 with 11 of 16 democrat state senators in my statethat is 68 percent of the democratsvoting for the bill in the west virginia state house of delegates the vote was 8812 again with twothirds of state house members that are democrats voting for the bill this is a bipartisan issue i am hopeful today that a strong bipartisan majority in this chamber will follow the example of my home state of west virginia and pass the paincapable unborn child protection act so these protections are extended to unborn babies in every state in the united states i am honored to also be the lead cosponsor of the life at conception act which simply clarifies that human life begins at conception there is no question that we in the prolife community have our work cut out for us president obama and most democrats in congress refuse to protect life at any stage one of the best examples of how out of touch the other side on this abortion issue came just a few weeks ago across the aisle in the senate where democrats were willing to block a bill aimed at protecting victims of human trafficking simply because it included a provision that prohibited taxpayer funding of abortion they are the extremists on this issue look at president obama himself in 2008 when he was running for president and he was in a debate against john mccain in the saddleback church forum moderated by rick warren the moderator asked president obama when life began and the presidents response was whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade the president of the united states said it is above his pay grade to say when human life begins that is a shame when i ran for congress i made the commitment to the people of the second district of west virginia that i would do everything in my power to defend the unborn i continue to be guided by my faith my values

law would decrease premiums by 2 500 per year instead they have risen since obamacare has been enacted to go with the increase in cost many americans have seen a sharp decrease in their choices there are fewer plans available restricting the ability of hardworking families to choose coverage that is appropriate for their circumstances taken together this trio of liberal policies is adding layers of bureaucratic red tape forcing americans to pay more for health care and putting taxpayers on the hook in 2009 democrats used the blank check to add 1 5 trillion in discretionary spending when republicans gained control of the house of representatives in 2011 we put discretionary spending on a downward trend discretionary spending funds our federal agencies such as the epa and the irs as well as the department of defense we have made real cuts in spending not slowdowns in growth and not projected cuts down the roadhonesttogod cuts in spending since i took office in 2011 discretionary spending has been cut significantly by 434 billion but this does not address mandatory spending which is the real driver of our national debt this includes programs like food assistance welfare medicare medicaid social security and interest on our debt reforms are needed to ensure these programs work efficiently and are sustainable because of the way obamacare was written and enacted mandatory spending also includes large portions of obamacare funding mandatory spending is on autopilot and will continue with or without congress annual appropriations process the fact is we have to change the law that means both chambers of congress have to pass reforms and the president has to sign them or we have to override a veto mandatory spending accounts for threequarters of all money spent by the federal government this is a 180degree change from when i was a teenager when in 1970 mandatory spending was only about a third of government spending realistically there is only one path to a balanced budget and shrinking our national debt that path is to pass a budget and use a process called reconciliation a budget facilitates reconciliation which only requires a 51vote majority in the united states senate and avoids a filibuster by liberals who want to continue running up americas credit card not doing a budget forfeits the opportunity to do reconciliation reconciliation with mandatory spending program reforms coupled with real tax and regulatory reforms will send a strong signal to our entrepreneurs and businesses which will unleash innovation and the american spirit and will thus grow our economy and provide for our national defense a vibrant economy will provide for our national security and priorities without raising taxes we have an opportunity with a new president next year to send two reconciliation bills to his deskone for this fiscal year and another for the next fiscal year elections do matter and this one has historic implicationsone being a path

there was any evidence that planned parenthood had broken any law even republican chairman chaffetz of the committee on oversight and government reform who investigated planned parenthood said no im
