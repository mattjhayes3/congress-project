district showed a definitive difference in the amount of monies paid by senior citizens for prescription drugs it was higher in the 18th congressional district in houston than in canada and in mexico we find that those who are 85 years old 40 percent of them do not even have the ability to pay for any drugs they have no benefit whatsoever and we must realize that seniors are living longer we also find that seniors are paying twice as much for their prescription drugs if they are medicare beneficiaries and they do not have that provision and so they are buying onethird less drugs what does that mean it means sicker seniors that is what it means these are individuals who have worked hard in our communities then we find the cost of our prescription drugs the amount of money our seniors pay is far more than any other health need that they have and this i would say to my colleagues begs for us to have a prescription drug benefit under the medicare provisions i do not know why it is so difficult this is something we should support i cannot go home and tell my seniors in the 18th congressional district that in the united states of america they cannot have a drug benefit but yet in mexico and canada prescription drugs are cheaper i would say it is time now to support this motion to instruct today i rise in support of the spratt motion to instruct the conferees on the budget resolution the spraft motion sets the stage for enacting a medicare prescription drug benefit or other legislation to improve medicare before the reporting date for a tax cut reconciliation bill by setting september 22 as the date for reporting a tax cut bill protected by reconciliation furthermore the spratt motion recedes to the senates slightly smaller tax cut and also recede to the senate by dropping the reserve fund language in the housepassed resolution that provides for an additional 50 billion in tax cuts while the republicans propose large tax cuts over the next 5 years and reconcile the finance and ways and means committees to report legislation republicans do not show the 10year cost of this tax cut which could be as large as the 792 billion that the republicans proposed and the american people rejected in 1999 moreover the republicans do not intend to strengthen or support medicare due to the fact that there are no reconciliation instructions to require legislation that would actually use the 40 billion reserve earmarked in the budget resolution in addition the republicans have cut nondefense appropriations while defense significantly increased for the third consecutive year republicans have chosen to provide large tax breaks for the wealthy this budget resolution provides at least 200 billion in tax breaks over the next 5 years for the financial elite of america furthermore this resolution is a major down payment for george w bushs proposed trilliondollar tax scheme i will not stand by while our childrens future is bankrupted to fund this irresponsible budget resolution this budget contains deep cuts in domestic spending by 114 billion over the next 5 years fails to provide anything to strengthen social security or medicare cuts nondefense discretionary spending by 19 7 billion in 2001 and 138 billion over the next 5 years below the level needed to maintain purchasing power after adjusting for inflation and pretends to reserve 40 billion for a medicare prescription drug benefit contingent upon essentially turning medicare into a voucher program republicans have used slight of hand to hide the facts of their irresponsible budget by showing the effects of proposed tax cuts for only the first 5 years and not the full 10year projections commonly used during the last 4 years i am disappointed in the budget resolution because i do not believe that it provides adequate investment in our nations future americas future depends on that of her young people in providing them adequate resources and opportunities to become our future leaders including providing them education and ac cess to adequate health care the budget resolution provides inadequate resources for the education of our young people i firmly believe that we must focus our attention and our energy on one of the most important challenges facing our country todayrevitalizing our education system strengthening education must be a top priority to raise the standard of living among american families and to prolong this era of american economic expansion education will prepare our nation for the challenges of the 21st century and i will fight to ensure that the necessary programs are adequately funded to ensure our childrens success we must provide our children access to superior education at all ages from kindergarten to graduate school recent studies emphasize the importance of quality education early in a childs future development and yet despite these studies the budget resolution still inadequately funds programs that would provide for programs targeting children in their younger years in addition we need to open the door of educational opportunity to all american children it is well known that increases in income are related to educational attainment the democratic budget alternative rejects the republican freeze on education funding and allocates 4 8 billion more for education for fiscal year 2001 than the republican budget over 5 years the democratic party demonstrates its commitment to education by proposing 21 billion more than the republican budget resolution the congressional black caucus offered an amendnient in the nature of a substitute that promised to invest for the future of our nation the cbc substitute is a budget that maximizes investment and opportunity for the poor africanamericans and other minorities this budget for maximum investment and opportunity supports a moderate plan to pay down the national debt protects social security and makes significant investments in education and training the cbc budget requests 88 8 billion in fiscal year 2001 for education training and development this is 32 billion more than the republican budget provides the cbc substitute proposed a 10 billion increase over the presidents budget for school construction other projected increases include additional funding for head start summer youth employment trio programs historically black colleges and universities and community technology centers in an age of unprecedented wealth the cbc has the vision to invest in the american family and not squander opportunities afforded by a budget surplus i will not support the failed policies of the past senator mccain has best characterized this budget resolution as one that is fiscally irresponsible i

many good mathematicians go into mit why is this a very bad bill because very bad budget considerations went into this bill this is a bad bill compared to the presidents budget it would cut 2 9 billion from education services cut 1 7 billion from labor with cuts to workforce development and safety investments and cut more than 1 billion from critical health programs this is a bad bill also

house leadership passed a bad budget resolution that puts tax cuts for the wealthiest americans above investments to promote americas education workforce and health services their 175 billion tax cut exceeds the projected budget surplus and requires deep cuts in nondefense discretionary appropriations the result was a republicandesigned budget resolution that was so bad that even the republican chairman of this subcommittee opposed it and soon we will be voting on a measure to repeal the estate tax within 24 hours we will be cutting education and we will be repealing the estate tax how could that be a proper statement of our national priorities repealing the estate tax will provide over 50 billion to the wealthiest 2 percent of taxpayers how much is enough when will republicans be

by the fact that this bill would eliminate head start for some 53 000 children and cut 1 3 billion for urgent repairs to schools across the country these are critical issues for my district and for many districts across the country this bill will also eliminate school counselors serving 100 000 children this action will deprive schools of the professionals they need to identify and help troubled children this bill also does considerable injustice to bilingual and immigrant education the amount included in the bill for programs addressing these issues is 54 million below the budget request the professional development of our bilingual education teachers is critically important the labor hhs and education bill in its current form provides an amount that is 28 5 million below the budget

pool of trained teachers and strengthen the skills of teachers who provide instruction to students who have limited english proficiency these funds support the training and retraining of bilingual

level these cuts will make it more difficult for these workers to find jobs this bill also cuts adult job training for almost 40 000 adults the cuts in adult training programs equal 93 million or 10 percent below the request and 2000 levels finally this bill provides only 9 6 million for employment assistance to another class of displaced workers our homeless veterans there are over a quarter million homeless veterans in this country and the provisions in this bill will deny employment assistance to thousands of these americans who have faithfully served their country this is unacceptable

did not take that with great regard as evidenced by the statement of my friend from that which occurred up there in cleveland so if we are to take a look at now the whole situation with one contract guard guarding three facilities there was a major tragedy then the federal protective service recommended to the public buildings service who is a real estate arm do not put child care facilities near

rise this morning to strike the language that limits the use of funding of federal transportation dollars for the planning design or construction of a light rail system in houston texas this is an effort to speak on this floor and to ask for collaborative support on communitybased efforts dealing with the great needs of regional mobility in an area that is working to comply with clean air requirements as a representative of the aiea that would see the benefits of this light rail project and as a representative from houston that would see the larger benefits i want this floor to know that this is a collective and collaborative effort houston metro simply wants to transfer 65 million in federal funds earmarked for construction of a light rail project in my home city of houston the rest of the monies would come from other local sources what better collaborative federallocal government collaboration than to see the matching funds the effort that the community is making the light rail project has been vetted extensively in our community it has been vetted by the metro board the city council the mayor of houston who is of course a supporter i have received support from the local surrounding congressional members the gentlemen from texas mr green mr lampson mr doggetr and mr turner the mayor of the city of houston the county judge of the city of houston the houston partnership the medical center the astrodome area of which this connector would connect if we just envision a straight line going through a myriad of areas in a city some high some low this light rail connector is in fact a dream effort to ensure a working laboratory to give further data and insight into the idea oirregional mobility it connects the large astrodome where the republican national convention was held along through some depressed areas along through our museum area the rice university main h3438 coi street as most of our towns have their main street which have fallen upon hard times then into our vibrant downtown area and connecting the university of houston downtown that serves a high population of hispanics and african americans this light rail is a win win circumstance it is a system that has been frugal in its analysis no comment or criticism has come from the department of transportation that this is not a good system no criticism has come that they are overrun with the new executive director and ceo of the metro shirley delibero we brought in a very fine rail professional we know for sure that this rail system will help to generate feeder lines if the community so desires in parts west north south and east reaching to all parts of this metroplex as we have seen the proposal of the light rail we have seen a light come into the area we have seen the beginning of a 27story highrise office building we have seen the work of trammell crow residential which is evaluating from 250 unit multiservice or multifamily housing complex in midtown houston we have seen camden development complete a 337unit apartment project in midtown and mccord development which has two highrise office redevelopment projects underway frankly what i am hoping that as we evidence to this body both democrats and republicans alike although this does not rise to the level of a point of order it is a limitation we ask that this body give respect and credence to a collective group of individuals who have sought only to see a return on their tax dollars and to match the work that has gone on in washington d c that has moved people from place to place seattle washington our sister city dallas texas and many other parts of this nation that have had rail and have seen the pollution come down and people being moved efficiently this city is seeking to have their olympics in 2012 and i know by saying that i might rise the ire of some of the other competing cities but we are working very hard to bring that olympics to the united states of course and certainly to texas and certainly to houston this is a real key component to doing that an economic engine and i do believe that those who may find fault with what has happened in the past in 1991 will come to the realization that they can find no fault in what is going on right now there have been meetings and hearings and there are stakeholders and people are concerned i would ask my colleagues to

century i look forward to my colleagues working with me and the gentleman from texas on this very important issue i rise with my colleague mr bentsen to offer an amendment to section 331 of this bill h r 4475 that would only prevent funding for the planning design or construction of a community supported light rail system in houston texas as a representative for the 18th congressional district in houston i fully support the transit funding that was appropriated for houston and approved by the department of transportation for the light rail project the houston metro was to transfer 65 million in federal funds earmarked for construction of a light rail project in my home city of houston the rest of the 235 million needed would come from local funds slated to build park and ride centers and other projects the light rail project is supported by the houston metro the surrounding congressional districts of congressmen bentsen who is a cosponsor of this amendment gene green lampson doggett and turner the business community the mayor of houston lee p brown and the harris county presiding elected official judge robert eckels this light rail project is a winwin situation for everyone in houston as well as the millions of people who visit every year in that it would attract and focus new development and an economic boom around the station areas and to the economically depressed areas within the city of houston and the 18th congressional district which i represent in fact an independent overview written by the greater houston partnership which includes the houston chamber of commerce houston economic development organization and houston world trade stated that the economic impact of the light rail project in houston would have an estimated incremental development over the 20012020 period ranging from 0 percent to 40 percent the light rail project would also reinvigorate retail sales in downtown houston as well as link the two principal employment centers of houston which is made up of 200 000 employees some of the local businesses that began to plan for the economic boom that the light rail project would bring are century development which started plans to build

50 million in renovation fees these are only some of the redevelopment that is being implemented as a result of the light rail project in houston which was to receive federal funding houston has also been hit with major concerns about air quality and requirements for improving its air quality through better mobility plans therefore the light rail project for houston is of urgent need to the community the main street light project is welcomed by the residents of houston light rail will help alleviate houstons traffic congestion problem and significantly reduce the number of motorists that presently pollute the air with exhaust the light rail project will play a pivotal role in regional transportation among other benefits the light rail project will service all day transit demand including peak hours it will relieve bus congestion in the urban core as buses from throughout the region currently converge on downtown this project will offer a transportation choice to many area

that he was going to allow a republican group a group of republicans to put together a bill that he and the republican leadership would find acceptable in terms of hmo reform there was no question in my mind that this was a bill this was an effort by the republican leadership to essentially bypass or kill the bipartisan patients bill of rights that had been drafted by my colleague the gentleman from georgia the gentleman from michigan who has long been an advocate and who formulated the original patients bill of rights the gentleman from iowa myself and others who had basically come up with a bipartisan patients bill of rights that would have achieved real hmo reform at the time on august 6 the speaker said well i am not in favor of that bill the patients bill of rights but i will let the gentleman from oklahoma and a few other members of congress on the republican side see what they can come up with for us to consider in september that perhaps the republican leadership would

amendment i have to apologize to our colleagues that we are taking up the time of the house for something that should be settled in houston texas but i rise and feel the need to rise to explain what is going on here i have been involved in mobility around houston for 20 years i have been involved in the regional mobility plan and in developing that plan in the 1980s that we are now finishing i am very proud of the fact that the city of houston as my colleague says the fourth largest city in the country just does not do things like everybody else does we are a major city and a great city in this country because we do not just do it the same way we are the city that built the astrodome we are the city that has a port that is off the shores of texas and the second largest port in the nation we are a city that does not say that they are not a great city unless they have rail and the reason is and i might point out to my colleagues if they had been involved in all the rail systems as i have and the chairman has for over 15 years they would understand why l a is getting out of the rail business because it is a boondoggle and a black hole for a city that is spread out like l a i might say that houston has stepped outside of the box and developed a regional bus plan that is the model for major cities in america this bill has over 20 million in it finishing the last part of 500 million in building one of the best bus systems in the world because we did not grab ahold of the notion that in order to be a great city they have to have a rail system every line that the gentleman from texas talked about every one of those lines loses huge amounts of money and takes money away from mobility systems for those cities but they do get to take a picture of a nice train and put it in their brochures and it makes everybody feel good the problem here in this particular dispute is that the houston metro following the design of many other cities and the gentleman says no elections were held in those other cities it is because the other cities did not pay attention to the voters in those cities and developed the same strategy that is going on here in houston they developed the strategy of starting a little starter line and when it does not make money and becomes a huge hole for transit funds they go to the people and say we made this great investment but it does not work only because we do not have this other line and when that does not work they say well we are just going to build another line and then they wake up and develop what dallas now has dallas now has a rail line but now has surpassed houston in congestion because dallas is more concentrated on rail than they are for the mobility in dallas i do not want to see that happen in houston it is my responsibility as a member of this committee to make sure that the full funding grant by the fta the 500 million is finished what houston metro wanted to do is take money from the regional bus plan from our regional mobility plan and move it to a rail line that makes no sense whatsoever transportationwise my good colleague and friend the gentlewoman from texas says no criticism there is all kinds of criticism including houston metros own study that says this does not help mobility this does not help transportation and this does not help the environment this is an economic development project to build a signature main street in houston texas a very worthwhile project but this is not a transit system this will not carry anybody this will not get anybody off our freeways this will not get bubba i say to the gentleman from texas out of his pickup and put him on a rail system this is an economic development project my position is if they are going to build a huge rail system in the houston region then the people of the houston region ought to vote on it and decide whether they want a rail system or not instead of doing the back doorway that was done in dallas that was done in portland that was done in miami that was done in many other cities that i described there is no transit benefit here major transportation decisions like the proposal to build this system in houston

by way of background the great majority of commercial properties within the united states are owned by corporations partnerships and limited liability companies that only own one property these are known as singleasset real estate entities the typical singleasset real estate entity has only one major creditor the mortgage lender that provided the financing for the acquisition of the property in most cases the mortgage lenders only remedy in the case of default is to take possession of the property through foreclosure the recession of the late eighties and early 1990s caused a flood of chapter 11 filings by singleasset real estate entities in the typical case the singleasset entity merely sought to stave off foreclosure and to use the bankruptcy process to force concessions from its mortgage lender as a result properties deteriorated and lenders suffered large losses as cases dragged on and on sometimes for months and years in the bankruptcy reform act of 1994 congress recognized that singleasset entities should receive expedited treatment in bankruptcy proceedings in order to protect properties from otherwise deteriorating during these lengthy bankruptcy proceedings at that time congress amended the automatic stay provision of the bankruptcy code to provide that mortgage lenders may have the stay lifted and proceed with foreclosure unless the singleasset debtor files a feasible reorganization plan within 90 days or commences monthly interest payments to the lender however these provisions currently apply only to singleasset debtors whose property are valued at 4 million or less typically when the owner of a building is bankrupt and the lender is allowed to foreclose there is usually a net economic benefit to the property because it is the goal of the lender to maximize the value of the property a weak owner is replaced by a strong owner who has resources to make the repairs attract new tenants and effect capital improvements this benefits our communities as well including the generation of tax revenues moreover by helping to keep the property commercially viable we help ensure that the workers who maintain the building from the janitors to the engineers will remain employed clearly everybody benefits from keeping the property from deteriorating significantly h r 833 would eliminate the arbitrary 4 million cap with respect to expedited foreclosures on these entities so that all commercial properties regardless of value can be protected from deterioration during bankruptcy proceedings however the conyers amendment would prohibit expedited foreclosure in any case where five employees of the property could be lost as such the conyers amendment would not only gut the provision in h r 833 which lifts the 4 million cap but it would also in effect nullify existing expedited foreclosure provisions in the bankruptcy code the conyers amendment would recreate the uncertainty that the current law seeks to remedy bankruptcy courts could hold endless hearings on the application of this amendment and whether certain employees may or may not losetheir jobs chapter 11 debtors could continue to game the system as they have sometimes in the past by hiring employees before filing or delaying the bankruptcy action unfairly moreover the very employees that the gentleman from michigan seeks to protect would be worse off

it is certainly not true that social security is going bankrupt we really do have more than a quarter of a century before that nevertheless it certainly would be better if we could get a bipartisan consensus this session let me say that i would rather see nothing however than see a new model based on some of the ideas that have come from the majority on social security we do not need a new model for social security we need a revitalized model the reason we do not need a new model is because the present model is a feminized model it is literally organized around the needs of women around longer lives around those with lesser earnings and if i may say so around housewives in particular the notions for personal savings accounts do not take into account this feminized model most of the time whe n we talk about social security reform we have reference to the elderly i want to talk for my few minutes not about the elderly but about women whose social security is most endangered because we are talking about social security in 2030 not social security in the year older women have been grandfathered in neither the republican majority or anybody else in his right mind would dare touch social security today they would not dare recommend personal savings accounts for social security today not when 53 percent of those receiving social security would be at the poverty line without it not when it is a major source for twothirds of todays beneficiaries i want to focus on the baby boomers and the younger women whose earnings today translate into pensions or social security tomorrow those are the women who are not secure the last time women members came to the floor to talk about social security i spoke from my past work as chair of the equal employment opportunity commission because it is from that work that i learned to focus on womens earnings it is by focusing on womens earnings today that we have any idea of their pensions or their social security tomorrow only by looking at younger women in particular can we evaluate the notion of personal savings accounts i want to be clear that we should all be saving and we should be doing more in this congress to encourage more saving 401 k s iras iras for homemakers there is ever so much more we must do to encourage savings and indeed savings in the united states is going down and that is itself very serious but the focus on earnings now is how we figure what workers will have tomorrow let us look at women women today earn 24 000 the average woman yearround worker 24 973 for a man it is almost 10 000 more 33 674 what does a woman who earns less than 25 000 have to put into a personal savings account something i hope but i guarantee it is too little social security as we know it needs to be there for that woman she cannot afford to put all of her eggs in a personal savings account basket no matter how we look at earnings we draw the same conclusion the progressive social security model now in place must be there especially for women first for the large number of women with no earnings what are they supposed to do with a personal savings account look at who they are there are only 7 percent of men who spend time out of the work force 21 percent of women spend time out of the work force look at part time seventyfour percent of men work full time only 49 percent of women work full time what are they going to put in personal savings accounts what will their social security look like for that matter that is why it has to be progressive because they will have too little earnings in even to get out enough of social security unless we have the present system which benefits low earners look at the labor force participation 73 percent of men in the labor force 63 percent of women this translates into no pensions or pensions that are too small and it certainly leaves very little for personal savings accounts personal savings accounts are not progressive they go with the market not with need i am with the market i am in the market i want more women to be in the market but i would not want my future if i earned under 25 000 a year to lie with the market by all means go into mutual savings but women cannot afford to leave social security as we know it today behind the republican majority would attribute the difference in wages between men and women to the fact that women are out of the work force more than men and they tell us that all the time when we complain about womens wages that is true but not entirely and there is a debate between us as to what accounts for that gap but let us assume for the moment that they are indeed correct for purposes of argument that the difference is because women spend more time out of the work force and may i ask them to please carry that thinking over to the needs of women into old age if they spend less time in the work force they should be subject to less risk when it comes time for old age what will housewives contribute to personal savings accounts what will parttime workers contribute to personal savings accounts what will mothers who go into the work force later who took time out contribute to personal savings accounts where are the family values when it comes to security for todays young mothers i am not talking about my mother her social security is intact and i think mine will be but what about my daughters that is who we must concentrate on now what about the young mothers who are staying at home and there are more of them because of the absence of a child care system and many more are going back home rather than go where they would like to go to work retirement becomes and is a burden in the thoughts of these women and we must make it less of a burden by encouraging them to save but also by assuring them that social security will be there in the progressive way that their mothers and grandmothers have known it young women are most at risk they are most in doubt we cannot restore confidence in the social security system by dismembering it we must look far more closely at the presidents plan where 62 percent of the surplus goes to social security and 15 percent to medicare then of course we have a balanced notion of means tested personal savings accounts we encourage savings and help people to save and encourage them to save if my colleagues do not like the presidents plan they should draw their own plan but plan it around women who are the americans who will most need the security our country has guaranteed for their mothers for their grandmothers and for their great

florida i want to say that the rhetoric on social security has reached a new level for the time i have been here a short 3 years the gentleman from florida is right nothing that we will do here today or in the next month will change and i think the american people know and i know every member of this body knows nothing will change the fact that every social security recipient will get their paycheck on time with full benefits at least until the year i want to remind members though that what the committee on ways and means has done over the last 8 months under the leadership of the republican majority is focus on an 800 billion tax cut rather than a structural reform for social security i think many of us feel like we ought to set some money aside so when we address the structural reform we will have that money to be able to pay for it i want to talk to the members about the cuts if i might the acrosstheboard cuts i want to tell a very personal story i got word earlier this week that last thursday a young lieutenant commander in the navy who happens to be a cousin of mine lieutenant commander raymond worthington flying off the unitedstatess eisenhower lost power on both engines as he began to take off and the nose turned down into the water and he and his back seat ejected and obviously were rescued and safe but the plane was destroyed i tell that story because his mother for the 3 years i have been in congress has been hounding me about the age of f14s and the availability of spare parts and the shortage of mechanics and people who keep these f14s running and in good shape i want to tell the members this acrosstheboard cut will cut 1 billion out of the operations and maintenance account of the department of defense it will makeit harder for lieutenant commander raymond worthington and his cohorts to get the maintenance and spare parts they need i want to tell the members also what else these acrosstheboard cuts do they take approximately 200 million out of veterans health care something that we all agree has been underfunded for many many many years that is very wrong and i would hope that this congress this house would reject those acrosstheboard cuts"], [0.0006097257137298584, 0.49939027428627014, 0, "i thank the gentleman for his remarks i have no further requests for time and i yield back the balance of my time"],

motive of our members and hear words that are being used about our native americans yes i am from oklahoma basically meaning the home of the red man oklahoma the state that has 22 percent of all native americans in this country i grew up with the choctaw indians in dirtpoor poverty i was the only nonindian on the baseball team i was the minority but did not know it all the rest of them were native americans i gave eulogies at several of my native american classmates funerals so please do not question the motive of people i have witnessed alcoholism among my native americans and their families i was raised with them do not judge the motives of people yes this budget is probably short in total dollars there could be a lot more done but right now as we stand before you we must make a decision on this amendment i was not in appropriations the amendment before us basically is whether we use 22 million for indian health service as my colleague the gentleman from oklahoma said in oklahoma we have the smallest percentage of indian health service funds for our native american families i cannot undo the things of the past but as i stand in front of you i have got an adopted native american daughter i have three native american grandchildren whom i would rather have in my arms tonight than being here listening to this kind of debate let us not question others integrity or whether we are sincere or not sincere we have an amendment before us let us address that amendment and move forward"]]}
