thoughtful consideration and care that he has shown to all of us but particularly to sala during the last several difficult months i have only been in this congress a relatively short period of time i am beginning my fifth year yet i cannot help but reflect that after one of the first weekends that my wife and i left town in our first term we came back to washington and saw a flag at halfmast and did not know why the flag was at halfmast and were shocked and deeply saddened to learn that it was as a result of the passing of one of the giants in politics and in legislative activity not just from california but from the country phil burton and today as i came into the office i saw the flags at halfmast again and was again very saddened to realize that these flags were flying at halfmast for the other half of that wonderful extraordinary team sala burton so much has already been said and there is little that i can add to the eloquence and touching comments of so many of my colleagues both phil and sala meant an extraordinary amount as is evident from what we have already heard and as we are reminded in so many respects almost on a daily basis i on a personal note could not help last night but reflect during the few minutes that i happened to watch the end of the very impressive show about lbj i thought i was watching phil burton as the man who played lbj demonstrated such an extraordinary ability to influence individuals and such an extraordinary grasp of the legislative process since phil burtons death i have thought so often about the legacy that he has left and so many of us have been touched so personally and so deeply by the fact that sala in her own way has not only continued that legacy but has added in her own personal thoughtful caring fashion a very very personal touch to the lives of so many of us and to the legislative activities in this chamber sala had a visceral opposition to discrimination sala had a visceral concern for people in need sala had a visceral commitment to try to help those in this country and frankly around the globe who needed help and who needed assistance from the public sector sala knew in her own mind what was right she did not have to carefully thoughtfully methodically analyze and weigh issues in terms of where she was going to come out she knew she knew what was right and she fought for what was right she cared as deeply as any individual that i have known about people about people that she knew and about people that she would never know as others have indicated she was such an important influence on each of us as apparently was the case with so many of my colleagues and i who find it fascinating listening today to how many people sala expressed so beautifully a concern not just about them but about their families sala would always in her relations with me first ask me how jan was and how the kids were and it was something that sala cared very deeply about jan and i used to participate with sala periodically in a study group and sala would attend that group religiously not because it would provide sala with any political benefit or not because it provided sala with any significant legislative opportunities but because it gave sala an opportunity to participate in something that enriched her life personally and gave sala an opportunity to share with others of us who cared so much about her her own experiences and her own personal concerns so on a family level on a personal level on a legislative level it is going to be extraordinarily different around here with sala not being here physically but as others have mentioned the legacy that sala leaves the inspiration that sala provided the importance that sala had for each of us in her own way is something that has enriched all of our lives so significantly that we are all and i certainly am the better for having had the privilege of knowing sala burton and considering her a very very close friend i know that i am speaking for jan when i express my condolences to salas family and say on behalf of so many of us that sala has made san francisco the country this legislative body and all of our lives much richer than we would

unrelenting assault on amercas elderly and poor that assault is most clearly and most recently reflected in the administrations threats to veto congress reasonable and compassionate budget plan for fiscal year 1988 sadly the administrations continuing attacks come as no surprise to those of us who care deeply about the millions of elderly and poor americans who have always been at the very bottom of this administrations priority list for 7 straight years americas elderly and poor have been the target of a massive assault by this administration and for 7 years democrats in the congress have fought to shield these most vulnerable americans from the unyielding onslaught of the administration budget ax the administration advances the cynical and convenient argument that americas massive budget deficits simply make it impossible to do more for our elderly and poor yes our deficits are massive yes our deficits require us to make hard choices about our priorities however it is my conviction that many of the problems we face today are the result not of hard choices which the administration has made they are the result of wrong choiceschoices which have placed unfair tax cuts and excessive military spending above the real needs of the american people the administration blames the congress and our party for the tremendous budget defcits now plaguing the american economy but it is not our priorities which have caused the huge deficits these past 7 yearsdeficits which dwarf anything our republic has ever before experienced rather it the policies and priorities of this administration which are more than anything else responsible for the deficits we face whats really driving the deficit based on cbo figures from the early years of this administration the impact of tax cuts and excessive military spending more than equaled the huge deficits burdening america lets take a look at some of the numbers in every fiscal year between fiscal year 1981 and fiscal year 1987 the administration has demanded more increases in the military budget and more cutbacks in domestic programs during this period defense spending increased more than 40 percent while domestic discretionary spending decreased 21 percent moreover this 21 percent decrease represents the average reduction in domestic discretionary programs some programs such as subsidized housing and employment and training programs have been cut over 60 percent suppose for a moment that the administrations defense and revenue priorities since fiscal year 1981 had not been put into effect according to the house budget committee defense spending in fiscal year 1986 for example would have been 54 billion lower interest costs would have been 39 billion lower and revenues would have been 66 billion higher had these administration priorities not been put into effect thats a total of 159 billion that would not have been added to our deficits in fiscal year 1986 alone sadly however those administration priorities were put into effect and it is those priorities which are driving the deficit today contrary to what this administration would like to have the american people believe it has never once sent a balanced budget to congress no this administration has instead repeatedly sent the congress budgets with large deficits resulting from grossly misplaced priorities fortunately we democrats have succeeded in softening the blows inflicted upon the most vulnerable americans by these misplaced priorities unfortunately however we have so far not succeeded in changing the basic thrust of these priorities despite our efforts this administration has largely succeeded in shielding high income people and large corporations from contributing their fair share to the nations support it has succeeded in shielding the wasteful military from the kinds of massive cuts which have been inflicted upon critically needed domestic programs for americas vulnerable children elderly and poor what about the effects of this administrations priorities on specific programs that affect the everyday lives of americas elderly and poor what about the effects of these priorities on programs like medicare and medicaid which protect americas sick and frail when they need medical care what about the effects of these priorities on the social security housing health and human services programs which are supposed to make up the safety net protecting americas elderly americas disabled and americas poor from catastrophe and ruin most of these programs have been threatened often and cut repeatedly by the administration budget ax as a result americas most vulnerable people have suffered desperately over the past 7 years that suffering will continue to grow unless we act decisively and quickly lets begin with medicare which has suffered cumulative spending reductions of 34 billion since fiscal year 1981 in 1981 beneficiaries paid medicare part b premiums of 11 today they are paying 17 90 an increase of 63 percent in just 6 years the amount beneficiaries must pay for the first day of hospital care has risen from 204 to 520 over the same period thatsa whopping 150 percent increase incredibly the medicare reductions which have been put into effect over the past 7 years represent only a portion of the reductions which the administration has wanted and it has continued to press for large medicare reductions in its fiscal year 1988 budget the administration is asking for medicare part bpremium increases that would add 11 4 billion to beneficiary costs over the next 5 years meanwhile it doubles research on antisatellite weapons of questionable feasibility the medicaid program has also suffered heavily under this administration today medicaid protects fewer than half of americas poor given this administrations record of insensitivity to our nations most vulnerable citizens it is sad but not surprising that the administrations proposed medicaid cuts would total 1 3 billion in fiscal year 1988 and 19 5 billion over the next 5 years the administrations proposals would result in a fiscal year 1988 cut of over 50 per beneficiary the magnitude of the administrations proposed reductions goes far beyond what states could absorb socalled savings under these proposals would jeopardize the neediest among us and shatter our staterun programs the administration has also repudiated its longstanding promise not to cut into the social security program the quality of services provided to the poor elderly and disabled has been repeatedly threatened by administration proposals to reduce social security staff by more than 20 percent in each of the last 5 years most recently the administrations fiscal year 1988 budget requested 5 092 staff below congressional appropriation levels despite consistent rejection by congress of these staff reduction proposals the administration has continued to reduce social security staff below congressionally authorized levels through attrition and through its failure to hire any new staff perhaps the administrations most relentless assault on americas needy has been its attempt to eliminate all funding for any lowincome housing construction rehabilitation and senior citizen housing although congress has rejected many of these proposals federal assistance has been drastically reduced by more than 70 percent over the past 6 years the administrations budget proposals for fiscal year 1988 would all but end any federal housing assistance for lowincome americans and senior citizens despite the fact that nearly half the residents of hudassisted housing are among the poorest of our lowincome elderly this administration has also proposed the total elimination of the lowincome weatherization program and legal service assistance to the poor substantial reductions in funding were proposed for the lowincome energy assistance program the community service block grant program the job training partnership acts dislocated worker program and transportation assistance in the first 4 years of this administration spending on the aged was cut by a cumulative 26 5 billion grants funding locally provided health and social services received cuts ranging from 22 to 39 percent one initiative by this administration the blockgranting of social services virtually assures that older minority persons will not receive services which have been designed to serve their special needs programs are less likely to be culturally sensitive adequately trained personnel may not be available to administer supportive services and services are much less likely to be located in the most appropriate community settings lowincome senior citizens have been particularly hurt by reductions in food stamp eligibility and benefits although not generally identified as an elderly nutrition program one out of five households receiving food stamps have at least one elderly member making the food stamp program this nations largest elderly nutrition program despite administration talk of preserving a safety net lowincome elderly have been hurt most by this administrations misplaced priorities and have suffered a great loss as a result of this administrations misdirected policies the time has come to be brutally honest with ourselves and with the american people the administrations priorities have had devastating effects on americas most needy and most vulnerable citizens children the elderly the sick and the poor have all suffered horribly because of the misplaced priorities of this administration just a few months ago the adminstration described its budget proposal as a plan a hope a vision of what america is and where it is going but if you are poor homeless hungry or sick in america the administrations budget provides no plan no hope and no vision of what america is and where it should be going just look at america in the seventh year of this administration 12 6 percent of americas elderly still live in poverty including 31 5 percent of americas black elderly and 23 9 percent of americas hispanic elderlymore than half of indian elderly live below the poverty level 15 6 percent of americas elderly women live in poverty including almost 20 percent of women over the age of 85 in 1980 19 cents was spent on subsidized housing for each dollar spent for national defense by 1985 the administration proposed less than 1 1 2 cents be spent on housing for every dollar spent on the military two out of every five elderly americans consume too few calories proteins or basic vitamins and minerals to meet even minimal requirements for good health outofpocket health costs consume 16 percent of elderly income more than wher medicare and medicaid began even without further cuts outofpocket costs are projected to consume up to 18 5 percent of elderly income by 1991 thirtyseven americans are uninsured for any health costs 200 million americans are underinsured against the costs of catastrophic long term illness sadly what i have outlined here is just the tip of a large and threatening iceberg much more can and must be said about this administrations relentless assault against americas elderly and poor the words we have heard today paint a tragic portrait of americaan america in which pebple are suffering because of the misplaced priorities of an insensitive administration americas elderly and poor have been the target of this administrations assault for 7 long and tortuous years far too long for a compassionate nation contrary to what administrations speechwriters would like for us to believe its priorities are way out of sync with those of the american people time after time the american people have reaffirmed their compassionate commitment to protecting our most vulnerable citizens in keeping with that commitment time after time democrats in congress have fought back and tried to shield americas poor its homeless its elderly and its infirm democrats in congress have fought to strengthen programs weakened by the administration we fought to protect and expand the older americans act the house version of this very important bill contains provisions to help low income and minority elderly including native americans and others with the greatest social and economic needs for 7 straight years we have repeatedly fought to save medicare and medicaid from destruction this spring our house budget resolution once again protected both of these critical programs from major cutbacks and precluded any increases in outofpocket costs to beneficiaries just last week we acted to provide an extra measure of medicare protection against catastrophic illness however much remains to be done especially in the areas of longterm care and the medically indigent but the struggle continues and the challenge remains this administration as demonstrated by its veto threats and its budget proposals for fiscal year 1988 fully intends to continue its relentless assault this congress and these democrats fully intend to block that assault and strengthen the protective shield surrounding americas most vulnerable"], [0.0015774965286254883,

trappings of nobility and royalty he faithfully lived a life of courage charity and moral bearing he showed all people that wise thoughtful and strong leadership can bring about change through the use of nonviolence of all the materials ive ever read regarding martin luther king an article written by coleman mccarthy a nationally syndicated colunist seemed to best put his life into perspective the writer said nothing of kings greatness can be understood without first seeing the reasons for his absolute commitment to the belief that the aftermath of violence is bitterness the aftermath of nonviolence is reconciliation he further says had king not taught and practiced that his national holiday would become as hollow as the one for george washingtons birthdayan excuse for the department stores to hold a sale kings holiday the writer says is a call to conscience not commerce it is important then that we remember dr kingmemorialize him perpetuate him and pay tribute to his leadership of a movement which touched the social conscience of this nation and changed the course of history martin loved his nation he loved the people of this nation and the world he even died for the nation he loved this nation and its people so much that he inspired a vision and a dream for the nation his dream was a simple dream uncomplicated and unencumbered in essence he believed and demanded that america live up to its creedthat all men are created equal the course of american history has been a relentless push by peoples of all races creeds and colors for america to live up to that creed that is why dr kings birthday celebration is so important and why i stand here today with great frustration knowing that the mission of dr king is far from finished this country has yet to meet its true creed that all men are created equal the recognition of dr kings life and death should not merely be symbolic it should be a living example of how our daily lives should be conducted america can and will i hope someday realize the dream the dream will come true when every american can work commensurate with his ability and training when every child receives quality education regardless of his race or status in lifewhen every american can live in a decent home in a decent neighborhood america will not see the dream until black mothers no longer die in childbirth at a rate four times as great as white mothers we will see martins dream only when children can replace their tattered clothing with new garments and senior citizens are no longer required to choose between eating and heating we will fully appreciate the dream when 50 million people no longer go to bed hungry and undernourished his dream will come true when the slums are destroyed when americans attack injustice and prejudice with the same determination they attack communism and terrorism the administrations budget proposes cuts and elimination of basic support programs for the working poorsuch as educational loans the food stamp program legal services corporation and mass transit the 100th congress will grapple with the grammrudman budget deficit reduction act which will have a devastating impact on many programs designed for the nations poor and disadvantaged dr king isnt here with us today but if he were he would see the rise in defense spending support for the contras and yet would find many of the programs he so fervently and aggressively fought for wiped out at the stroke of a pen but if he were alive today he would be in the forefront lobbying congress in an effort to remove these programs from the presidents chopping block when dr king delivered his famous i have a dream speech in 1963 the unemployment rate for black workers was 10 8 percent today although the overall unemployment rate dropped in december to below 7 percent for black americans and teenagers it remains at a shamefully high rate for black males it was 14 8 percent and for black teenagers it was 40 percent in dr kings lifetime america needed a war on poverty in 1987 we still need one a congressional report indicates that the percentage of american children whose families have incomes below the poverty line has now increased to 22 2 percent the study further found that half of poor children live in femaleheaded oneparent families for children in black single femaleheaded families where the mother is under 30 and did not complete high school the poverty rate was 92 8 percent a recent report released by the unitedstates department of health and human services reconfirmed our worst fears about the disparity in the health status of black and white americans the report concluded that more than 60 000 excess deaths occur each year among blacks and minorities largely because they are easier prey for disease and violence dr king loved all people be they black white jew or gentile certainly the human rights problems that exist today in not only south africa but russia afghanistan and central america would be of great concern to dr king so similar are these situations to those that existed throughout much of this nation that dr king would attempt to prevail upon the leaders of those countries to bring about dignity and equality for all mankind dr king so fervently believed in the brotherhood of man he showed us the similarities between us and most importantly that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere each year then when we recognize this man it seems to me that we should come together to think reason and act just as he did dr kings legacy challenges each of us to use the power across america and around the worid to pursue equal justice due process of the law and true liberation for all people while we have made progress since the death of dr king the dream has yet to come true as long as inequality exists as long as injustice exists and until we truly become a land of brotherhood with equal justice for all the struggles which dr king had the goals that he set for us will continue the dream will come true when every american can proclaim in a loud clear voice that they are proud of this country and brotherhood is the hallmark of human relations lest not the dream be deferred we should use this day this hour and this year to reaffirm the ideas and the dream he had for america the struggle must continue there is a great challenge ahead for america and for people

nicaraguan people is nonlethal aid to the democratic contras any less likely to free up money for weapons purchase than nonlethal aid to the republican contras in the last 4 weeks has there been any change in the arias peace plan which opposes outside aid to rebel groups in central america the answer to all those questions is plainly no and therefore no is how i shall vote on the democratic

hearing we heard from dr james fletcher the administrator of nasa the general accounting office which had done a study of the issue of development of such a second source and officials of several

leadership that the gentleman has shown over the years in this issue yes as we all can see if we will allow our eyes and ears and our minds to see another year has come and gone and the cypriot problem persists with no solution to be had it was the early morning hours of july 20 1974 that turkish paratroopers began descending on the island republic on the pretext that they were undertaking a peace operation intended to protect the turkish cypriot minority in the wake of the political turmoil then enveloping the country this socalled peace operation however was codenamed attila and was effectively an unlawful invasion and occupation of an independent country in violation of every tenet of international law custom and behavior the fact is that attila was not a peace operation at all it was an operation undertaken in order to achieve the partitionist plans of the turkish and turkishcypriot people it was indeed successful in meeting that goal for attila and attila ii on august 14 1974 effectively took over almost 40 percent of the territory of the republic while killing thousands of greek cypriots raping others uprooting 200 000 of them from their homes and looting and stealing from the homes and churches that they were forced to leave behind to make matters worse not only were these atrocities carried out but they were carried out with the use of supplies and equipment provided turkey by the united statesin violation of the unitedstates foreign assistance act of 1962 which authorizes the use of american aid solely for defensive purposes thirteen years have passed since that time and the years have seen several initiatives undertaken toward a solution a solution however has not been attained the reason is not that one is unattainable rather the sad reason for the stalemate is that turkey and the turkish cypriots have not negotiated toward a solution in good faith and have in fact taken a series of steps intended to achieve the permanent partion of the republic of cyprus turkey and the turkishcypriot leadership in direct violation of relevant u n resolutions have indeed taken a series of actions subsequent to the 1974 invastion which are aimed at consolidating the occupation and division of the small mediterranean republic facts speak louder than words so i will cite the evidence first and foremost turkey refused and to date still refuses to comply with international requests and pertinent u n resolutions to remove its occupation troops from the republic of cyprus to add insult to injury not only do they refuse to withdraw their troops but turkey has recently begun a military buildup on cyprus in both manpower and equipment to where today there are an estimated 34 000 to 35 000 turkish troops on cyprus with the number of tanks having more than doubled for a total of over 300 furthermore in an effort to further consolidate their illegal presence on the island turkey has moved in more than 60 000 mainland settlers who are threatening to turn the turkish cypriots themselves into a minority while occupying the homes and properties that the greekcypriots were forced to leave behind when they were turned into refugees in their own land in addition turkey and the turkish cypriot leadership is subjecting the greek cypriots to further indignity by systematically and intentionally destroying the christian and hellenic cultural heritage in the turkish occupied part of the island yes the greek cypriots have since the landing of the mainland troops and to this day been subjected to the pillaging theft and destruction of the artifacts and works of art that tell the story of their identity they have seen their ancient churches used as stables and warehouses they have seen their icons and other works of religious art stolen and they have seen their hellenic antiquities sold to private collectors throughout the world in order no doubt to systematically remove any trace of the cultural heritage which represents the national identity of the occupied areas as if these facts were not enough the partitionist aims of the turkish and turkishcypriot leadership were made crystal clear to the world when as recently as november 15 1983 they undertook an attempt to create a new turkish political entity in occupied cyprus yes they declared the northern occupied part of cyprus to be an independent country and called this pseudostate the turkish republic of northern cyprus fortunately law and logic prevailed and the international community almost unanimously withheld their recognition of the pseudostate and criticized the action i say almost unanimously withheld for the one exception and i underline one exception was turkey for turkey was the only country in the world community to grant its recognition to this illegal entity how i ask can turkey possibly pretend that they want and work toward the return of peace and unity to the republic of cyprus when they are a party to such destructive actions to the process how can they pretend to want to work with the u n secretarygeneral to find a workable solution to the situation when they ignore his expressions of concern as well as those of the united states over the military buildup on cyprus that turkey is engaging in by replying as turkish foreign minister halefoglu did on june 6 1987 that the evidence is ridiculous and untrue and that turkey does not have to answer to anyone on the number of troops and military equipment it has on cyprus i declare that turkey does have to answer for its actions and further i maintain that they should answer to the people of the united states it is the united states after all as i said earlier that supplies and equips turkey with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of foreign aid each year and it is the united states that they are giving a slap in the face to when they knowingly and intentionally fail to comply with the restrictions we place on that assistance the unitedstates congress is on record with its sound conviction that there can be no resolution of the cyprus conflict unless and until the turkish troops are removed from the island rather than comply however turkey laughs in our faces and increases its military presence there and does so with no less than united states origin equipment even while both the house foreign affairs committee and the senate foreign relations committee report out legislation prohibiting the continued use of united states origin military equipment by the 35 000 illegal turkish occupation forces on cyprus congress position on the cyprus issue is clear both the house foreign affairs committee and the senate foreign relations committee have reported out legislation that would prohibit the continued use of united states origin military equipment by the 35 000 illegal turkish occupation forces on cyprus in the senate the foreign aid authorization bill contains the pell amendment prohibiting the transshipment of united statessupplied military equipment from turkey to cyprus in the house the foreign aid bill contains language broomfieldyatronsnowe amendment prohibiting the transshipment of united statessupplied arms from either turkey or greece to cyprus both bills also maintain the traditional 7 10 funding ratio between greece and turkey this legislation is anything but a radical approach to this critical problem instead it merely clarifies the intent of congress as expressed in the foreign assistance act i strongly support this legislation because i believe it would be repugnant to the rule of law that we talked about here earlier when the gentleman from california had his special order which is recognized in our constitution for the united states to support in a direct or indirect way this illegal occupation and division of cyprus i take this opportunity to ask my colleagues to likewise support this necessary legislation to make matters worse turkey has the unmitigated gall to inform the state department that it is reconsidering implementing the alreadyagreed to extension of our base rights agreement because of all things congress attitude on the cyprus issue heaven help us i think that the united states and we as legislators have been more than patient and have tolerated an intolerable situation more than long enough i believe that it is now time to implement action in order to force turkey to cease the actions that are preventing an appropriate resolution to the cypriot problem despite our security interests in a strong security interest in a strong relationship with turkey and god knows they are there and those of us who care about america are concerned with the fact that turkey is in a very strategic position as is the country of greece and as is the independent republic of cyprus we must no longer tolerate such intransigence by the leadership in ankara without strong united opposition by the united states to turkish efforts to ensure the permanent partition of cyprus we cannot expect peace to be achieved in that country in the near future cyprus has always been a good friend to the united states and we should do whatever we can to help bring about a just solution cyprus is after all not only strategically important to the peace of the region but it has proven itself time and again to be a good friend and ally of the united states it was for example cyprus not turkey that allowed the united states the use of its facilities to carry supplies to our dying marines in lebanonturkey refused it has furthermore offered us its unrestrictive assistance after the bombing of the marine barracks in beirut in 1983 the bombing of our embassy in beirut in 1984 and during the highjacking of twa flight 847 in 1985 and while we are at it it was the greeks who fought and died heroically in world war ii while turkey chose neutrality and though it is little known it was 38 greeks who joined 6 unitedstates marines to win a military victory in 1805 on the shores of tripoli the same victory i might add that is immortalized in the marine hymn from the halls of montezuma to the shores of tripoli and i ask what has turkey contributed to the security of the west that is an open question turkey for example during the 1973 middle east war granted moscow overflight rights and overland passage rights to resupply syria and egypt while refusing united states overflights rights to resupply israel and among other questionable acts allowed soviet aircraft carriers passage through the dardanelles in violation of the montreux convention of 1936 and over nato objections we as legislators and we as americans must therefore do all in our power to bring about a just and lasting solution to the cypriot issue we must condition aid to turkey on her genuine efforts to reach just such a solution and we must push to see that this solution meets certain minimum conditions of acceptability including first the immediate withdrawal of all turkish occupation forces and colonists from cyprus second the immediate return of all occupied areas to the republic of cyprus under u n auspices for the immediate resettlement of the 200 000 greek cypriot refugees third an agreement by turkey and the turkishcypriots to a constitutional arrangement based on the universally accepted democratic principle of majority rule with full minority rights guaranteed as well as freedom of movement settlement and ownership anywhere in cyprus after all should there be a green line there i think not fourth an agreement by turkey to full cooperation with the international red cross regarding investigation of the five abducted americans and the 1 614 missing greek cypriots i might add that this factor in the cypriot issue has unfortunately not received as much international attention and concern as it might have and rightfully deserves the fact is that much like the americans missing in vietnam 1 619 individuals including 5 americans have been missing since the turkish invasion of cyprus clearly any fair and appropriate resolution of the issue must fully and adequately address the fate of these unfortunate victims and their families and so in closing i say on behalf of all three nations over there on behalf of american security and american interests in that entire area let us all work in earnest to return peace and unity to the republic of cyprus the cards are after all largely in our hands let us deal a fair and appropriate hand"], [0.9875603318214417, 0.9875603318214417, 0, "this is the third time in 8 weeks that congress
