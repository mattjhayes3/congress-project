happened with this october surprise investigation when the democrat majority first pressed for a task force to investigate these charges i said the majority is offering an unacceptable resolution for an unnecessary investigation into unbelievable allegations based on unsubstantiated claims made by unsavory characters now after an 8month investigatlon at a cost to the taxpayers of 4 5 rrlion the october surprise task force conclusively refuted all alegations nde by the proponerls of 1he october surprise conspiracy theory i hate to tell you i told you so but i told you so i belileve now and i have always beleved that thi investigation was not necessary we were told by th majority tvhi there were trowbing llegations those allgatons were not troubling there were preposterous both newsweek and the new republic concluded as much in detailed investigative reports before the democrats even started this committee there is a curious aliceinwondarend logic about all of this first there were a number of october surprise conspiracy theories reported in the media these theories fed off each other repealing the same myths and fentasles in different ways taking unproven assertions and claiming they were undeniable facts quoting dubious sources playing up anything that could damage the reagan campaign team playing down anything that would damage their own case al the sordid ancient ticks of the conspiracy trade but simply by being reported and commented upon in the politcay correct media outlets ihat is the new york tames public television et cetera the conspiracy theories were said by democrats to raihe questions that needed to be answered once that claim was made it was inevitable that a congress dominated by democrats would be asked to provide the answers particularly since it was the antirepublican conspiracy theorists themselves who primarily did the asdng so the house had a costy investigaton based on nothing more than the claim that questions had been raised but questions are raised all the time in the media theories about secret powerful cabals of sinister puppet masters abound why was this particular theory dragged out for so long in the press paid such respectful attention and finally made the subject of two congressional investigations the fact that the questions were raised by disgruntled democratic party partisans shady characters and worldclass international liars was rarely mentioned by democrats when democrats were accused by republicans of partisanship in asking for an investigation based on unproven allegations they held up their hands in pious horror and exclaimed but questions have been raised we must investigate as if they rush to answer all conspiracy theory questions as matter of principle shorn of its sensationalism here is what happened reaganhating political activists and scoundrels concocted a libelous story claiming that ronald reagan or his aides or both deliberately used the hostages for their own political purposes the media reported the story and gave the theorists forums from which to spread the ibel because the story had been reported democrats said there are questions that must be answered and a congressional investigatory committee was formed and funded the theories were as i have said groundless is this going to be the investigative model for our future in the house will the democratic leadership always call for an investigation of conspiracy theories no manner what the source so long as questions are raised will we see democrats rushing to the floor or secretly enlisting the gao to investigate conspiracy theories about president clinton if and when such theories appear if some disgruntled republican who served in the bush administration manages to get a large part of the oped page given to him of the new york times as mr sick dkto offer a wacko conspiracy theory about the president clinton will democrats say questions have been ralsedl and call for an investigation i watch and wait with patient expectation it is also interesting to note the timing of the release of the report i can guarantee you one thing if there had been one bit of evidence that the reaganbush campaign was indeed involved the information would have been on every front page across the nation before the election instead the report concluded that there was no credible evidence of a conspiracy and it was released following the election i commend mr hamilton the very distinguished member from indiana who did a fine job in leading this investigation but lee hamilton should not be forced to waste his valuable time tracking down erroneous outrageous ridiculous allegations he should spend his time on the substantive things he does best things like heading a task force on congressional reform in fact investigations like this should be an item for the joint committee on the organization of the congress we should have better procedures in the house so that we can make certain that we dont form committees to investigate every wild conspiracy theory that hits the halls of congress we should also have a requirement that the minority is always kept informed of gao investigations initiated by the majority we should also prohibit staff from writing to federal judges urging them to release convicted felons from prisons because they proved helpful with secret investigations i appreciate the role that henry hyde both as the republican leader of this task force and as a force for reason during the entire debate i would like to thank him for reminding us all through this special order that the october surprise task force was formed not because the majority wanted to answer troubling questions from credible sources but because there are some who want to cast a shadow on one of the greatest presidents in our history i think the formation of this task force not the work product of the members of that task force symbolizes much to what is wrong with this house after

years ago today he signed into law the nations first income taxdesigned as a temporary emergency measure to finance the civil war today president clinton is raising taxes to finance his version of a class war of course the administration is not without admirers one master of illusion the great houdini must be smiling down on this chamber today when we blow away the smoke and shatter the mirrors what we get from president clintons taxandspend road show is nowhere near what he claims not the 496 billion in deficit reduction not if we use the cbo numbers because cbo based on their estimates would score it at best at 428 billion in deficit reduction even that figure is generous because of the presidents illusory claims of slower spending growth 4 or 5 years from now and then that figure is generous because of the presidents illusory claims of lower spending in the fourth and fifth years this is the president who said we have all got to use congressional budget office estimates they are the real estimates and we have got to reject accounting gimmicks then he ignored cbos baselines and had his bookkeepers invent their own and counted savings from the 1990 budget agreement twice in order to puff up his deficit reduction numbers and i do not know if that is smoke and mirrors or what but if an accountant on main street did it he probably would go to jail that fact is this package includes about 120 billion in promises of net spending reductions almost all in the third fourth and fifth year 255 billion dollars worth of real net new taxes and user fees and about 53 billion in questionable debt service claims that is what you get when you lay this package against cbos estimates instead of the ones the administration cooked up there will be no net spending cuts in the first year zero and virtually none in the second year this package includes deficit increasing items totaling 62 billion over 5 years this new spending probably seems odd to the american people in a socalled deficit reduction package it is one of the reasons why they are nervous about this bill the largest tax increase in our nations history yes the largest by cbo estimates new taxes in this bill are 275 billion the democrats dispute this and they talk about the 1982 tax act but the cbo scored the 1982 tax act as raising 3214 billion in new taxes instinctively americans know these new tax increases are jobkilling poison for the economy they do not believe for one minute that the democrats tax increases are going to create jobs nor do most of the economists in this country the president claims the vast majority of these taxes will hurt only the rich and that is baloney he must not have read his own bill the socalled rich who are targets for massive retroactive tax increases are the small business men and women who create the vast majority of new jobs heaping higher taxes on those jobs creators translates into fewer jobs for working people perhaps we should remember the socalled luxury tax from the 1990 budget deal it is repealed in this bill because that misguided class warfare scheme backfired and killed the boatbuilding industry try to sock the rich and you drown working men and women simplistic attempts to minimize the impact of the energy tax on american families will not hold water either when the democrats tax transportation they are not just taxing people who pull up to the gas pump they are taxing everything that has to be transported senior citizens are among the hardest hit in this package thanks in particular to increased taxes on their benefits it must make them feel real special to learn that president clintons definition of rich people includes seniors with incomes of just 34 000 and that includes half of their social security benefits now that sounds pretty callous especially since seniors on fixed incomes are the one group of americans for whom lower interest rates serve as a financial curse rather than a blessing yes president clinton would like the american people to believe his own taxes only hurt rich people but with over 40 tax increases and 16 user fees in this package no one should seriously buy that story here is what the taxpayers do understand when he was courting their vote clinton promised the middle class a tax cut now he is raising their taxes he promised to create jobs now he is promising tax increases on employers that will kill jobs he promised 500 billion in deficit reduction he is at least 73 billion short of that at best all of the rate increases in the bill including estate taxes are

for the past several weeks and months stood in this well to support an initiative that president clinton is wholeheartedly behind that is the north american freetrade agreement i happen to believe very strongly that it is going to be one of the greatest jobcreating mechanisms that we can possibly put into place following along the lines of what was just offered by the gentleman from pennsylvania i would like to say that i stand here once again with a very bipartisan spirit that bipartisan spirit is a desire to try to implement a jobcreating mechanism in this economy over and above the north american freetrade agreement now i liketo pride myself on first being an american and second a republican and i was not a supporter of president clintons when he was a candidate last fall but i was frankly very impressed with more than a few things he said in his campaign and i would like to spend this evening talking about one of those items which he referred to in his campaign i want to talk about the fact that we unfortunately are not utilizing that campaign promise in this reconciliation package which we are going to be considering later on this week i happen to believe that president clintons statement last year that a capital gains differential was very important to job creating and economic growth was a correct one it is one which i have subscribed to all along and based on every bit of evidence that we have seen it is clearly going to play a key role in creating job opportunities in this country now as has been said earlier the president is going to be going on television this evening and he is going to be bringing forth urging the american people to contact those of us members of the congress to support his plan i will say here that while i am a strong supporter of many of president clintons initiatives i will do everything that i possibly can to defeat his plan that he is going to be talking about later this evening because even though he talks about an economic growth component and stimulating small business this plan does anything but that based on the evidence that we have seen in the past now i happen to believe and i made this statement earlier that we in the minority clearly have to offer a very positive economic growth component and in fact shortly after we defeated or after i voted against the initial budget package that the president had and many in the media were saying that republicans were simply trying to block president clintons initiatives they were not offering any positive alternative i introduced h r 1885 a basic 4point plan designed to create jobs stimulate economic growth and bring down the deficit the 4 points include first and i am going to be talking about it in just a couple of minutes a capital gains differential taking the 28 percent capital gains tax rate reducing that to 15 percent second imposing a moratorium on the promulgation of new regulations on the business sector of the economy we know full well that many of the problems that are created in this country come about in large part due to the burden of federal regulations that are imposed on the private sector and under the bush administration we opposed a 90day moratorium on new regulations for the business sector of the economy and there were no catastrophes as a byproduct of that so the second part of the proposal that i have in h r 1885 extends that moratorium on new regulations for the business sector of the economy the third thing that it does very importantly as we look at the deficit and the national debt it imposes what is called the 2 percent solution which is close to a freeze on federal spending and we all know that trying to bring about a freeze in the area of federal spending could go a long way toward turning the corner on that debt and the fourth point is as i said earlier establishment or expanding of individual retirement accounts in the 1981 tax bill which was the only tax bill that i voted for it was known as the economic recovery tax act and we established individual retirement accounts those individual retirement accounts were designed to encourage people to plan and save for retirement put dollars aside so that they would not have to be totally relying on the social security system or other government programs for their survival so what i have in h r 1885 is an expansion of individual retirement accounts allowing for a spousal contribution to that individual retirement account and withdrawals from that individual retirement account for three basic uses first a new home purchase which obviously is very important as we know that the housing industry has historically played a key role in pulling us out of recession second the purchase of very needed health care we are looking at health care reform and it seems to me that being able to withdraw form an individual retirement account would be very beneficial as we look at health care reform and the third thing is education we know that many people are decrying the very sorry state of the educational system in this country and one of the things that i call for in h r 1885 is a withdrawal for education purposes for postsecondary education so it seems to me that this 4point economic package would go a long way toward dealing with the challenges that we have and it is contrary to what many in the media and some on the other side of the aisle have said a positive alternative to the one that has been brought forward and the one which most on our side of the aisle strongly oppose now i want to take a few minutes to talk specifically about the issue of capital gains and the effect that a capital gains tax cut has had in the past and will continue to have first of all if we look at the overall tax rates since 1946 tax rates marginal tax rates have fluctuated from 91 percent at a high to 28 percent and revenues have basically as a percentage of the gross national product remained constant at 19 5 percent we have clearly demonstrated that the only way to increase revenues to the federal treasury is to expand the economy now my friend the gentleman from pennsylvania fias talked about the fact that this gasoline tax increase and other taxes that are in this proposal which the president is going to be talking about in a couple of hours is one which will lead the economy to constrict now how we can possibly expect to deal with the national debt and the federal deficit if we have not an expanding economy but a shrinking economy is really beyond me because most every small businessman and woman and many many others even in big business not withstanding those who went down to the white house the other day to support the plan have indicated to me and to others of our colleagues that we must have growth components there and according to the date that we have gathered from the joint economic committee and from the internal revenue service one of the very best ways for us to gain tax revenues to the federal treasury so that we can turn the corner on the 4 5 trillion national debt and the hundreds of billions of dollars in deficits that we run up each year would be to put into place a meaningful capital gains tax stimulus now in 1978 the top capital gains tax rate was lowered from 50 percent to 28 percent as a result of that tax rate reduction in 1978 we saw at that point an increase in revenues to the treasury from 51 billion to 32 billion in 1986 i would like to ask you to focus your attention if you could on this chart here which basically deals with the level of revenues that have been gained from a capital gains tax reduction versus the level of revenues when we have seen an increase in the capital gains tax cuts now i referred a few minutes ago to the capital gains tax cut which was known as the steiger amendment which in 1978 saw a reduction in the capital gains rate from 50 percent down to a 28percent rate that capital gains tax reduction which started then actually did create an increase in revenues to the treasury i refer to the 1981 economic recovery tax act known as the reagan tax cut we saw the rate reduction take place and we saw a further increase in revenues to the federal treasury this has taken place for a wide range of reasons primarily the fact that we have eliminated the socalled lockin effect whereby people who have a tremendous appreciation hold on to it because the rate of taxation is so high when we have a rate reduction they sell off those items which have a capital gains appreciation and therefore those dollars are going back into the economy the tax revenues come into the treasury and the dollars that the individual investors have been able to accrue are reinvested well in the 1986 tax reduction act known as the tra which i happened to oppose there was a 40percent increase in the capital gains tax rate that 40percent increase in the capital gains tax rate created a tremendous disincentive for those who had capital appreciation what happened was we saw a tremendous drop in revenues to the treasury because of that socalled lockin effect which went into play and at that point we lost a tremendous amount of revenue tragically now there are many that say that the loss in revenue to the treasury which has come since 1986 has been because of the economic slowdown which has taken place but you cansee on this chart here that there is a tremendous dropoff which takes place in 1987 when we were still seeing economic growth take place long before the economic recession began this played a role in creating the economic recession that increase in the capital gains tax rate of 40 percent which was incorporated in the 1986 tax reform act actually decreased revenues to the treasury and laid the groundwork for the economic recession which has been so devastating so it seems to me as we look at tax rates especially in the area of capital gains the best thing that we can possibly do is reduce them to stimulate the economy now the joint commission on taxation has come to the conclusion that any capital gains tax rate which is beyond 28 5 percent actually decreases the flow of revenue to the federal treasury as we look at that and this is evidence which has come from a wide range of economists and not just information from economists but empirical evidence which we have gleaned from the activities of investors here in the united states what we found is that we are going to decrease revenue to the treasury if there is any kind of increase in the capital gains tax rates and what we need to do to increase revenue to the treasury is actually see a meaningful cut in the capital gains tax rate this is a bipartisan issue as i said president clinton talked about it in his campaign last fall i wish he had taken that capital gains rate reduction plan that he talked about as a candidate and put it into place as part of his budget package unfortunately he did not and it is not the only promise that he has turned his back on and many of us have recognized that on both sides of the aisle when i say the capital gains tax reduction is not simply a partisan issue it is not just the fact that president clinton talked about it as a candidate we saw here in the house a vote on the capital gains issue two years ago and that vote saw 43 democrats join with us to pass the package tragically the capital gains tax reduction designed to stimulate economic growth died in the senate because of the filibuster that was brought about by the senate majority leader"],

should remember george bernard shaws famous quip about second marriages the triumph of hope over experience while i heartily applaud the presidents emphasis on deficit reduction like the famous irish writer i urge my colleagues to focus on experience the problem is the underlying principles of the clinton plan that tax increases will reduce the deficit flies in the face of precedent recent history shows higher taxes lead to more federal spending lower economic growth fewer jobs and ultimately larger deficits we saw budget agreements and this chart reflects those budget agreements that resulted in massive tax increases in 1983 1985 1988 and 1990 in each case you can see from the charts more spending and larger deficits resulted from those tax increases chairman obeys own chart showed us that it was only in the years when congress was forced to restrain spending under the grammrudman act did we see any slowdown in this pace of runaway federal spending and that is reflected in chairman obeys own chart that he has presented us under grammrudman total domestic spending grew at an annual rate of 1 1 percent under the 1990 budget agreement with its supposedly stricter than grammrudman spending controls total domestic spending grew at an annual rate of 8 4 percent the proof is in the pudding as you can see from this chart here the grammrudman record clearly shows that seriously restraining congress ability to spend is the only real way to achieve progress on the deficit in addition i think it is important to point out actual tax revenues since the 1990 budget deal have fallen by more than 3 25 for every dollar the deal is supposed to raise and the deficit increased from 3 1 percent of gnp in 1990 to 5 percent in 1992 every economic study you look at shows that every dollar in new taxes raised since 1947 has led to 1 59 in new government spending a recent study by citizens agonst government waste showed that the 1990 budget agreement produced 2 37 in new spending for every dollar raised in new taxes that is hardly a formula for real deficit reduction experience shows that excessive government spending not a lack of tax revenues causes massive deficits revenues to the federal government have remained steady at an average of 18 6 percent of gross domestic product between 1965 and 1992 never falling below 17 5 percent at the same time government spending has risen from 17 6 percent of gnp to 23 5 percent in 1992 even more telling tax revenues have grown annually at an 8 percent rate over the past decade but spending has increased at an annual rate of 11 percent during the same time the clinton plan is more of the same with deficits the administration projected to average 250 billion a year and their analysis does not even reflect the blow to the economy of taking 328 billion out of the private sector out of the revenue stream in new taxes 328 billion these new taxes will stifle economic growth destroy jobs reduce revenues and increase the deficit economists across the ideological spectrum are convinced that the clinton tax increases will lead to widespread job loss let us look at a few of their comments david resler of nomura securities puts the cost at 400 000 lost jobs by the end of 1994 from these new tax increases drimcgraw hill says 700 000 jobs will be lost in 1997 and 1998 larry kudlow the chief economist at bear stearns estimates job losses at 3 2 million by 1996 and a reduction in real economic output of 450 billion we are going to have unfortunately i think the votes are there for the huge tax increases and we are going to see the prophecies of these economists realized constricting the economy with higher taxes not only means additional job losses less revenues from taxes higher expenditures for unemployment claims but ultimately larger deficits we all remember the infamous boat tax hike in the 1990 budget agreement that illconceived and shortsighted proposal not only failed to reduce the deficit despite the claims from many that it would do just that but it actually lost revenue the boat tax actually lost revenue because it threw thousands of workers out of their jobs as we now know the government lost the income tax revenues from these workers and increased spending on their unemployment claims the experiences of economies across the globe show that higher taxes and more government lead to longterm economic sluggishness we simply cannot grow the government without seriously stifling the private sector at the same time that the government gets bigger these tax increases stifle the productive private sector and destroy jobs we will not balance the budget or even make a dent in the deficit unless we allow the private sector to operate as the engine of economic growth i hope we can learn something from these economic lessons learned throughout our history economic lessons learned in couptries from mexico to poland but unfortunately lost on many of the politicians in this body when will they learn that free markets less government spending and low taxes are the only solid foundation for real economic growth 1 i urge my colleagues to support real

increases are retroactive but the spending cuts dont start for 2 years we were promised 2 in spending cuts for every 1 in new tlaxe but this tax bill is 4 in new taxes for every 1 in spending cuts and it increases the national debt by over 1 trillion one of the reasons for this is the devastating energy tax in the presidents plan which will cost the unitedstates economy over 600 000 jobs in my home state of michigan a family of four would pay about 800 a year in energy taxes for home heating fuel and other goods and services they purchase further the energy taxes are indexed for inflation which means theyll keep going up and up and up farm families are going to be especially hard hit by the energy tax the energy taxes are indexed for inflation which means theyll keep going up and up and up but its not just the tax its how complicated it will be when many farmers will be having to deal with five different tax levels on fuels they use between fuel dying and different tanks the costs and complexity will be incredible on average there would be 1 600 in energyrelated costs to an individual farmer producing about 400 acres of corn in the midwest why are we going to do this to american farm families why are we going to do this to american agriculture which is our leading unitedstates export the energy tax is a tax on everyone and not everyone can afford it in november the people spoke theywant us to cut spending but the administration has proposed adding another trillion dollars to the national debt the president pledged he would cut federal spending and cut taxes for middleincome tax payers now were voting on his increased spending and tax increases which are the largest in american history the facts speak for themselves on the presidents tax plan and america cant afford it"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.9928403943777084, 0.007159605622291565, 1, "i rise in opposition to the conference report i have two main concerns one a longstanding opposition to the unnecessary level of secrecy in which the intelligence budget is cloaked and two the abrupt change in direction that the intelligence conferees have taken in their report regarding two important intelligence programs first i will state to my colleagues once again my belief that the foreign policy activities of this nation taken by our government on behalf of its citizens should and is for the most part done in the open i believe it is wrong however that an arm of our government is given the authority to conduct operations other than intelligence gathering in support of foreign policy goals that are unknown to our citizens the people of the united states have a right to be engaged in the debate which yields our foreign policy activities i do not here refer to the important maintenance of operational secrecy but rather to the need to debate in the open whether and when we would engage in hostile operations against another country in this context my concern lies not specifically the overall budget level for intelligence although i believe that prudent savings in the intelligence budget can be realized with careful planning and a recognition of the many new and open ways in which information flows to policymakers additionally it is the right of the people of our country to know the funding level of its intelligence agencies i will continue to support legislative efforts that would bring these aspects into the sunshine my second objection to the report is concemed more with what has become ablurred relationship between the national foreign intelligence or nfip programs and tactical intelligence and related activities or tiara programs i think it is time we substantially change this arrangement i am disappointed and concerned that the conferees have increased the authorization for nfip above the budget request while authorizing a corresponding decrease in tiara programs this action is contrary to actions taken by the conferees on the fiscal year 1995 defense authorization and appropriations acts and contrary to agreements reached between the secretary of defense and the director of central intelligence resulting from their joint review of nfip and tiara programs we should be focusing on the interoperability of capabilities in support of military operations ensuring essential improvements for imagery support as well as developing a new unitedstates intelligence program and budget structure to better reflect user needs and priorities consistent with our changed strategic environment the blurring of national versus tactical intelligence was highlighted last year when the committee raised concern in its report on the fiscal year 1994 defense authorization bill the committee then observed that over the years the boundaries between tiara and nfip components of the intelligence budgets have become a source of confusion and contention the committee was and continues to be concerned that the lack of clearly established definitions for nfip and tiara have led to the sometimes arbitrary assignment of intelligence programs and functions within these categories as a consequence the armed services committee called on the secretary of defense and the director of central intelligence to review intelligence programs and activities and provide to congress a report identifying those programs which support first primarily national purposes second primarily defensewide theater activities and the unified command or three primarily a single service or agency the report was also to have identified those programs and activities that should no longer be included in the intelligence budget although we have seen fragments and or bits and pieces of what appears to be a concerted effort to address this matter a formal comprehensive report has yet to be provided an important review was undertaken by the department earlier this year to determine what if any programs or activities should be removed from tiara this effort was undertaken in response to the fiscal year 1994 house armed services committee language asking the department to identify programs and activities that should no longer be included in the intelligence budget as a result the department determined that indeed there were certain programs that fell outside the definition of tiara used by the congress and has subsequently proposed to delete these activities from the fiscal year 1996 tiara congressional justification book these programs include for example ballistic missile defense the defense meteorological support program tanker support to reconnaissance and the navys mapping charting and geodesy to name a few when added up funding for these programs totaled more than a half a billion dollars in each of fiscal year 1994 and further earlier this year nowdeputy secretary of defense john deutch notified officials within the department of defense and congress that effective june 1 1994 he was establishing the joint military intelligence program or jmip to focus on joint defensewide initiatives activities and programs that predominantly provide intelligence information and support to multiple defense customers the goal of the jmip is to bridge existing programmatic divisions across national and service or departmental intelligence lines to provide more effective and coherent intelligence programmatic decisionmaking and ultimately to provide support to military intelligence consumers policymakers force modernization planners and warfighters i concur with the administration in their intent to submit a joint military intelligence program budget re quest for fiscal year 1996 this january i intend to make the analysis of these and other intelligencerelated issues a priority issue for the armed services committee

demonstration act of 1993 this demonstration initiative would authorize hud to provide section 8 assistance to housing projects where a pension fund would enter into a partnership with a nonprofit municipality or other entities to provide investment funds for the construction acquisition or rehabilitation of housing for lowand moderateincome families this measure had been a part of an earlier suspension bill passed by the house addressing several housing initiatives however the provision was withdrawn at the time because of several questions which arose about the proposal the most important of these questions involved the overall role of pension funds in performing social purposes and the safety of these types of investments for the funds because these issues were pension related and not directly germane to the housing subcommittee or the underlying request for authorization i felt a hearing by the labormanagement subcommittee may have been appropriate so that these questions could be discussed as the ranking member of the labormanagement subcommittee the most important concern with this program was the efficacy of these types of investments by pension funds and the need to ensure through statutory language that nothing in this demonstration violated the rules and regulations of the erisa laws which govern pension funds short of a hearing i asked the majority and minority staff to analyze the legislation and provide me any of their concerns for the safety and soundness of pension funds and whether or not erisa laws could be circumvented by this legislation the labormanagement staff and members agreed that the program was conceptually sound because pension funds are already investing in housing projects in the private sector but they recommended adding additional statutory language which would make it clear that erisa laws could not be violated or circumvented in carrying out this program they also recommended and i concur that pension fund investments in this demonstration be limited to the purchase of securities supporting the project or that fund investments be securitized that clarifying language was added to the bill before the house as introduced by chairman gonzalez and myself our housing committees principal concern in this matter is whether the use of pension funds to help meet the affordable housing needs of our citizens is practical and whether we should authorize hud to consider participating in such a program our other critical concern is that we not authorize any program which could jeopardize the future of a pension fund or its participants i believe the use of pension funds for housing investment may be a legitimate use of private funds leveraged by federal housing assistance this legislation is also constructed in such a way that i believe will not jeopardize the future of any pension fund based on this i advised chairman gonzalez that since my principal concerns about the safety of the pension funds and the role of erisa laws had been satisfactorily answered i had no problem with this legislation now with respect to any issues beyond the safety of the pension funds i do not believe these are significant or necessarily relevant to the housing subcommittees decision to authorize this demonstration this initiative is a demonstration program designed to test the feasibility of using limited federal rental assistance to leverage millions of dollars in private sector funds for housing this legislation does not mandate that any pension fund managers participate in this demonstration
