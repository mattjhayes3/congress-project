offers this nation the promise of strong economic recovery rather than the continued pain of unemployment high interest rates and runaway deficts this alternative is necessitated by the fact that this current administration continues to make excuses for its bankrupt economic policies which are bankrupting our nation we are told to just wait intil our economic recovery program takes effect we have been waiting now for 8 months with these results interest rates are the highest in history 16 million americans are either out of work working parttime or so discouraged that they no longer even look for work the housing industry is in the worst condition since world war ii business failures and farm foreclosures are running at the highest levels since the great depression this litany could go on and on but suffice it to say that if the congress had enacted last year the congressional black caucus economic recovery plan instead of president reagans we would not be suffering the economic contractions that are now wreaking havoc with our nation there is no joy however in pointing out that the congressional black caucus last year predicted the misery and human suffering that would occur as a result of the adoption of the reagan economic program the reagan record hs all too clearly shown that the congressional black caucus was right the congressional black caucus is right again this year we have once again met the presidents challenge to put up or shut up we put up once again a fair and sound budget proposal which will rescue our nation from devastating and debilitating deficits unemployment and economic stagnation the fauntroy alternative controls federal spending not by pushing millions more americans into poverty not by a continued assault on the nations young disadvantaged and poor but by an assault on wasteful military spending extravagant tax breaks to wealthy citizens and irresponsible tax subsidies for profitable corporations the fauntroy substitute rejects the reagan economic shell game which redistributes income from the poor and middle class to the rich more than any other alternative the cbc alternative embodies creative and comprehensive tax reformstopping the raid on the federal treasury through tax breaks for those who least need them rather the cbc alternative restructures the presidents tax cut to principally benefit those earning less than 50 000 per year moreover our alternative provides real tax relief to the poor and middle class by increasing the standard deduction and earned income tax credit the fauntroy substitute proves that fiscal responsibility can be achieved while maintaining compassion and concern for the american people by implementing tax reform and by reducing military expenditures the cbc budget would reduce the projected fiscal year 1983 deficit to 97 billion by 1985 a surplus of 4 2 billion would result let me emphasize once again that fiscal responsibility need not come at the expense of the poor and disadvantaged in our society the republican party platform for 1980 said the measure of a countrys compassion is how it treats the least fortunate yet we now know that this republican administration has systematically dismantled every program which was created to serve our least fortunate under the cbc budget the american tradition of compassion and concern for the needy and destitute would be restored to address the totally unacceptable rate of unemployment among our people the cbc alternative includes 6 billion for a desperately needed jobs program to train and put people who want to work back to work additionally the cbc budget restores funding for important education programs such as title 1 and student financial aid in order to maintain an investment in our human capital and in our future by educating our young people other vital national needs in housing social services and transportation which the reagan budget fails miserably to address are best met under the cbc alternative budget in short there is a way to move this nation toward the goal of reduced inflation without throwing millions of americans out of work there is a way to reduce the federal deficit without taking school lunches away from hungry children and snatching costofliving adjustments from the elderly there is a way to lower interest rates and to restore confidence in our economy without slamming the door on thousands of small businessmen and farmers the way is the fauntroy substitute i have a special concern in the area of health care and waut to discuss with my colleagues the cbc alternative budget proposals in this regard the fauntroy subutitute recommends that 85 5 billion be spent on health care programs in fiscal year 1p83 in order to provide the resources necessary to treat and prevent disease care for sick workers mothers children and the elderly this amount is a full 7 5 billion more than the reagan budget and 5 5 oillion more than the budget committee alternative as cochairman of the congressional black caucus health brain trust i enjoy the benefit of the special expertise of hundreds of experienced health care professionals throughout the country these health care professionals are appalled and rightly so about the ruthless impact of last years budget cuts on the ability of poor and disadvantaged americans to obtain high quality medical care it is all too obvious that the great progress that we have made in the last decade in expanding the availability and affordability of health care from inner city communities to isolated rural towns is swiftly being undermined last year 1 billion was slashed from the medicaid program forcing states to cut benefits and limit eligibility for the poor and working poor as a result over 1 million people lost med icaid coverage virtually all of the losers were women and children in lowincome families thousands of families with incomes at or below the poverty line when faced with overwhelming medical care costs have had to quit their meager paying jobs and go on welfare in order to keep or obtain vital medicaid coverage we believe that it is unconscionable to impose this type of pain and hardship on the poorest and most disadvantaged segment of the population the cbc budget therefore restores those cuts in medicaid imposed last year and maintains a basic level of medicald coverage for the millions of women children and lowincome famtlies who depend upon the government for basic health care similarly the fauntroy substitute restores cuts imposed last year in medicare and rejects any cuts for fiscal year 1983 more than 90 percent of medicare enrollees are senior citizens who have the greatest health care needs in this nation senior citizens have the highest percentage of heart attacks and the greatest number of strokes they are the individuals who for the most part have the greatest incidence of cancer and suffer the greatest incidence of crippling and debilitating disease moreover in addition to being the most sick the elderly suffer the double disadvantage of being sick and poor one out of six senior citizens is poor one out of every two black elderly is poor or marginally poor the cbc finds untenable any proposals which penalize our senior citizens and ask them to use their already limited resources to pay more for medical care the cbc also rejects as foolish and shortsighted any freeze in spendling on such vital health programs as maternal and child health alcohol drug abuse and mental health rervices health manpower and biomedical research additional spending in these areas now only serves to save money in the long run no where is the cost effectiveness of a strengthened federal investment in health care more evident than in the area of biomedical research the economic losses from illness and diseases which we still are unable to prevent and cure run into the billions of dollars last year i had the pleasure of hearing testimony from 10 nobel laureates who spoke about the fact that our nation is becoming scientifically and technologically illiterate they spoke about the need for more funding for biomedical research in order to maintain a leadership position in advancing new knowledge about medical care in order to continue progress in understanding the causes of disease and illness the cbc budget provides additional fundiqg to maintain a strong federal investment in biomedical research let us remember that the debate about health programs and out the larger federal budget is otri simply a debate about numbers and dollars and cents it is about human beingschildren parents elderly it is about their successes and failures it is about their hopes and dreams the cbc budget is an alernative which will allow all america te to enjoy human dignity and a high qusiity of life i urge my colleagues to support the fauntroy substitute"], [0.005490720272064209, 0.9945092797279358, 1, "i join with

the bully pulpit of a congressional office to help protect the consumers and workers of america he has shown us how to use a subcommittee to investigate shed light and arouse public concern over key environmental and energy issues his work on toxic wastes energy and auto efficiency unwise public works projects and the havoc which would be wreaked by an oil import fee have helped improve the lives of all americans tobys leaving will deprive the house of one of its best oversightersunfortunately at a time when we need him more than ever he has demonstrated again the old truth that eternal vigilance is the price of libertyand of good government i am going to miss his presence in this chamber his wit and courage are an example to us all i can only hope that he will soon find another platform to continue his work on behalf of the american people i would address my colleagues in the chamber and the con gressmans staff and say that followng the remarks that i would put in the record about my colleagues good works as a subcommittee chairman and in dealing with the environment dealing with his ability to use oversight as a tool that worked well to talk about something that bothers me and that tony did well he did it so well that i thought about this in this sense if you think about a political leaderand i tried to think about somebody as i extend my remarks who talked about the importance of what one person could do and so if you will bear with me for a minutea person who some years ago talked about the futility of being one man and he suggested that if we all gave in and said that we could not make changes in the world because it was futile we should look at martin luther king or we should look at martin luther as a practical matter if we would give in to expediency and say that if that was a cause for us to not want to make changeswe should look at those people who in the expediency of giving in to politics gave in to the camps of dachau and auschwitz and we did not give inmany people did not then you could look at the other danger this person said and we could give in to the concerns of temerity and say that many of us did not wish to be laughed at and so we would not take a chance and risk the temerity or take the temerity and risk the chance of being laughed at by our colleagues and the other great danger this colleague of ours of some years back said was the risk of comfort which toby did not have tony did not have the comfort of an education paid for by his parents or toby did not have the comfort of a great deal of outside income and many people could use that comfort to not take a chance if you have a great deal of education a great deal of income you do not have to risk fighting so as our friend said the futility the expediency the temerity the comfort all those things could deny one person from trying to change the course of the world and if you did not risk greatly you could not achieve greatly now the person who said that and i wish it could have been me was a person who i am sure both toby and i admire it was robert kennedy when he finished his book in march of 1968 and he wrote those words in los angeles just before he was assassinated but i think back on it and i think that those apply to toby who was willing to risk greatly to achieve greatly we will miss him those of us who may not risk as greatly as we would like he did achieve greatly and i think that will go on his record and i think we will all admire him for that in addition to that we will miss him as a friend we will miss his wife myra and little mary ellen

has provided income security to americans for nearly half a century during his campaign for the presidency mr reagan promised that he would preserve the social security system as a safety net we now see that this was just so much more campaign rhetoric already mr reagan and his chief budget slasher david stockman have succeeded in eliminating the 122 minimum benefit this will hurt nearly 3 million americans at the bottom of the economic ladder now the administration is attempting to panic the congress into making benefits to most americans who have come to believe in the integrity of the system and to rely on it for security the president has proposed cutting 88 billion in early retirement disability and other benefits by 1986 attempting to frighten the american people into believing that the social security system will go broke unless he has his way this is a blatant example of overkill the measures proposed by the white house to protect the social security system it is clear that the president is interested in protecting something other than social security the tax bill that tie stampeded congress into accepting is guaranteed to produce huge budget deficits so he can keep his campaign promise to balance the budget by 1984 there is no question that the gigantic tax cut for the rich will reduce revenues and will require budget cuts beyond anything so far proposed reducing social security benefits is just another way to achieve these cuts some measures must be taken to insure social securitys immediate future but they need not be nearly as drastic as the white house proposes social security supports three separate programseach financed by a separate trust fund they are financed by a payroll tax on earningscurrently 6 65 percent for employees and 6 65 percent for employers up to a maximum of 29 775 a year first there is the old age and survivors insurance program that pays benefits to retired workers and their dependents and survivors next there is the disability insurance program that pays benefits to disabled workers and their dependents finally there is the health insurance program which is part a of the medicare program which pays for doctors bills is finance4 by monthly premiums paid by those enrolled in the program and from general tax revenues because i have encountered considerable confusion regarding some other programs i would like to set the record straight the supplemental security income program which provides a basic level of income for the aged blind and disabled is run by the social security aministration but is not part of the social security program it is paid for by general revenue tax funds and not from any of the social security trust funds a person does not have to work under social security to be eligible for ssi benefits this used to be called the old age assistance program when it was run by the states until a few years ago funds for the aid to the families with dependent children program afdc also come from general tax funds and are in no way related to social security it has surprised me to discover that many people think the programs are somehow related neither is the civil service retirement system related to social security this retirement system is funded by contributions from federal employees who are not covered by social security and matching funds from the employing agencies the social security program does have some problems that must be solved but solutions do not require the kind of severe remedies that the president has proposed in the past few years we have had historically high rates of inflation accompanied by high unemployment moreover wage rates have fallen behind price increases as a result social security has been paying out more and not collecting as much as had been anticipated it is expected that the economic picture will improve and that the social security outlook will brighten as well for the next 30 or 40 years until longrange problems begin to take hold it is apparent to me that this administration wants to mislead the public on the social security issue to achieve its own ends all through the tax debate mr reagan used the most optimistic economic assumptions to argue his case in his social security proposals he uses the very worst economic assumptions he cant have it both ways depending on which he wants to advance i dont want to mislead the people into thinking that there are no problems with the social security program the longrun problems are very serious they result from the fact that the population is aging at a time when the birthrate is declining social security is a payasyougo program where active workers pay the benefits of retired workers it is predicated on an everexpanding work force and today that work force is not growing what the reagan administration wants to do is solve the problems of the next century in the next few years none of us knows what is going to happen in the 21st century as in our private lives most of the things we worry about so much never happen none of us knows what the economic conditions will be like 30 or 40 years from now perhaps we will develop new energy sources that will expand our productive capacity beyond our wildest imagination we would not recklessly leap into solving predicted longrange problems when to do so will cause injury to millions of people right away the president wants to cut billions in benefits out of the program in the near future by discouraging early retirement 55 percent of full benefits rather than 80 percent allowed now at age 62 restricting eligibility for disability insurance limiting benefits to survivors and by taking other steps beyond what is needed it is not necessary to hurt millions of americans now when there is a good chance that such extreme measures will not be needed at allespecially if mr reagans assumptions for economic recovery should prove right in the meantime using the social security system to achieve shortterm economic ends such as a balanced budget is playing recklessly with the future of millions of americans there are a lot of things we can do we can amend the law to permit one fund to borrow from another we can allow the troubled old age and survivor insurance fund to borrow from the healthy medicare fund we can consider financing a portion of social security from general tax revenue funds there is an opportunity as well for creating standby loan authority from general funds whatever changes we decide to make should be thought through very carefully and should take effect sometime in the future we cannot simply say to americans who have spent all their working lives paying into a system that we are going to change the rules and they are going to have to make other arrangements do you say to a man or a woman 55 years old that they are going to have to start some kind of private fund for their retirement how much time do they have to build that fund many people made assumptions about retirement income based on social security they took out private insurance annuities and set up separate savings accounts or made other investments they figured out how much they would need based on how much they could expect from social security it would be heartless and unrealistic now to tell them they will have to find a way to increase their savings in the working years they have left working beyond 62 is fine for those people who want to and are able but recent studies by the social security administrat ion show that only 15 to 20 percent of those who opt out before 65 do so voluntarily most who retire before age 65 do so because of failing health or because they can no longer handle the job pressure in many cases the 62yearold worker who has labored 40 years in the steel mills or the auto plants is worn out if he works until he is 65 he may well be dead maybe that is what the administration is counting on there is something else to consider social security is a compact between the young and the old it was designed for a changing society where it is no longer possible for younger people to assume the responsibility of caring for their aged relatives because of changes in working and living conditions mr reagan wants us to return to the old world even though it is no longer possible if we fail to meet the income and medical needs of the older citizens we inevitably are going to shift this cost to the young who cannot afford it we would also create major problems in private pension funds that are tied to social security workers would demand higher employer contributions to make up the difference putting added pressure on price developments we simply cannot afford to destroy the confidence of a program that is so much a part of our society because we are worried about what might happen 30 or 40 years from nowor because mr reagan has gotten himself into an embarrassing revenue situation as the result of an illconceived tax

slaying of over 20 children in atlanta ga is clearly indicative of the sickness which is eroding the fibers of our society violence is becoming more and more a way of life throughout our nation the atlanta slayings and related attacks against children are very cogent symbols that we are moving further away from the highest regard for human life it frightens me deeply to acknowledge the significant psychological damage which is growing among all children due to the recent incidences while the victims of these murders have all been black it is no secret that such acts of violence do not discriminate the fundamental question we must face now is that any child may be forced to live in fear during every phase of a days activity surely the increased number of weaponcarrying schoolchildren momentary periods of panic if a parent is late picking up a schoolchild and decrease in academic achievement are not peculiar to the findings of several atlanta psychiatrists psychologists and mental health officials the feelings of distrust fear and apprehension wih spread among all of our nations children as they begin ti dread functioning in everyday environments this is a sad outlook for our future another fundamental question which is magnifici in the minds of those who fear for human safety is the continuing focus away from human needs we are forced now to question if whether or not the evils of poverty deprivation and unemployment may be so deep rooted in our society that respect for human life becomes secondary to mere survival we are also forced to question the validity of continuous violence as romanticized and glamourized on our television and movie screens the situations in georgia florida maryland and throughout most regions in this country leave us frustrated and angry they leave us to question the basic responsiveness of authorities who must become more adamant in the protection of human lives however they must not lead us to take the law into our own hands the widespread acts of violence must also remind us that the protection and preservation of human lives are crossjurisdictional when as many as 21 lives are lost it cannot be pegged as a state or local government matter both the president and the congress realized this and i laud the dispersal of federal funds to atlanta and the efforts to appropriate 1 5 and 1 8 million for use by this city we have to examine closely the cli mate that motivates and encourages psychotic violence the violence of racism the aforementioned influence of television and movies and the violence of war and militarismall of these inevitably get reflected in individual behavior to a greater or lesser degree he psychotic killers who murder our children in atlanta or any where else are victims of this climate and have apparently been affected to a greater degree we cannot excuse this behavior however we can and must deal squarely with the environment which fosters such actions several sociologists tell us that most of the slain atlanta children come from public housing neighborhoods which are more vulnerable and conducive to human mistreatment abduction and even death such conditions and incidences are not limited to this region of the country right here in washington d c children from lowincome housing projects are becoming more and more susceptible to conditions of drug abuse and molestation here the elimination of unemployment underemployment and poverty must precede the eradication of such criminal acts it is not easy to warn the blacks of atlanta to stay away from theories that the acts of violence against 21 black children are conspiratorial in nature or racially motivated the pattern of systematic murders rapes additional overt and covert actions against black citizens in the south and throughout this country is still just too prevalent however we must assist in the efforts of mayor maynard jackson the numerous task forces and concerned cftizens in addressing the problem in a rational way again until we eliminate the fundamental societal ills we cannot be shocked at deviant behavioral patterns of violence irresponsibility and total disregard for human lives there is little help in calling on citizens to care about each other when increasing inequities among neighborhoods schools living standards and opportunities have become a way of life those of us who are in a position to have impact on public policy must stand firm against further inequities and burdens on our children elderly and lowincome citizens we must promote the kind of

student aid program which is 50 percent below the level of the cuirent academic year i personally am becoming increasingly concerned by reports from universities in my district depicting what will happen to students there if mr reagans federal aid proposals become reality in addition i am troubled by letters from cleveland area students that are pouring into my office on a daily basis a special report which i requested from the ohio student loan commission to analyze and assess the impact of guaranteed loan changes in the package is instructive the report compares the struggling student to a drowning person in need of a life preserver and charges that certain features of the reagan program would turn out to be a life preserver filled with lead i request permission to insert a copy of this report into the record i would also like to share with you some figures which illustrate the sheer magnitude of ohio students who will be affected by the cutbacks at cleveland state university 813 graduate and professional students took out guaranteed loans this year at case western reserve universitys school of medicine 74 percent of the students depend on gsls 1 611 ohio state university graduate students in the health professions used the gsl program 1 318 students at john carroll university applied for loans 106 students received a loan at notre dame college of ohio and 207 students depended upon the gsl program at lakeland community college i have one question for the president where are these young people supposed to come up with the money to attend college or even finish their college educations while i feel that parents and the students themselves do have primary responsibility for assuming educational costs i believe it is naive to assume that these parents and students can finance the institutional losses created by massive federal and in ohio state cutbacks in a letter from cleveland state university which i received yesterday concerned financial aid counselors echoed this question they wrote that the parents of our student body typically hold blue collar jobs and struggle simply to make ends meet and avoid extended layoffs essional record extensions of remarks over 78 percent of the csu students already work full or parttime jobs while they attend classes these counselors are upset they feel the reagan administration is telling students that the

budgetary shuffle omio student loan commission columbus ohio february 18 1982 the g s l program has always played the role of safety net for those students who could not qualify for adequate funding through other sources of assistance while students have always found our program less attractive than the various grant and scholarship programs it has always been an open alternative as the eligibility for student loans is cut further and further the alternative is eroded to the point that the safety net has a number of gaping holes through which eligibile deserving students are certain to fail before getting to a specific discussion of the latest proposal i need to establish some parameters for you with respect to the numbers that our projections are built on the most recent calendar period for which statistics are available1981is really too atypical for purposes of comparison people came out of nowhere to apply for loans last summer anticipating that open access was about to end and as a result we recorded a tremendous loan volume 316 million in guarantees compared to 200 million in 1980 for approximately a percent increase for this reason we have used 1980 as our base year for volume projections this probably understates the impact of the proposed cuts but it also insulates us from accusations of overstating them increase the origination fee charged on new loans from 5 perent to 10 percent the same arguments that applied to the imposition of the 5 percent origination fee apply to the proposed doubling of the fee while it does effect an immediate reduction in the amount of federrl support required to finance the program it also means that student borrowers end up with less money to pay for their educations the 118 474 students who participated in our program in 1981 borrowed an average of 2 667 55 each 318 035 782 divided by 118 474 this meant that each of those hypothetical average students had their 2 667 55 loans reduced by 133 38 5 percent to 2 534 17 a 10 percent origination fee would reduce that same hypothetical borrowers loan by 266 70 to 2 400 79 a great number of our graduate and professional students borrow the full 5 000 of their eligibility these students would face an immediate 500 reduction in the net proceeds of their loans with a 10 percent origination fee students also must pay a guarantee premium on their loans while the percentages and methods of calculation vary from state to state ohio charges 1 percent per annum through the grace period of the loan this would typically mean a total fee of somewhere between 1 percent and 5 percent by combining our guarantee premium with the proposed origination fee for a worst case example a student beginning graduate school could borrow 5 000 but only receive approximate ly 4 250 the 750 reduction can seem relatively insignificant when viewed on the larger scheme of things but to the graduate student who may literally be pinching pennies to pay the heavy costs involved in his or her education the loss could very well make the difference in the ability to continue even so the origination fee whether at 5 percent or at 10 percent is one of the less odorous of the proposed changes in that it does not have an adverse impact on loan availability if the gsl program could be likened to a life preserver thrown to drowning students the 10 perc nt origination fee would insure that the life preserver still gets thrown it just requires the drowning student to help inflate it there is a tremendous difference between offering expensive assistance and not offering any assistance at all we believe that the alternative the choice of whether or not to borrow must be retained apply the need analysis to students at all income levels and limit loans to those students who will qualify after taking into account family contributions and other financial aid e g pell grants 0 1 bill the second proposal the requirement that all applicants show need in order to obtain osls is not a new idea congress passed a law requiring a needs analysis for all applicants effective july 1 1972 but the resultant political heat was so great that the requirement was lifted just a month later on august 18 1972 with a return to the income cap eligibility criterion the idea wouldnt go away however and we saw the needs analysis requirement reimposed just about six months later on march 1 1973 the requirement was kept in effect this time until june 2 1974 when we once again returned to the income ceiling qualification there are two significant areas of concern with respect to a needs test one practical and one philosophical from the practical standpoint a universal needs analysis requirement works a real administrative hardship on all parties concerned one of the strong points of the gsl program has always been an ability to provide assistance in fairly short order but the requirement that needs tests be filed can quickly make a threemonth application turnaround time pretty common the mountains of paper involved soon clog the application pipeline and many students dont get their applications approved until after tuition deadlines are past from the philosophical viewpoint need can be a terribly difficult figure to derive with any consistency or equity need has no identity independent of that given it in the law or regulations and i have yet to see a needs analysis system that in my view provided an accurate measure of a familys ability to support a postsecondary student needs analysis was originally conceived of as a rationing device for scarce grant and scholarship money rather than meeting the need of any applicants it simply distributed the available pot of money among the applicants in accordance with their relative need the application of such a standard to the osl program without some fairly major modifications to the underlying assumptions and tenets will not meet the actual need of the people who turn to the program for help my point i guess is that the regulatory action that establishes the parameters of need is almost more important than the requirement that a needs analysis be performed allow graduate and

president by the american people on november 4 1980 of the four alternatives before us it does the best job of eliminating deficit spending reducing the level of federal spending providing tax relief to the american people and spurring jobs and economic recovery for american businesses and american workers the 18 members of the congressional black caucus are now about to detail for your consideration and debate a resolution that balances the budget in fiscal year 1982 which indeed offers the american people a 7 85 billion surplus instead of the 50 4 deficit that the reaganstockman proposal imposes upon us it is a budget that spends 7 95 billion less than djes the reaganstockman proposal it in a budget resolution that offers the american people 56 4 billion in tax cuts nearly 2 billion more in tax relief than does the reagan stockman proposal and we do it in a fashion that will not concentrate 80 percent of the business and industry tax incentives among the major corporations while providing only 20 percent of the tax relief to the small businesses of the nation which account for 48 percent of private sector gross national products and employ 80 percent of the

the american employee and another 7 2 billion to the businesses of our country the 10percent a year acrosstheboard tax cut proposal of the reagan administration is more of the same old thing it will have the average worker earning 15 000 a year paying 93 more in federal taxes by 1984 while the twotenths of 1 percent of the people who earn 200 000 a year will have the government return nearly 20 000 a year to them the american people voted for a new beginning not more of the same old thing with respect to the budget and tax policies of this nation they voted for a balanced budget and reduced federal spending and tax relief not for a legalized raid on the treasury by rich individuals and multinational corporations that will rob the people of 220 billion a year in tax revenues by 1986 they voted for a strong america not an america weekened by throwing 1 1 million people out of work which the reagan human needs budget cuts alone would do in fiscal year 1982 and the fauntroy amendment gives them that they voted for a just and compassionate america not a callous america that would deny a 1 5 billion free lunch to hungry children while continuing a 3 billion free lunch program for the rich that we call the three martini lunch deduction the fauntroy amendiment gives the amerncan people what they voted for it is living proof that the budget can be balanced government spending decreased and tax relief given without necessarily cutting back before yielding to my colleagues in the congressional black caucus to provide you more of the details of our constructive alternative budget resolution let me say three things about this budget resolution that the democraitic study group described as the substitute that takes the boldest step of any proposal being offered to the house to deal with the federal deficit that offers the largest and fairest tax cut of any of the proposals before the house and that accomplishes all of this without hurting other important national programs the first is that while the fauntroy amendment in the nature of a substitute is authored by black legislators it is not a program for black people only the most serious problems confronting this nation just happen to be reflected most acutely in the black experience this is a program for all americans the elde ly on limited income most of whom are white the struggling young couples all over the nation who want but cannot find affordable housing anywhere most of whom are white the coal miners whose black lung benefits are being threatened most of whom are white young people from low and middleincome families who would be denied guaranteed student loans and basic opportunity grants for higher education most of whom are white the sick the cold the hungry the handicapped most of whom are white and all of whose burdens will be made heavier by the grammlatta budget proposal thus the solutions we seek are not for black people only but solutions that will benefit all americans black and white together young and old together rich and poor together protestant catholic jew and gentile together the second thing i want to point out is that our constructive alternative budget is based on a different assessment of the root cause of the problem we are experiencing in our domestic economy and the arena of world affairs than that of the reagan administration a in the area of the economy we maintain that inflation unemployment and loweconomic growth are not caused by government spending government taxation and government regulation as the administration would have us believe imprudence in each of these areas contributes to our economic woes and we are as determined as president reagan to sort out waste fraud and abuse at all levels of government expenditures but the fact is that our economic woes have nothing to do with the fact that we provide food stamps for the hungry medicaid for the sick housing for the poor and public service employment for the jobless our economic difficulties are rooted in the fact that other people are making better mousetraps nowadays our difficulties are rooted in the fact that over the past 15 years or more we have had a steady decline in economip performance in manufacturing output in product design and in productivity in sector after sector we are producing insufficient quantities of poorly designed products at too high a price when you do that not only does the world not buy what we make but we do not buy what we make this is best illustrated by an experience which i had a few months ago looking for a christmas gift for my young son marvin he said he wanted a portable radio for christmas i went to one of our local department stores and saw on the shelf a portable radio by rca amfm 87 i was about to purchase it when i noticed on another shelf something called sanyo it said amfm radio three speakers and tape recorder 47 now i love america and i have sense enough to know that when i purchase american made products i am sustaining jobs for americans but when i saw something better for less i must candidly admit that i bought the sanyo and i did it not because i like strange sounding names but because it was a better mousetrap the problem with our economy is that most americans are doing just what i did we are buying datsun toyota kawasaki suzuki honda yamaha panasonic sony seiko nikon and pentax that is our problem and it will not be solved by denying students basic opportunity grants or poor children free lunch or the elderly poor medicaid the problem is that we are losing market shares in the world at large as well as at home the consequence is rising unemployment inadequate profits and therefore reduced investments still worse productivity a falling dollar and still worse inflation our goal therefore must be to restore productivity the competitiveness of unitedstates industry and our other major economic sectors in both domestic and world markets to do this we must undertake the most fundamental reassessment of our economic structure since 1932or perhaps of all time as our colleague representative augustus hawkins has repeatedly pointed out and will do so again today to remedy that problem we must begin to implement the policies called for in the humphreyhawkins full employment and balanced growth act the third thing i should like to say is that the congressional black caucus makes a different assessment of what our problems are in the areas of world affairs our view is that our problems in 1hternational affairs do not lend themselves to military solution they are social economic and political in nature and thus we have emphasized a strong national economy and food and technical assistance as the primary weapons in the arsenal for our confrontation with soviet russia we favor improved national security but without wasteful military spending our budget as representative dellums will point out today calls for defense of our nation not domination of the world our emphasis on the area of foreign affairs must be for example upon development aid and technical assistance to nations like zimbabwe so that mr mugabe may build roads from the chromium mines to the sea where we can buy it sail it to detroit and make a kcair that goes a longer way to empty than does datsun that is what we need to be doing finally our speaker of the house thomas tip oneill has prominently displayed on a desk in his office in the capitol a quote from hubert humphreys last speech on capitol hill on november 17 1977 i think that quote summarizes the choices we must make this week on our budget resolutions he said the moral test of government is how it treats those who are in the dawn of life the children those who are in the twilight of life the aged and those who are in the shaows of life the sick the needy and the handicapped the three other choices before you this week fail the moral test of government the fauntroy amendment in the nature of a substitute which we now detail for you passes that test with flying colors i yield for the distinguished gentleman from new york to open our presentation of the details of our proposal"], [0.006318092346191406, 0.9936819076538086, 1, "we are beginning with this general debate a very historic process which i believe will result in the most dramatic and substantial change in federal fiscal policy that has occurred in this country in the last 50 years whether we are democrat or republican i think all of us read what the american people were demanding last november they asked that there be serious restraint on the growth of federal spending and that we get our fiscal house in order the alternatives before us today regardless of which one you are talking about have a substantial dramatic change in federal fiscal policy from the outset i would like to reiterate what i stated when i asked my colleagues to elect me chairman of the committee on the budget and that is this that the funandgames time for the budget process is over if you want to continue the budget process then we ought to build a budget based on reality build a budget that will stand the test of time and pass a budget which we will support when the individual authorizing and appropriations bills come before the house of representatives i think we have the lattakemproth substitute or the republican substitute and the committee bill present a clear choice in many respects of ways to proceed on budget policy quite frankly i have been somewhat disturbed by reports that some of our colleagues say for political or other reasons they are going to support this or that alternative but that it really does not mean anything because when they come back to the authorizing votes and to the appropriating votes they will vote the other way what i want to set out from the very beginning is that so long as i am chairman of the committee on the budget i intend to do everything in my power to make the budget process realno more fun and gamesso that those who vote for the budget resolutions will know what is in those resolutionsand they will be expected to vote the same way when the individual authorizing and appropriating bills come before the house many people think that they can vote one way because of the immediate political pressure on them but that the pressure will be off 1 week from now 2 weeks from now 1 month from now i think it is incumbent upon every member of this body to know what is in these resolutions to know what they are voting on what they are cutting and what kind of tax program they are providing because those who look to you on this vote will be looking to you on subsequent votes to be consistent if you think you get out from under the pressure by casting a vote one way today and changing it the next time you are not going to do it because the same interest groups that are after you today will be after you tomorrow and you will look worse by being inconsistent so i hope that you will make it a point to know what is in these various alternatives some of the reports i have heard that my colleagues indicate that they may support the republican substitute they should keep in mind that it really does include the kemproth tax bill and there is no way to get around it the president of the united states just a few days ago from this chamber said that the tax program the kemproth tax program was integral to his program that there would be no compromise no alternative so those of you who vote for the latta republican substitute are voting for the kemproth tax bill and you ought to know it some say that a vote for the latta substitute does not include any kind of severe cuts in elementary and secondary education that is wrong the substitute includes deep cuts 25 percent cuts in elementary and secondary education and most of those cuts are going to affect education for handi capped children and you ought to know it some who have indicated that they may support the republican substitute say that that does not mean that we are not going to provide for filling the strategic petroleum reserve and that is not true the substitute cuts the support for the strategic petroleum reserve by 75 percent there is no way to get around it and you ought to know it when you vote the substitute i might also add will raise a point of order against the appropriation of 3 billion for the strategic petroleum reserve that is pending and ready to come to thenfoor of the house next week and you ought to know it some say that they may support the republican substitute but that it does not contain any cuts in vocational education or job training and that is not true it cuts vocational education it cuts job training and you ought to know it all i am saying is whether you are talking about the cuts in agricultural programs the cuts in job training the cuts in education or the kemproth tax bill if you feel you want to support that i will never question any member of this body on that decision you have your own reasons and you ought to vote for those reasons all i am saying is let us be consistent let us be honest with the american people and you vote today as you are going to vote for the rest of this year on the 1982 budget the budget committee will be keeping with the responsibilities we have a scorecard as to where we are and that scorecard is going to be embarrassing for some people if they are not consistent as the year goes on so that is one of the first points i wanted to make that is that i take my responsibility as chairman of this committee on the budget very seriously and whatever this body passes i will attempt to enforce to the letter now i want briefly to state how the committee resolution got to its present form because it was not a happen stance event it was guided by a number of principles and a number of goals that i personally had and the committee had a number of goals that were laid out after i was elected chairman of this committee the overriding goal that directed my attention was to put together a budget that would truly lessen the pressures on inflation unless we keep that goal uppermost we are npt responding to what the american people said they wanted in the elections last november what can we do to get inflation down another goal was to try to limit federal spending as a percent of gross national product many of you recall and some of you cosponsored the efforts we made in the last congress to start limiting federal spending and the first step was to limit federal spending to 22 5 percent of gnp that goal was achieved in this committee resolution as a matter of fact we actually cut spending more in aggregate terms than the administration recommended in its march 10 budget a third overriding goal was to recommend a tax policy designed to meet the needs of our country and the american people today in that connection we looked at various tax programs and compared kemproth to other possibilities and we found over and over again that the kemproth tax bill would in effect a keynesian consumptionoriented tax policy it would stimulate demand there is no question about it"], [0.006464123725891113, 0.9935358762741089, 1, "i thank the gentleman for allowing me to address this rule and more specifically the resolution h j res 391 the labor supplemental appropriation i want to commend the chairman of the committee for guiding us through a very complicated situation yesterday in bringing before the house the bills that we will consider i rise and take this opportunity to address the substance of house joint p solution 391 out of frustration and out of a concern for the situation that exists in the state of michigan representing the northeast suburbs of detroit i appreciate the intent of this appropriation as deeply as any member of this congress michigan currently suffers from a 16percent unemployment rate that translates into a record 600 000 unemployed we have already closed 18 unemployment offices because of previous federal funding cuts and without this supplemental we would probably have to close 19 more causing some of our citizens to travel as much as 94 miles to reach one of these offices one need not peruse very far back in the congresssional record to find the administrations supporters on the budget and tax debates of last year condemning the projections of the congressional budget office poor economics they said the cbo is incompetent they said cbo is using the wrong assumptions they said dr rivlin is too liberal and ought to be replaced they said one year later we know that the cbo was right because their projections yere based on some familiarity with economics and they refused to adopt the fantasies of the alchemists at the office of management and budget they implicitly predicted this day would be faced by this congress wishing something to be mr president does not make it so maybe on film but not in the reality of the american economy economic policy must bear some relation to economic theory otherwise lives careers and hopes of this and future generations are diminished this day was predictable it was predictable last summer when this body gave away the store to corporate interests and gave a green light to military excesses so much so that even they cannot find ways to use such unprecedented largesse meanwhile we told the poor the elderly and the marginally employed that they were sapping the economy of its strength and it was up to them to restore it it was predictable when we cut job training assistance and based our ceilings for unemployment assistance on hallucinatory projections of the administration it was predictable and you know as grateful as i am to the chairman of the appropriations committee for his expeditious response to this emergency it is not going to be enough it is not going to be enough for workers who have lost their homes to foreclosure and with it that most american of aspirations inherited from previous generations it is not going to be enough for the children of workers who will see their dreams of a college education evaporate with their parents jobs unemployment benefits exhausted federal education assistance nonexistent where is the trickledown mr prestdent despite mammoth concessions to corporations our unemployed number 10 million the business rate of investment is a meager 0 3 percent where is the trickledown these are real people mr presidentthe unemployed are they laugh and cry they hope and right now they hurt the president confronted with massive unemployment in many regions of this land contemptuously tells people to vote with their feetto move to another part of the country we see stories in the newspapers regularly of thousands of applicants lining up in response to announce ments of a handful of jobs the detroit free press in my own area in a wonderful spirit of community offered to publish at its own expense situations wanted ads for detroits unemployed the response was six pages of free ads while the help wanted ads were listed on a single page our president tells us there are plenty of jobs offered in the newspapers for those who want to work it is time that this administration spent less time with the blue blooded and more time with the blue collar less time with black tie and more with black unemployment less time talking with people in reception lines and more time talking with people in unemployment lines there is a certain vindication for those of us who stood on this floor last year and denounced the midnight budget with its disneylike assumptions who predicted severe dislocations and resulting unemployment which would in turn create unprecedented need for assistance which would in turn drive deflbits upward which would in turn keep interest rates high which would in turn prevent economic recovery but that vindication is hollow because it as predicated on the fulfillment of predictions which many of us expected yet hoped against it is vindication obtained at the suffering of people i know respect and serve and it is most unwelcome and bitter so i am happy for this bit of relief while i denounce the actions that have made it necessary if any of my col leagues feel that this economic experiment is still attractive theory i invite them to visit the silent lumber mills of oregon the steel mills of pennsylvania and ohio and the auto factories of michigan and indiana i urge my colleagues to support this rule this supplemental appropriation and more honest budget projections than we are learning to expect from this administration"], [0.006570756435394287, 0.9934292435646057, 1, "today as some of us will begin to enjoy windfall gains from a new tax law that was approved not on the basis of being fair and equitable but as being deliberately constructed to~help the rich i hope we will not continue down a deadend street of believing in what president reagan calls the magic of the marketplace empirical evidence of six recessions in the postwar period resulting from similar tight monetary and regressive fiscal policies now being pursued documents the fallacy of feeding the fat and starving the lean economics for those who care to think objectively and to heed commonsense i am inserting into the record the report of the national advisory council on economic opportunity a governmental agency which the congress created warning us that the blunderuss budget cuts in social program will lead not to price stability and a sounder economy but more crime poverty welfare dependency and general social and economic chaos the councils statement follows the national advisory council on economic opportunity today sharply criticized the reagan administrations proposed cutbacks in federal incometransfer and antipoverty programs saying that the effect of these cuts will be to cause massive suffering as well as to undermine the work ethic and family life among the poor the administrations proposed cutbacks of these crucial federal programs warned the council in releasing its final report will severely deepen the crisis of poverty in the future and could drive whole segments of our society toward hopelessness and despair instead the report calls for passage of the economic opportunity act and continuation of the legal services corporation two programs that are essential to the wellbeing of the more than 29 million americans still living in poverty in a separate statement arthur 1 blaustein chairman of the council said by separating economic theory from social policy and pursuing the former at the expense of the latter the administration has adopted a strategy of brinksmanship that could lead to social chaos there is a price to be paid for the reduction of human and social services the price is that these cuibicks will not reduce crime they will increase it they will not reduce the use of drugs they will increase it they will not reduce alcoholism they will increase it they will not reduce physical and mental illness they will increase it they will not promote better family life they will destabilize it they will not increase respect for the law they will weaken it at present there exists an air of suspended disbelief over the radical changes that have occurred in the past two months that is because the layoffs the shutdowns the cutbacks and the reduced paychecks have not yet reached ground level but the day of reckoning will come shortly october 1 1981 will be remembered as a day of infamy for it will mark the worst massacre of social and human service programs in american history the report the american promise equal justice and economic opportunity addresses itself specifically to the issues of unemployment inflation women in poverty the implementation of human and social service programs citizen participation and volunteerism and the myths of poverty the 15member council established by congress in 1967 and appointed by the president is responsible for making an annual report to the president and congress on programs and policies aimed at helping the poor it is slated for abolition by this administration attacking what it termed persistent myths about poverty in the united states the council presented evidence that disputed what it termed the mistaken view of some economists that the reduction in the proverty population had been a result of growth ini the private economy the council maintained that for some time such growth has ceased to trickle down to the poor in the farm of more jobs better income and a more rewarding and productive role in society and the council reaffirmed its belief that only those comprehensive and national economic revitalization efforts targeted specifically toward dissadvantaged communities and the jobless would effectively combat poverty in the 1980s a strategy that the administration is abandoning in addition to releasing the report the council issued the following statement seventeen years ago this nation made an historic commitment to reduce if not eliminate poverty in america the economic opportunity act was conceived with moral conviction and dedicated to the proposition that all americans even the 36 million poor were entitled to both opportunity and equal access to the law the act itself called for a national effort to attack the causes of poverty and related social problems which were national in character and scope all the testimony given to the council over the past several years has shown that these federal programs do work that they do help people get out of poverty and that the delivery systems are providing the necessary basic human and social services thus after fifteen years of progress in our nations effort to relieve poverty when in fact the number of poor had by 1980 been reduced by 11 million and millions more have been kept above the poverty line this council is deeply concerned that the process will be reversed by recent policy decisions by the administration that will serve not only to increase the number of poor but to make their burden more severe the three aspects of the administrations economic recovery program that gravely concern the council are 1 the massive acrosstheboard cuts in social and human service programs 2 the abolition of delivery systems provided for in the economnic opportunity act and the legal services corporation act 3 the transfer of federal authority and program responsibility to the states through block grant programs in evaluating the impact of these changes on the poor we believe that each of these decisions taken alone would be painful but taken together they will be absolutely devastating this council under four presidents two republicansand two demo crats has consistently taken the position that the federal government must maintain active responsibility for pursuing the goals of the economic opportunity act this has never beena partisan issue and it should not be one now the council vigorously reaffirms its earlier recommendations that the economic opportunity act and the legal services corporation act should be reauthorized the council is well aware that the economic difficulties facing our nation are complex and often seem overwhelming but these difficulties cannot be used as an excuse for reneging on our social and moral commitments as a nation we are deeply troubled by the notion that national issues ones that require national policy and programs and that are a part of our national purpose should suddenly devolve to the states the issue is not federal versus 9tate responsibility rather it is the dimunition or avoidance of any national standards of responsibility and accountability to deflect suspend or fragment responsibility and accountability suggests that we are either renouncing or failing to assert our moral purpose as a nation worse than that the administration seems to be denying that this moral purpose exists the effect of the block grant proposal as opposed to the economic opportunity act and the legal services corporation act is to destroy existing support systems that are effective that have a proven capacity to deliver services and that utilize local planning and implementation capabilities they are being replaced by a new system that has a poor track record and is restrictively financed more bureaucratic less accountable ans more subject to intense political pressures the last point is extremely important in that effective and efficient use of limited federal funds is in danger of being thwarted by conflicting political interests in each state after reviewing the recent budget process it appears that there has been a massive transfer from basic human and social services to our military budget the council seriously questions whether it is in the national interest to relegate a substantial number and social service programs to the junkpile while we increase the stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction in an arms race where overkill has long been achieved moreover these changes are occuring without any serious national debate when advocates of balanced national priorities are dismissed by the president as representatives of special interests and critics of the administrations policy are referred to as demagogues in criticizing the administrations sharp cutbacks in social programs the councils statement emphasized the negative impact of these cutbacks on work and family life from an administration that places high priority on the importance of faily life and the work ethic it said this budget will be selfdefeating the council cited the following analyses drawn from its own research and other recent studies in support of its statement that these policies will actually encourage dependency instead of work family breakdown instead of family stability the council cited an estimate by the congressional budget office that proposed cuts in public service employment under the comprehensive employment and training act ceta would result in a net loss of between 210 000 and 330 000 jobs in fiscal years 1981 and 1982 causing a sharp rise in expenditures for welfare and unemployment insurance the loss of these jobs the council pointed out would be compounded by cuts in support services which range from child care to mass transit creating a spiral effect that will deal a devastating blow to the realistic job prospects of hundreds of tihousandsof disadvantaged workers the council cited an estimate by the wharton economic forecasting associates that about threequarters of a million jobs would be lost through cuts in ceta alone and an additional million as a result of the administrations program reductions as a whole the council singled out proposed cuts in the aid to families with dependent children afd c program as an example of how the reality of the administrations budget departs from its rhetoric citing independent studies by the congressional budget office and the university of chicagos center for the study of welfare policy the council noted that the bulk of cuts in afdc are concentrated on families who are presently working but do not now earn enough to maintain an adequate living the council pointed out that welfare recipients who work will have their incomes cut by an average of more than 20 percent versus a 4 percent reduction for those who do not work and in some states the administrations proposed changes will eliminate the difference between what an afdc family can receive if no one works and the income it can receive with a fulltime worker noting that this sharply penalizes the working poor the council commented that tile administration apparently feels that only the rich need incentives to work the council said that families with young childrenespecially minority families and families headed by womenwould be among the worst victims of thle hardships imposed by the administrations cuts citing an analysis by the congressional budgct office the council pointed out that of those families that are expected to lose a substantial portion of their spendable income from reductions in public service jobs af dc food stamps and the school lunch program over twothirds are headed by women and almost two out of five are nonwhite referring to thle university of chicago study the council noted that a singleparent faily with two children could lose up to 30 percent of its disposable income from reductions in afdc food stamps and child nutrition programs alone in rejecting the administrations contention that renewed economic growth will eventually trickle down to the poor to offset these losses the council declared that it flies in the face of everything we know about poverty today tile council cited new evidence in this years report affirming that growth in the private economy has had a declining role in reducing poverty and that virtually all of the reduction in poverty since the mid1960s has come about through the expansion of social insurance and incometransfer programs of the kind now under attack by the administration though poverty increased most dramatically in the hardhit declining cities of the northeast and midwest the report says poverty rates also remained disturbingly stable even in those cities characterized by strongoccasionally phenomenalgrowth in jobs and income in short economic growth has had little impact in decreasing poverty rates in recent years even in the boom cities of the southwest the stubborn persistence of poverty in the face of economic growth the council pointed out in its statement results in part from the changing nature of thle poverty population what tile report terms the new poor are increasingly a population of those whom the private economy has passed by even in good times thle council noted these peoplethe aged the disabled disadvantaged youth women heading families with small childrenare rarely hired by the private sector in 1978 a year of economic recovery thle unemployment rate among disadvantaged minority youth was 41 percent among afdc recipients one of the groups most harshly affected by the administrations cuts nearly 70 percent are clilldren more than twothiirdls of them 11 years old or younger among the adults thle overwhelming majority nre women heading fainiliesabout 80 percent of whom are either required as fulltime homemakers disabled or already in training at work or seeking work because few of these people can be absorbed into the private economy without special assistance and support said the council the massive suffering these program cuts will bring cannot be balanced by any credible longrange benefits from the administrations programeven under the hi 6769 most optimistic economic assumptions instead the council declared any economic renewal resulting from the administrations policies would take place at the expense of stable rewarding family lives and genuine work opportunities for the poor and their children mr lllaustein chairman of the council added that we are watching a great tragedy unfurl before us the steady drumbeat of rhetoric emanating from administration officials and shrewdly orchestrated by the white house is intended to create and has heretofore succeeded in creating a counterreality and new myths with respect to social policy for example by continuously referring to economic opportunity and equal justice programs as welfare programs the administration has misled the american public these programs are in fact designed to achieve the opposite to create jobs and economic opportunities and to encourage people who are dependent upon welfare to become productive citizens and taxpayers by seeking to eliminate these programs and substituting its own policies the administration will deny upware mobility to millions on welfare and will force many of the working poor into welfare dependency by shifting program authority from the federal government to the states through block grants the administration has created a bureaucratic nightmare that will result in government by provisional catastrophe by transferring huge amounts of funds from human and social services to defense the administration is not dampening inflation it is fueling it in order to gain support for its economic package the administration has conjured up the specter of an economic dunkirk what it is perpetuating is a social pearl harbor which will have a devastating impact on the poor who are defenseless as well as wiping out the modest gains made in the past fifteen years by women the elderly minorities and the youngthe most vulnerable segments of our society"], [0.006637692451477051, 0.993362307548523, 1, "i would like to say to my friend the gentleman from ohio that his is exactly the point i was trying to make we are damaging our ability to have a strong defense by putting all this emphasis and huge expenditure into nuclear weapons in fact we are denuding not only our colleges and universities of professors in the sciences and engineering we are also at the present time already without this huge buildup creating shortages through our defense program in our industrial base on which we depend to produce weapons and on which we ri pend to try to keep an industrial base that can support a sound defense we are even injuring the military itself because so much of the military budget is going into nuclear weapons and nuclear delivery systems that we have not got adequate funds to be able to strengthen our conventional force to train our personnel so that they can operate the military equipment we were embarrassed not too long ago by having an initiative to try to recaputure our iranian hostages which went bad because we could not keep the helicopters flying i think increasingly we are going to see this with tle sophisticated technology we have ve have to give greater incentives to get qualified people into the military and to keep them in the military i have advocated a program which would give educational benefits very much like we do now at west point and the other military academies in return for people having an obligation of service for a period of time and obviously there is that critical need but we have not got money enough for that now i think from every aspect we are undermining our security by proposing to spend these trillions of dollars in nuclear weaponry there is another aspect of this that i would like to emphasize and then i will put the rest of my remarks in the record and that is the question of proliferation that also endangers our future and the future destruction of humanity i am very disturbed indeed that this administration is dropping the efforts that have been put together by all previous administrations republican and democratic to keep a curb on the weapons gaining capability of other countries who are not already nuclear weapons countries i think we need much greater effort internationally and in our own domain to end a fast growing proliferation which in many ways in more dangerous than the nuclear weapons race between ourselves and the russians i think it is highly unlikely that the russians are going to drop bombs on us knowing that they would be committing suicide in doing so they would be destroyed but if we allow reprocessing and enrichment in breeder technology to go around the world with plutonium and highly enriched uranium therefore very greatly available and not subject to effective controls we run the risk that a quadhafi in libya or an araot in the palestinian liberation organization or the red brigades in italy will gain control of a nuclear weapon and might be able to blackmail the world or anybody else and what is our response if the red brigades get a nuclear weapon you do not blow up italy the only real response is to assure that irre sponsible powers of that sort do not get access to nuclear weapons and nuclear materials from which weapons can readily be made today and yet this administration is not only dropping the previous administrations resistance to the spread of nuclear weapons capabilities the sale of reprocessing and enrichment and highly enriched uranium and breeder reactors abroad but we understand it is even being seriously considered that we would start selling reprocessed and enrichment material and equipment abroad ourselves and that we are even contemplating contaminating our civilian nuclear program by turning over spent fuel to be used for the production of weapons by our military forces i would like to say that if we proceed on that road i think we run just totally unacceptable risks that instead we ought to be calling an urgent international conference of nuclear weapons nations to try to restrict the further proliferation of nuclear weaponsmaking capability and the spread of plutonium and highly enriched uranium from which bombs can be made we ought to set up some kind of an international mechanism to assure countries that using fission reactors they would have an assured supply of lowenriched uranium we ought to put a tremendous effort into technology that the united states has developed to extend the lifetime and the burnup capability of existing fission reactors to do what we can to prohibit the sale to any other countries of the machines or the actual materials from which bombs can be made i think that this debate is exceedingly important again i congratulate its sponsors i am happy to take part in it to lend whatever efforts i can to have us stop saying nuclear policy overall and nuclear weapons policy in particular the reagan administrations stand accelerating the nuclear arms race is the crowning glory of a myriad of senseless destabilizing and dangerous policies it is thus especially gratifying to see so many americans finally rise up against this huge senseless nuclear arms buildup with its socalled tactical nuclear weapons neutron bombs and winnable nuclear wars and resist the administrations policies which are leading us on a course toward unprecedented nuclear calamity president reagan has initiated the most massive buildup of nuclear weapons in unitedstates history and on top of that an equally risky foray into develoying a new generation of chemical warfare weapons yet it has not even defined a coherent military or foreign policy the administration is planning a 6year 222 billion expansion of nuclear forces invulving land sea and airbased missiles space weaponry civil defense systems and more in the next decade reagans policies would add 17 000 new nuclear weapons to the 30 000 already existing in the unitedstates nuclear arsenal the stated purpose of this policy is to achieve the capacity to fight and win a nuclear wara goal as unattainable as it is dangerous the administration defends its buildup by claiming that we are vulnerable to the soviets in response to our repeated calls for priority efforts to control the development testing and deployment of nuclear weapons the administration has used distortions and inaccuracies to portray our present nuclear capability as inferior to the russians there is only one important fact in this equation howeverit is not comparability that matters but sufficiencyand we clearly have sufficient nuclear powerin fact the unitedstates has far more power than needed to destroy russia should it attackand russia knows it that is what mattersnot whethler we outnumber the russians or they us in particular weapons system even using the administrations comparisons however the united states and the soviet union are in rough parity today each possessing advantages and disadvantages in its nuclear weapons capability for example the united states leads the soviets by 9 400 deliverable strategic nuclear warheads to 7 800 according to the center for defense information moreover our warheads are more survivable because of more diverse unitedstates strategic force deployments despite the clear sufficiency and even advantage in strategic nuclear warheads possessed by the united states the administration has argued that the soviets are at an advantage in nuclear megatonnage but as paul warnke former director of the arms control and disarmament agency said in a recent interview which appeared in the new york times the fact that they might have a 2megaton warhead compared to our modest ones of something like 400 000 tons of tnt only makes one difference how big is the hole going to be where the high school used to be h 1260 again though all these comparisons are irrelevant we have more then enough power for our security already despite the incredible redundancy of nuclear weapons the reagan administration wants to continue spending hundreds of billions of dollars to fuel the arms race paralyzing our nations 1 the administrations continued development of more sophisticated nuclear weapons and delivery systems on this massive scale has created the impression that the united states is building a nuclear force to destroy the soviet unions nuclear arsenal in a preemptive attack as the united states and russia approach preemptive capabilities we both become much less secure requiring hairtrigger launch on warning policies enormous amounts of money will be spent and we will be less secure than ever as the military budget is absorbed by destabilizing nuclear weaponry really needed expenditures are denied for conventional forces spare parts improved pay and technical training for our military personnel we deny our soldiers sufficient education and training necessary to understand the tenets of military strategy and even how to operate the sophisticated weapons to which we entrust our national security thus again we will be less secure ever but the nuclear arms race is not the only problem risking nuclear destruction of humanity we need not only a freeze on nuclear weapons development but on the transfer of the materials and equipment for producing nuclear weapons the development of nuclear power on an international scale also carries with it the risk of increasing the number of countries that will have access to the technology and the materials for nuclear weapons specifically nuclear e richment and reprocessing facilities and breeder reactors are direct sources of bombquality materialshighly enriched uranium235 and plutonium if countries decide to use these facilities to develop nuclear weapons the rate of nuclear proliferation could increase and with it the chance of a provoked nuclear war or nuclear blackmail by terrorists against which there is no defense while we can deter russia from nuclear war by making it suicidal there would be no adequate response if a qadhafi or an araffat gains access to a nuclear bomb the only realistic recourse is to prevent terrorists from gaining access to weapons during the past decade the united states has expressed increasing concern over the proliferation risk assocated with nuclear power i one of the great ironies of reagans policies is that they will leave us much weakerweaker because of diversion of funds from our economly weaker because of the established nature of our nuclear investment and weaker because the billion to be spent on nuclear weapons will deprived our conventional military adequacy by 1985 25 nonweapon countries will have operational power reactors each generating enough spent fuel to manufacture a score of bombs annually if the plutonium is separated from the fuel more important some of these countries plan to build reprocessing facilities that will enable them to separate the plutonium from spent fuel once separated the plutonium could be put to weapons use quickly other countries have or are building enrichment plants that could be used to enrich uranium235 to bomb grade levels the reagan administration would greatly exacerbate this problem by condoning even promoting the intro duction and use of these sensitive nuclear technologies and materials on a commercial scale throughout the world once introduced they would be impossible to safeguard effectively providing too easy access to any terrorist group and nuclear weapons ca pability to countries that might use them for blackmail or in local conflicts if they got pressed to the wall the result could be incredible carnage in the late 20th century from the spread of nuclear weapons to other countries and the possibility of a third country provoking a nuclear war between the united states and russia the worlds most volatile regionsthe middle east and south asiaalready include five countries reported either to have the capability to construct nuclear weapons or to be actively seeking that capability in a worst case libya israel iraq pakistan and india could all have nuclear weapons within a few years the actions of these countries will not be independent of each other the nations are connected in a complicated fashion by enmity and cooperationthus the acquisition of nuclear weapons by one of these nations is likely to generate similar actions by others the region has suffered from major wars every few years the introduction of nuclear weapons into these wars could threaten millions of deaths in the region the destruction of the petroleum transportation facilities through which 40 percent of the western worlds oil must pass and the threat of annihilation of much of the worlds population through fallout or the provocation of wider nuclear conflict even the fear that one of these nations was attempting to acquire nuclear weapons could lead to armed conflict the iraqi nuclear program already has been the subject of assassinations and an air attack with conventional munitions of these five countries three of their governments came to power through internal military takeovers nuclear weapons in such internally unstable countries may not remain in the hands of the national governments subnational forces attempting a takeover are likely to try to seize the nuclear weapons sooner or later nuclear weapons or the material for their manufacture may fall into the hands of smaller military units or terrorists groups the middle east and south asia is the most dangerous region for nuclear proliferation in the near future but the capability to manufacture nuclear weapons reportedly has been sought by south africa south korea taiwan argentina and brazil and this is only the situation is the early 1980s the acquisition of nuclear weapons by one country is likely to lead to a chain reaction in which the enemies or rivals of that country then feel that they must acquire nuclear weapons some politicians in nigeria for example have already called for a nigerian weapons program aimed at the possibility that south africa will acquire nuclear weapons the same applies for syria visavis iraq proliferation need not stop with the acquisition of a few bombs of the type used by the united states against japan at the end of world war iiweapons that in the context of a small nuclear war could cause millions of deaths the next stop can be thermonuclear weaponsraising the death toll to tens of million of people or more or the next step may be long range delivery vehicles spreading the threat of nuclear destruction to nations far removed from the regional conflict in short proliferation is a major international security threat and it will certainly get worse if we do not take the lead with the other nuclear weapons powers to stop it for these reasons american policy has long featured a strong consensus opposed to the proliferation of nuclear weapons the reagan administration however is striving to undermine the good bipartisan unitedstates example set by previous presidents not only is mr reagan indifferent to the proliferation risks posed by civilian nuclear technology he has graphically illustrated that indifference by considering the use to make nuclear weapons of plutonium derived from spent fuel produced in civilian nuclear powerplants even worse he is considering for the first time in our history the export of sensitive reprocessing and enrichment technologies to nonnuclear weapons countries such exports would have tragic consequences and must not be permitted i intend soon to propose legislation to block mr reagans thoughtless move the united states simply must exercise its strongest leadership with its allies to prevent nuclear profits from overcoming the restraint necessary for nuclearage survival thankfully there are americans who are seeking to correct these irrational policies and to change our course away from nuclear devastation they recognize that nuclear war is not winable as this administration has claimed and they realize the danger in spending hundreds of billions of h 1262 co dollars on a massive nuclear weapons buildup without incorporating arms control and proliferation prevention into our national security policies i commend those who are resisting these senseless administration initiatives and i pledge my efforts to do all i can to see that congress

house joint reso lution 220 proclaiming raoul wallenberg to be an honorary citizen of the united states and requesting the president to ascertain from the soviet union the whereabouts of raoul wallenberg and to secure his return to freedom raoul wallenbergs extraordinary record of saving the lives of countless thousands of jews during the holocaust at great personal risk and sacrifice amply justifies this nation conferringupon him its highest honor by proclaiming him an honorary citizen of the united states mr wallenberg undertook his perilous mission at the behest of the united states and the american war ref ugee board the passage of house joint resolution 220 will represent a ringing affirmation of americas commitment to the survival of the jewish people and our tremendous esteem for someone who risked his own life to try to save so many jewish lives from nazi extermination a number of bills have been introduced over the years to confer honorary citizenship on various persons but the only successful effort to date related to sir winston churchill the conferral of honorary citizenship on raoul wallenberg however will not establish a precedent for similar action on behalf of a number of other heroic figures the fact that our action today will not serve as such a precedent is clear for a number of reasons raoul wallenbergs valiant efforts to save thousands of jews from the holocaust provide an appropriate basis for distinguishing this bill from bills introduced on behalf of others conferral of honorary citizenship on wallenberg unlike any other honorary citizenship bill congress has considered heretofore will symbolize our commitment as a nation to remember the holocaust and vigilantly guard against the possibility of any recurrence congressman lan~os who introduced this joint resolution testified before the subcommittee on immigration refugees and international law thatwe need to establish a clear record for posterity that america through wallenberg did act to prevent the holocaust in its final days during the subcommittee hearings i requested congressman lirrros to develop this idea further and place mr wallenbergs actions in the context of other actions or even inaction by the united states to prevent the holocaust congressman lairros answer i believe should be brought to the attention of the house and for that reason i will quote from it at some length it is important to underscore that wallenberg was not a diplomat wallenberg was a young man living in the comfort and safety and affluence of neutral stockholm during the brutal closing days of world war 11 he left behind a most promising career as the son of swedens most prominent family the safety the security the comfort of stockholm to voluntarily assume the task of saving human lives so raoul wallenberg did not think of this mission himself this was not an activity that stemmed from his own plans it was a mission that he tundertook at the specific request of the secretary of state of the united states the united states thtrefoe bears a very heavy responsibility for the untold numbers of years that this young swede spent under the nightmarish conditions of the gulag archipelago whether he died earlier or whether he is alive today it is we the united states who are responsible for his tragedy and for his lost life a great deal of criticism has emerged over the course of years concerning the failure of the western powers to act in decisive ways to stop the slaughter questions such as why werent the railroads bombed why wasnt there an attempt to liberate the camps earlier here is a tangible demonstration that the united states officially acted and successfully acted to save approximately 100 000 people our record for world war ii is a better record because of the actions of raoul wallenberg undertaken at our own behest honorary citizenship is singularly appropriate in the wallenberg case not only because of the place the holocaust occupies in the history of human depravity and our national commitment to the survival of the jewish people the fact that wallenberg acted at the behest of the united states and suffered untold misery as a result of it establishes our interest as a nation in giving this special recognition to him the soviet union in addition never satisfactorily has accounted for what happened to mr wallenberg the conferral of honorary citizenship on him may give the united states added leverage with the soviet union in determining whether he is still alive and possibly in securing his release honorary citizenship is exactly what its designation impliesnamely an honor that does not confer on either mr wallenberg or any members of his family any rights or privileges under the immigration and nationality act the concept of honorary citizenship must be distingished clearly from citizenship itself no member of mr wallenbergs family as a result of our action today can possibly claim any derivative rights under our laws even mr wallenberg himself will not be recognized as an american citizen under united states domestic law or under international law if he is found to be still alive conferral of honorary citizenship in no way can be described as giving away anything tangible the meaning and significance of our action today is entirely symbolicbut it is a critically important symbolic gesture in an age when many nations treat human life so cavalierly a few of the statements in the legislative record underscore the critical significance of the step we are about to take today secretary of state alexander m haig jr said that mr wallenbergs contribution during the dark days or world war ii in hungary stands out as a beacon to all those who respect human rights and dignity he expressed his full support for this legislation assistant secretary of state richard fairbanks informed the judiciary committee thatthe conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would serve to underscore the seriousness with which the american government and people view sovietbehavior in the wallenberg case conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would also serve to reaffirm to the government of sweden that the united states firmly supports the quest to resolve wallenbergs fate former secretary of state edmund muskie informed two subcommittees of the house committee on foreign affairs that the chronological record of state department and war refugee cables and conmnunications 0 documents the unitedstates governments position of responsibility for the selection of wallenberg the directive and funding for his activities the appreciation for his work and the deep distress over his disappearance mr muskie concluded that its isthe uniqueness the extraordinary link between a man raoul wallenberg and our nations conscience that makes this action appropriate mr muskie went on to say raoul wallenbergs mission on behalf of the united states behind nazi lines in world war ii was without precedent what hie accomplished on our behalf risking his own life to save the lives of tens of thousands of people is unparalleled in our history the cost to him the years of his life can never be repaid the action of bestowing honorary citizenship on wallenberg undertaken by the congress of the united states will recognize his humanitarian sacrifice under our direction this is an important part of american history this adoption of raoul wallenberg as our own citizen makes clear to our posterity that the american government did act to save lives threatened by the holocaust i can add nothing further to the eloquent statements submitted by numerous witnesses before subcommittees of both the committee on foreign affairs and the committee on the

where you are going to fight and over and over again we have been told that you can preposition everything that we cannot carry on the 747 the c17 argument calculates that you can figure on building a cheaper airplane on time and on schedule let me suggest that there are three lessons from the falkland islands that shatter both the c17 and the boeing 747 argument first you want to win early and with as much force as possible you want to win decisively that means you want to deliver combat loaded equipment that rolls off and goes into battle you do not want to pull up and start assembling second you cannot be sure where trouble is coming no one in britain expected a war in the south atlantic no one in the united states can predict where we ought to prestock equipment and i dare say when you talk about cost if the 747 advocates would count in the cost of all the equipment they intend to prestock in all the places we have interests they would find their costs 10 or 20 times greater than the c5 third ultimately you fight with what you have when the battla starts the fact is that paper airplanes do not help you at all in this context let us look at our choices the c17 is a paper airplane every promise that has been made about delivery dates and cost of the c17 is just that a promise in fact every person who is concerned about bringing the pentagon under control should know full well that buying a paper airplane wit a paper date is a very dangerous game to start you know full well we will not get the c17 on time or on budgetit is pure paper july 2l 1982 then there is the boeing 747 offer the fact is that if the airline industry were not cutting orders boeing would be too busy selling what it has done best recently which is commercial airliners and commercial freight haulers to be dealing with the business it does not do particularly well which is landing near a battlefield to deliver combat equipment candidly the boeing 747 is a sad joke as a military aircraft it cannot land on short runways it cannot handle outsized cargo it cannot unload itself now the advocates in this debate tell us that we can pack outsized equipment in the c5 and everything

interim legal framework under which they can proceed with their preparations for mining the seabed at the came time we have produced a bill that is supportive of our governments efforts to achieve a comprehensive law of the sea treaty and we have handled the timing of the legislation so as to minimize any adverse impact on the law of the sea conference in a true spirit of compromise the committee of lurisdiction have reeonciled all the differences among the varous versions of the bill which is what enables us to bring this bill before the house under suspension of the rules i think this is a remarkable achievement for which the members are to be congratulated i particularly commend the chairman of the merchant marine committee and his staff for their hard work and their constructive and cooperative attitude on this bill without their efforts we could not have produced this result this soon since it is at my suggestion that the floor manager is bringing this bill up under suspension of the rules i would like to comment on my reasons for suggesting that procedure at first glance this bill might seem too important and complex for that procedure however a similar bill passed the house in the last congress by a vote of 312 to 80 the changes that were made in the bill in this congress were carefully considered and agreed to by four different committees obviously no member is entirely satisfled with the bill but i am aware of no opposition on any of the four committees to passage of the bill in its current form in fact there is agreement among all the committees the administration and the mining industry that the earliest possible passage of the bill is imperative in view of the fact that the bill is both urgent and noncontroversial and in view of the crowded floor calendar i think the suspension procedure is appropriate the committee on foreign affairs has been involved with seabed mining legislation since it was first reported out of the merchant marine and interior committees in 1977 since that time the objective of the foreign affairs committee has remained the same to fashion a bill that would support and contribute to the achievement of this nations overriding interest in successfully concluding a law of the sea treaty while at the same time protecting the interests of our seabed mining industry this objective has required our attention to both the timing and the substance of the bill and in dealing with both timing and substance we have had to recognize the opinion of most countries of the worldeven though we may not agree with that opinionthat the united states does not have the right under international law to mine the seabed outside the context of a treaty premature enactment of legislation or enactment of legislation without certain necessary provisions could have scuttled the tre ty i join in bringing this bill to the floor at this time wit h the sincere intent and belief that it poses no threat to the negotiations or to those countries that do not have seabed mining capabilities several provisions of the bill are important in that regard first under the bill commercial mining of seabed nodules is prohibited before january 1 1988 this provision is intended to provide a reasonable period of time to bring a treaty into force before seabed mining begins second this is explicitly interim legislation on its own terms it will be superseded by a law of the sea treaty so that unitedstates seabed mining operations will be conducted under the terms of the treaty third while the bill states the intent of congress that the rights of us mining companies be protected in any treaty there is no statement as there was in earlier versions of the bill that the terms of the treaty should necessarily conform to the terms of the legislation finally should a treaty not be in force by january 1 1988 the bill provides that some of the proceeds of any seabed mining that may commence after that date must be deposited in a revenuesharing fund for future sharing with the international community under the terms of a treaty i want to say a few words about the socalled grandfather language in title 2 of the bill section 201 states that a law of the sea treaty should provide unitedstates mining companies assured and nondiscriminatory access under reasonable terms and conditions and security of tenure and that the attainment of these goals should be determined by the totality of the provisions of the treaty rather than by any one article or provision this section recognizes that a treaty negotiated by 150 countries with widely divergent interests cannot be expected to provide terms and conditions as favorable as unitedstates legislation drawn specifically to promote the development of our seabed mining industry the administration has testified many times and this section recognizes that a treaty will provide for additional financial obligations and other new requirements not contained in this legislation such as the transfer of technology on fair and reasonable terms and conditions it is our intent that section 201 does not exclude such treaty provisions section 201 simply states the realistic expectation that these and any other treaty provisions taken together must not impose significant new economic burdens that have the effect of preventing the continuation of mining operations on a viable economic basis i have said that no member is totally satisfied with this bill i would be remiss if i did not mention that i am deeply concerned about the implications of the unitedstates flag requirements in the bill the mining consortia are multinational in character and i do not understand how only one of the countries particiiating in a consortium can expect to reserve for itself the lions share of the shipping business associated with seabed mining foreign governments have expressed their opposition to these provisions in very strong terms in recognition that i would not have the votes i did not press for a procedure which would have permitted me to offer an amendment to delete or soften these provisions although i would have preferred to do so i can only express my hope that these provisions do not lead to the breakup of the consortia on the other hand i am gratified we were able to include sufficiently flexible provisions in the compromise bill with regard to the location of processing plants the successful conclusion of a law of the sea treaty is important to the national security of the united states when the united states entered these negotiations several years ago our principal objective was to secure provisions that would preserve the freedom of maritime movement necessary for unitedstates air and naval mobility and the projection of our national power as events in iran and afghanistan demonstrate this objective has never been mire important it is achieved in the current treaty text it is my sincere hope that our delegation to the law of the sea conference will be able to achieve a treaty that meets our interests in other areas as well that the senate will ratify such a treaty and that our mining industry will support such ratification ambassador richardson has written an article for foreign affairs examining the national security implications of a law of the sea treaty which i include at the end of my

1930 and the crash of the stock and equity values forecasting the drop in world trade and the contraction of the economy which followed my friend the gentleman from california is doing the house a great service indeed he is doing the people of the country a great service by bringing this to their attention i want to remind my colleague that the bill was signed in 1930 but its most important provisions were passed in october of 1929 indeed they passed at the very same time that the market crashed there are people and i am one of them who believe that the drop in equity value preceding the drop in trade was a response to the tremendous increase in tariffs not only on agriculture but on manufacturing is it any coincidence that the stock market has dropped 30 points only yesterday and today i would say parenthetically that when the congress passed the smoothawley tariff act almost every reputable economist every finance minister in the world begged president hoover not to sign the bill and when he said he might not sign it the stock market recovered about 80 percent of its value from october of 1929 and that crash on into june of 1930 and then hoover signed it and the stock market crash of june 1930 was almost as great as the stock market crash of within weeks i would say to my friend the gentleman from california every single nation in europe raised its tariffs to match the tariffs of the united states and the world contraction resulted we went into a terrible deficit taxes were raised by president hoover and the congress monetary policy tightened in response to the money panic and we went into the terrible depression why do i bring it up to demonstrate by history that this is not a jobs bill this is going to destroy jobs it is not easy for me to speak on this issue but i think it is important that we establish some legislative history here because it is going to como back in the next congress i represent an auto town a steel town buffalo n y we have high unemployment my heart goes out to the people who have had their lives and their families and their economic for tunes dislocated by the terrible economic consequences of high interest rates high

the problems which face our nation there are few which surpass the flow of illegal immigrants into our country although there has been much discussion about new methods to impede the flow of illegals into the country there has been a relatively small amount of discussion on the equally important issue of how to reform and expedite the processes of exclusion and deportation of those aliens who have already set foot on our soil today i am introducing the immigration court and procedure reform act of 1982 which is a bill designed to expedite exclusion deportation and political asylum cases while enhancing due process for aliens and providing a judicial forum for these matters i am pleased to report that all of my colleagues from my home state of florida from both political parties have joined with me as original cosponsors of this bill the act establishes under article i of the constitution a court of record known as the unitedstates immigration court with a trial division composed of 50 judges and an appellate division composed 7 judges all of whom are to be appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the senate for terms of office of 15 years the trial division of the court is given exclusive jurisdiction of deportation exclusion and rescission of adjustment of status cases under the immigration and nationality act the appellate division has exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine appeals from final decisions of the trial division and certain final adjudicatory decisions of the immigration and naturalization service as well as final decisions of asylum officers who are established in a separate provision of the act to determine claims for political asylum an asylum officer will be an immigration officer designated by the attorney general to carry out this specialized task in order to get the other federal courts out of their involvement and streamline the process of deportation exclusion and political asylum provision is made in this bill giving the immigration court exclusive jurisdiction for habeas corpus and other extraordinary writs and for all injunctive and declaratory relief with respect to deportation exclusion asylum or any other matter concerning the status of an alien or his detention under this bill with the exception of the supreme court no federal court outside of the immigration court will any longer be able to be brought into these matters the most common tactic for delay will be eliminated the current procedures for dealing with matters of exclusion and deportation and political asylum area a hodgepodge of statutory and regulatory devices which have failed miserably under pressure of the everincreasing volume of such cases in recent years and the intervention of unitedstates district courts it is common knowledge that in the last few years we have had thousands upon thousands of aliens entering our country without obtaining passports or visas or other documentation permitting them entry under color of law most of these people come from economically oppressed countries and many have come from countries which are politically oppressive as well the orderly process of immigration set up under the immigration and nationality act has long since broken down and nowhere has the breakdown been more evident than in the handling of deportation exclusion and political asylum matters once an undocumented alien has crossed into this country he is subject to deportation if on the other hand such an undocumented alien is apprehended at a border or port of entry or coming off a plane he is subject to an exclusion process in either case the alien may seek political asylum in this country under the refugee relief act of 1980 and the united nations convention relating to the status of refugees by claiming that he is in danget of political or religious persecution if march 1 1982 co he is returned to the country from which he came determinations in such matters are made by the attorney generalor his designees or statutorily created immigration a id special inquiry officers who are employees of the immigration and naturalization service under the department of justice under varying circumstances there is the involvement of the state department and federal district courts the process is so intertwined and complex that an alien or his attorney with a little imagination can easily make a mockery of the system and delay the process for years if these matters were only an occasional occurrence the problem would not be nearly so grave however the magnitude of the problem can be easily seen by examining state department statistics which show that in 1971 state was requested by the immigration service to give its views on political asylum claims on 441 occasions compared to 1 616 requests in 1977 over 15 000 requests in 1980 and well in excess of 20 000 in 1981 these figures are even more startling in light of the fact that the state department is not required to give its view in all politial asylum cases and the immigration service says that it has not begun to scratch the surface of the number of claims lying in wait when it has the manpower and mechanisms in place to begin rounding up the thousands of aliens who are known to be here illegally but who are not detained or in the active pipeline for being removed from the country another example of the gravity of this matter can be found by looking at the exclusion process involving the haitians in my home state of florida last summer at one point in miami from june 1 1981 to june 4 1981 a total of 140 exclusion cases were heard by two special inquiry officers of the immigration and naturalization service of this number 96 received final orders to be removed from the country but only 11 were actually returned to haiti lawyers had successfully gotten a court injunction from a federal district court on the basis of alleged irregularities in the process a massive effort at exclusion proceedings is now underway again in miaml to clear the famed krome detention center and we can only hope that the extraordinary steps taken to get all the parties working together including the federal district court will make this effort successful where the other earlier one failed not only must we be concerned about the processing of those undocumented aliens already in this country but unfortunately as was so ably pointed out during the unveiling of the caribbean basin plan last week we must be prepared for the possibility of waves of refugees from numerous countries in central

favorable impact were the plant to be opened unfortunately we are in the position now that our lant in pennsylvania is running at only between 40 and 60 percent of capacity our management has in effect put the sterling heights facility in mothballs because obviously if we cannot run one plant at capacity we certainly cannot look to another we do not see the demand for our product in the next year or so such that would justify pressing on with the sterling heights facility now that is the problem that we have in spite of the legislation that is proposed here the very companies that would like to locate in this country for their production are not very optimistic if this legislation is passed without some modification nissan has made a similar investment to that of honda in their light truck factory in tennessee but in their testimony nissan seriously doubted whether it would have made the investment if local content laws has been on the books that would have meant a loss or will mean a loss of 2 600 jobs in tennessee now that is the reason we ought to at least make an effort to amend this bill it may become law but probably will not become law in this session but this will be a precedent certainly for what we will do in the future if this issue is addressed in the next congress we certainly ought to try to address the problem that the content requirements now in the bill

that there is going to have to be some adjustment for companies that first build a plant for one car and one model rather than a plant for their full model line they build a plant for one model and if they cannot make that go they will never build that second plant for the other model lines and that is what we are trying to address in this amendment i urge my colleagues not simply because they are
