americans that is to say americans of middleincome for the clinton health care bill and for the clinton health care bill in its legislative form in the other body where it is the clintonmitchell bill and in the house where it is the clintongephardt bill the same phenomenon occurred last year during consideration of the clinton tax bill during the 1992 campaign as a candidate he talked about middleclass tax cut but in fact we know how quickly that evaporated once we got down to brass tacks instead this congress pushed through the biggest tax increase in american history one that directly impacted the middle class for example seniors receiving social security making 14 000 got a 70percent effective rate increase on their social security benefits that is how much their income taxes went up on social security benefits that recordbreaking tax increase passed by the congress will pale in comparison to the clintongephardt bill that we are likely to take on here in the house although it is difficult for us to talk about it as members of congress because while we have looked at the press releases and press statements about the bill we are still waiting we are still waiting for a bill even though we are just days away from adjournment and the congress hopes to act on health care before we adjourn but we do not have a bill the congressional budget office has not been able to give us an estimate of how much precisely in the way of new taxes the bill contains and precisely how much in the way of new spending the bill contains we simply have not read it this is more than a trivial point health care comprises oneseventh of our nations economy it is also on a more personal level a matter of life and death for every american one would think that a new health care plan prescribed by the federal government for the whole country would therefore be the most carefully studied document since the constitution but instead when as and if this congress and house get around to seeing and voting on a bill we are going to find that members have not had a chance to read it that in fact when we vote members will know more about o j simpsons blood type than they will about the content of our own health care legislation but we operate necessarily in an environment of uncertainty we do not have a bill but we must debate what it is we anticipate because after all the vote will be upon us and that will be it and we will have an election we must adjourn at some point and that point is arriving rather quickly why are people skeptical of what they have been seeing the heritage foundation did an analysis of the clintongephardt bill as it was released what they found is that the ew taxes and there are many of them in the clintongephardt bill would amount to 42 6 billion in the first full effective year of the plan in 1999 on top of the current costs on the system people who are saying these new taxes are only going to displace existing health care costs or somehow limit the growth of health care costs must face this fact 42 6 billion in new taxes will be imposed by the clintongephardt health care bill on top of our current estimates for how much the existing system is going to cost now the average additional tax burden per individual as a result of the clintongephardt bill according to the heritage foundation is 430 per individual on average the clintongephardt bill unquestionably is going to offer americans less choice it does not quite do justice to the fact to say less almost none compared to what presently an insured american has available congress and the federal government are going to prescribe a standard health care plan and that is going to be the norm for the country like it or not if your existing plan is different than the standard plan if you continue to get those benefits you will pay a tax not only will you pay a tax but your employer will pay a tax the new taxes imposed by the clintongephardt bill are going to be split 80 percent by the employer and 20 percent by the individual so 20 percent of these new taxes will come directly out of the paycheck of the american worker there will be far more bureaucracy in this plan because for a substantial part it is going to rely upon something called medicare part c medicare part c is in effect a governmentrun insurance plan that will extend together with the existing medicare program to over half the entire population or to about half the entire population according to our best estimates half of the american people at that point will be getting their health care from a government plan as compared to the current system the more americans learn it seems the more likely they are to realize that instead of providing americans with greater health security the clinton gephardt plan clinton mitchell plan over in the other body and whatever congressional cousins are aboard or are just now being written in so many different staff offices will create greater uncertainty especially for middleincome americans middleincome americans will pay more in both taxes and health care premiums for less in both taxes and health care premiums for less in both quantity availability of health care and the quality of that care why will they be paying more in premiums we discussed why they pay more in taxes under the clinton gephardt bill why pay more in premiums because of the community rating system that is where factors like age cannot be taken into account senior citizens incur about 4 timeson average in the way of health care costs as younger working americans if you are under 45 years old you will have a steep increase in your health care premiums under a community rating system so for all americans under 45 years old the clinton gephardt plan the clinton gephardt health care plan is going to represent a big increase in premiums on top of the payroll tax increase it is not surprising then that the strategy of the democrat leadership is to in the words of senator rockfeller pass health care regardless of the views of the american people i would hope we would not handle it that way i do hope instead of a legislative version of blindmans bluff we will get at least 30 days

very very important subject as we enter into the debate on a social issue that will impact the lives of every american every man woman and child in this country what could be more important than taking time to discuss the pros and cons i was delighted as i am sure my colleagues were today to see that the bipartisan negotiations that have been going on for weeks now many many hours in length were rewarded were fruitful in coming out and announcing today a bipartisan health care proposal so we really have a debate now we have a clintongephardt we have a clintonmitchell bill and we have a health care reform bill with bipartisan support that deals with the health care crisis in this country from the standpoint of private sector reforms to expand coverage to more americans than ever before and to begin to control the spiraling costs in health care i think there are a number of things out there in the public sector right now to assist us as we look at this health care debate one of the books recently published written by dr jane orient she is an internist in tucson arizona and she heads the association of american physicians and surgeons with over 4 000 members nationwide the title of her book is a very timely book indeed your doctor is not in i think she provides us some important insights let me share a few of them she says first of all the proposed remedies for the health care crisis are snake oil and you shouldnt swallow them further the private doctor is an endangered species in the end we will have a herd a nice placid socialized tamed cudchewing herd readers should care about the plight of doctors for one and only one reasons some day they might need one you may think you know what the hippocratic oath says but you probably dont and you should learn about it before they do away with it entirely the hippocratic oath is built on physician autonomy it reads i will prescribe regimen for the good of my patients according to my ability and my judgment eurther do you want your doctor to place society or the department of health and human services ahead of his being independent she says further managed care is about preventing medical care in order to make money for thirdparty payers or to save money for the government behind the slick advertising managed care is little more than prepayment for rationed health care rationed care is one of the most disastrous things that can ever happen to the health care practice in this country then i conclude with her insight there is no utopia i will only maintain that a free market in medicine is the best of the avallfble alternatives and the one that does the least harm that is what doctors do the least harm that is what the hippocratic oath says the way we do the least harm although it is not perfect is to maintain a free market in the health care system another recent book a novel published entitled fatal cure by robin cook a bestselling novelist he as a physician as a doctor imagines what will happen to the health care service industry in this country should we resort should we go in these coming weeks to governmentrun health care system i only share with the listeners this evening and with my colleagues a couple of paragraphs of the dialog that he imagines might take place some day he says everyone knows that doctor patient relationships are the cornerstone of medical care one of the characters says maybe thats passe the current reality is determined by a new army of medical bureaucrats being created by government intervention all of a sudden economics and politics have reached the ascendancy in the medical arena i am afraid the major concern is the bottom line on the balance sheet not patient care the problem is washington every time the government gets seriously involved in medical care they seem to screw things up they try to please everybody and end up pleasing no one dr cook is absolutely right that would be the result of governmentrun health care in the washington post not exactly an advocate of freeenterprise health care certainly one that has espoused the governmentrun health care in its editorial policies dana priest in a frontpage story entitled health bill may have no substitute for bureaucracy he writes just recently president clinton and members of congress last week hailed the senate democratic leaderships health bill as a vast improvement over the bureaucracyladen 1 462page plan produced by the white house but the 1 410page bill proposed by senate majority leader george j mrrchell dmaine also would create dozens of new federal and state agencies they would have untested authority to centralize reorganize monitor and enforce the way medical care is bought sold and to a lesser extent practiced in this country and indeed the post is right they would have untested authority to centralize reorganize monitor and enforce i understand that the clintonmitchell bill in the senate has over 20 new federal bureaucracies that will be created now before i yield back to the gentleman i want to share a letteri am from the state of arkansas i have served 8 years in the arkansas legislature with nowpresident clinton our president was then my governor our chief executive in the state of arkansas many times during those 12 years that he was our governor the issue of abortion and more specifically the issue of public funding of abortion arose in various debates in arkansas as it has been throughout our country a major issue and it continues to be a major bone of contention and a major issue in the health care debate in every major governmentrun health care plan that has been presented to this congress the provision for reproductive services or abortion services if you will has been included that means that every american under a governmentrun health care system would be subsidizing the practice of abortion regardless of what their moral conscience or religious convictions would be september 26 1986 governor clinton then governor wrote in a letter to the arkansas righttolife people a letter in which he said in part because many of the questions do concern the issue of abortion i would like for your members to be informed of my position on the states responsibility in that area i am opposed to abortion and to government funding of abortions we should not spend state funds on abortions because so many people believe abortion is wrong that was governor clinton who is now president of the united states saying he not only opposed abortion but he opposed public funding of abortion and believed it was wrong to require people who believe it is wrong to pay for abortions and yet today he has included that insisted on including that in every governmentrun health care program that he has advocated and supported then i would concludeand i am indebted to our colleague from the other side of the aisle the gentleman from minnesota tim penny democrat for his dear colleague letter in which he points out something that i think is vital in this debate in the coming weeks he points out that major votes of the 20th century on large social policy changes have always been accorded overwhelming bipartisan support he enumerates some of those the social security act of 1935 96 percent of the democrats supported that 81 percent of the republicans supported that and it passed by a vote of 372 to 33 the development of the interstate highway system federalaid highway act of 1956 major policy change in our country 93 percent of the democrats supported it 98 percent of the republicans supported it passed by a vote of 388 to now the civil rights act of 1964 what more significant social change has this congress enacted than the civil rights act of 1964 sixtyone percent of the democrats supported the civil rights bill 80 percent of the republicans supported the civil rights act and it passed by a vote of 290 to i could go on the clean air act the medicare act the water pollution act all of these passed by overwhelming bipartisan majorities here we are told that we must in the coming weeks have a health care reform bill that is going to affect the lives of every american the biggest social change in 50years and we are going to do it with the barest of majorities it is going to be forced through in spite of overwhelming opposition not only by the republican party but the polls indicate by the american people when the buscapade came to town i saw the big banners on the side saying pass it now and i said to myself pass what now at that point we did not even have a bill no one had read a bill yet they say we have got to hurry it through we have got to do it now yet the polls say 65 percent of the american people say they want to wait they want to read it want to study it want to react to it and that is the way major social change ought to take place it ought to take place with the american people aware of it the american people supportive of it and with a large bipartisan majority supporting it in congress we do not have that and that is~why we ought to wait on health care reform i thank the gentleman"]], "top_incorrect":

no vital american interests are at stake that require any longterm american troop peacekeeping presence there are practical limits to what the humanitarian intervention can accomplish in somalia and
