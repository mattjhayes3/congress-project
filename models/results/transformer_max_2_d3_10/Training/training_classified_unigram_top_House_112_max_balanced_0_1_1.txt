coverage and promoting education but this budget signals that the republicans do not in fact this budget seems designed to have devastating effects on american families and businesses and would dramatically damage our nations improving economy this legislation makes significant cuts to social programs and investments in education destroys american jobs and represents the latest in a series of republican attacks on medicare although our economy is recovering from years of misguided policies many americans are still struggling to make ends meet gas prices have skyrocketed in recent months quality health care and education are becoming more expensive for the average american families are fighting to save their homes from foreclosure and escape from under mountains of debt instead of focusing on these important issues mr ryan and the tea party have developed a budget that dramatically undermines the social safety net that so many americans depend on i believe that budgets are reflections of our valuesand it is clear from this proposal that mr ryan and the tea party do not possess the same values as ordinary americans by turning medicare into a voucher program this budget would effectively end medicare as we know it and shift thousands of dollars of health costs onto seniors but gutting medicare is not enough for the republicans the ryan budget would also cut more than 1 trillion from medicaid and endanger health care coverage for over 60 million americans including lowincome children pregnant women nursing home patients and persons with disabilities this budget also demonstrates the republicans lack of commitment to investing in americas youth by proposing to cut funding for education by 45 percent it is clear that the republicans do not understand the importance of investing in education and in science technology engineering and math in particular to ensure our nations competitiveness in the global economy at a time when states are drastically reducing their education budgetsincluding my home state which recently cut funding for education by 5 billionthe republicans budget attacks critical initiatives ranging from extra reading and math help for lowincome students to muchneeded financial aid for college if mr ryan and the tea party get their way in 2014 nearly 10 million students would see their pell grants fall by more than 1 000 dollars and 200 000 children and their families would no longer be able to participate in head start in my 16 years proudly representing the people of my district this is by far the worst piece of legislation that i have seen mr ryan and the tea party have once again put forward a budget to benefit the wealthy and special interests groups at the expense of middleclass americans seniors veterans and children while this budget provides huge tax cuts for the richest one percent of americans it does nothing to stimulate the economy nor create jobs and would adversely impact the hispanic community and the residents of my district this budget yet again shows how out of touch the republican party is with the lives of ordinary americans instead of focusing on creating jobs and putting americans back to work it extends the bush tax cutswhich i voted against and continue to opposefor the wealthiest americans and provides millionaires and billionaires with an average tax cut of 150 000 to put this amount into perspective 150 000 would pay for one years worth of savings for a senior in the medicare prescription drug donut hole 600 one school computer lab 40 000 one year of medical care for a veteran returning home 8 945 one grant for medical research on chronic diseases 50 000 one tax credit to make a year of college more affordable 2 500 one firefighter police officer or first responder kept on the job 42 000 and one college student receiving the maximum pell grant 5 550 in todays economic climate we dont need more subsidies for big oil and bigger tax loopholes for hedge fund managers on wall street yet the republicans have put forward a budget that provides huge tax cuts and subsidies for the megarich and corporations while utterly failing to support vital investments in education job training research and development and our nations crumbling infrastructu re for these reasons i strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this ideological radical budget and

plan and its effects on americas seniors i believe that we must address our national deficit but i believe we can do it in a responsible manner that does not hinder our fragile economy and does not risk important programs i support the democratic budget proposal which makes practical cuts to reduce our nations deficit but without hurting americas seniors and sacrificing their health and financial security the republican plan is irresponsible it would hurt americas seniors while giving enormous tax breaks to the top 2 percent of the wealthiest americans it does nothing to create jobs but gives billions in corporate loopholes and subsidies to big oil most notably the republican plan would literally end medicare and while this may be a new plan these are not new ideas the republicans 2012 budget attempts to do to medicare what president bush wanted to do to social security in 2005privatize it and severely cut benefits can you imagine if we had privatized social security in 2005 the way the republicans wanted to do just before the biggest financial collapse since the great depression is that what we really want to do with medicare we cannot afford to have wall street control the fate of our seniors the republican plan would convert medicare into a voucher program that forces seniors to buy costly private insurance plans it asks seniors half of whom have less than 19 000 a year in total income to pay more and get less if this plan were put in place the nonpartisan congressional budget office has estimated that the average senior would end up paying nearly three times more outofpocket expenses meanwhile the health care law enacted last year is already helping to close the gap in prescription drug coverage known as the doughnut hole and provides annual exams and preventive services but a repeal of the health care law as the republican budget plan calls for would eliminate these benefits these benefits for medicare patients are making a real difference in the lives of my constituents i recently heard from a 71yearold woman from sacramento who requires several expensive drugs to maintain her health in october of 2010 she was worried about her ability to pay for her medication because she fell into the coverage gap but she was relieved to learn that she would get 250 in 2010 and that 50 percent of her costs would be reimbursed this year and even more would be reimbursed in the future but now republicans want to pull the rug out from under our seniors and their families what is astonishing to me is that in addition to privatization of medicare the republican plan also goes after medicaid instead of making real reform to the medicaid program the republican budget calls for converting medicaid into a block grant program that would sharply reduce funding for seniors and lowincome americans on medicaid so that it would not keep up with health care costs medicaid helps keep our seniors in their homes and helps them afford nursing homes if they need them but the republican plan would leave seniors on their own and ignores the promise that our country has made from one generation to another the federal budget should reflect our american values that have been passed down for generations where seniors earn the benefits that they have paid into and have been promised and are able to enjoy their retirement after working hard in their careers that is why i will continue to fight to protect the dignity of americas seniors and protect them against the devastating effects of the republican budget

republican budget right now millions of american families and children are suffering from food insecurity as the map here clearly shows food hardship is a national tragedy it is present in each and every congressional district the districts that are highlighted in pink and in red have the most food hardships while the districts in yellow are not far behind districts highlighted in blue have the lowest food hardship but the national average is that nearly one in five americans struggles with food hardship simply put they are at risk of going hungry according to a study done by the center for budget policy and priorities the republican budget composed by chairman paul ryan and endorsed by presidential candidate mitt romney would impose extraordinary cuts in programs that serve as a lifeline for our nations poorest and our most vulnerable citizens not the least of these are americas critical antihunger initiatives like food stamps and the women infants and children or wic program all of which the ryan republican budget threatens to slash by as much as 19 percent that means for example that over 8 million men women and children could be cut from food stamps and 21 2 million pregnant and postpartum women infants and children may be slashed from the wic program the ryan budget slashes these antihunger initiatives while preserving subsidies for big oil tax breaks for the wealthiest americans it is a reverse robin hood budget that in the words of robert greenstein the head of the center on budget and policy priorities would likely produce the largest redistribution of income from the bottom to the top in modern unitedstates history and likely increase poverty and inequality more than any other budget in recent times and possibly in the nations history as many religious and ethical observers have noted this week the decisions made in this budget are antithetical to our basic moral values last friday 60 catholic leaders and theologians wrote a letter to chairman ryan arguing that his budget was morally indefensible and betrays catholic principles of solidarity just taxation and a commitment to the common good a budget that turns its back on the hungry the elderly and the sick while giving more tax breaks to the wealthiest few cant be justified in christian terms this ryan republican budget is particularly cruel when you consider the scale of need in the current economy where 13 million are unemployed and one in six are living below the official poverty line as another group of christian leaders the circle of protection has urged congress

that the senate passed yesterday so i rise to urge the house majority to bring to the floor the middle class tax cut that was passed in the senate yesterday let me just take a quote from the washington post yesterday the headline republicans want to raise taxes on the poor why the tax cut plan passed yesterday by the democrats in the senate and supported by the president would provide tax cuts to 98 percent of americans and 97 percent of small businesses in this country failure to pass this bill would mean 114 million middle class families would see their taxes increase including 1 4 million in my state of connecticut yet the house majority appears intent on holding these middle class tax cuts hostage to further tax cuts for the wealthiest people in this nation in fact the house majoritys reverse robin hood tax plan which failed in the senate yesterday would raise taxes on middle class and working faiilies in order to pay for even more breaks for the wealthiest americans the majoritys tax plan is unconscionable in order to pay for an over 160 000 tax break for millionaires it would allow tax cuts to expire for 13 million working families and raise taxes on the most vulnerable households in america the republican proposal would significantly weaken the child tax credit leaving nearly 9 million families to lose an average of 854 with a family with one fulltime minimum wage earner and two children seeing their credit drop far more drastically from 1 812 to 267 as a result the families of 2 million children would be pushed back into poverty in addition the republican proposal would weaken the earned income tax credit which supports lowincome working families this credit kept 8 3 million people out of poverty last year the proposal would also prevent millions of families from getting help to pay for college through the american opportunity tax credit and all to pay for more tax breaks for the wealthiest families in this country this tax plan reveals the true colors of this house majority they say they do not want to raise taxes on americans in this economy but their actions here speak louder than their rhetoric again a quote from an article yesterday in the new york times senate republicans will press this week to extend tax cuts for affluent families scheduled to expire january 1 but the same republican tax plan would allow a

yielding to tell him how proud he makes us all for his important work in constructing a democratic alternative to the republican budget that is mr van hollens budget proposal that is a statement of our national values that says to the american people what is important to you about the education health and wellbeing of our children the economic security of their families and the health security of our seniors those are important values to us and those values are reflected in the democratic alternative the republican ryan bill on the other hand i do not believe is a statement of our national values as to what is important to the american people as reflected in their budget priorities but you be the judge would it be a statement of your values if you had a budget that said to seniors were going to end the medicare guarantee and youre going to pay 6 000 or more while you get less in terms of benefits while at the same time were going to give an over 300 billion tax break to the wealthiest people in our country would that be a statement of your values this 6 000 more for seniors with fewer benefits 300 000 or more to the richest people in our country would it be a statement of your values for you my colleagues and the american people you represent if you had a budget that said to big oil were going to continue to subsidize you to the tune of tens of billions of dollars but at the same time were going to freeze pell grants were going to eliminate them for 400 000 young people and make them less available to over 9 million young people lower the benefits for some eliminate it for others and use the money to give tax subsidies to big oil big oil which is making tens of billions of dollars in record profits each year would it be a statement of your values if you said in your budget that all of those young people who are now children who have a preexisting medical conditionasthma diabetes birth defectany of those preexisting medical conditions under present law under the affordable care act they may not be discriminated against in obtaining health insurance but the republican budget says they should be because were going to eliminate that to the 2 5 million young people who are now on their parents policies until theyre 26 years old this budget says no to you too were eliminating that were too busy giving tax breaks to the richest people in america and while were at it with young people just graduating from college some of them may have student loans and in the house budgetthank you mr van hollenin the house budget we have a provision that says that come july 1 the interest on those loans will not double we have taken care of that under the circumstances the path were on the interest rates would go from 3 4 percent to 6 8 percent the house democratic budget says no to that doubling of interest the republican budget keeps it the same thats just to name a few things that i think may not be a statement of the values of the american people whether its interest paid on student loans availability of pell grants to young people ending the medicare guarantee and as the distinguished ranking member said right now today overturning the resources that were put in the affordable care act to reduce to narrow the doughnut hole maybe 5 million seniors have benefited to the tune of 3 2 billion already in the bill also there are preventative services there are annual wellness visits without a copay so were talking about kitchen table items for people where people are trying to make ends meet where people wonder about if their children will be able to go to college and if they do will they be able to have health insurance so that when they look for a job they can reach their aspirations without having their choices only narrowed by whether they have health insurance or not until the bill comes into full effect so there are just a couple of things that i would want people to know about this bill they are ends the medicare guarantee ends the medicare guarantee ends the medicare guarantee while making seniors pay more for less while giving over 300 billion in tax breaks to the wealthiest people in our country and by the way did i mention it its a job loser so i urge my colleagues to enthusiastically support the house democratic proposal which is a statement of our values and which our distinguished colleague will presenti dont know if its tonight or tomorrow morning i understand that it keeps changing the house democratic alternative invests in americas priorities creates jobs protects our seniors and our students strengthens the middle class democrats protect medicare republicans dismantle medicare the democratic plan asks the wealthiest to pay their fair share and put our fiscal house in order the republican plan gives them more than the tax break theyve had they almost double their tax break our democratic plan reflects the most enduring theme in america the american dream democrats want to reignite the american dream to build ladders of opportunity for all who want to work hard play by the rules and take responsibility it does this by investing in small businesses and entrepreneurialism in our country by strengthening the middle class in that regard we believe that our budget is a statement of our values we call upon our republican colleagues to work with us on a budget that reflects our values we must work together to protect and strengthen medicare we must put people back to work and build a broadly shaped prosperity for all americans we must make it in america to stop the erosion of our manufacturing base we must rebuild america putting people back to work we must do this with community involvement and all of these things strengthen the middle class

ends the medicare guarantee and makes seniors pay 6 000 or more for fewer benefits while it gives 300 000 in tax breaks to the wealthiest people in the united states and it costs us jobs to do so and

on the care of children and families you would see that under this bill no longer would being a woman be a preexisting medical condition as it is now as women are discriminated against in terms of price and access to insurance you would see that it offers tax credits to millions of small businesses who choose to do right by their employees and offer insurance benefits it was for all of these americans that we acted it is for them that we stand here today to oppose this amendment and if you read the bill you will see contrarycontrary to misrepresentations that were set forth by those who do the bidding of the health insurance industry in our country you would see what the bill does you would see that it is about innovation its about prevention its about a healthier america not just health care in america its about using the technologies of the future its about bringing health care closer to people where they live to lower the cost to improve the quality and to expand the access you would see that it is a bill about the future instead of the misrepresentations about this that and the other thing which i dont even want to repeat here you would see that this is transformative for our country because it gives people the liberty again to pursue their lives so i would like to know how many of you read the bill we read it over and over again to each other drilling down on different parts of it so we know of what we speak when we come to this floor and maybe if you knew more about it you wouldnt be so quick to saywe do not want to allow children to stay on their parents policies we do not want to end discrimination on the basis of preexisting conditions for our children we do not want to begin to close the doughnut hole we do not want to have preventive medicines without cost and copay for our seniors and the list goes on and on so thats whats happening here today this is again yet again another example of our friends standing up for the insurance companies at the expense of the american people standing up for the insurance companies at the expense of the health and wellbeing of our country it is again an example of washington d c holding on to the special interest status quo it is again this congress saying to the american people we are here for the special interest we are not here for the peoples interest to stacie we are not here for your two daughters for vernal we are not here for women and having being a woman being a preexisting condition to claudette and richard to say to them too bad about your mortgage if you cant pay your mortgage because you have to pay your medical bills so be it i urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment which is another manifestation of the so be it attitude of some in congress at the expense of many in our country"], [0.980119526386261, 0.980119526386261, 0, "i move to strike the last word the acting chair the gentleman from washington is recognized for 5 minutes"], [0.9759736657142639,
