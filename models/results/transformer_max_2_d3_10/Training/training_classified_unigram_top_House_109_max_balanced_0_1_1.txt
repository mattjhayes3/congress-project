fight a war in iraq but to do so at the expense of those americans suffering when more can be done to fight the war on cancer is simply not right im 36 years old and ive had cancer four times i have a two year old son i should be dead or should have earned a medal of honor neither are true yet im still here trying to help people as best i can by integrating eastern medicine into the western world i intend to get through this battle too and when i do it would be nice to know that someone out there is doing whatever he or she can to make sure i dont have to fight my own war yet again rather than

people died because they were poor and black and young and old and disabled the incompetence and the indifference demonstrated by this administration in responding to this tragedy was really quite shocking but it was not surprising for some of us however this is an america that we know very well it is an america that has often been swept under the rug by lawmakers and the media this is the america that many of us know and that is why the congressional black caucus and so many in this house fight each and every day against these obscene tax cuts for the wealthy and medicaid and housing and health care budget cuts this is the america that i know and this is why i have said over and over again that the war against iraq based on distortions and false information did not have to be fought we did not have to spend over 300 billion and deplete the resources that could have gone to domestic security economic security and taken care of our people right here at home each and every member of congress should be frightened to death seeing the lack of preparedness and the unacceptably slow and deadly response by our government people died who would not have died if our government had responded quickly and efficiently this is a crime each and every member of congress has had a glimpse of what could happen in their districts should a natural disaster or god forbid a terrorist attack occur in the future now americans have risen to the occasion and asked what they could do to help and after listening to a very disappointing briefing by cabinet members and however listening to members of congress from affected districts who in spite of the odds again have been responding around the clock to the survivors of this devastation in heroic ways i have a few thoughts that i

sensitive to and they should be of the diversity of the affected populations and understand the cultural background of those who have been traumatized and they should understand quite frankly that they just left a war zone and posttraumatic stress syndrome will be setting in and we must insist that the rebuilding process takes into account the populations who have been displaced developers should not just come in and create a city where no one can afford to return home there must be affordable housing and goodpaying jobs for those survivors of this devastation also we must ensure that survivors losses are not compounded by financial institutions credit card late fees and penalties and mortgages all of these issues must be addressed and we must make sure that our americans are

cosponsor of h con res 153 which welcomes his excellency hamid karzai the president of afghanistan on the occasion of his visit to the united states in may 2005 and expresses support for a strong and enduring strategic partnership between the united states and afghanistan as the cochair for the congressional afghan caucus along with my colleague chairman ney i am proud to welcome president karzai back to the united states i want to thank my colleague ms roslehtinen for introducing this appropriate concurrent resolution while there will be those who have the view that the war in afghanistan is over and we should shift our view the truth is that afghanistan is as vital to our nation now as it was shortly after september 11th operation enduring freedom was a success in removing the taliban leadership and giving the afghan people new hope however our work there is far from done we must ensure that afghanistan has a bright and productive future ahead of itself in which peace and prosperity will be possible we can not make the same mistake we made in afghanistan after the conclusion of the cold war the brave afghan warriors defeated the red army stopping them for completing another brutal assault upon an innocent nation however we rewarded their bravery by ignoring afghanistan and allowing it to be a place where extremists like the taliban and al qaeda could take refuge and indeed have sanctuary to build upon we can not allow ourselves to make that same mistake again we must show the afghan people that we stand with them even after our own short term interests have been fulfilled i have traveledto afghanistan on a couple different occasions and i have seen the faces of the afghan people and i know they are ready to embrace us if only we can really support them for the long term i want to applaud president karzai he is a man of courage and vision more than 10 5 million afghan men and women voted in national presidential elections in october 2004 again giving credence to the fact that they have embraced democratic reform the afghan people have chosen hamid karzai formerly the interim president for a fiveyear term as afghanistans first democraticallyelected president i congratulate president karzai for this victory his job has not been easy and surely there were few who would have been willing to assume the burden of leadership that he did his goals and aspirations will be for the long term health and security of afghanistan and to get to that point he needs and deserves the full support of our nation again let me welcome president karzai back to the united states i stand among many members who admire his will and resolve on behalf of his people his accomplishments despite all the obstacles are certainly praiseworthy and deserving of recognition from the united states congress let us all hope that this pattern of progress and success continues for president karzai and afghanistarn as we move forward"], [0.0007167160511016846,

assistance are very important louisiana is uniquely positioned in the ocs debate our state is one of the few that allows production off its coast we are also major consumers of this production through chemicals fertilizers and various other gasintensive manufacturing some quick facts for yo among the 50 states louisiana ranks first in crude oil production s6cond in natural gas production second in total energy production from all sources second in petroleum refining capacity second in primary petrochemical production third in industrial energy consumption third in natural gas consumption fifth in petroleum consumption eighth in total energy consumption we are a state that is a working state with a working coast our state is a vital part of the domestic energy production and consumption which keeps our entire economy humming as others refrain from similar production natural gas supplies tighten and the prices rise jeopardizing tens of thousands of wellpaying jobs that are being shipped overseas many of these from my own state and district the energy support louisiana and other coastal states provide for our nation is not without cost we are happy to provide what others would rather not however this supply also impacts our eoastal communities and wetlands conservation and we bear the costs of onshore infrastructure required to support this production activity every debate on ocs production should also include an equity discussion coastal producing states should receive a fair share of revenues off their coasts just as inland states receive from onshore production i appreciate the leadership mr peterson has taken on this issue and i respectfully oppose mr putnams intent to strike this language from the bill if you look off the coast in the next several years if not sooner between cuba and key west you will see the chinese and the cubans starting their venture to drill right off the coast of florida they may not be visible but they will be there gas and oil production offshore the technology that is there today is astounding i would invite every one of you that have never been on an offshore rig or seen the technology for drilling i invite you to come to
