for rare diseases like huntingtons disease myorclonus als lou qehrigs disease tourette syndrome and muscular dystrophy i hope all members will join me in supporting this important bill fifty years ago we could not have dreamed of the miraculous breakthroughs in medical care which have occurred as a result of the development of new drugs indeed we are fortunate to live in a country that has committed tremendous resources to pharmaceutical research and development in 1979 pharmaceutical companies spent approximately 1 2 billion on drug research and development in this country amid these successes though we must not overlook one of the most serious human tragedies of our time there are millions of americans who are affected by rare diseases or conditions but successful drugs to treat them commonly called orphan drugs have not been developed and are not expected to be developed the problem with orphan drugs is that because so few inidividuals are affected by any one rare disease the costs of developing a drug are greater than the relatively small revenues generated by it for example huntingtons disease affects only about 14 000 people myoclonus about 2 000 als about 9 000 tourette syndrome about 100000 and muscular dystrophys about 200 000 consequently the pharmaceutical company which develops a drug for a rare disease can reasonably expect to incur a financial loss under these circumstances many promising orphan drugs wil not be developed the orphan drug act will change this outlook it creates new financial incentives to develop orphan drugs it reduces the costs of orphan drug development by providing new flexibility in our drug approval process without compromising the safety or efficacy of the drugs and it assures better coordination of those government agencies like the national institutes of health which are involved in drug research and testing with this legislation we can be confident that a pharmaceutical company which discovers a promising orphan drug or uncoversan important research lead can and will pursue it until a new drug is available to the public the pharmaceutical manufacturers association and its member companies are also addressing this difficult issue through the creation of the commission on drugs for rate diseases as stated in the commissions charter it will serve as a clearinghouse to which academic and other scientific investigators or institutions can submit information on promising compounds or basic research leads for wide distribution to the drug industry and other interested parties the commission will perform the very useful function of giving independent noncompany investigators a forum to present the merits of their discoveries i am pleased the commission has begun this important work and believe the orphan drug act will serve the commission well in addition to giving pharmaceutical companies incentives to commit their own researchers to the creation of orphan drugs the act will also enable the companies to commit necessary resources in pursuit of the discoveries of independent scientists the orphan drug act and the commission will bring us new orphan drugs to combat rare diseases many members will recognize the orphan drug act as the successor bill to mr weiss h r 1663 which has 77 cosponsors it is through mr weiss leadership that the orphan drug problem has been presented to this congress i am pleased that mr weiss has joined me in sponsoring the orphan drug act rare diseases not only cause significant human suffering but they cost this country billions of dollars a year in treatment costs personal income lost due to illness and productivity lost by absence from work the orphan drug act will promote the development of orphan drugs to treat these diseases orphan dauo

has now been in prison for over 4 years for the crime of seeking to live in the state of israel he has been separated from his wife avital his mother and other members of his family the latest reports on shcharansky are especially alarming he is gravely ill and in fact may be near death how lbng can this unfair confinement continue i wish that there was some way of making the soviet government understand that the concern of this congress over shcharansky is no fleeting interest we shall not forget sheharansky we shall continue to speak out until this good and innocent man is free anyone who thinks that in time we shall forget shcharansky and leave him to his fate should recall the case of alfred dreyfus like shcharansky dreyfus was imprisoned after a kangaroo legal proceeding like shcharansky dreyfus protested his ininocence agitation for dreyfus release did not end despite the fact that dreyfus wvas chained to his cell on devils island the thunder of protest against dreyfus unfair imprisonment continued to roar until the day the innocent frenchman was finally exonerated a turning point in that case came when the great french writer emile zola pointed to the government of france and said i accuse today members of congress join as one to say that we accuse the soviet government of knowingly keeping an innocent man in prison we urge the soviet government to immediately effect the release of shcharansky and his reunification with his wife in israel the release of shcharansky would benefit not only the shcharansky family but also the cause of peaceful relations between our two countries mrs heckler the ordeal of anatoly shcharansky is one that carries great import for all of us who are appalled by the soviet governments systematic policy of rep ession against its own jewish comn i ty because anatoly shcharansky is one of the most visible of the soviet jewish refuseniks his imprisonment and criminal mistreatment represent not only a profound human tragedy but a blatant flouting by the soviet union of international opinion and concern anatoly shcharansky is indeed a symbol a man who has through his suffering and his courage come to exemplify the steadfast deterriination of soviet jewry in the fac of the most malignant strains of antisemitism his ability to endure the mistreatment that the soviet authorities have devised for him is a tribute not only to his personal bravery but also to the deep desire for freedom that sustains the entire refusenik community now observers have noted reports that anatoly shcharansky is gravely ill and that even in this extreme condition he is being denied proper medical care by his jailers such gross insensitivity by the soviet authorities is shocking but not surprising the soviets record or lack thereof in the area of human rights is sadly familiar to all of us here it would perhaps be easy for the united states to resign itself to the soviet governments imposing refusal to face up to its own constitutional obligations and its responsibilities under international agreements but we cannot we cannot stop calling the soviets to face their responsibilitieswe cannot stop reminding them of the conscience of their own nation which they strive not to hear the case of anatoly shcharansky goes far beyond soviet domestic policies or international political wrangling it strikes at the most basic requirement of all who share the human condition respect for human life and liberty and the obligation to preserve and protect innocent lire simple justice dictates clearly the actions we are required to take we must continue to press for what is humane and justfor the quick mnedical treatment of anatoly shcharansky in his illness and for his subsequent release and free emigration to israel we must do so not only because anatoly shcharansky is a symnbol of a movement whose values we share but more importantly because he is a member of the human family whose triumph and sufferings we also share the release of anatoly shcharansky would be an important humanitarian statement by the soviet authorities to the extent that it is in our power to bring such a move aboutand todays resolution was only

this i am delighted to have joined my colleague from new york and many others in this body in cconding a very strong signal to the general session of the united nations on march 11 i introduced legislation providing that if the general assembly of the united nations should illegally act to suspend expel or in any other manner abridge the rights and privileges of membership of any democratic nation the government of the united states should suspend its participation in the general assembly and withhold its assessed contribution to the united nations until such time as the illegal act is rectified i believed that there was reason to fear that an effort might be underway to suspend israels participation in the general assembly or to expel israel from that body in plain contravention of the charter and the principles upon which the united nations was founded sadly that fear recently has been confirmed anew with soviet troops in afghanistan polish solidarity members in jail chemical warfare in southeast asia war between iran and irtq cuban forces in angola guerilla insurgents in central america and confrontation in the falkland islands the united nations sat in emergency session last week to consider the question of palestine and an arab petition condemning the united states and challenging the right of israels membership in the u n in her speech before the general assembly on april 23 unitedstates permanent representative to the united nations jeane kirkpatrick charged this special session and its accompanying draft resolutions are one more clear example of a strategy whose goals and tactics are clear use a united nations body to make official demands incompatible with israels security and survival so as then to be able to complain that noncompliance with these impossible demands proves israel an international lawbreakerunworthy of membership in the international community of peaceloving states after long and ardent meetings the special session did not take up the radical arab petition due in large measure to the forceful opposition by the united states in particular the resolve of the congress as expressed in house concurrent resolution 289which is now house resolution 322and the parallel measure sponsored by senator moynihan that has already passed the senate by unanimous vote proved to be an important deterrent to the extremists success but the threat has not disappeared the resolution that was finally passed at the special session reiterates earlier language found in the general assemblys resolution on the golan heights viz that israel is not a peaceloving state language that may be a prolog to a fullscale onslaught on israels right of membership at the next regular session of the general assembly the real threat is not to israel but to the integrity of the united nations if the general assembly should attempt illegally to expel israel the united nations would be casting aside what vestiges of respectability and honor it may still retain as expressed by ambassador kirkpatrick in her speech before the special session how much falsification can an institution stand without destroying itself entirely this world body cannot endure as a moral and political force if its energies are devoted to increasing conflict and conducting vendettas against targeted countries if the united nations prefers to make political war rather than peace it must suffer the consequences in terms of its credibility and reputation and if in violation of its own rules it should decide to exclude the democratic state of israel from participation it will inevitably reap the whirlwind the purpose of this legislation is to make explicit what has long been unitedstates policy that we will never condone efforts by a tyrannical majority to infringe the just rights of a democratic member state and that we will not allow unitedstates taxpayer dollars to be spent in underwriting the destruction of the fundamental principles of the united nations in october of 1980 president then candidate reagan said it is my own belief that should a hostile majority in the united nations general asseinbly vote to deny israel its credentials masy 10 1982 1 we should reject such a vote as as violation of the united nations charter which provides for suspension of rights of membership and expulsion only upon recommendation of the security council and in the security council we should exercise our veto 2 we should work vigorously with israel and our friends to preserve the right of israel to be present and vote in the general assembly 3 if unsuccessful in this effort we should suspend our financial contribution to the united nations and urge our friends to do the same until the rights of israel are fully respected if we are determined and make clear that we will protect our interests and our friends i am confident the attempt to deprive israel of its rights in the united nations can be deterred i agree with president reagan i believe that the unitedstates response to such a move by the general assembly or any of the specialized agencies of the u n must be set forth clearly in advance of any overt move against israel so that member nations fully understand the implications of their contemplated illegal act by voting for this legislation members of congress will be reaffirming longstanding unitedstates policy our passage of this measure will be an important deterrent to efforts to interfere with israels rights and privileges of membership in the u n and its specialized agencies i wish to note parenthetically that it is the intent of the drafters of this resolution that it shall apply in the event of any substantial iiterference with israels privileges of membership in the general assembly or in specialized agencies the language right to participate as it appears in house resolution 322 is used in a broad sense encompassing the rights and privileges of membership and not by way of narrow limitation and it will be a clear expression of our abiding belief in the principles of the charter of the united nations and our support for the spirit of honor and integrity with which that institution was originally founded most importantly our willingness to defend israels rights is in truth a measure of our willingness to defend ourselves for the principles of freedom and democracy for which this country stands are ultimately the object of the campaign against israel and in that confrontation americas position must be unequivocal that is the true purpose of this resolution i urge my colleagues support"],

we see throughout the heart of our economy is indicative of the depth of the recession we are in with auto and construction workers being hit the hardest the prospect of any recovery with out a boost

and will have no one to blame but themselves if these industries do not survive to see better times this resolution calls upon the members of this body to address a feasible partial solution to these troubled industries this does not assume that all our problems can te so easily solved but we had better at l ast begin to ponder the solution that are available to us we have spent the last year in one proforma session after another blaming each other for the political print we think we all need for reelection while americas housing and automobile industries plead with us for help there is no reason why we cannot take the legislative proposals now in various committees and act upon them there is absolutely no valid reason why this body should not make constructive progress toward considering the feasible alternatives for insuring a stable affordable money supply for these critical industries in the future today i join with my colleague from michigan in calling upon congress to simply study the feasibility of making these pension funds available to meet these ends it is a reasonable and logical request that should be honored in addition to this resolution i join with congressman laoxansino of california in reintroducting the individual housing accounts bill this bill is designed to create taxexempt housing accounts to provide longterm financing for this nations firstterm home buyer if we are seriously concerned about the diminishing ability of americas families to purchase homes this bill is a major step in reversing that trend although my particular interest lies in the revitalization of our housing and timber industries the need to encourage the automobile industry is just as immediate to those unemployed at this time who is to blame for the recession is irrelevant what is very relevant vitally relevant is that the means through which we can sustain life in these industries is available to this congress now the longterm solutions are languishing in committees for lack of interest now the shortterm tools of basic survival for these industries is also being stalled todays introduction of this resolution and the individual housing accounts bill is the beginning of what i hope will be the refocusing of attention a refocus of attention away from the partisan politics that has held this house spellbound to providing the legislative leadership that we were sent here to provide i hope you share my grave concern for this nations housing and timber industry and join with me in forcing this issue to the floor where it

april 24 1981 marked the 66th anniveresary of the beginning of the first genocide of the 20th century the first holocaust i refer to the inf amous armenian genocide which began shortly after midnight on the morning of april 24 1915 at that time agents of the ottoman turkish government commenced that genocide by the sudden rounding up of the leaders of the armenian community in turkey as the first step of a planned vicious highly organized genocide which to that time was without precedent in human history this is the 11th year in which i have reserved a special order in order to remind the world of the historic facts of the armenian genocide and to give my colleagues an opportunity to join with me in expressing their remembrance for those events this year because of the easter recess which resulted in the congress not being in session on april 24 i am holding this special order on tuesday april 28 in order to conform to the congressional schedule you will remember that today we were honored by the appearance of archbishop vatcho hovsepian as our guest chaplain archbishop hovsepian is the primate of the western diocese of the armenian church in north america with headquarters in los angeles calf he made his trip from california today for the express purpose of appe ring before us there are those who would ask why remind us again of the facts of the armenian genocide which took place so long ago this particularly since the events have been gone over by you so many times in the past there are those who would say why bring this matter up again what can be accomplished particularly since the facts are so well known and since it seems that repetition will produce no results well to them i reply that we will always remember that we may never forget the martyrdom of those who were put to death simply because of their religious beliefs and because of the incredible policy of genocide which was conceived and carried out by the ottoman turkish government against those helpless people there is probably no armenianamerican family today which did not have one or more members who lost their lives in that first genocide let us remember that at that time 66 years ago there were only about 3 million armenians alive in the entire world about 1 million of them half of all the armenians then alive were put to death by cruel and unusual means by being buried alive by being trampled to death by chargig cavalry horses by being beheaded and cut apart by hanging by being driven out into the desert there to die of thirst and statvation by death in whatever form 1 5 million people half of that race the first genocide the first holocaust of the 20th century you will remember that is eminance archbishop hovsepian who prayed for us today the primate of the church was here to be our guest chaplain i know that his own family was gravely touched his mother was with us today his mother was one of the surviving victims of the genocide her parents her brothers and sisters perished in the genocide somehow she escaped somehow she was able to get away through the help of friends into egpyt or some other such place and finally was transported into lebanon where she found refuge that is a common stcry among armenians i know because i represent one of the largest armenian communities in america i can tell you that there is not a family in that group that did not lose someone a mother a father a brother a sister children someone died sometimes all of them perihed they will never forget and becaute of the fact that their descendants here in america have never forgotten and because now these facts are recorded in history no one is ever going to forget i can only regret one thing for some incomprehensible reason the present government of turkey does not seem to want to make amends most of us are old enough to remember the second great genocide of the 20th century the genocide of the jews in hitlers nazi germany while it was terrible beyond description at least the german government after the war those who replaced the evil hitler acknowledged the wrong took whatever steps it could to make amends and have tried to heal this horrible oreach in human relations and the good results a e clear for all to see on the other hand the present turkish government denies to this day that there ever was such a thing as a genocide what a ridiculous and untenable position our own unitedstates am bassador to turkey at the time reported to the am erican people on the details of the genocide and those records are a part of the archives of the united states today they can le found in the archives of the unitedstates department of state the unitedstates ambassador the honorable henry morgenthau sr of new york a very distinguished member of a most distinguished american family wrote a book reflecting those facts which he as our ambassador saw and which he tried to prevent yet for some reason the present turkish government does not even admit that these horrible facts of history took place that is a grave and offensive mistake which adds grievous insult to the prior crime in the affairs of man and under the laws of god there is always room for repentance and repentance can hr~al the wounds of human relations even so great as these i thank god i thank the framers of our constitution for the privilege of free speech that we have been able to put into the records of this congress we have been able to put into the records of the united stqtes for all of the world to know that these facts the armejian genocide did take place and that we shall never forget those who were its victims history shows that when hitler commenced his genocide of the jews some 40 years ago 45 years ago some people protested to him that this was something the world would not tolerate and history shows that hitler replied well who today remembers the armenians that was his justification for going ahead with his genocide and that is a good reason for us to remember that we must not forget because it is through forgetting that we permit these things to happen again i am most pleaed to note that these efforts of the past 11 years have not been in vain i

america christopher columbus whose life and exploits we commemorate each october is one of the true heroes of our nations history he is justly admired as a brilliant navigator a fearless man of action a visionary who opened the eyes of an older world to an entirely new one above all he personifies a view of the world that many see as quintessentially american notmerely optimistic but scornful of the very notion of despair nearly five centuries have parsed since the fateful day on which columbus changed the course of history but his adventurous spirit lives on among us challenging us to emulation andabiding with us as we too press forward on our voyage of discovery in tribute to the achievement of columbus and to the many sons and daughters of italy who have helped to shape our life and destiny as a people the congress of the united states of america has requested the president to proclaim the second monday in october of each year as columbus day now therefore 1 ronald reagan president of the united states of america do hereby designate monday october 12 1981 as columbus day and i invite the people of this nation to observe that day in schools churches and other suitable places with appropriate ceremonies in his honor i also direct that the flag of the united states of america be displayed on all public buildings on the appointed day in memory of christopher columbus

the nasa budget back to the administrations request i must take exception to this committees action however on the proposed revisions of nasas space transportation upper stages program and related changes in the galileo mission to jupiter and the international solar polar mission ispm last year after reviewing the nasa fiscal year 1982 budget request to develop a modified centaur to support planetary exploration programs this committee directed nasa and the dod to conduct a joint study to determine our nations upper stage requirements and to define the most appropriate program for meeting these needs both agencies proceeded to examine current and projected mission requirements and evaluated the following upper stages against those requirements inertial upper state ius centaur transtage interim orbital transfer vehicle iotv the agencies concluded that the iu3 is the only available stage capable ol meeting the near term earthorbiting requirements and with modifications could satisfy nasa and dod earthorbiting missions through the 1980s however the study clearly indicated that t e centaur is the only vehicle capable of meeting near term nasa planetary requirements particularly the need for a galileo combined orbiter probe mission on a direct trajectory to jupiter additionally it was determined that the centaur will satisfy the future envisioned and proposed nasa planetary missions through the mid1990s such findings led nasa and the dod to recommend that the air force continue ius development and production while nasa begin developing the centaur in the intervening four months since this report was released nothing has significantly changed to warrant reprogramming monies from centaur to ius in the nasa budget in fact an ius gallleo mission utilizing the ius on a deltavega trajectory was specifically rejected by the joint study an ius galileo on a deltavega trajectory provides at best major compromise to the mission in addition to mission deficiencies the combination of weight and co location for a galileo combined spacecraft with kick stage would represent a load to tht generic ius which is greater than design limits this fact would require as a minimum structural modifications to stiffen that upper stage while it is apparent that a mission with a combined galileo spacecraft can be accomplished with upper stage performance characteristics equivalent to an ius it is not clear that such a mission could be accomplished withcut major science compromises as well as high cost and schedule risks which would make a single launch in 1985 undesirable because this committees decision to cancel centaur has very serious ramifxcations on our civilian space program not to mention our defense intelligence and telecommunications capabilities i believe it is necessary to reiterate the compelling reasons for proceeding with centaur development for galileo ius cannot meet high energy upper stage requirements for nasa dod and commercial missions failure to move decisively now to develop a high energy upper stage for shuttle will result in an increasing loss of business to foreign competition development of a new high energy upper stage coupled with the decision to reprogram ius for galileo will cost at least 700 800 million more than centaur take at least two years longer to complete and yield no significant performance improvement launching galileo on centaur in 1986 has two critical advantages over a 1985 ius galileo mission cost and benefit first ius cannot meet high energy upper stage requirements for nasa dod and commercial missions ius has a basic design capability of 5 000 pounds to geosynchronous orbit compared to 10 00013 000 pounds for centaur depending on which centaur configuration is utilized consequently as lift requirements increase the need for an adequate upper stage intensifies again the joint nasa dod study accurately summarized this issue the collective trends illustrated as a result of the current analysis of earthorbiting payload requirements show that in the late 80s a need will exist to deliver payloads greater than 5 000 pounds into geosynchronous orbits and that the existing vehicles of the 1980s will determine the spacecraft designs of the late 1980s and the early 1990s the results also indicate that geosynchronous spacecraft develolpment growth rate was slowed considerably during the last decade should a higher performii12196 ance vehicle become available at affordable per flight cost by 1985 spacecraft requirements will grow and effectively utilize the carrier capability in the late 1980s second failure to move decisively now to develop a high energy upper stage for shuttle will result in an increasing loss of business to fureign competition unquestionably launches for foreign payloads mainly communications satellites yield a large favorable balance of payment to the united states it is almost an assurance that the failure to continue centaur development for the shuttle will open this launch market to the europeans and japanese intelsat and comsat have indicated that commercial payload developers desire spacecraft with lift capacities which far exceed existing carrier cap bility according to the joint study intelsat would probably plan earlier conversion to shuttle capability if centaur proceeded through development significantly the direct broadcast satellite corp in a recent letter to this eommittee stated that as a practical matter the ius will not be used for commercial space programs because of its cost and lack of flexfollity the letter goes on to say that what is clearly needed is a flexible highperformance and reasonably priced upper stage of the kind we thought we had in the centaur program finally nasa can convincingly justify a solesource procurement for centaur despite a 1986 galileo launch date and vociferous protests solesource procurements are authorized under 10 unitedstatesc 2304 a 10 and nasa procurement regulation 3210 because of the requirement for maximum practical competition in the conduct of government procurements agency decisions to procure solesource must be adequately justified and are subject to close scrutiny however the general accounting office gao will not substitute its judgment for that of nasa when reviewing the justification for a solesource procurement but will only determine whether the agency decision has a reasonable basis hence the burden is on the protester to make a clear showing that nasas decision is unreasonable as we learned last year timeisoftheessence is a circumstance that along may justify a solesource award the timing for the launch of a space mission is clearly within nasas discretion and the gao has held that mere disagreement with a contracting agencys discretionary decision is not grounds to disturb it to be sure if galileo and ispm are to use a high energy upper stage time is of the essence alternatively i would point out that centaur design production and launch operations teams are now at work on continuing orders extending through 1984 nasa management and support staffs are also functioning tools and equipment for production testing and launch support exist now in mature form centaur for the shuttle has been studied by thrge nasa centers and various contractors safety aspects have undergone particularly close scrutiny again over the last several years consequently solesource procurement of the centaur would take advantage of this wealth of hardware and experience moreover the development of centaur would in fact initiate a more meaningful competition within the shuttles upper stage program by allowing centaur to compete with ius for shuttle launches just as the atlas centaur now competes with the ariane the question is not competition or no competition but development competition or production competition incisively a production competition focusing on price and performance is in the best interests of the american taxpayer and our civiltan space program in summary developing a new high performance stage would unquestionably take longer than modifying an existing stage t run a full competition as contemplated by this committee would also delay the availability of a high performance stage a new stage also would not approach the maturity and reliability of a modified centaur and undoubtedly costs would be much higher than for a modified centaur i strongly urge my colleagues to pursue centaur development in the nasa fiscal year 1982 and 1983 budgets for a 1986 galileo launch as has been approved previously by the senate authorizing committee for nasa thank you"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.9910234212875366, 0.9910234212875366, 0, "i move the previous

myself such time as i may consume i rise in support of h r 3863 a bill to amend the poultry products inspection act to increase the number of turkeys that can be slaughtered annually without federal birdbybird inspection and eliminate the inequitable distinction presently made between turkeys and birds of other species in the exemption for small processors the poultry products inspection act provides for inspection of poultry and poultry products and otherwise for the regulation of the processing and distribution of these products to prevent the distribution in interestate or foreign commerce of adulterated or misbranded products among the requirements to that act are provisions for a birdbybird inspection of the carcass of each bird processed the act provides certain exemptions and section 1 of h a 3863 amends section 15 c 3 of the act so as to increase from 5 000 to 20 000 the same number that currently applies to birds of other species the maximum number of turkeys that may be slaughtered and processed annually without a birdbybird inspection this exemption applies to the following categories first poultry raised and slaughtered or processed by a producer on his own premises for distribution within the state second poultry slaughtered or proc essed by any person for distribution solely within the state and directly to household consumers restaurants hotels and boarding houses for use in their own dining rooms or in the preparation of meals for sales direct to consumers and third poultry slaughtered or cut up for distribution as carcasses or parts within the state by small enterprises not otherwise exempt further the amendments clarify the law by adding specific language to prevdnt the exemption provision from being circumvented by other individuals slaughtering or processing additional turkeys in the same plant the secretary however is author ized to grant an exemption from this limitation to any additional person when he feels such action will not impair effectuating the purposes of the act finally section 2 of h r 3863 amends section 15 c 4 of the act which under current law exempts from the requirements of the act poultry producers with respect to poultry of their own raised on their own farm if 1 such producers slaughter not more than 250 turkeys or not more than 1 000 birds of all species during the calendar year 4 birds of other species deemed the equivalent of 1 turkey li such poultry producers do not engage in buying or selling poultry products other than those produced from poultry raised on their own farms and ii none of the poultry moves in interstate or foreign commerce section 2 amends clause 1 to increase from 250 to 1 000 the number of turkeys that may be slaughtered under the exemption thereby bringing the provisions of this paragraph in conformity with the changes made in section 15 c 3 by section 1 of h r the purpose and need for this legislation is to free our nations turkey farmers and processors from unnecessary and costly regulatory control while still maintaining adequate pro tection to the public against adulteration and misbranding h r 3863 would allow the small familysized turkey processor who depends on a seasonal local market to be exempt from birdbybird inspection conducted under the auspices of the unitedstates department of agriculture on the same basis as processors of other birds under the legislation there would be no compromise in the wholesomeness of turkey products the products must continue to be sound clean and fit for human consumption when distributed and comply with the protections in the act against misbranding other than the requirement of the inspection legend the limitation in the exemption under the existing statute that equates one turkey to four birds of other species works a hardship on the small business person the exemption in current law applies only to turkey processing operations that are insufficient to maintain a level of income proportionate to the capital invested to maintain facilities and equipment that comply with federal birdbybird inspection regulations requires a capital investment that causes hardship to many small producers for example the plant must provide the federal inspector with office space a shower and uniform and must maintain special equipment for this purpose it was estimated that the cost of supplying these special needs could amount to 30 000 according to the american farm bureau federation witness increasing the exemption limitation to 20 000 turkeys under section 15 c 3 of the act and to 1 000 turkeys under section 15 c 4 of the act would provide a more reasonable return on labor and investment while assuring the continued maintenance of a high quality product continued spot inspection of the processed poultry as well as required health and sanitation requirements would assure compliance with the intent and standards of the poultry products inspection act furthermore h r
