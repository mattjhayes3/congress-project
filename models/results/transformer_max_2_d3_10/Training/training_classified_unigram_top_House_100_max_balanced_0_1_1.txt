{"top_correct": [[0.0, 1.0, 1, "11 years ago congress passed the copyright act of 1976 the first general revision of our copyright law since 1909 we did so only after years of workstarting in the early fifties continuing with 22 days ofhearings and 51 days of markup in 1965 and ending with 17 days of hearings and 25 days of markup in 197576 i committed much of my first 18 years in congress to this endeavor the copyright act of 1976 was a bipartisan legislative achievement of the first magnitude legislators of both parties understood that copyright legislation raises unique difficulties while a relatively obscure discipline copyright touches every american in their homes schools libraries and workplaces determining the scope of a law which deeply affects how all of us may enjoy books films television programming computer software information products and services music and the visual arts requires great caution particularly in a rapidly changing society such as ours that seeks both the free flow of information and the free marketplace with the memory of the 1976 revision still fresh in mind i am introducing legislation today to amend the 1976 copyright act although narrow in scope and seemingly technical these amendments contemplate fundamental changes in our copyright system my legislation responds to the same brooding presence that has lurked in the background of unitedstates copyright legislation for 100 yearsthe berne convention for the protection of literary and artistic works in many ways we drafted and passed the 1976 act with a weather eyeon berne the bill i introduce todaythe berne convention implementation act of 1987removes from law provisions incompatible with the proscriptions of the berne conventionas revised at paris on july 24 1971and adds to our law provisions required by that convention not now present in the statute the objective of the bill is simple to permit the adherence of the united states to the berne convention if after hearings and consultations we determine that berne adherence on balance serves the interests of this country and its citizens i am honored to have mr moorhead join me as a cosponsor this kind of bipartisan tradition reaches back to the 1976 act i am aware of the administrations conceptual support for adherence to berne and i look forward to working together with the executive branch on the implementing legislation i also anticipate a close working relationship with the world intellectual property organization wipoi and its director general dr arpad bogsch on this important subject in preparing this bill i have been guided by the hardlearned lessons of historyboth the history of our domestic copyright revision struggles and that of our several unsuccessful efforts in the past to adhere to berne my bill is based in part on the toll of the ad hoc working group on unitedstates adherence to the berne convention i would like the record to reflect the hard work of the members of that group and in particular those of its chairman irwin karp and of its guiding hand in the executive branch harvey winter from the office of business practices in unitedstates department of state i would be remiss if i did not mentlon the efforts last congress of senator charles mcc mathias jr who introduced similar legislation in the senate like our law the berne convention has changed over time its 76 adherents now include most of the industrialized world a number of developing countries and a few nations in eastern europe the united states the soviet union and the peoples republic of china do not adhere the united states and the soviet union along with another 76 nations belong to a more recent treaty the universal copyright convention both treaties are administered by united nations organizations berne by the world intellectual property organization and the ucc by unesco the united states has a seat on the committee that oversees the ucc but since we withdrew from unesco we have a smaller voice and no formal vote in the overall planning and budgeting process affecting uccrelated activities many nations adhere to both treaties and the united states enjoys copyright relations either through the ucc or a formal bilateral relationship with almost 100 states if we adhere to berne we gain or clarify or improve our relations with 24 nations that adhere to berne but not the ucc and with whom our copyright relations are now nonexistent unclear or otherwise problematic the interest in adherence to the berne convention that sparked this initiative is rooted in part in the desire to promote the international protection of works of american authors this arguably would be achieved by having the united states embrace particular legal rules accepted by 76 nations including our major trading partners in western europe canada and japan but we now have copyright relations with most if not all of these states by virtue of the universal copyright convention and berne membership would not by itself increase the level of protection we now enjoy in those states upon closer scrutiny the benefit most frequently pointed to in support of united states adherence to the berne convention appears to be enhanced political credibility in our global effort to strengthen copyright norms to suppress piracy and to secure in all the countries of the world a realistic minimum standard of protection for creative works a major forum in which this policy objective is being sought is the uruguay round of the general agreement on tariffs and trade where we are seeking the adoption of a code or standard of conduct relating to protection of intellectual property within the gatt for copyrights that standard or code may well be the minimum economic rights of the berne convention and if we join berne our trade negotiators around the world could insist on these standards as those that constitute adequate protection for gatt as well as bilateral purposes while we all agree that protection of our creative works abroad is often inadequate everyone does not agree that this is the case with respect to our own works under our own copyright law we are nevertheless being called upon to modify the equilibrium of our domestic copyright law in order to help secure better protection for our authors in other countries we want to protect and promote the copyright export earnings of unitedstates industry but we should not do so at the expense of the unique needs and traditions of our society and our preferences as to the proper mix of rights limitations and conditions we have come to rely on over the years the legislation i am introducing today seeks to raise all of the questions that must be asked for the fullest range of private and public interests to be aware of what berne adherence will mean now and tomorrow the goal of the bill is to stimulate debate about the issues and to further understanding about the berne convention in a democratic and open setting i have never seen a copyright bill that failed to evoke some controversy and this one will be no exception it will stir debate within the framework of full public hearings and give my subcommitteethe subcommittee on courts civil liberties and the administration of justicethe information it needs to decide how to proceed the bill is a first draft and undoubtedly will undergo refinements the united states chose not to join the berne union in the past because we did not then want for our society the kind of copyright laws that the convention required a fresh look is needed and i encourage my colleagues to do so this legislation was drafted after assessing both the level of berne obligations under the current paris act conscious of the practices of those states party to berne at a similar stage of development as the united states that generally share our values of free speech and artistic freedom also examined were the literally dozens of bills introduced over the last 60 years to bring the previous copyright laws into conformity with berne conforming our law with berne may not involve many major changes to the copyright act of 1976 it will however require congress to move that act a few inches further along in several areas where the 1976 act stopped just short of a point of berne compliance we may also have to add a few rights proposed but not accepted in the 1976 revision the ultimate political question may become whether or not the country is prepared to accept copyright notions that were unacceptable scarely a decade ago copyright experts disagree on the extent to which we have to change current copyright law whatever the case none of these experts has testified before my subcommittee i look forward to giving them this opportunity in the very near future serious issues must be confronted for example adherence to berne will require the elimination of the formality of the copyright notice and perhaps more importantly will preclude the future conditioning of the existence of the authors copyright upon any sort of formality many will feel this to be a just and longoverdue step some will have doubts everyone must consider however whether the elimination of such formalities upsets the balance of rights and privileges copyright proprietors now live under and of which formalities have long been a part berne also appears to require some modification of the compulsory license for the public performance of music on socalled jukeboxes finally the moral rights section of the bill will engender lively debate in order to examine the berne issue with some specificity i am proposing a bill that would if enacted clearly place unitedstates law in substantial compliance with the provisions of the treaty my bill errs on the side of legislating compliance with berne rather than remaining silent on the issues during the hearing process the subcommittee we will learn whether all of the proposed amendments are necessary and desirable whether the treaty compels other changes as well and whether adherence to the treaty is worth the price the proposed legislation clearly proceeds upon the presumption that the berne convention is not selfexecuting and requires implementing legislation there is as well serious doubt as to whether copyright treaties such as the berne convention are constitutionally susceptible of selfexecution in any event under article i section 8 of the constitution the power to enact this nations copyright and patent laws is allocated exclusively to the congress and this power is not diminished or qualified by any potential executive authority to conclude international copyright arrangements under which all or part of those benefits are extended to foreign nationals and their works let me now turn to a description of the bill it contains 16 sections section 1 of the bill sets forth the short title the berne convention implementation act of 1987 section 2 provides for drafting clarity that whenever in the proposed legislation an amendment is expressed in terms of an amendment to a section or other provision the reference shall be considered to be made to a section or other provision of title 17 united states code section 3 sets forth several congressional declarations including first that the berne convention is not self executing under the constitution and laws of the united states second that the proposed legislation together with current law will enable the united states to meet its obligations as a nation adhering to the berne convention and no further legislation will be needed and third the provisions of berne shall be given effect under title 17 united states code as amended and shall not be directly enforceable in any action brought pursuant to the provisions of the berne convention itself in section 4 the bill would modify chapter 1 of 17 it would add definitions of architectural works berne convention and berne convention work to section 101 in the same section the definition of pictorial graphic and sculptural works is modified expressly to exclude architectural works in section 5 section 102 a is amended to add architectural works to the list of types of copyrighted works although an aspect of the berne convention not examined with serious scrutiny by any group the protection of architectural works appears to be required by the berne convention in a fashion not now fully available under title 17 specifically while rights holders in twodimensional architectural plans or blueprints may enjoy copyright protection in such works as considered pictorial works such a copyright has not extended to the exclusive right to control the building of the structure so depicted in three dimensions the right of an architect to control the construction of his or her work is therefore given a basis in our copyright act by these amendments section 6 of the bill relates to the national origin of berne convention works it amends section 104 of title 17 in two ways protection for foreign works is explicitly extended to berne convention works and the proscription against selfexecution is codified this letter codification is fundamental to the entire question of implementing legislation and of adherence to the convention it should be absolutely clear that all copyright rights available in courts in the united states must be found exclusively within the provisions of title 17 it should also be clear that state law rights that are not preempted by section 301 are not affected in any way by this legislation or by berne adherence section 7 sets forth a major change in chapter 1 of the copyright act this change is found in a new section 106a the moral rights of the author section this section creates important berne rights in works other than works made for hire the rights of paternity and integrity are provided and are independent of the economic rights in the work the right of paternity means that authors may claim authorship in their works independently of any license or conveyance of their copyrights the right of integrity gives them power to object to any distortion mutilation or alteration of their works that would prejudice the authors honor or reputation"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "25 years ago our government imposed an embargo upon cuba a new communist regime in our hemisphere during the intervening period that embargo has not been as effective as it should have been and one of the reasons for the fact that it has not been as effective as it should have been is that a lot of the nations of the world which are receiving aid from our country are doing business with communist cuba for example in 1985 egypt which received that year over a billion dollars of economic aid from our country bought 186 000 metric tons of sugar from cuba adding to the economic power of castros communist cuba to raise trouble in the western hemisphere and in other parts of the world which are fighting for liberty and human rights another instance was the country of india in the year 1985 also india which that year received about 175 million in economic aid from our country bought 108

now exists in cuba i do not generally speaking believe with some of my colleagues a few in sanctions but these are the types of years ago i stopped over two or three sanctions that should not only be

that is cuban aggression in angola but conwhat my amendment does i think all tinued unitedstates trade with the mpla of us know that the more hard curren regime continues to subsidize the cy that cuba

make little sense to revive the mv program next year once it has been shut down this year restarting the program would be an extremely expensive option for a program that i believe would yield no useful asat capability because the program is specifically mentioned in the conference agreement it is automatically a congressional interest item that would necessitate a reprogramming request for additional funds given the established house position on the mttv asat i feel there is essentially no chance that additional funding would be provided for this program i would thus see it as a futile

agreement i am today going to cast my vote in favor of its implementation for some time now i have been concerned that dramatic influxes of canadian electric imports into this country such as to the degree we have witnessed in recent years may begin to adversely effect the domestic coal mining industry and cause undue reliance on imported energy within certain regions of the country after the proposed agreement was announced i focused my attention on the question of whether any of its provisions would lead to a further escalation in canadian power exports to the united states this question as well as whether the agreement would impact other domestic mining sectors was the subject of a march hearing conducted by my subcommittee on mining and natural resources unfortunately at that time the administration witnesses were so illprepared to address these matters that some nagging questions remained after the hearing i have since satisfied myself that this agreement will have no adverse impacts on the domestic coal mining industry in effect as it relates to power sales the united statescanada freetrade agreement if implemented would not change the current situation it would neither impose nor lift any restrictions currently in place on the trade except for one other considerations outside of the scope of this agreementsuch as the extent of electricity demand transmission capability and environmental matterswill continue to influence the level of canadian power being imported into the united states in this country the regulation of imported canadian electricity primarily deals with transmission currently any transmission line which crosses the unitedstates international border requires a presidential permit under the federal power act the proposed agreement would not affect this permitting process in canada the national energy board is responsible for regulatory international transmission lines and licensing electricity exports the national energy board currently enforces three price tests for these exports the price of exported electricity cannot be less than that charged to canadian customers exports must recover costs incurred in canada including the total cost of production and the price of the electricity exported must be less than the least cost alternative available to the united states utility importing the power all of these canadian requirements would remain unchanged except for the last one known as the least cost alternative test as such it is very possible that the price of canadian power sold to domestic utilities could rise somewhat depending on what the market will bear at this time canada is the largest importer of united states coal in the world last year the united states exported approximately 16 million tons of coal to canada with about half that quantity used for electric generation and the other half utilized by canadian steel mills it should be noted that my home state of west virginia exports about 6 percent of its total production to canada as with electricity this coal trade will be unaffected by the implementation of the agreement to summarize my central concern as to whether the amount of united states coal exported to canada at some point in the future would be exceeded by the amount of domestic electric utility coal use displaced by canadian power imports remains but it is a matter upon which the united statescanada freetrade agreement has no bearing i am going to vote in favor of this agreement because west virginia currently has a trade surplus with canada with exports of items such as chemical products coal and other commodities and goods far exceeding canadian imports into the state due to this strong market position and the agreements removal of various canadian trade restrictons i believe west virginia companies will be in the position to make further trade advances in the future i also believe that the agreement will provide adequate safeguards against any further canadian subsidization of its industry the subsidy issue will most assuredly be the subject of continued monitoring and investigation especially due to the provisions of the implementing legislation which require the achievement of an increased discipline on canadian subsidies"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "along with the gentleman from florida and my other colleagues i would to put on the record

minorityowned savings and loans reported to the federal home loan bank board nineteen of those institutions nearly a third of them reported net worth of less than 3 percent of assets minorityowned savings and loans represent an important resource in minority communities they supply the loans that allow us to purchase our homes and to improve our businesses they serve as a repository for our savings and they provide whitecollar jobs for our citizens each time a minorityowned s l closes the minority community loses a monetary resource for improving the community it loses a repository for savings and it loses a source of meaningful work we are all aware that savings and loans are in a period of crisis andthat it is the responsibility of the fslic to insure that those who save at savings and loans will not be devastated by this crisis it is also the responsibility of the fslic to get the savings and loan industryback on a sound footing one of the ways it will do that is by closing down certain institutions i believe that even the savings and loan associations agree that irresponsibly managed or worse illegally managed institutions should be shut down they drag the whole industry down but the associations strongly disagree with anything that would encourage the fslic to shut down s ls just because they have a low net worth those institutions should be given the help they need to regain vigorous financial health five billion dollars in new borrowing authority will allow the fslic to close the irresponsibly and illegally managed institutions it will not allow the fslic to snuff out the smaller weaker institutions that serve important functions in our communities despite their modest means fifteen billion dollars on the other hand is viewed by the minority institutions and by many other small savings and loans i might add as the fslics license to kill i dont want us to look back on this bill in a couple of years and be reminded of that famous comment

there is great harmony and teamwork on that committee in the last year and they have reported out a lot of good legislation i want to thank all of the members on the committee who have worked hard on this bill i support h r 4174 for a number of reasons briefly because it level funds all current programs establishes a small loan program enhances the surety bond program provides for voluntary participation in sbir maximizes the effectiveness of breakout procurement center representatives expands upon the disaster loan program and incorporates the small business title to the trade bill particularly important to me is section 113procurement center representatives on february 8 1988 i introduced h r 3921 to enhance the powers of breakout procurement center representatives at my suggestion h r 3921 was incorporated into h r 4174 as section 113 bpcrs are advocates of competition in the procurement process their main function is to identify items being procured on a sole source basis and to break out the item for competition bpcrs also counsel and encourage small businesses to compete for the breakout section 113 is the direct result of recommendations made by the sba in its fiscal year 1986 annual report to congress on the bpcr program the sba has identified problem areas that impede the effectiveness of the small business procurement program srction 113 modifies the small busincss act to address those concerns specifically it modifies the law to allow bpcrs access to classified data up to the limit of their security cleaxance strengthens the bpcr appeal process allows the administrator to make flexible staffing decisions and provides for an educational component for procurement center personnel the latest data from the sba show that in fiscal year 1987 the total operating cost of the breakout program was 3 8 million the total dollar savings of actions items purchased under breakout amount to 163 8 million section 113 will not cost a dime but it will dramatically increase the effectiveness of the bpcrs as a direct result of section 113 small business will receive a greater portion of government contracts and enhanced small business competition will generate substantial cost savings to the taxpayers a savings which cbo estimates at 20 to 50 million annually h r 4174 is vital to americas small businesses it is responsive to their needs it is good policy and when properly implemented will do much to promote and strengthen our small businesses therefore i urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation several amendments will be offered today i would like to comment briefly on just two one would drop section 125 the setaside provision the other would add a provision for management and technical assistance for women owning small business concerns dropping section 125 that provides for fair distribution in setasides is cause for concern this section places a 50percent cap on small business participation in certain industrial classifications and gives the sba options for enforcement section 125 was written in response to section 921 of public law 99661 the defense authorization act of 1987 921 started in the armed services committee where there was concern that small business was getting a disproportionate share of government contracts in certain sic codes if 921 were enacted the sba estimates 50 000 small businesses would be adversely impacted and small business contracts with the government would drop by 2 5 billion 99 percent of all business in america is small business only 1 percent is classified as big business yet that 1 percent accounts for 100 percent of government contracts in a great many sic codes but no effort was made to limit their participation in government contracting we should be writing legislation to benefit small business not the 1 percent that constitutes big business while we will be dropping this section because of jurisdictional issues we will shortly be going into conference with the senate to address 8 a reform and setasides i feel strongly that certain concepts must remain foremost on our agenda in order to protect small business first if a small business participation cap is to be set there should be a menu of enforcement remedies offered to the sba for implementation second participation caps should be placed upon individual sic codes within targeted industry categoriesnot upon the aggregate industry amount third offset provisions must be required to mitigate against the anticipated loss to small business such provisions should include mandatory increases in those targeted sic codes not reaching the participation cap and require nontargeted sic code growth across the board with a z all business participation floor of at least 5 percent in all appropriate sic codes diversifying small business participation in government procurement is important for several reasons increased small business competition will save tax dollars will stimulate innovation will protect the defense mobilization base and jill diversify the employment base of many local economies therefore any mandatory limitation on small business participation must be offset by mandatory increased opportunities in areas of underutllzation this is the quid pro quo for limiting small business participation in certain segments of government contracting i would also like to go on record in support of an amendment offered by the chairman to provide for management and technical assistance for womenowned business enterprises this is critical and long overdue it
