month we honored the great achievements and rich history of african americans and the african american community we reflected on an unfortunate journey through slavery and segregation prejudices and discrimination though we bring black history month to a close the congressional black caucus will continue to fight for justice tonight our special order hour is bridging the divide observations on race and justice in america our attention to the divides in our society however does not end because we entered a new month we must remain focused on how we can bridge the divides in our society and how we can bring our nation closer together the divides are striking and we know them all too well the school to prison pipeline education disparities health disparities the injustices in our justice system it is well established in fact that students of color face harsher punishments in schools than their white peers leading to a higher number of youth of color in detention suspension and yes expelled african american students are arrested far more often than their white classmates black and hispanic students represent more than 70 percent of those involved in schoolrelated arrests or referrals to law enforcement currently african americans make up twofifths and hispanics onefifth of confined youth today disparities are found not only in how we punish behavior in schools but also how we fund education this is true in k12 it is also true in higher education and we know that a college degree is a path to a middle class life as african american students graduate with more debt than their white classmates the cuts to pell grants are threatening african american access to a better education without the pell grant program hundreds of thousands of young african americans would not be able to afford college the disparities in access to health coverage are startling the infant mortality rate among african americans is 2 3 times that of nonhispanic whites and african american infants are four times more likely than nonhispanic white infants to die mostly due to complications related to birth weight we must confront these prejudices and these injustices in our nation headon the congressional black caucus is committed to resolving these challenges the congressional black caucus has fought to ensure funding the pell grant pell grants are contained in each years appropriations bills we have worked hard to make sure that the maternity and newborn care are part of health care plans under the affordable care act over 390 000 african american women in the individual market alone are projected to gain maternity coverage thanksyes thanksto the affordable care act our task force on the elimination of sentencing disparities is moving the ball on how black men and women are treated in the judicial system as we have been working here in congress our partners the deltas my sorority delta sigma theta sorority held their annual delta days in the nations capital today with thousands of women from across this nation gathering and advocating for these same disparities and injustices as deltas were uniting in their efforts today in our nations capital my sorors and i were also uniting for one of our very ownnominee loretta lynch last week the senate judiciary committee voted 128 to approve the confirmation of loretta lynch as the next united states attorney general bringing her confirmation to the full senate for consideration i remember it all too well a couple weeks before that when we were in that hearing room it looked like a sea of red as deltas marched in and lined up one after another wearing our colors crimson and cream deltas lined the outside of the hearing room we did that because prior to entering that room media and some of my colleagues on the other side had tried to make it a bad thing that she organized and was a founder of her college chapter of delta sigma theta sorority what we were able to do was to show them when we work together whether that is democrats and republicans or sorority members or nonsorority members when it is the right thing to do we can make a difference i was so proud last week to sit there on the front row with my other colleagueswith our chairman of the congressional black caucus congressman g k butterfield with the 100th woman sworn into the united states congress congresswoman alma adams to be there with the 21st national president of delta sigma theta sorority congresswoman marcia fudge we sat there next to loretta lynchs father reverend lorenzo lynch of north carolina while the judiciary committee favorably reported the nomination on a vote that was closer than it needed to be ms lynchs nomination is well deserved and historic ms lynch testified before the senate judiciary committee for nearly 8 hours and she responded to nearly 900 written questions which is unprecedented many of the written questions were from senators who had already declared their opposition to her nomination ms lynchs nomination has now been pending far longer than any recent attorney generals nomination which in my opinion is shameful she deserves to be voted our next attorney general if senators have a reason to vote against her nomination they should make their case public yes hiding behind procedural tactics does not help our nation as the senate has an opportunity to unite behind a wellqualified nominee for a critical position congress members will have an opportunity to be united this weekend when democrats and republicans will travel to alabama to march to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the selma marches fifty years ago people marched for equal voting rights out of those marches we got the voting rights act however disparities remain and the voting rights act has been eroded we can end this divide of who votes if my republican colleagues would bring up the voting rights amendment act h r 885 let me say that again we can end the divide of who can vote if my republican colleagues would bring up the voting rights amendment act h r 885 how long will it take how long must we wait to have equal rights and justice it is well past time that we deliver to all americans what they deserve like we did 50 years ago in selma we must do so again today and stand united arm in arm as my congressional black caucus colleagues and i did recently in

concerns facing minority communities my colleagues in the congressional black caucus and i understand the very difficult challenges facing us in the form of huge health disparities among our community and other minority communities we will continue to seek solutions to those challenges it is imperative for us to improve the prospects for living long and healthy lives and fostering an ethic of wellness in africanamerican and other minority communities certainly the affordable care act which i cosponsored and worked on has brought a new quality of life and access to healthcare for millions of americans including minorities i thank all of my cbc colleagues who been toiling in the vineyards for years developing effective public policies and securing the resources needed to eradicate racial and gender disparities in health and wellness let me focus these brief remarks on what i believe are some of the greatest impediments to the health and wellness of the africanamerican community and other minority communities the first challenge is reversing the dangerous trend of increasing obesity in juveniles and young adults cancer diabetes and hepatitis are of great importance as well as combating the scourge of hiv aids finally we must confront the leading cause of death of young africanamerican males between the ages of 1524 that cause is not disease or accidental death but homicide obesity although the obesity rates among all africanamericans are alarming as chair of the congressional childrens caucus i am especially concerned about the childhood obesity epidemic among africanamerican youth more than 40 percent of africanamerican teenagers are overweight and nearly 25 percent are obese in 2007 my office in concert with the office of congressman towns and the congressional black caucus foundation held a widelyattended issue forum entitled childhood obesity factors contributing to its disproportionate prevalence in low income communities at this forum a panel of professionals from the fields of medicine academia nutrition and the food industry discussed the disturbing increasing rates of childhood obesity in minority and lowincome communities and the factors that are contributing to the prevalence in these communities what we know is that africanamerican youth are consuming less nutritious foods such as fruits and vegetables and are not getting enough physical exercise this combination has led to an epidemic of obesity which directly contributes to numerous deadly or lifethreatening diseases or conditions including the following hypertension dyslipidemia high cholesterol or high triglyceride levels type 2 diabetes coronary heart disease stroke gallbladder disease osteoarthritis asthma bronchitis sleep apnea and other respiratory problems cancer breast colon and endometrial when ethnicity and income are considered the picture is even more troubling africanamerican youngsters from lowincome families have a higher risk for obesity than those from higherincome families since the mid1970s the prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased sharply for both adults and children according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc among africanamerican male adults aged 2074 years the prevalence of obesity increased from 15 0 in 1980 survey to 32 9 in the 2004 there were also increases in overweight among children and teens for children aged 25 years the prevalence of overweight increased from 5 0 to 13 9 for those aged 611 years prevalence increased from 6 5 to 18 8 and for those aged 1219 years prevalence increased from 5 0 to 17 4 as the debate over how to address the rising childhood obesity epidemic continues it is especially important to explore how attitudes environmental factors and public policies influence contribute to obesity among africanamerican males some of these contributing factors are environmental others are cultural still others are economic and others still may be lack of education or information but one thing is clear we must find ways to remove them cancer certain groups in the united states are not doing as well as others when it comes to preventing and surviving cancer many such disparities are apparent among certain minority populations such as african americans and hispanics the reasons why cancer adversely affects these groups are largely related to issues such as poverty access to health care and other socioeconomic factors the cancer death rate among african american men is 27 higher compared to nonhispanic white men the death rate for african american women is 11 higher compared to nonhispanic white women african americans have the highest incidence rates of colorectal cancer of any racial or ethnic group hispanics have higher rates of cervical liver and stomach cancers than nonhispanic whites liver cancer incidence and death rates among asian pacific islanders are double those among nonhispanic whites diabetes about 19 percent of all nonhispanic black americans age 20 or older about 5 million people have diabetes the highest rate of any ethnic group among hispanic adults more than 2 5 million or about 11 percent of the population have diabetes 14 percent of american indians and alaska natives are living with the disease compared with nonhispanic white adults the risk of diabetes is 18 percent higher in asianamericans 66 percent higher in hispanics latinos and 77 percent higher in nonhispanic africanamericans"], [0.0012006759643554688, 0.9987993240356445, 1, "i rise this evening along with my colleague congressman hakeem jeffries of the eighth congressional district of new york for tonights congressional black caucus special order hour bridging the divide a call to action by the congressional black caucus to eliminate racial health disparities tonight the congressional black caucus comes to the house floor to discuss our overarching goal of promoting equality for african americans across the healthcare spectrum it is well known that poverty socioeconomic status and health disparities are closely linked and latched together for example individuals with low incomes tend to have more restricted access to medical care and face greater financial barriers to affordable health care oftentimes contributing to health disparities last week the house republicans released their conferences poverty plan called a better way unfortunately but not unexpectedly this republican antipoverty proposal isnt a better way it isnt even a new way quite frankly it is the wrong way it uses the same trickledown discredited policies that house republicans have put forth in the past the house republicans poverty elimination proposal would repeal the affordable care act and undermine affordable quality health coverage that millions of americans are now enjoying it would also cut medicaid the childrens health insurance program that we refer to as chip and it would end the medicare guaranteeprograms with proven successes in reducing health disparities so this is in part why we are here tonight we know that health coverage is the first step in securing better healthcare outcomes and medicaid and chip play a vital role in opening the doorway to the needed health care especially for our children as we address the most pressing challenges in achieving health equity and equality for african americans i want hardworking american families to know that they have voices in congress that aim to protect their safety invest in their future and provide affordable health care for all with the affordable care act which every member of the congressional black caucus supported when it passed we have improved access we have improved affordability and quality of health care so tonight i want to thank president obama for moving the needle forward in helping american families and african american families across this great country and nation to have the financial and health security that comes with health care we cannot repeal the aca we must continue to improve and strengthen it and we will still have more work to do the congressional black caucus from its very inception has long been the voice for bridging the divide on racial healthcare disparities no we have been the voice for standing up for american people and especially individuals who are african american against all disparities we will not only come to this floor tonight we will continue our fight and we will continue to come to this floor tonight you are going to hear a lot of our members weave together our poverty plan you are going to have members talk about gun violence you are going to have members talk about all lives matter if we dont end the gun violence then we are not going to have a healthy nation tonight i want to applaud my good friend and colleague congresswoman robin kelly of the second district of illinois chair of our congressional black caucus health braintrust i want to commend her for her report the 2015 kelly report on health disparities in america the official congressional analysis of the state of african americans health in the united states and her work on the 40 under

cannot come to this house floor and talk about poverty programs and health care and education and about finance if we do not bridge the gap with gun violence i salute her for no longer standing up until we make a difference so tonight we are coming with a strong call to action for us to keep this wonderful america healthy you will hear from congresswoman kelly momentarily i yield to the gentleman from north carolina chairman of the congressional black caucus he is a chairman who has been a longtime advocate and voice for not only the congressional black caucus but for his

national minority health month it is no surprise that we are here today because certainly we have had many firsthand experiences to know the disparities that exist across all americans but more specifically across african american communities to you mr payne thank you for having the foresight to come tonight and to you congresswoman kelly thank you for taking a leadership position in helping us share with the nation the value and the importance of protecting all lives but giving information to the nation about the state of black health it is imperative that we continue to address health disparities that affect racial minorities and work together on the efforts to advance health equity since july 1971 the congressional black caucus has sponsored national conferences and held brain trusts on black health it is so timely that we have this discussion as we observe national minority health month tonight is a call to action a charge for all of us to unite towards a common goal of improving the health of our communities everyone in america should be able to live a healthy life regardless of the color of their skin the good news is the overall health of an american has improved over the past few decades this is in part due to the increased focus on preventive medicine and dynamic new advances in medical technology however not all americans have benefited equally from healthcare improvements since the enactment of the affordable care act millions of americans now have access to quality affordable coverage according to the american medical association recent studies have shown that despite the steady improvement in overall health of the united states racial and ethnic minorities experience a lower quality of health services and are less likely to receive routine medical procedures and have higher rates of morbidity and mortality than nonminorities disparities in health care exist even when controlling for gender condition age and socioeconomic status for example cardiovascular diseases account for the largest proportion of inequality in life expectancy between african americans and nonhispanic whites according to the american cancer society african american women have a 44 percent higher death rate from breast cancer despite having a mammography screening rate that is nearly the same rate for white women according to the centers for disease control the cdc the infant death rate among african americans is still more than double that of whites tonight you are going to hear my colleagues and i discuss much data and statistics because i am from the great state of ohio and ohio ranks 47th in the nation in infant mortality with black infants dying at twice the rate of white infants according to a 2015 study conducted by the kaiser family foundation in ohio on average 14 5 black infants die per every 1 000 live births while 6 3 white infants die ohio community leaders and the greater columbus infant mortality task force are working hard to lower franklin countys infant mortality rate and the infant mortality rate in all of ohio tonight i salute them for their research for their education and for their consistency to save lives the statistics are staggering and we can and must do more to lower and eliminate them the societal burden of healthcare disparities in america manifest in multiple and major ways for example a 2014 study by the joint center for political and economic studies concluded that the combined costs of health inequalities and premature death in the united states were 1 24 trillion that 1 24 trillion is the cost between 2003 and 2006 that is why on march 23 2010 when president barack obama signed the affordable care act it was a monumental step that has helped us address the overwhelming statistics and health disparities within our community i proudly supported the affordable care act because lives matter all lives matter black lives matter now we have comprehensive healthcare reform that improves access to affordable health coverage and guarantees that the most vulnerable in our communities have access to care by improving access to quality health care for all americans the affordable care act helps reduce health disparities how does the affordable care act do this this law invests in prevention and wellness gives individuals more control over their care and expands initiatives to increase racial and ethnic diversity in healthcare professions by strengthening cultural competency training for all healthcare providers and improving communications between providers and patients the affordable care act represents the most significant federal effort to reduce disparities in this countrys history congressman payne and congresswoman kelly again i salute you i am going to repeat that because it is so important for us to let the nation know that the affordable care act represents the most significant federal effort to reduce disparities in this countrys history the affordable care act also increases funding for community health centers which serve an estimated one in three lowincome people and one in four lowincome minority residents there are over 43 community health centers in ohio including many in my district columbus neighborhood health centers heart of ohio family health centers and lower lights christian health centers these community health centers provide outstanding primary care dental behavioral health and pharmacy services in our most underserved areas in 2013 community health centers provided care to over 550 000 ohioans and recorded over 2 million patient visits we have come a long way but there is still much more for us to do all people should have the opportunity to reach their fullest potential for health we must continue to move forward to combat health disparities build healthier communities and create a stronger country in order to have a successful nation i believe we must have a healthy nation let me leave you with something a national figure once said if you neglect to recharge a battery it dies if you run full speed ahead without stopping for water you lose momentum to finish the race let us make sure that all americans

topic of tonights special order hour is the state of black healtha cbc assessment during national minority health month each april we observe national minority health month in order to raise awareness about the gaping health disparities that impact communities of color across the nation many of us have been personally affected by the physical and emotional tolls that conditions like obesity diabetes kidney disease breast and prostate cancer and hiv aids have brought on ourselves and our loved ones and neighbors last month marked the 50th anniversary of the selma to montgomery marchesthe generationdefining events that led to the passage of the 1965 voting rights act like the right to vote health care is a fundamental civil right that our leaders health professionals and communities must fight to protect the affordable care act was a critical step in the march toward health equity but there is still much more to be done dr martin luther king expressed this a half century ago when he said of all of the forms of inequality injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane i couldnt agree more and it has been the work of the cbc and of the congressional black health braintrust which i chair to advance the critical phrase of the human rights and civil rights struggle health equity this year the cbcs health braintrust will focus on three core principles strengthening our communities improving health access and marching toward a healthier future the disparities facing minority communities in rural areas across the country are too numerous to name to

to say that my heart goes out to the families and friends of the victims of the horrible tragedy in orlando and i can only imagine what they are going through the other thing that is illuminating to me is that as we came here and stood up for a moment of silence after that moment of silence i believe members were given a 1minute opportunity to speak on any topic that they would like to on the floor as is customary and not one person from the other side of the aisle mentioned what happened in orlando so not only was it a moment of silence for the leadership in this house but it appears that it is going to be a moment that remains silent or a topic that remains silent from the other side of the aisle eliminating racialbased health disparities depends on our ability to advance access to affordable health care for all even in the 21st century health disparities are stark especially in the african american communities where life expectancies are lower and infant mortality rates are higher than among whites today despite improvement in overall health in the united states african americans and other minority populations lag behind in numerous health areas including access to quality care timelines of care and health outcomes for years the congressional black caucus has called on republicans to join us and other house democrats in developing a plan to eliminate racial health disparities a plan that addresses the causes of health disparities such as inequities in environmental social and economic conditions in our communities instead we get from them proposals like their socalled a better way poverty proposal a stale repackaging of failed policies presented under the guise of concern about americans trapped in poverty cutting job training programs food assistance and head start will push lowincome americans further into poverty making it even more difficult for them to access the affordable and quality health care needed to secure their wellbeing and the wellbeing of their families we need to instead use the government as a source of good every american deserves to live in a safe and healthy environment yet lowincome and minority communities are much more exposed to high levels of pollution resulting in serious health problems such as asthma heart problems and cancer this is a very real problem across america a very real problem in my district thirteen million people including 3 5 million children are concentrated in the vicinity of transportation facilities and are exposed to unhealthy levels of air pollution my district is home to the port newarkelizabeth marine terminal part of the port of new york and new jersey the third largest port in the country according to the epa 25 percent of children in newark suffer from asthmathree times the state average what we need are additional federal actions to reduce harmful air pollution from ports and congested components of the national freight transportation system the issue is critical to the lowincome and minority community who suffer the disproportionately adverse health effects of these environmental hazards now since i am on the topic of environmental justice i just want to remind everyone that the republicans continue to block any action to help the thousands of children facing lifelong damage from drinking poisoned water in flint including a vote to block the families of flint act emergency supplemental their radical refusal to address this health issue will have tragic consequences for american families and i think it is representative of their overall inadequate approach to health disparities in minority communities the way to eliminate racial health disparities is neither to downplay them nor to cut programs that will assist the most vulnerable it is to address the environmental social and economic conditions that exacerbate those disparities it is to expand access to quality health care that could eliminate or reduce the onset of many of these chronic illnesses and disproportionate health outcomes it is to maintain and strengthen our investments in healthcare access and resources for disadvantaged populations in closing i also want to stress that health education must also be a focus in any efforts to eliminate racialbased health disparities african americans and other communities are disproportionately affected by poor providerpatient communication and health literacy issues consequently they often do not have access to information that enables them to make the appropriate health decisions we have a responsibility to work with our healthcare institutions and community health centers to make it easier for people to find understand and use the information and services as cochair of the congressional mens health caucus i have hosted and participated in a number of outreach events in my district to engage directly with constituents about the importance of making positive health decisions and staying proactive

fighting for these freedoms and protections and when it comes to the matter of health equity i have worked to champion the health policy concerns of vulnerable communities as my predecessors in the

killed martin luther king jr was quoted as saying of all the forms of inequality injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane i couldnt agree more and as the chair of the health braintrust i have worked with many of the people in this room to focus on advancing this critical phase of the human rights and civil rights struggle health equity when benjamin franklin created the nations first public hospital the pennsylvania hospital he did so in order to establish the promotion of public health as a core american value he did so to care for our nations diseased and sick poor nearly 300 years later the affordable care act cemented health care as a fundamental right for all americans yet today we find ourselves at a crossroads in health care health disparities in communities of color continue to be intractable hurdles in the quest to achieve health equity in america african americans are infected with hiv at a rate that is 8 times that of white americans while white women are more likely to have breast cancer african american women are 40 percent more likely to die from the disease african americans latinos asians and pacific islanders as well as native americans are diagnosed with lupus two to three times more frequently than caucasians more than 13 percent of african americans aged 20 or older have diagnosed diabetes and people of color are two to four times more likely than whites to reach endstage renal disease this grim snapshot illustrates that despite the gains we have made since the days of ben franklin and the aca there is still much ground to cover in closing the health equity gap last year i drafted a comprehensive report the kelly report on health disparities an official congressional analysis of the state of minority health in the unitedstates that offers a blueprint for reversing negative health trends in communities of color the kelly report brought members of congress together medical professionals and public health thought leaders to examine the root causes and impact of health disparities in america and provide a comprehensive set of legislative and policy recommendations to address them the whole can only ever be as healthy as its parts for america to achieve true health equity lawmakers community leaders and industry stakeholders must come together and aggressively work to reduce disparities nationwide we all have a part to play in creating a healthier america we must take heed of dr kings words of all the forms of inequality injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane and we can and we must fix that again because of what happened in orlando and i want to say it is the mass shooting that we are talking about and it is tragic but the night before one person was shot and i often liken

rights i think we can reach consensus on the criminal justice reform i think both parties believe that there are substantial areas that need to be addressed in criminal justice reform senator cornyn has certainly indicated that republicans and democrats in this house have indicated that my question to you is with respect to the issues that i think we have all discussed and that the speaker has discussed such as jobs and economic growth health care poverty and opportunity which we believe is a very important issue criminal justice reform job creation longterm fiscal agreements so that we can replace the sequester with a permanent rather than an every2year resolution comprehensive tax reform which almost all of us have said we are formr camp brought a bill forward on thatcomprehensive immigration reform restoring voting rights which i mentioned taking action to address gun violence which we are in favor of and i think clearly your side has indicated that mental health is very much a component of that and you want to address that and addressing our national security challenges which i agree with the speaker that is a primary responsibility and concern of i think everybody on the floor of this house my question therefore mr leader is do you expect any substantive legislation rather than simply ideas that both parties might express and put out to the public that would be transparent specific and on which we could have debates on alternative policies do you expect in the relatively short time we have this year to have legislation on the floor dealing with one or more

from california for her longstanding leadership her commitment to human rights and change in a positive way for the relationship between the united states of america and cuba i also would be remiss if i didnt recognize some of my other colleagues who have been in this have encouraged a change in policy for many many years if not decades congressman farr congresswoman delauro congressman mcgovern congressman van hollen congressman polis congressman meeks and many others who have taken it upon themselves to visit the island of cuba like the average american is not allowed to do and learn about the real situation on the ground there i also commend the obama administration and the president for his bold move in finally moving this outdated anachronistic policy towards cuba into a positive direction because just think about this since the embargo has been in place and our policy of isolation has been in place we had a war with vietnam but we have come to reconcile with the vietnamese and now the vietnamese people have seen great economic reforms because america was engaged even after world war ii when we had a world war against germany you have to turn the page and move on in human history and we were able to do that with one of our closest allies now with germany so why not cuba in the tampa bay area i represent a lot of cubanamerican families in fact the bulk of my constituent work often involves family unification it is not uncommon every week to have a situation where there is a dying grandmother in the united states and her grandchildren in cuba would like to come and visit and yet over the past years they have been subjected to the worst kind of bureaucratic red tape that has not allowed them to travel freely to america and the same for american citizens did you know that americans are not allowed to travel freely to cuba many people dont know that cuba is really one of the only nations in the entire world where our constitutional rights to travel are restricted and we think now with the obama administrations move we will begin to open the door to greater travel in recognition of our own human rights and constitutional rights but i think it is really for our families to be able to unify them it is only a 1hour flight from tampa to havana it is less than that and it is a beautiful flight and yet it has been off limits for so long so thank you to the obama administration for beginning to take the steps to open this up i want folks to know cuba is changing just like the congresswoman who has traveled there multiple times i traveled on a factfinding mission not too long ago there are meaningful economic reforms under way america needs to be there to encourage it to move it along faster and farther people now in cuba can own some private property there are new small businesses and entrepreneurs that have the ability to step away from government control and take control of their own lives there is decentralization of power but unless america is engaged we are not going to be able to continue those economic reforms and press for improvements in human rights this is also an important time for america to capitalize on the changes in the world economy remember for a long time it was the soviet union that supported cuba or it was venezuela well now with the energy revolution in america there has never been a better time for america to use its influence in the world its economic power its pressing for human rights as venezuela doesnt carry the day anymore their economy is in turmoil the same for russia the economic conditions now play to our advantage and we need to use it to improve human rights on the island to improve family unification and begin to establish those all important diplomatic ties in my hometown of tampa they have led the way my greater tampa chamber of commerce has traveled a number of times they would like to reestablish trade ties there have been enormous numbers of cultural exchanges the florida orchestra had a multiyear exchange with the orchestra of cuba ybor city businessmen have instituted art celebrations with the cuban people right in the heart of tampa the university of tampas baseball team went and played the cuban national team yes and the university of tampa did prevail much to the chagrin of the cubans but these are the ways that you build a relationship a greater foundation for economic reform and human rights reform in fact it is the saint lawrence catholic church in tampa that is going to fund the first catholic parish on the island of cuba in the coming years if we cannot stand as leaders in the western hemisphere for religious freedom for human rights for economic engagement and improvement who will it is our time i thank the leaders in this congress that have pressed for this change i commend president obama for taking this bold move and i encourage all members of congress to travel there and listen to the people listen to their cries for positive change we have it within our power to lift the embargo and begin to press on these issues and i hope that we will"], [0.9522136449813843, 0.9522136449813843, 0, "mr chair i think what i have before all of us is a commonsense amendment it simply says that the advanced technology vehicle manufacturing loan program will continue to exist but there can be no additional loans the reason that i do so is when i came and offered this amendment last year i had a cutting amendment last year but what was explained to me was that if you cut the program then you wouldnt have money to administer the existing loans that were out there so as a result i have altered this amendment so that it again leaves in place the appropriation which is more than 5 million so that you could continue to administer the existing loans that are in place but there would be no additional loans now why do i think that that is important i think it is important for a couple different reasons i think from a democratic standpoint what we would say is that we all believe in equality and that there shouldnt be subsidized loans for major corporations global corporations here in the united states while your cousins pizza business is struggling or your friends landscaping business is struggling they dont get subsidized loans why should a big business so from a democratic standpoint i think we would hold that belief from a republican standpoint we would say we need to watch out for the taxpayer if you look at the default rate on these loans unfortunately it has been relatively high you would say i dont know if government is in the best spot to be making these kinds of loans to businesses i think that ultimately is the role not of government but of business let them do what they do i think from both vantage points it is something that makes sense i would add just a couple of additional thoughts and then i would yield i would say one there have been only five loans made since 2007 this is not a huge program this is a very limited program two two out of the five loans made since 2007 in fact have defaulted that is a 40 percent default rate i dont think that that is the kind of thing that we would like to see in government there have been no loans made since 2011 and then the gao came in march of 2013 and said the costs outweigh the benefits of this program they followed that up with another gao report in march of 2014 and said we recommend shutting down the program unless the department of energy can show real demand for the loans then they followed that up with a final gao report in march of this year and it said that there hadnt been a sufficient level of demand as a consequence their words were this determining whether funds will be used is important particularly in a constrained fiscal environment this congress should rescind unused appropriations or direct them to other government priorities i think the simple issue with this loan program is that there could be other priorities where you take that 4 billion of loan authority and let other parts of government use it or turn it back to the private sector and use that money much more

that does not meet the needs of people with mental illness and it places an undue burden on law enforcement his words about people having a right to be well really resonates with me because we have seen in all of our communities situations that escalate because they dont have the proper responsewe dont have the proper training we dont have the proper resourceswhere people get worse it is not just that it costs more money it is the pain to the individuals to their families and ultimately since virtually all of these people are released but are released in a more damaged situation they are worse they are a greater risk to themselves and society and the cycle continues there is no doubt in my mind that if we were able to properly account for the costs and consequences of the current

my colleague because i dont want anyone to misinterpret the facts here every single president has acted in this area and these actions by this president are no different than the actions by previous presidents in this trade space around providing amnesty and what the gentleman strenuously and sincerely objects to is that this has benefited a large number of people whom the president has a different view of in terms of their circumstances because they were brought here as young children and the president says well they are here they went to school here and this is the only country they know and they have abided by our laws and he is granting them this ability to stay and the gentleman objects but i dont want anyone to think that the congress has taken some different view because the congress is two housesthe house and the senateand even if both houses were to act the way our laws are structured you need a presidential signature so in fact one house may have a difference of opinion when ronald reagan was president the democrats had a difference of opinion it didnt change the law so that we voted in some particular way i dont want anyone to misinterpret the comments of my colleague as he has articulated his sincere objections to these issues and then to get to the point of his amendment what he is saying is that it is wonderful that the judiciary is responding they are interpreting the law the way he thinks it should be interpreted but here what he wants to do is to deny the executive branch appropriate resources to pursue its policy objectives by saying that none of the funds here can be used by doj in furtherance of their position so i think it is fair for the house to have a view the house is even suing the president about his point of view on some things but it is unfair for us to deny the executive branch an opportunity to put forth its arguments in court on any of these matters so that we can get a proper ruling from the third branch of our government and even though there have been rulings in the gentlemans favor he and i both know that we are not at the final rendezvous here and that the wheels of justice grind slowly but there will be a final decision probably by the highest court in the land but we should not deny the doj an opportunity to go into court and argue the administrations position i think that would be unfair therefore
