couples by eliminating the marriage tax penalty in the tax code this bill is identical to h r 6 that passed this house in february why are we here again because the blocking techniques of the vice president as president of the senate and the minority leader in the other body have prevented our bill from even being able to come up for a vote on the floor and then they have the audacity to say we are a donothing congress they are forcing us to come back again and pass this bill under reconciliation which procedurally cannot be blocked from coming up on the floor of the senate by their delaying tactics i was somewhat surprised to see recent campaign ads touting vice president gores support for fixing the marriage tax penalty in the year 2000 because it sure does not match the clintongore white house 8year do nothing record of stonewalled opposition to fixing this unfair tax since 1993 the clintongore white house has sent 25 million married couples an expensive gift from the irs a bill for 1 400 a year that is not exactly the traditional happy anniversary card so here we are at it again trying to fix this once and for all and this is a bipartisan bill with 48 democrats in the house voting with us in february on a bill that is the most complete and fairest way to get this job done but despite this bipartisan support i have a feeling we will still hear excuses from democrats today as to why we cannot do it for whatever reason they may say we should not help stayathome moms and dads and yes this bill does that but their plan actually denies relief to these important parents in fact the democrat plan leaves millions of married couples at the altar and that is wrong raising a child is the single most important job in the world and we are right to provide families with relief who have only one wage earner democrats will also complain that this is too much tax relief of course they say that about almost every tax bill that we bring up but again they are wrong fairness demands it because it is wrong to take money from the pockets of wageearning americans just because they are married the money should not be coming to washington in the first place then they might say oh we should wait the timing is just not right to fix the marriage tax penalty and they are wrong again we should fix the marriage tax penalty right now married couples should not have to wait 1 day longer to be treated fairly by the tax code so this all comes down to a matter of principle the fact that married couples pay more in taxes just because they are married is simply immoral it is unfair it is unjust and today once again we are moving to overbome the blocking tactics of the democrats in the other body and to fix the marriage tax penalty and return a small sense of decency to the tax code i reserve the balance of my time"], [6.820457201683894e-05, 6.820457201683894e-05, 0, "i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their
