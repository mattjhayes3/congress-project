racial health disparities i would like to thank my colleagues congressman hakeem jeffries and congresswoman joyce beatty for hosting this timely special order historically racial and ethnic minorities are likely to have the highest uninsured rates and are less likely to receive preventive and quality health care while the affordable care act has helped minorities afford health insurance and access quality care there is still a need to eliminate existing disparities for example the department of health and human services is currently working to expand access end racial and ethnic discrimination perform outreach to underserved communities improve workforce diversity and expand data collection and reporting while this is an ambitious plan it is one that is extremely necessary unfortunately coverage access and outreach may not be the only keys to eliminating disparities demographic characteristics contribute heavily to racial and ethnic health status for example research shows that privately insured african american and hispanic adults fare worse than privately insured white adults along measures to access and use of care unfortunately african americans and hispanics are less likely to have a regular provider than their white counterparts the same research also showed that privately insured african americans and hispanics had less confidence in their ability to pay for medical costs since social determinants like economic stability education and environment play such a large role in how we each view and access health care many of the changes necessary to eliminate racial and ethnic disparities require a much larger plan than just a focus on healthrelated programs reducing disparities in health truly entails addressing racial and ethnic social determinants such as availability of safe housing affordable food access to education job opportunities communitybased resources public safety public transportation and more our society must make many changes before we can truly eliminate racial and ethnic health disparities because that also means eliminating disparities in many other sectors i thank congressman jeffries and congresswoman beatty for hosting this poignant special order tibet"], [0.0014023184776306152, 0.9985976815223694, 1, "first let me thank congresswoman kelly for those very generous remarks but also for your tremendous leadership and for staying the course and making sure that we are here really speaking truth to power each and every week on behalf of the black caucus also to you congressman don payne thank you very much for your leadership and for really rising to the occasion on so many issues in the very short time that you have been here you have hit the ground running and really have made a tremendous difference i want to just speak for a few minutes as it relates to the review of the congressional black caucus for the last year or 2 years i have to just say that our leader mr butterfield has been a very bold and tremendous leader we have accomplished quite a bit and we have a lot more to do while 2015 has been very challenging i believe that the congressional black caucus has really stepped up and made a huge difference not only for the african american community and communities of color but for the entire country it has also been an inspiring year we have seen the birth and growth of the vital black lives matter movement we have also witnessed powerful and moving protests across the country in places like missouri new york and even in my district in oakland and in berkeley california with people of all backgrounds and ages coming together to demand justice to petition their government to exercise their democratic rights i am so proud of the young activists who are standing up and demanding an end to racism and injustice in many of our communities they are truly bringing the civil rights movement into the 21st century i want them to know that they have allies here in the peoples house for too long congress has ignored or brushed aside issues affecting the african american community and other communities of color it is past time that everyone steps up and does the good work that we were sent to washington to do that the congressional black caucus has done for many many decades we need to start by talking about and looking at what has happened with the voting rights act as you know this year marks the 50th anniversary of this landmark legislation the voting rights act was gutted by the supreme court in its shelby v holder decision and of course republican state legislators have fallen all over to restrict voting rights across the country everywhere these dangerous restrictions come in the form of voter id requirements elimination of sameday voter registration and really severe reduction in early voting efforts we must call these efforts for what they are republican attempts to take away one of our most fundamental rights but we will not let this happen i am so proud of the congressional black caucuscongresswoman terri sewell and john lewis and mr clyburn the entire congressional black caucus our bill h r 2867 the voting rights advancement act sponsored by congresswoman sewell who represents selma alabama would restore the preclearance provisions of the voting rights act for any state that has had 15 or more voting rights violations in the last 25 years in the preclearance process as dr king once said give us the ballot and we will fill our legislative halls with menand of course womenwith goodwill we can fill this body with those who really want to see democracy fulfilled so we need our young people to keep up the street heat and demand that congress act it is past time that we get serious about restoring the voting rights act and ensuring that all americansand that means all americanshave free and unobstructed access to the ballot box also the serious economic disparities that persist in the african american community are very very evident according to a report released earlier this year by the joint economic committee led by ranking member congresswoman carolyn maloney and the congressional black caucus we learned and it is very glaring that more than one in three black children are born into poverty and the african american poverty rate is three times that of white americans the cycle of poverty and inequality starts in our school systems where black students account for 42 percent of preschool student expulsions despite accounting for only 18 percent of enrollment now that is preschool expulsion every time i remember this and say this it really makes me very terrified about what is taking place with young black kids especially with young black boys because there is no way anybody no kids should be expelled from preschool that is ages 1 to 4 that is outrageous i am the mother yes of two fabulous great black men and i am the grandmother of two black boys and i find statistics like that very very troubling for african americans we have allowed our school system to be turned into a pipeline to prison we must act now to address systemic issues facing our education and our criminal justice systems i want to applaud congressman bobby scott and congressman conyers because they have worked for decades on criminal justice reform and we are beginning to see some progress as a result of their very diligent work our criminal justice system is broken it needs to be rebuilt from the ground up so alongside of our cbc colleagues once again we are calling for comprehensive criminal justice reform also i want to mention our effort which i cochair with chairman butterfield our tech 2020 initiative silicon valley is right next to my district in california there are great opportunities there for everyone however the tech industry has not been inclusive of hiring and contracting with and working with communities of color especially the african american community so i am very pleased that the tech 2020 of the congressional black caucus has been initiated we are working with our great leader reverend jesse jackson with an insideoutside strategy many of the tech companies understand what is taking place and that they need to be an industry that is inclusive of everyone so the black caucus along with rainbow push along with the tech industry are working on a variety of strategies to make sure that this industry which provides goodpaying jobs and opportunities is an industry that is inclusive that does not discriminate and that includes the diversity of this great country so i have to just say to congresswoman kelly and congressman payne thank you for giving us a chance to talk about so many of the issues that we have been working on when you look at the issue of poverty cutting poverty in half in 10 years we know how to do it we have legislation the half in ten act h r 258 to do that and the pathways out of poverty act h r 2721 we know how to provide opportunities the congressional black caucus once again is leading on all of these fronts it is a big agenda but it is an agenda that makes our country stronger so thank you congresswoman kelly and thank you congressman payne for the chance to be with you tonight"], [0.0016347765922546387, 0.9983652234077454, 1, "first let me thank congresswoman robin kelly and congressman donald payne jr for hosting this important special order i appreciate your leadership in organizing this important discussion on the state of black health in america every april we observe national minority health awareness month this year is particularly significant as we mark 30 years since the groundbreaking health and human services task force on black and minority health report this report sparked the first serious discussion in washington on addressing the deep racial health disparities that exist in this country this year also marks 50 years since the creation of medicare and medicaidprograms that have kept and continue to keep americans healthy we are also celebrating the fifth year anniversary of the passage of the affordable care actthe most significant legislation to improve the health of all americans in more than a generation these legislative achievements continue moving us closer to health equity for allhowever major health disparities still exist the zip code in which you are born still determines your likely life expectancy gross disparities exist from zip code to zip codeeven within the same city or county so today i rise to join my colleagues in the congressional black caucus to bring to light the state of black health in america and call for more action to address persistent and lingering disparities in health access treatment and care since the passage of the affordable care act access to care has dramatically expanded in communities of color the uninsured rate has declined 7 3 percent in the african american community and more people have access to affordable quality healthcareall thanks to the affordable care act when we were crafting the affordable care act i had the privilege of serving as chair of the congressional black caucus and let me tell you we worked day and night with our colleagues in the congressional hispanic caucus and congressional asian pacific american caucus to push congress and the administration to craft the best possible bill since its passage the affordable care act has improved the american health care system healthcare is now more affordable and accessible than ever women can no longer be discriminated against because they are a woman have a preexisting conditionsuch as hiv aidsor have been the victim of domestic violence young people can stay on their parents health insurance until they are 26 and people with serious conditions like cancer no longer face the real fear of hitting their lifetime cap and being denied lifesaving treatment the aca also expands the capacity of the healthcare delivery system to better serve those at risk for and living with hiv aids these are the facts the affordable care act has dramatically increased access to preventative care for women lowincome communities and people of color despite rabblerousing and grandstanding from the right this law is saving livesevery day in communities across americafrom maine to my district in the east bay during the last enrollment period 16 4 million americans obtained health insurance and more than half a million came from my home state of california make no mistakethe affordable care act is working african americans and latinos historically underinsured or uninsured groups have seen the greatest declines in their uninsured rates this is especially good news for african americans who are living with hiv where the key to halting the epidemic is access to affordable and quality care with this increase in coverage we are beginning to close the gap in racial and ethnic health disparities and access to care however much work remains to truly realize health equity in america right nowin america the richest and most powerful country in the worldafrican americans still suffer from disproportionately high numbers of preventable deaths disparities in access to quality health care and underrepresentation within the medical community african americans have the highest mortality rate of any racial and ethnic group from cancer furthermore africanamericans are 40 more likely to die from a stroke than whites and 30 more likely to die from heart disease than whites and while african americans are only 13 of the unitedstates population they account for nearly half of all new hiv infections african americans also account for the highest hivrelated deaths and hiv death rates madam speakerthis is unacceptable in an age where technology and innovation are paving the way to new medical breakthroughs these persistent disparities in healthcare cannot be allowed to continue that is why today i urge my colleagues lets work together and commit ourselves to passing legislation that will end racial and ethnic disparities and achieve health equity the affordable care act was a good start but more is needed for years the congressional tricaucus has championed this effort by introducing the health equity and accountability act heaa congresswoman robin kelly will have the honor in introducing this important legislation this congress and i am proud to colead this effort as cochair of the capac health task force this important legislation builds on the affordable care act and puts us on track to eliminate health disparities in our country the health equity and accountability act would address incidences of terminal and chronic diseases that disproportionally affect communities of color including cancer diabetes heart disease and hiv aids so in recognition of national minority health awareness month i urge my colleagues to support this important bill in order to truly achieve health equity for all

include the passage of a budget resolution in fact it was thencongressman ryan who in 2012 stated that failing to enact a budget has serious consequences for american families there are at least three current health crises that we are trying to deal with in america and throughout the world but republicans have abdicated their responsibility the zika virus the flint water crisis and the opioid

congressman dan kildee who are fighting every day to bring justice to these families their work is essential to ensuring the people of flint have the resources that they need to recover the situation in flint is nothing short of a tragedy and a tragedy that could have been prevented michigan state officials sacrificed the health and futures of flints children in order to save a few dollars in water costs this really is a shame and a disgrace i have to ask would this have happened in a city where the residents had the advantage of wealth or do these gross breaches of public trust only happen in cities where politicians believe the residents are expendable sadly i think we all know the answer to that question after the incredible harm that has already been done to these families our elected officials are once again turning their backs on the people of flint these families deserve better the people of flint were already hurting before the water crisis the average family income in the city is just 24 834 a year no one can raise a family on that many of these courageous and resilient families struggle to find highquality child care access healthcare services and afford healthy food and now the costs of this crisis are mounting for families the schools and the entire community we can and we must do more for our fellow americans in their time of need two years since this tragedy began families are still relying on bottled water for daily life imagine using bottled water for everything from brushing your teeth to making a bottle for a hungry baby we can do better by these families they need support including health care nutrition specialized education and developmental care and we need to fix the root of the problem the degraded dangerous pipes and infrastructure that caused this tragedy the shortsighted dangerous actions of michigan officials have already caused unimaginable pain for these families we cannot allow congress to betray these families as well let me just say that i was part of a congressional delegation that traveled to flint michigan to listen to the residents regarding the horrendous impact of these government decisions that led to the poisoning of those children and families the environmental injustice in flint is an example of how many lowincome communities of color throughout our country not just in flint throughout the united states an example of how they are treated differently than affluent communities congressman dan kildee and members of the michigan delegation have introduced legislation that would help these families rebuild their lives and get the care they need for their children the families of flint act h r 4479 is a comprehensive plan to address their most urgent needs it would provide for critical investment in flints water system to replace the lead pipes that poisoned these families this legislation would also provide essential support services to the families of flint to help these children mitigate and overcome lead exposure these are simple commonsense measures for the people of flint addressing this tragedy really shouldnt be a partisan issue every member of this chamber should understand the need for urgent action it could happen in any of our communities yet congressional republicans have not held one single vote or even a hearing on this bill that is just simply outrageous and let me just say that flint is not the only public health crisis that congressional republicans have ignored there are 17 000 americansincluding almost 1 600 pregnant womenwho have contracted the zika virus the president submitted an emergency request of 1 9 billion for zika funding more than 6 months ago and the republicans have failed to act on it now if we dont act soon the cdc will be out of money to combat zika in a matter of weeks congressional republicans also failed to do their job on gun violence every day more than 90 million people die from gun violence this too is a public health crisis but congressional republicans once again have refused to take up any commonsense gun legislation even though 91 percent of americans support background checks to keep guns out of the hands of

forest management and i really appreciate your leadership on the house agriculture committee as chairman of our subcommittee on conservation and forestry most recently the subcommittee held a hearing on the 2015 wildfire season and longterm fire trends a muchneeded hearing recognizing the concerns and urgent needs of many of our members who watched their districts and states burn to unprecedented levels this year what is abundantly clear from the testimony we heard especially that of forest service chief tidwell was how crippling the current wildfire budget system is to the agency and how frankly it prevents the forest service from carrying out its congressionally mandated mission the current process for funding wildfire suppression is inefficient and wastes taxpayer dollars once the forest service exhausts their wildfire suppression budget the agency is then forced to transfer funds from nonfire programs which are often needed to prevent fires in order to support the immediate emergency needs of fire suppression 1845 in the last fiscal year fy15 the forest service spent 700 million more than what congress initially appropriated since 2004 the forest service has needed eight supplemental appropriations this is now the norm not the exception this years wildfire season devastated much of the western united states the forest service spent 1 7 billion fighting these fires more than 9 million acres were burned thousands of homes and other infrastructures were lost and 13 firefighters lost their lives in the line of duty while i am thankful new mexico avoided any big fires this year i know firsthand how devastating fires can be for 3 years in a row new mexico endured the biggest fires the state has ever seen the whitewaterbaldy complex las conchas and the gila fires devastated our land our resources and our communities these fires are natural disasters that require emergency response and recovery and should frankly be funded the same way as hurricanes floods and tornados now it is clear to me that congress needs to urgently fix this funding problem before more communities are destroyed and lives are lost in addition to the fire borrowing issue congress also has to address the rising 10year suppression cost average for wildfires rising wildfire costs means that less funding is going to nonfire forest service employees and programs each year because of this the forest service now has fewer resources for recreation research and development and road maintenance there are also fewer resources to carry out activities and projects that many say we need more of such as nepa analysis timber contracts timber salvage controlled burns and other forest service management activities lack of resources often means that these projects get delayed or canceled and we arent just talking about forest service projects they are projects in each of our districts that are developed by our own constituents and partners within each of these communities now i understand that the broken wildfire budget and rising costs are only part of the problem wildfires are burning bigger and more intense than ever before climate change is causing more drought higher temperatures bringing new diseases and pests to new areas and changing the vegetation on the ground our forests are not the same forests that they were 50 years ago or even 20 years ago climate change is undoubtedly changing our forest dynamics and we must make our forests more resilient fixing the broken wildfire budgeting process is the most effective thing congress can do to begin to address the devastating wildfires that are plaguing this country i also agree that we need more management work done on the ground so lets work together to ensure that the forest service has sufficient resources to do their work i understand that there have been talks on both the house and senate side about including a budget fix in the upcoming omnibus but that a deal remains elusive because some parties are unwilling to address the budget caps in order for wildfires to get treated as exactly what they are as natural disasters this would treat wildfire natural disasters just like

search warrant on a home on a quiet street officers terrified the sleeping family but did not find any drugs when they entered the home during the raid a 2yearold child baby bou bou was badly burned when the officers tossed a flashbang grenade into his playpen which was located in a darkened room the officers justified their actions by saying that their intelligence indicated that there would be no children present as an editorial in the washington post noted a flashbang grenade is an explosive device that emits a deafening boom and a blinding flash of light it is designed to temporarily stun the occupants of a building so that the armed men who deployed it can clear the building it is an instrument of war my amendment is simple it would prohibit the transfer of flashbang grenades from the department of defense to local law enforcement the department of defenses 1033 program has helped to sometimes distort the relationship between the police and the communities they serve by allocating over 5 billion in surplus military equipment to local police including flashbang grenades nothing in current law prevents the military from giving police including school and university police departments flashbang grenades allowing this loophole to exist puts our communities at risk of increasing militarization while we have real tensions across the country our police and their communities are not at war funneling free military equipment to the police however helps to further deepen the divide in our communities the same washington post article i mentioned earlier cited over a dozen incidents in recent years where police injured themselves or others while using flashbang grenades this amendment is not about regulating what types of equipment law enforcement agencies should or should not have instead it is about whether this congress should purchase flashbang grenades for fighting wars abroad and then allow these flashbang grenades to be transferred by the department of defense back to local law enforcement agencies for use here at home local governments in consultation with law enforcement agencies that they oversee should decide what types of equipment the law enforcement agencies can acquire law enforcement agencies should not unilaterally make that decision independent of civilian authority the local government can purchase whatever equipment they deem necessary for use by the agencies under their control through the local budgeting process and they can also seek financial assistance through federal grants this amendment doesnt touch grant money or state or local governments freedom to purchase the equipment they need the local budget process and federal grant programs involve making choices based on need and funding the 1033 program is an unregulated pipeline of free equipment directly from the pentagon to the law enforcement agency when the equipment is free and is plentiful and civilian authority is not involved the calculus is very simple why not accept free gifts of military equipment however if acquiring this equipment militarizes our police departments beyond comprehension what kind of community policing are we actually performing or are we just simply occupying this amendment is very common sense we should consider whether or not we want our country to move in this direction of militarization and we certainly need our civilian authorities to be involved in that process so the consequences are too dangerous to keep proliferating this weaponry on our streets and i would ask that my colleagues support this

many places in which the statutes and regulations small businesses must understand are overly complex this problem is compounded by inconsistencies in the language for example there are entire sections of the small business act that are one long sentence with multiple commas and clauses the act also predates many other statutes and regulations that we now use to govern how agencies purchase goods and services as such the act uses outdated terminology when discussing federal contracting additionally there are places in which the definitions vary between the act and the corresponding regulations one such case is when a contract must be reserved for award to small businesses while the act indicates that contracts valued over 2 000 and below 100 000 are to be reserved for small businesses other statutes and even sbas own regulations point to different values or use the terms the values are supposed to represent this causes confusion not only among small businesses but also

support of another such example the foreign aid transparency and accountability act of 2015 this bill is a project i have worked on with judge poe for a number of years now in the 112th congress a previous iteration of the bill passed this body by a unanimous vote we hope for a similar outcome in this congress and for quick senate consideration and passage the bill directs the president to establish monitoring and evaluation guidelines for the 22 federal agencies that are charged with implementing some piece of development and economic assistance the guidelines will require m e plans as part of the project development process and agencies will be encouraged to incorporate the findings of evaluations and impact studies into subsequent foreign assistance programs this feedback loop will include measurable goals performance metrics and a clearinghouse for lessons learned on unitedstates led aid projects something long overdue after 60plus years of foreign aid additionally the legislation requires that the documents and reports created under this m e regime be made available to the public on foreignassist ance gov this administration has developed an encouraging record on foreign aid transparency the foreign assistance dashboard which was created in 2010 is a great example of demonstrating a promising inclination toward disclosure that we hope to enshrine in this law this measure will strengthen and codify those transparency best practices to ensure that they exist as agency policy under future administrations that might not be as accommodating of the aid communitys demand for this information aid programs that are held accountable for their performance and results can be made more effective and their impact on communities and countries abroad can be more easily demonstrated perhaps with more information we can dispel the commonly held belief that 26 percent of our budget goes to foreign aid when as my friend judge poe pointed out it is actually less than 1 percent the unitedstates foreign assistance operation does not lack passion the men and women who put themselves in harms way overseas and who take their families to remote areas of the world often dangerous in the interest of helping vulnerable populations are certainly not seeking fame glory or fortune they do it because they can envision a path to prosperity in even the most povertystricken areas of the world and they see the promise of democracy in the face of the most repressive and authoritarian regimes while our passion is welldefined our mission and metrics are not regarding our mission i was a staffer on the senate foreign relations committee the last time congress actually passed a foreign aid authorization bill in 1986 the original foreign assistance act of 1961 which judge poe cited listed five principal goals for foreign aid today we have more than 260 some are competing and some are redundant what is our core mission today until january 2014 usaids mission statement read as follows usaid accelerates human progress in developing countries by reducing poverty advancing democracy building market economies promoting security responding to crises and improving quality of life working with governments institutions and civil society we assist individuals to build their own futures by mobilizing the full range of americas public and private resources through our expert presence overseas that is not a clear mission statement i am hopeful this bill will help us focus on the foreign assistance operations while i think we have some distance to travel in streamlining the legislative construct for foreign assistance and clearly articulating our mission we have an opportunity today to make immense progress toward establishing badly needed metrics for aid programs with the passage of this bill it is time to apply a datadriven approach to constructing an assistance operation that has the support of both this congress and of a wellinformed public i urge my colleagues to support this bill again i particularly thank my friend judge poe for his leadership for his initiative and for his vision with respect to this subject i know it is going to actually make unitedstates foreign assistance investments in the future a lot more effective and a lot more accountable"]]}
