investigation because we were not charged with making a criminal investigation what we were charged with doing was finding out what went wrong and recommending new administrative procedures in the post office so it would never happen again and we did that but the nature of the testimony we took was very very different and taken under very very different circumstances than you would if you were pursuing a criminal investigation in fact the witnesses were told and i have to tell you it was a republican counsel who first said this and i do not mean to blame republicans but only to indicate

and are more interested than anyone else in this country in preserving the environment of this country let these true environmentalists use their judgement dont impose the agenda of activists who
