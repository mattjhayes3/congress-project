down not only did we vote to abolish medicare increasing costs for seniors lowering benefits while giving tax breaks to oil companies and corporations for shipping jobs overseas not only have we done that once but were going to do it again today on a day that were going to swear in a new member of congress a reminder that all of us takes an oath of office to protect and defend and this bill the bill that this rule comes up on homeland security undermines the ability to protect and defend the american people so this is a double whammy its a threat again to the health and economic security of our seniors and those who depend on medicare and it is a threat to the safety of the american people i heard my colleague mr markey talk about purgatory and rapture and the rest in his original and effective presentation and it reminded me what we always say when we talk about a budget that it should be a statement of our values what is important to us should be reflected there our budget proposalswe had one under the leadership of chris van hollen that was heard and voted on by the floor a number of weeks ago a republican budget that is on the floor today in the form of this ruleare windows to the soul of whom we are as public officials and this rule today which deems passage of the republican budget is a window to the soul of the republican party and this house of representatives giving tax subsidies to big oil would benefit corporations that shift jobs overseas and would give tax cuts to the wealthiest people in our country while it says to seniors no more medicare for you youre going to pay more get less and weaken the middle class at the same time weakening the middle class because of abolishing medicare and weakening the middle class because of what it does to education for our young children and making college more expensive for nearly 10 million young people in our country is that an investment in the future i dont think so but its really important when we talk about our soul and our values and what our priorities are that we note that a vote for this bill is a really serious assault on the middle class people are concerned about the dignity and retirement of our seniors they are concerned about the education of our children they want to reduce the deficit we must create jobs growth in our economy will help reduce the deficit this bill does none of the above so again its about what we believe in i have to give you credit for this that the republicans are true to what they believe in they do not believe in medicare and they are

families make informed decisions regarding the care they needed or the care their loved ones needed i provided a professional opinion based on the facts and sometimes had to convey information and news to patients and their families that they didnt want to hear i came here to tell the american people the truth that sometimes can be difficult to hear but the american people deserve the truth about whats happening with health care in this country the majority of my patients were medicare patients we know that medicare is one of the main drivers of our longterm systemic debt i want to reiterate that on may 13 the medicare board of trustees released their annual report on the programs financial status in it the medicare trustees stated that the hospital insurance trust fund will become insolvent in 2024 thats within 13 years 5 years sooner than last year was predicted and from a physicians standpoint according to the american medical association one in three primary care doctors is currently limiting medicare patients in their practice and one in eight physicians is forced to refuse medicare patients altogether due to the cuts already that have been made in the medicare program and with the medicare population estimated to double by 2030 to approximately 70 million americans imagine the access problems were going to have then today the average couple that turns 65 has paid in over 100 000 to the medicare program but is receiving over 300 000 in benefits this is not a sustainable model without significant reforms beneficiaries in the future are going to be at risk for limited access to quality care they deserve and they count on and ultimately face rationing of care waiting lists and dramatic cuts to current seniors based only on the cost not based on what dr roe has said the quality of care or what type of care they need but based on the money alone anyone promoting the status quo is dooming medicare to failure and soon its coming up in 2024 our plan doesnt affect any american over age 55 they have counted on these benefits but what it does is preserves the program for future americans again the status quo is dooming medicare to failure and soon congressional democrats and the current administration have offered no plan to date except the independent payment advisory board that dr roe and others have been talking about in the

maybe the silver bulletif you listen to them tell the storyto control costs but what ipab really will do is will recommend cuts be made to the programnot savings cuts were talking about here cms will then make those recommendations to congress unless we get a twothirds vote they go in play they start to happen we have given up as dr roe said our congressional authority to do something about the future of health care for our citizens this is a misguided approach that will again empower this group of unaccountable bureaucrats to determine the type of health care you may receive based on your age and your health health care decisions are best made when left up to the patient and their doctor you and your doctor and your family know whats best for you not the government and i want to finish by saying for me personally this is about the future of health care for the american people i fear for what the future may holdaccess problems waiting lists rationing of care look at other countries that have socialized medicine all of these things are occurring this may be based on your age based on your health we dont know what theyre going to be based on in the future it could be based on

working in the swampy fields bordering lake apopka in florida their backbreaking work helped to provide the bulk of the winter season produce on the eastern seaboard in the early 1990s a settlement was negotiated with the large farming corporations where 20 000 acres of land were sold for roughly 100 million a negligible amount of 200 000 was allocated for the 2 500 farmworkers and most were simply given pink slips despite decades of service on the farm for years these workers were exposed to a chemical mixture of carcinogens and other contaminants as planes cropdusted the fields now

good health what they ask for more than anything else is their dignity dignity is the contribution of their community to feeding this nation and the sacrifices they made in doing so i would therefore

colleagues heard in the last election but what i heard was that we needed jobs it is clearand i hope that we can see thiswe have been here for 5 weeks plus and the number of jobs that have been created by the republicans is zero so here we are now with a 15 percent cut on pell grants what does that mean it means that schools all around the nation will not be able to provide pell grants to the individual students who need them in fact in my own district with this 15 percent cut this 5 550 going down to 4 705 will drastically impact students in my constituency for example the cuts will jeopardize education and the future of 16 570 students who are currently dependent on pell grants in order to finance their education 5 726 are currently studying at texas southern university and 10

republicans created zero i always want to bring this chart which is very hard to see but we can see how many jobs we lost in the last administration we are on the rise of creating jobs in fact the cbo said that our future is great it will not be great with a misguided plan to eliminate 600 million from the pell grant program it is absolutely absurd for example let me share with you thoughts from the new york times this cr is ideologically driven we started with a 74 billion cut but because the republicans decided that it is preferable to abide by polls they decided to move to a draconian and ludicrous 100 billion that means that 600 million was cut from pell grants in addition to an amendment that i did not offer the nih we see that those grants that were competitive for fellowships and research have also been drastically cut at texas southern university and at the university of houston and many state institutions in texas are impacted by the cuts of the nih grants but this is the greatest sin in a meeting that i had with my community colleges and my school districts they were in complete panic about losing pell grants that will then impact on the wonderful upsurge of jobs from what we had lost in the last administration i would simply ask my colleagues why are we going down a pathway that would take away the growth that we have provided so i would ask as we look to the future that this be restored my amendment and ms chus amendmentthe one that i joined and the one that i intended to speak onwas in fact to restore these dollars a new wall street journal survey of economists shows they expect the economy to expand at the fastest pace since 2003 but not with these draconian cuts why wouldnt they do as the presidents budget has done which is to get rid of the 2 percent tax cuts for the billionaires we might be able to provide 600 million for students but no we want to i guess stand with ideological viewpoints and with individuals who say i was sent here to budget cut you were sent here to govern you were sent here to protect the american people students who will create the workforce of the 21st century you are now telling them they cant get an education let me say this the constitution reminds us of what a wonderful country we live ina country that believes we all are created equal we dont have the same economic opportunities meaning the same wealth but we do have the ability to access education through wonderful programs like the pell grant program now youre telling poor and lowincome students the door is closed the lights are out youre not equal and you dont deserve an education i would say that this is an abomination support the amendments that will provide for 600 million restored to the pell grants i ask my colleagues to vote for the amendment mr chair i move to strike the last word h r 1 the continuing resolution making appropriations to fund the federal government through september 20 2011 contains some very deep cuts that will be very hurtful to many americans especially those who are the most vulnerabledisadvantaged women and families children minorities the elderly and our nations university students the proposed cuts in the cr will have a disproportionate effect on the lowincome and minority portions of our population as we face a large deficit and growing debt we know that cuts will have to be made and yes some of those cuts will be painful however we must be careful not to place added burdens and cause greater harms to those americans who are the most vulnerable and in need of our support the most the proposed cr calls for a 15 percent reduction in funding for pell grants such a cut will reduce the maximum pell grant award from its current level of 5 550 to 4 705 this would present a serious problem for institutions of higher learning but more importantly it creates a major hardship on students current students who receive pell grants would have to figure out a way to come up with nearly an additional 1 000 in order to continue their education students who have been accepted to school and have received their financial aid packages are also put in a position that would force them to find and secure additional funds for their schooling pell grants provide the basic foundation of federal student aid and help more than 8 million students afford to attend college to some of us 800 1 000 may not seem significant however to a student who qualifies for pell grant assistance and relies on those funds this would be a great hardship potentially forcing students to take time off from their schooling in my district in houston tx these cuts will jeopardize the education and future of 16 570 students who are currently dependent on pell grants in order to finance their education5 726 currently studying at texas southern university and 10 847 at university of houston 16 570 students in one congressional district alone will be unfairly affected by these cuts in the entire state of

that almost no member is willing to vote against something that has the word security attached to it but i wish that most members would consider these words from ian lustick professor lustick is a professor at the university of pennsylvania and he wrote several years after 9 11 about the war on terror money feeding frenzy he wrote this after september 11 2001 what accounts for the vast discrepancy between the terrorist threat facing america and the scale of our response why absent any evidence of a serious domestic terror threat is the war on terror so enormous so all encompassing and still expanding the fundamental answer is that al qaedas most important accomplishment was not to hijack our planes but to hijack our political system for a multitude of politicians interest groups professional associations corporations media organizations universities local and state governments and federal agency officials the war on terror is now a major profit center a funding bonanza and a set of slogans and sound bites to be inserted into budget project grant and contract proposals for the country as a whole however it has been a maelstrom of waste he pointed out an example that even dunkin donuts franchises had received 22 million in federal counterterrorism loans in addition to that shortly after 9 11 when every government department and agency was requesting more money for security the wall street journal carried an editorial that said any bill with the word security in it should get double the public scrutiny and maybe four times the normal wait lest all kinds of bad legislation become law under the phony guise of fighting terrorism unfortunately we havent followed the guidance of professor lustick or the wall street journal i thought of these writings by mr lustick and the wall street journal when i read two recent articles on december 20 2 months ago vanity fair magazine carried an article on its web site which said as you stand in endless lines this holiday season heres a comforting thought all those security measures accomplish nothing at enormous costs the magazine said since 9 11 the government has spent more than 1 1 trillion on homeland security then the article added this to a large number of security analysts this expenditure makes no sense the vast cost is not worth the infinitesimal benefit not only has the actual threat been exaggerated they say but the great bulk of the post9 11 measures to contain it are little more than security theater actions that accomplish nothing but are designed to make the government look like it is on the job in fact the continuing expenditure on security may actually have made the united states less safe and then a second article by abc news probably the most needless useless agency in the entire federal government is the air marshal service usa today once reported that more air marshals had been arrested than were arrests by air marshals talk about a soft easy job all these people do is ride back and forth on airplanes back and forth back and forth mostly in first class a few days ago abc news reported that air marshals took taxpayerpaid trips to visit families and to go to vacation spots one supervisor was even photographed asleep on a flight while carrying a loaded pistol abc reported that managers at the air marshal service acted like a bunch of school yard punks and that they repeatedly made fun of blacks latinos and gays according to agency insiders i guess they had too much time on their hands and too little to do i know as i said earlier that its almost impossible to get congress to vote against anything that claimed to be for security but this almost 1 billion that we give to air marshals each year is a total complete waste when we go ridiculously overboard on security we are taking money away from individuals and families who really need it and taking money away from other good things on which this money could be spent"], [0.9953805208206177,

who participated in bringing osama bin laden to justice and it really wasnt a victory over one person or one leader but a blow to the entire network to the belief system of those that believe violence killing innocent men women and children of all religions is a way to promote your political gains if you think about the incredible accomplishment that happened after and started really after 9 11 we had to make up for huge gaps in humint intelligence and through the help of this body and this congress and president bush and then on to president obama we began to reassemble the abilities and capabilities of our intelligence community through interrogations information was developed about how al qaeda works and we understood its logistics how it finances and recruits and moves people how it recruits people to do suicide bombings how it plans operations all of that came in the early days then 5 years ago through an integration there was a little piece of information a nickname applied to an alias with someone who was hanging around other folks who were probably using nicknames applied to an alias who may be a courier for osama bin laden and through all of our collection agencies signals intelligence satellite intelligence other forms of intelligence a case was slowly and surely developed that finally allowed with a few lucky breaks and some great determination from our intelligence community the ability to locate the place where they believed osama bin laden was hiding out once that was determined they brought in our special forces community who did an exceptional and superb job in bringing him to justice in what was a difficult situation so i want to compliment mr reed and mr grimm for bringing this amendment forward to give a small sense of recognition to all of the work on behalf of the entire intelligence and special forces community and the soldiers too who risked their lives in holding ground in places like afghanistan to reestablish security there so that al qaeda wont find safe haven there when they leave all of those things and all of those capabilities are incredibly important all of that service and all of that sacrifice led to last sundays successful event let us not forget al qaeda may be hurt they have lost their operational and inspirational leader but they are not down this is not the time to back off this is not the time to say

a conference so that we really can iron this out and make sure that there is not a raising to the 6 8 percent it kind of makes you wonder it just seems like the political maneuvering certainly is

prevention and public health fund that will remain available to individuals who seek preventive care such as cancer prevention and care including breast and cervical cancer screenings screenings for birth defects and developmental disabilities tobacco prevention at the cdc and efforts that promote healthy nutrition and physical activity to prevent obesity so i think that this really is a lot that we believe in for prevention and we heard from mr stearns all of the appropriations and how that takes care of a lot of the prevention issues i think that the american people are really very knowledgeable now about prevention and what they need to do and have the ability to do this on their own as well this political bickering is not what the bill is all about what the bill is all about

are to be issued we have to do it with probable cause and describe in particular the places the people and the things that we are going to look at i think what has happened though over the years has been that we have diluted the fourth amendment it was greatly diluted in 2001 but it started a lot earlier than that when the fisa law was originally written in 1978 that really introduced the notion that the fourth amendment was relative and not absolute later on it was further weakened in 1998 and then of course in i think our reaction to the horrors of 9 11we can understand the concern and the fear that was developed but i think the reaction took us in the wrong direction because the assumption was made of course that we werent spending enough money on surveillance even though then our intelligence agencies received 40 billion that didnt give us the right information so now we are spending 80 billion but it also looks like the conclusion was that the american people had too much privacy and if we undermine the american peoples privacy somehow or another we are going to be safer i think another thing that has come up lately has been that the purpose of government is to make us perfectly safe now it is good to be safe but governments cant make us safe i question whether or not we have been made safer by the patriot act but lets say a law makes us somewhat safer is that a justification for the government to do anything they want for instance if you want to be perfectly safe from child abuse and wife beating the government could put a camera in every one of our houses and our bedrooms and maybe there would be somebody made safer this way but what would you be giving up so perfect safety is not the purpose of government what we want from government is to enforce the law and to protect our liberties this to me has been especially since 9 11 a classical example of sacrificing liberty for safety and security now i didnt invent those terms they have been around a long time and it is easily justified and i can understand it because i was here in 2001 when this came up and people become frightened and the american people want something done but i think this is misdirected and it doesnt serve our benefits i think at this time we should really question why we are extending this we are extending the three worst parts why were these sunsetted because people had concern about them they werent sure they were good pieces and maybe they were overkill and therefore they were saying we had better reassess it so what have we done we have already extended it twice
