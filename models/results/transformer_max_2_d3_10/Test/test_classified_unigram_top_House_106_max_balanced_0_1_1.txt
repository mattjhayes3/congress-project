legislation the social security and medicare safe deposit box act of 1999 how many of us over the last 30 years and i have only been in the house and had the privilege of serving here for the last 42 years have been asked in town meetings and senior citizens centers union halls vfws and other public forums when is washington going to stop dipping into when is washington going to stop raiding the social security trust fund to spend social security on other things other than social security today we are going to pass legislation that will do that that will stop the raid on social security let us review the history here for over 30 years now washington has been dipping into the s6cial security fund regardless of the rhetoric on the other side where they say it has not it has gone on back when president johnson and the democratcontrolled congress 30 years ago began raiding the social security trust fund they have run up quite a bill according to the social security trustees appointed by president clinton the social security trust fund has been raided by more than 730 billion over the last 30 years i have a check here written on the social security trust fund it is a blank check washington for the last 30 years has used the social security trust fund as a slush fund and as a blank check to pay for other programs this walls off the social security trust fund and puts a stop for those who want to raid it we set aside those funds for social security and for medicare i believe that is an important first step setting aside 100 percent of social security and locking it away before we consider any other reforms or changes to social security let us lock it away first that is an important first step we can use those funds to strengthen medicare and social security this legislation accomplishes this goal i would like to point out of course that not only is the social security and medicare safe deposit box a centerpiece of this years balanced budget but there is a big difference between the clintongore democratic budget and the republican budget the republican budget sets aside 100 percent of social security for social security the 137 billion social security surplus this year will go to social security if we compare that with the clintongore democrat budget that only uses 62 percent of social security for social security and the clintongore democrat budget spends 52 billion of social security money on other things all good programs education defense things like that but the clintongore democrat budget raids the social security trust fund this lockbox will prevent the clintongore raid on social security i would also point out that the social security and medicare safe deposit box sets aside 1 8 trillion the president talks about 62 percent sixtytwo percent is 1 3 billion over the next 10 years clintongore will raid the social security trust fund by 12 billion let us put a stop to it"], [0.00015191998681984842, 0.00015191998681984842, 0,

500 000 had gone into exile at the end of 1923 all of the armenian residents of anatolia and western armenia had been either killed or deported the genocide was criticized at the time by unitedstates

perpetrated by his predecessors and yet this forthright and sober analysis has been spurned by turkey and the united states during the last decade the intransigence of this and prior administrations to recognizing and commemorating the armenian genocide demonstrates our continued difficulty in reconciling the lessons of history with real politic policies that is those who fail to learn the lessons of history are condemned to repeat them we have seen continually in this century the abject failure to learn and apply this basic principle the armenian genocide has been followed by the holocaust against the jews and mass killings in kurdistan rwanda burundi and the balkans many of these situations are ongoing and in most cases there seems little apparent sense of urgency or moral

wouldnt have been able to fool if theyd thought i was smarter how and why shoeless joe jackson got his name is exaggerated one day after getting blisters from his new baseball cleats jackson played one game in his stocking feet one game not a season and not because he could not afford to buy cleats as is widely reported then there is the wellknown refrain say it aint so joe that supposedly took place after jackson was arrested for conspiring to throw the 1919 world series as the story goes a boy approached joe and pleaded say it aint so joe and joe replied yes kid im afraid it is as jackson would later tell it that tale is just that there was no kid and no arrest charlie owens a reporter with the chicago daily times made the story up and published it what is the truth about joe jackson he was a rising baseball star until he was banned from baseball for allegedly participating in the 1919 chicago white sox gambling scandal in 1921 jackson was acquitted of all charges and left the courtroom an innocent man however despite three attempts by his home state of south carolina joe jackson was never reinstated the only interview joe jackson conducted regarding the chicago white sox scandal was in the 1949 edition of sport magazine in the article entitled this is the truth joe jackson maintains his innocence and states i have never made any request to be reinstated in baseball and i have never made any campaign to have my name cleared in the baseball records this is not a plea of any kind this is just my story i am telling it simply because it seems 30 years after the world series the world may want to hear what i have to say he goes on to say baseball failed to keep faith with me when i got notice of my suspension 3 days after the 1920 season it read that if found innocent of any wrongdoing i would be reinstated if found guilty i would be banned for life i was found innocent and i was still banned for life it would seem that you are innocent until proven guilty

governor bush also has put out a statement calling for the full implementation of the patten commission report which shows that this clearly is a bipartisan issue it is an issue on which all men and woman of goodwill can stand together what we are faced with tonight today and for the next weeks and months in the north of ireland is a true crisis if the good friday agreement is premised on concession and compromise the good friday agreement itself was a compromise the good friday agreement itself was based on very strong concessions made by all sides particularly by the catholic community the nationalist community the republican community who made very deep concessions in return for a pledge by the british and irish governments that all the provisions of the good friday agreement would be carried out no provision was more important in the patten commission than the section dealing with police reform because in the north of ireland for three decades the royal ulster constabulary was guilty of the most vicious and gross human rights violations imaginable it is hard for us as americans to envision in the english speaking world in the united kingdom which stands for the magna carta and justice and law that there was such brutality systematically carried out not the type of brutalities that occur by accident not those that are incidental but brutalities that were root and branch a part of the policing in northern ireland torture murder of children intentional killings intentionally maimings this was all part of the police policy in the north of ireland so the police have to be reformed that was an integral part the integral part of the good friday agreement and the patten commission which was chaired by chris patten a conservative mp a former conservative mp a minister in margaret thatchers government he came up with a series of reforms which again were themselves a compromise there is much that is lacking as the gentleman from new jersey chairman smith has pointed out time and again the patten commission itself the patten commission recommendations themselves are deficient yet now the british government is attempting to compromise the compromise it is attempting to water down the compromise of the patten commission to come out with a series of reforms that will not be reforms at all it will just be a readjustment of the status quo it will be a continuation of the royal ulster constabulary not even under a new name because the old name will still remain it will be a subset but it will still be there and this is wrong the entire peace process is at risk the entire peace process is being put at risk by the british government by the ulster unionist party and probably nothing is more aggravating than to hear someone like david trimble who is head of the ulster unionist party to say that we in the congress should not get involved that the american government should not get involved the reality is that on the night the good friday agreement was reached and the morning that it was signed david trimble would not sign it until he was assured by president clinton that the unitedstates would stay involved and now that we are involved he is saying that we should get out and back away from the agreement and allow it to go back to the status quo the way it was for three decades and seven decades and even three centuries if we want to go all the way back where the catholic community was systematically discriminated against and had their rights violated it is essential for us in the congress to stand together it is essential for the president to speak out as clearly as he has in the past to let the british government know to let tony blair know let the british secretary of state peter mandelson know that they cannot continue to violate the rights of catholics they cannot take the nationalist community for granted the fact is an agreement was signed an international agreement and the british government has the absolute obligation to enforce that agreement it cannot back down and cannot succumb to blackmail from david trimble because if it does it puts at risk the entire peace process and we will go back

is a product of the legislative process and it is a product of a legislative process in a democracy which means it is a good bill with some imperfections personally i would like to see some changes in the manufactured housing section i want to talk about manufactured housing briefly manufactured housing is a very important housing resource particularly for people of limited income it has not been given the respect it deserves in our law this legislation on the whole with regard to the regulation of manufactured housing the ability of the manufactured housing industry to produce the housing and the rights of the people who live in it improves the law in this area it does not improve it enough in my judgment but i believe that taken overall the provisions in this legislation are better than existing law it will be my intention to work in the future to try to further improve it but i do want to stress that this is in part a recognition of the importance of manufactured housing as a housing resource particularly for people of moderate incomes and it also improves the situation insufficiently but improvement is better than the alternative and i therefore support the bill i appreciate the chairmans acknowledging particularly in this colloquy that we do intend to give hud some flexibility in carrying this out there are other important provisions in the bill there are provisions that do not on the whole commit new resources to housing let me say i regret that we were not able to work that out there were in many quarters both here and in the other body people willing to add some funds for the production of housing but in the constraints of the legislative process we did not get the unanimity that we needed for that i want to express my appreciation to those on both sides of the aisle and both sides of the building who were interested in that i hope that no matter who is in control of this place next year and no matter who is the president we will address the important issue of housing production we have a housing crisis in this country we have an economy that is booming and has helped many people but it does not help everybody equally and some people are not helped at all there are many people in this country whoare living in areas where some have prospered in this new economy and they have not and the result has been an exacerbation of a housing crisis from which they suffer i think we have an obligation morally and it makes sense economically to help with the production of housing indeed many parts of the country including the one i represent the high cost of housing and lack of affordability becomes a problem in trying to employ public employees one of the things we have in this bill is an effort to deal with the stress that has been placed financially on public employees who are expected to live in a certain community but cannot afford to live there because of these trends it also becomes a problem for employers it becomes a problem in trying to get a rational distribution of employees so i again note that this bill has some good things in it but the thing that it has in it involves flexibility in the use of existing resources those are important and i am glad to be supportive of the bill that provides them but they leave undone the important task of getting into a production program and i look forward to our being able to do that next year i was pleased in the conversations that went on around the appropriations bill and this bill to see a number of people agreeing that it is time to get back into a flexibleand thoughtful housing production program to help with the affordability crisis and i look forward to us being able to work on that together next year there are provisions in this bill that also deal with the problems of people who live in subsidized housing and whose owners use provisions of the law that have been put in years ago that were pretty dumb provisions but none of us here voted for them and so we were stuck with them it allows people who owned housing and who benefited from federal subsidies now as the economy has changed and as the areas that they have their housing has changed to throw out in effect the subsidized tenants to turn affordable housing into unaffordable housing this bill has some provisions that further help the tenant unfortunately we will lose some of those units eventually when the tenants move out or move on but this bill does do something to help and therefore overall despite the gaps it is very much worth supporting"],

from a column by paul harvey i quote for the life of me i cannot understand what could have gone wrong in littleton colorado if only the parents had kept their children away from guns we wouldnt have had such a tragedy yeah it must have been the guns it couldnt have been because half of our children are being raised in broken homes it couldnt have been because our children get to spend an average of 30 seconds in meaningful conversation with their parents each day after all we give our children quality time it couldnt have been because we treat our children as pets and our pets as children it couldnt have been because we place our children in day care centers where they learn their socialization skills from their peers under the law of the jungle while employees who have no vested interest in the children look on and make certain that no blood is spilled it couldnt have been because we allow our children to watch on average 7 hours of television every day filled with the glorification of sex and violence that is not fit for adult consumption it couldnt have been because we allow our children to enter into virtual worlds in which to win the game one must kill as many opponents as possible in the most sadistic way possible it couldnt have been because we sterilized and contracepted our families down to sizes so small that the children that we do have are so spoiled with material things that they come to equate the receiving of material with love it couldnt have been because our children who historically have been seen as a blessing from god are now being viewed as either a mistake created when contraception fails or inconveniences that parents try to raise in their spare time it could not have been because our nation has become the world leader in developing a culture of death in which 20 to 30 million babies have been killed by abortion it could not have been because we give 2year prison sentences to children who kill their newborns it could not have been because our school systems teach children that they are nothing but glorified apes who have evolutionized out of some primordial soup of mud by teaching them that evolution is a fact and by handing out condoms as if they were candy it could not have been because we teach our children that there are no laws of morality that transcend us that everything is relative and that actions do not have consequences what the heck the president gets away with it nah it must have been the guns closed quote"], [0.0003808140754699707, 0.49961918592453003, 0, "i thank the chairman for yielding me time a 9

this eric sterner on the majority side and dick obermann i believe we have before us a good piece of legislation that the president should be pleased to sign into law it has been said several times that this is the first nasa bill in 8 years it may also be the first nasa bill to come to the floor of the house while astronauts are orbiting above us as we speak the shuttle atlantis was launched a week ago friday and they are completing the initial preparations for making the space station ready for a permanent crew or a crew that will stay on orbit for 4 months that will be launched in november they are currently working on a lot of electrical work on getting the station ready and putting a lot of supplies up there i think it is a tremendous milestone that we have reached to be able to see the space station finally coming together it has been very hotly debated on the floor of this body and as well for us to be moving ahead with important legislative priorities for how we are going to manage the space station one of the features in this bill that i am quite pleased with and i would just like to echo the comments made by the gentleman from tennessee about some of the educational priorities in the bill i think they are very good i am particularly pleased about the feature in this bill establishing a new approach to how we handle commercial space i believe if spa is ever going to be utilized the way i think many of us would like to see it utilized we have to really see a flourishing of commercial operations in space what we are trying to do in this legislation is take a new approach as to how we do commercial space i think it has a tremendous potential to be successful the proof of the pudding is of course always in the eating so time will tell but i was very pleased to be able to work with the minority in crafting this bill and i think it is a good future direction for nasa nasa is about the future and i think we have a lot of reasons to be very pleased

here we have a program in place today that allows most of the producers of milk in this country to receive essentially the same price but there is a wide variance in the cost of production so what we are trying to do today is overturn a program that says if it costs as my friend from california said a moment ago 17 to produce milk in the southeast and 12 to produce it in the upper midwest what we are trying to do is overturn a program that says that the place that has the cheapest cost of production we are going to give a dollar per hundredweight raise and where it costs more to produce it we

percent and the figure is still more than the president requested for defense therefore defense is just hunkydory what the gentlemen on the other side really did was to appropriate more than the president requested for weapons systems for pet weapons systems for particular members of congress money that was not even requested by the president now they want to cut below what the president requested for operations and maintenance and for personnel this is not doublespeak this is triplespeak in fact the defense department under their 1 percent cut will now get less than what the president asked for to be able to deploy people around the world less for operations and maintenance and will in fact have to reduce the size of the armed forces they should not be permitted to get

work at maintaining that we have to prioritize basic information technology research there are a whole slew of very good ideas but we have to have priorities we have to go first with that which is most important we have to produce the next generation of highlyskilled information technology workers this bill will help attract more students to science and to careers in information technology by providing grants for colleges and companies to create forcredit courses which include internships participating companies must commit to providing 50 percent of the cost of the program so for a whole
