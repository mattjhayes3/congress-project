"i yield myself such time as i may consume i would like to commend the subcommittee chairman the gentleman from mazsachusetts for convening the hearings on h r 3763 last year and for moving this bill through the committee to the house floor for consideration i would also like to commend the author of this legislation mr besiman for his work in crafting this legislation i was a member of this committee in 1976 when we drafted and enacted the foreign sovereign immunities act which is codified in our law today in title 28 while i believe the law has been successful toward its purpose i believe some of its provisions leave room for amendment i think it is important however with regard to these amendments that we keep in perspective the purpose and history of the foreign sovereign immunities act until congress enacted the foreign sovereign immunities act in 1976 questions with regard to whether or not a foreign state should be granted sovereign immunity with regard to its actions were for the most part left to the state department in makfig those determinations the state department beginning in the early 1950s adopted what became known as the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity which is the prevailing trend in international law today the restrictive theory of soverign immunity provides that the immunity of a state is restricted to its public acts and does not extend to its commercial or nongovernmental activities congress enactment of the foreign sovereign immunities act was intended to codify the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity and in so doing provided that our judicial branch and not our executive branch was the proper forum to determine whether immunity should be applied in certain circumstances the act provides a statutory framework through which litigants may proceed against a foreign government regarding commercial disputes and certain causes of action in tort our task back in the 94th congress in drafting this law was one of attempting to balance two sets of interests that of recognizing unitedstates citi zens right to have access to the courts to resolve ordinary legal disputes involving foreign states and that of providing ample respect for the concerns of other governments and the foreign policy implications of making foreign states subject to suit in this country during the 99th congress and again in this congress i introduced legislation to amend one aspect of the foreign sovereign immunities act h r 1689 which i introduced this year would amend the foreign sovereign immunities act to ensure that neither the federal act of state doctrine nor the doctrine of sovereign immunity would constitute grounds for circumventing the effect of an agreement to arbitrate or an arbitral award entered against a foreign state that bill was the subject of a hearing by the administrative law and governmental relations subcommittee last year a case in point which amply illustrates the need for an amendment to clarify when use of the act of state doctrine would be inappropriate is the case of libyan american oil company versus socialist peoples libyan arab jamahlrya in that case a dispute arose between the country of libya and the libyan american oil co otherwise known as liamco regarding the enforcement of an agreement to arbitrate the parties had entered into an agreement to arbitrate in the event of a dispute a dispute arose with regard to libyas nationalization of certain concessions it had granted to liamco and when liamco sought a resolution to the dispute by enforcing the arbitration agreement libya refused to participate in the proceedings in the end the united states district court for the district of columbia ruled that the act of state doctrine precluded enforcement of the agreement to arbitrate because libyas actions to nationalize the concessions was considered an act of state clothed with immunity decisions like the iarnco decision indicate a need for language clarifying the intent of congress with regard to arbitration and the act of state doctrine clearly theactofstate doctrine should not be used to allow a party to a commercial relationship to circumvent an agreement to arbitrate disputes section 2 of h r 3763 adopts language similar to the bill which i introduced regarding arbitral awards consequently section 2 of this bill amends title 9 of the united states code to ensure that the enforcement of arbitral agreements or awards made pursuant to such agreements shall not be avoided because of the application of the act of state doctrine due to the inclusion of this language in h r 3763 i am inclined to support the bill however i have some concerns regarding other provisions in h r 3763 h r 3763 as cuirently drafted in section 3 would limit the immunity of execution currently provided to a foreign government by broadening the category of commercial assets available for execution against foreign state property the language in section 3 of the bill not only broadens the category of commercial property subject to execution but broadens the category of causes of action which may be brought and which may result in execution against commercial property i think it is important to keep in mind that prior to the enactment of the foreign sovereign immunities act successful plantiffs could not execute against the property of foreign sovereigns in the united states under any circumstances the section of the act section 1610 a which this bill attempt to amend was intended to partially modify this absolute rule against execution of property of foreign sovereigns by allowing for execution of judgments on foreign state property used for the commercial activity upon which the claim is based a reading of the current language of the act in that section illustrates that there is currently the requirement of a nexus between the property to be executed upon and the legal dispute the language of h r 3763 proposes to extend execution under section 1610 to reach any commercial property regardless of whether the property was involved in the cause of action further it would make available assets to satisfy a noncommercial tort judgement which is not presently covered in the act i have some concerns as to the broad brush with which we are sweeping with the language in this bill especially in that should a foreign state reciprocate with a similar law property of the unitedstates government which is present in a foreign country at the time a legal dispute may arise could also be vulnerable to attachment or execution it is no secret that this country has on any given day substantial amounts of property existent in many foreign countries around the world it is my understanding that the united states is currently a defendant in over 800 cases in about 50 countries throughout the world the department of defense has expressed concern that if the united states liberalizes its attachment and execution provisions as this bill contemplates that we would be in a vulnerable situation should other countries decide to initiate reciprocal treatment especially those countries where much unitedstates property may be located in light of these facts i think we should consider whether expanding this area exposes our assets abroad to a greater risk than under existing law and whether this expansion is worth the risk

have rarely closed the american market to any foreign goods but whether or not there are equally effective consumer advocates in japan is a good question just last week the latest in a series of trade

three decades this change has not lessened the influence of their farmers despite their democratic onemanonevote political system the ldp has stayed in power by giving a disproportionate share of parliamentary representation to japans rural areas for example in one farming area 80 000 citizens vote to elect a member to japans house of representatives meanwhile in an urban area a member may represent as many as 285 000 citizens this means that every rural vote is worth 3 5 votes in a city this unfair apportionment allows the ldp to stay in power but all of japan pays for it farmers are kept happy with public works projects in their areas lower tax rates and protections against foreign competition for agricultural goods the agricultural population represents about 4 percent of the japanese population and their average farm is less than 3 acres by contrast farmers make up 2 2 percent of the american population and the average unitedstates farm is sprawled out over 461 acres so siace the avers e american farmer owns more than 150 times more land than his japanese counterpart it only makes sense that we should be able to produce more goods at a lower price and this is certainly the case japanese farmers currently raise almost 5 million head of cattle compared with 100 million raised in the united states since we raise 20 times more cattle one would expect our beef prices to be lower but its outrageous that beef sells for 25 a pound in tokyo and only 2 a pound in washington japan doesnt operate by the rules of free trade and its ridiculous for anyone to claim otherwise japanese consumers suffer from their governments restrictive trade policies and they see the problems with these policies each time they go to the grocery store faced with everyday reminders of the drawbacks of protectionism its surprising that japanese officials object so strongly to h r 3 the omnibus trade bill they have opposed the bill since it was first introduced 3 years ago and they are pleased that mr reagan has vowed to kill it the bill contains a number of provisions designed to improve american access to foreign markets but a spokesman for prime minister takeshita of japan said the bill will have a serious impact on bilateral and multilateral economic cooperation and may hinder the development of the world economy these strong remarks seem to be prompted by the fear that h r 3 might hurt japanese merchants by opening their domestic market to lower priced american goods a more open market in japan certainly might hurt their farmers and middlemen who are protected by japans restrictive agricultural import policies but the benefits to the average japanese consumer would be immeasurable if their government lowered the trade barriers which keep american food products out of the japanese market im sure united states farmers would line up to sell them our highquality lowpriced cattle and crops for years the commerce department has been negotiating with the japanese to open their markets to american farm products the most recent talks have focused on united statts exports of beef and citrus to japan these negotiations collapsed because japans ruling partys strength lies with japanese farmers and those farmers are not about to give up their generous subsidies tax preferences and other government perks so the issue will go to gatt and that agency will inevitably decide that indeed american farmers should be able to sell more beef oranges and grapefruit to the japanese at a time when japanese consumers pay anywhere from 13 to 50 a pound for beef one would think that japanese officials would open their market to american beefbut they havent i firmly believe that the democratic government of japan should listen to the majority of its citizens japanese consumers want lower food prices and american farmers want to be able to sell their cattle and produce in japan the solution is obvious but difficult for the japanese government to put into practice because of its dependence upon japans farmers politicians in japan need to realize that the extraordinary clout which their farming minority wield is trying the patience of japans trading par tners and hurting japanese consumers less expensive imported food would raise the standard of living for every japanese wade earner since food is such a major expense for the average japanese family an increase in the volume of food imports could also reduce the enormous bilateral trade imbalance between the united states and japan last years 170 billion trade deficit has created tension between the united states and our major trading partners but a more open japanese market could ease some of these tensions h r 3 our omnibus trade bill was designed to help america reduce our trade deficit and improve our competitiveness considering how jealously the japanese protect their agricultural market it is outrageous that they have the audacity to criticize h r 3 if in fact the president does veto h r 3 i urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of an override so this important bill can become the law of the land the bill is a fine piece of legislation which took 3 years f labor and negotiation to produce and i am convinced that it will strengthen our position in the world market but we cannot do it alone international trade is a giveandtake relationship and now is the time for the japanese to open their markets to our farm products we grant the japanese the privilege of selling their goods in the united states and american farmers and businessmen expect and deserve the same free access to the japanese market without a doubt american farmers can deliver the quality and price which japanese consumers demand and it is simply up to their government to allow us to compete in the japanese market many american industries have taken a beating because of competition with the japanese and millions of american workers have lost their jobs because japanese imports have forced their employers out of business japanese officials should be sensitive to this fact and they should appreciate that the united states of amercia is still the largest and most open market in the world the least they can do is allow us to compete with their farmers on a fair and level playing field access to their farming market is not a lot to ask and it would go a long way toward improving trade and diplomatic relations between the united states and japan i am convinced that our farm products are competitive all we need is the opportunity to sell american farm goods freely and openly in the japanese market that concludes my very diplomatic remarks involving the japanese and their farm people at another time i will take some other items up which i have talked about in the past but let me just make a couple of observations at this time first of all the japanese have been trying to fool the whole world they have kept themselves free from any imports they have subsidized their own industry they do everything that breaks every regulation real or imagined binding or nonbinding more than any other country in the world which has to adhere to and respond to we have caught the japanese cheating time and time again cheating on television sets stealing in this country and i say that without reservation they have been fined repeatedly but bbcause of their diplomatic negotiations those fines have been reduced or almost eliminated the record speaks for itself it is not me speaking it is the record speaking the japanese have not been fair in international trade since we beat them in the last war i have my own particular thoughts of what i would like to do with japan but those are a subject matter for another discussion the fact remains that most of my colleagues and most of those in the economic communltyof ours calls japan our trading partner they are no more a partner than if we could expand it to its nth degree and they are a trading enemy really because we are at war with japan economically and anybody who reads it any differently does not understand that is not speaking again it is the record i can go back seriatim and point out in the record what the3y have done over the years they even have not become party to a joint international agreement on a voluntary restraint agreement they have not done that basically they keep putting things off they say we are going to take care of your agricultural products who wants to exchange of course our trade people our negotiators the international trade ambassador keeps using excuses and explanations that he would like to get our farm products in and that was the basis of my special order this evening but who wants to be in a position whereby we give our natural resources we send lumber to japan in its natural state we send minerals to japan we send coal to japan and we send farm products and that is not labor intensive we get back cameras highlaborintensive products such as automobiles and i think that is absured as it is for anyone who even has a smidgen of understanding of international trade they are not treating us fairly every time we catch them with their hand in the cookie jar and every time they are caught cheating and they have been cheating on patents and everything else and it is not me speaking again it is a matter of record everytime they are caught they go back again saying we are a defeated nation you cannot do this to us international trade negotiations should take the place of all this severe penalty and things of that nature in the meantime they have 18 000 to 20 000 economic spies in this country all over the country it is a matter of record we have caught them so many times i do not know how long this nation can put up with it what is going to happen has already happened the low value of the american dollar has allowed all the foreigners to come in and buy up our industry they are buying it up the japanese own pearl harbor 80 percent of the hotels and all the business in pearl harbor is owned by the japanese i am not antijapanese or anticanadian or whatever all i know is that it is a bad sign for example the canadian acquisition corporation over in canada they are spending large sums of money in canada through their parliament and they are making that money available so that the canadian acquisition corporation can in turn try to acquire for canada all foreign interests in these companies including a lot of united states interests up in canada the canadian government has finally concluded that it is not to their best interests that foreign governments own so much of their industrial activity we had a special order earlier this evening on plant closings here there is a decision made on a computer in bonn germany to close a plant in this country that is crazy it is crazy to have this country find itself in such an inexplicable position that they would be the victim of a movement such as that that is foolish we cannot even get through the congress here a reasonble legislative enactment which would allow us to know exactly how many companies or how if a123 much of our economy already has been purchased by foreigners i have spread on the record as of last week or the week before a japanese publication in the japanese language which indicated all of the japanese ownerships in this country and the facts in that article were shocking i had an interpreter interpret the columns and i spread it on the record last week or 2 weeks ago and in there it says such and such a corporation with so many employees and located in such a place how much business they do every conceivable statistic and it is all listed in that japanese publication we have to find out what is going on in this country and we better do that because if we do not i think we are destined to become a colony again and may have to fight another war to remove the yoke from our necks this country is not the richest nation in the world that is another matter of record this country is not the richest nation i think we are no 3 supposedly we are the biggest debtor nation if that is some accomplishment next week or so i will be taking up another aspect of this subject in another special order mr speak6r i would like to close by urging the japanese representatives in this country and urge the government of japan because they read this record that they better give some practical consideration to the existing trade inequities and that they better take a little suffering their way because we just cannot do it any longer there is diplomacy and there is delay and there is fast talking and things like that and i do not know how else they do it but they are doing a pretty good job of it because they are still doing what they have been doing and that is excluding american products i have the whole litany laid out we know how many american cars are sold in japan which is 3 000 or 4 000 we know how many they sell here and it is in the millions they have 25 percent of our market that is crazy it is not understandable and it is indefensible and absolutely bad interna tional economics back many years ago i gave a name to international trade with the japanese and i called it by a certain name i was criticized very regularly for it and very profoundly so because i said the japanese at that time were not authentic in what their trade position was their posture and their supposed desire to negotiate as our trading partner as i mentioned before i do not think we are trading partners many years ago i called it sumural economics i gave it that name samurai economics meaning that in international economics one would accomplish ones end at any cost if you have to lie and cheat whatever you have to do do it and apparently that is what is happening there is no question about it it has been proven time and time again that they have dumped on the american market and they subsidize it has been proven it is not me saying it it is the fact i would say that they would be well advised if those in their proper positions would take a second look at their obstinance and negotiate sincerely with this government and try to equalize our international trade imbalance which is now 40 billion to 50 billion and heading to 60 billion in favor of the japanese that is all i have to say at this time i will be back in a week or two on another aspect of this subject matter"], [0.0018870830535888672, 0.49811291694641113, 1, "a unitedstates naval vessel the unitedstatess roberts has been struck by an

midst of the stable energy market which existed at the time a national energy policy could have been devised which would have both foreseen and planned for the new energy situation which is on our horizon however since world oil prices began to fall in 1986 our countrys dependence upon foreign oil has begun to increase in 1986 the united states depended upon imported oil for more than onethird of its required sources this number approaches the amounts which created unitedstates vulnerability during the oil shocks of the 1970s further a recent department of energy report estimates that in the 1990s unitedstates oil imports will rise to nearly onehalf of its total consumption this trend is already beginning recently the washington times carried a front page story announcing the prediction of rising gasoline prices at the pumps which could reach 1 per gallon this summer this news follows the continuing decline of our doemstic oil industry a standstill in the exploration of new wells and the inability of domestic wells to compete with cheaper world oil have devastated the industry we have enjoyed the recent days of inexpensive oil but we must realize that the future will

do in fact acknowledge that you not only do a good job but you have a tough job to do and you do it with sincerity and you do it with vigor having made that point and made it as sincerely as i can let me talk about what we are doing here today this is not the first time we have come to the floor with an amendment to an appropriation bill this year nor is it the first time we have come to the floor with an amendment that is an acrosstheboard cut i personally do not like acrosstheboard cuts and that is why i have argued consistently that we ought to make line item cuts much after the fashion the chairman has argued i think it is a better way to legislate but we have repeatedly on each appropriation bill come to the floor with a series of acrosstheboard cuts or of line item cuts and been defeated every time when we do that my colleagues will acknowledge what we do is use a great deal of the bodys time we have a good deal of evidence on which to conclude that the four separate item cuts that we had prepared to offer today and would have taken 4 separate hours and gotten nowhere and we do not wish to be an extended harassment to the body so as a consequence of that we made a decision today to really go to where it is we had won despite the fact that so many members of our body will come up and deplore acrosstheboard cuts acrosstheboard cuts are what they vote for and we pass them and we have passed them and i predict we will pass one today the chairman has spoken about a 5percent acrosstheboard cut the fact of the matter is that the american people understand how desperately our budget circumstances are they understand how desperately they do not want to face a tax increase and they believe that there is not an agency of the federal government that cannot reduce its existing budget by 5 percent through the elimination of waste and inefficiency and do not only as good a job but perhaps even a better job they believe that largely by virtue of having seen their state and local governments achieve exactly that and we have heard testimony even on the budget committee sparkling testimony from a mayor in ohio where he demonstrated that the reduction in federal funding turned out as they made adjustments they were capable of making to be a blessing so we know that the american people are ready even though we have widespread agreement across this nation on the part of the american people that there is at least 5 percent waste in federal programs that can be eliminated this amendment offered by the gentleman from texas does not ask for a 5percent reduction in spending on these programs in fact it allows a 4 75percent increase in spending it takes the spending increase that is in the bill for fiscal year 1988 over fiscal year 1987 and it cuts it in half so these agencies will not be devoid of their increases they will get approximately a 5percent increase after this amendment is passed i for one do not want to go home and tell my constituents who are worried about the deficit who are afraid that they are going to get a tax increase that i do not agree with them when they tell me that we can eliminate waste and inefficiency in our government agencies and save their tax dollars that i was willing to vote against an amendment that allows an increase of almost 5 percent while it cuts an additional increase of almost 5 percent this is a strategy change for our group but it is a strategy change that is made out of deference to the body at large out of consideration even for the members of the committee and we have watched subcommittee chairmen and ranking members suffer long days and through extended debates over lineitem cuts that never took place never were passed we have seen the body beleaguered and weary"]]}
