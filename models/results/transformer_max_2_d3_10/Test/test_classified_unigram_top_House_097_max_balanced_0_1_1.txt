which allows us to do things that we cannot do ourselves the upshot of all of this is that we do not pay attention to many of the bills in the subcommittee or committee stage because you go prepared to have hearings you go prepared to listen to the evidence you go prepared to make up your mind based on the evidence that is presented and maybe everybody there decides based on the evidence that is presented that there is one way to go but a chairman or someone else will pull the proxies out of his pocket and vote the opposite way for those people who never had the benefit of those hearings that were actually taken it then happens on the committee level where proxies are allowed to be voted then we come here on the floor of the house and we have bills that really are not in good shape what happens when we on the minority side i 850 attempt to bring amendments and some on the majority side bring amendments we get criticized by the leadership for slowing down the process and for attempting to put roadblocks in the legislative progress the fact is that much of the legislation is not being dealt within the subcommittee level the committee level and then by the rules we adopt on the floor which do not allow us to take care of those problems it is not being dealt with on the floor so the committee staffing goes beyond us picking up the cudgel thrown by the president of the united states to try to slim down government to its regular size so that we are fighting trim instead of being overweight and trying to slug ourselves through a fight that we cannot win it goes to the very question of how this institution operates if we are elected by the people to make those decisions we ought to make those decisions they should not be made by staffers who in some waysand there are many many good staffers i do not mean to say that there are notbut there is a certain feeling that develops after awhile when you are here long after the members are here when you stay on the committees and the subcommittees long after they do i had a freshman member come to me today and say during a hearing he and another member got together to bring up an amendment and they asked one of the counsel to come over the counsel said well have you checked with this staff person and that staff person and that staff person he named three staff people well if you have not checked with those staff people i would suggest that you not introduce this amendment during this markup proceeding now what does that mean it means that we have turned this place on its head there is no justification for the growth we have had in staff two years ago the entire professional staff of the committee on education and labor went to the peoples republic of china i have waited with bated breath to find out what pearls of wisdom they have brought us back from the communist regime in china as to how we can better have labor relations in this country or how we can better educate our children you know i am still waiting because i doubt we can learn much in the peoples republic of china about our labor relations and our educational institutions which i thought were the reasons that we had a committee on education and labor we all know that it goes on it is something that we keep quiet about here on the hill and we should not keep quiet about it the american people are looking at us i would hope sometime that the press who are so interested in watching when we do our daily dance or yearly dance on pay raises for members of congress and then leave as we discuss something else which probably costs 40 times as much would pay a slight bit of that attention to how we organize ourselves to the fact that we are overstaffed here to the fact that on some committees you have four and five and six

information quoted lord mountbatten the brilliant british military person who said in 1979 i have come to the conclusion that nuclear weapons are not military weapons because nuclear weapons cannot be used and the danger that imperils humankind on the face of this earth is the perception the illusion that nuclear weapons can be used to me this was an eloquent and powerful statement that nuclear weapons are never to be used but only for deterrence but the supporting documents for this military budget fiscal year 1983 say we must have the capacity to fight to survive and win a nuclear war anyone who believes we can fight survive and win a nuclear war bydefinition with all due respect is psychotic every analyst i have seen indicates that no one wins in a nuclear war there is no such as a limited war a surgical strike where 20 to 100 million human beings are dead what is limited and surgical about that i would quote dr geiger the executive director of the physicians for social responsibility who said as i look at the united states and the soviet union and their nuclear arms race i think of two men and i think that is appropriate because it is very sexist and macho to play war gamestwo men in a room locked tight up to their throats in gasoline one standing there with 10 matches and the other standing there with 7 matches and they are both arguing over whether they need 15 matches apiece before they can agree not to strike 1 match in that room that is where we are that is precisely where this arms race is millions of the american people are beginning to awaken to the reality that nuclear war is insanity bloated wasteful and unnecessary military budgets are not in our best interests finally my colleagues are talking about a 5percent addon for fiscal year 1983 military budget as if these numbers make some sense the point is that fiscal year 1982 was an incredibly high base in fiscal year 1981 the military budget in budget authority terms was 173 billion in fiscal year 1982 it went up to 226 billion 25 percent over and above that is incredible we must remember that ronald reagan stomped us in 1982 and put the military budget at an incredible level so let me give the members these figures because it also includes the black caucus budget when you go back to 1981 as a base 1982 which was terribly out of line the jones budget if we use 1981 figures calls for 32 9percent increase in 2 years the aspin budget in 2 years calls for a 31 3percent increase the latta budget 33 4percent increase in the military budget in 2 years the obey budget 30 6 percent and even this socalled radical document known as the congressional black caucus that budget is still 25 percent over and above fiscal year 1981 a 12 5 average increase in 2 years so yoticannot tell me

an alternative budget plan that offers this nation the promise of strong economic recovery rather than the continued pain of unemployment high interest rates and runaway deficts this alternative is necessitated by the fact that this current administration continues to make excuses for its bankrupt economic policies which are bankrupting our nation we are told to just wait intil our economic recovery program takes effect we have been waiting now for 8 months with these results interest rates are the highest in history 16 million americans are either out of work working parttime or so discouraged that they no longer even look for work the housing industry is in the worst condition since world war ii business failures and farm foreclosures are running at the highest levels since the great depression this litany could go on and on but suffice it to say that if the congress had enacted last year the congressional black caucus economic recovery plan instead of president reagans we would not be suffering the economic contractions that are now wreaking havoc with our nation there is no joy however in pointing out that the congressional black caucus last year predicted the misery and human suffering that would occur as a result of the adoption of the reagan economic program the reagan record hs all too clearly shown that the congressional black caucus was right the congressional black caucus is right again this year we have once again met the presidents challenge to put up or shut up we put up once again a fair and sound budget proposal which will rescue our nation from devastating and debilitating deficits unemployment and economic stagnation the fauntroy alternative controls federal spending not by pushing millions more americans into poverty not by a continued assault on the nations young disadvantaged and poor but by an assault on wasteful military spending extravagant tax breaks to wealthy citizens and irresponsible tax subsidies for profitable corporations the fauntroy substitute rejects the reagan economic shell game which redistributes income from the poor and middle class to the rich more than any other alternative the cbc alternative embodies creative and comprehensive tax reformstopping the raid on the federal treasury through tax breaks for those who least need them rather the cbc alternative restructures the presidents tax cut to principally benefit those earning less than 50 000 per year moreover our alternative provides real tax relief to the poor and middle class by increasing the standard deduction and earned income tax credit the fauntroy substitute proves that fiscal responsibility can be achieved while maintaining compassion and concern for the american people by implementing tax reform and by reducing military expenditures the cbc budget would reduce the projected fiscal year 1983 deficit to 97 billion by 1985 a surplus of 4 2 billion would result let me emphasize once again that fiscal responsibility need not come at the expense of the poor and disadvantaged in our society the republican party platform for 1980 said the measure of a countrys compassion is how it treats the least fortunate yet we now know that this republican administration has systematically dismantled every program which was created to serve our least fortunate under the cbc budget the american tradition of compassion and concern for the needy and destitute would be restored to address the totally unacceptable rate of unemployment among our people the cbc alternative includes 6 billion for a desperately needed jobs program to train and put people who want to work back to work additionally the cbc budget restores funding for important education programs such as title 1 and student financial aid in order to maintain an investment in our human capital and in our future by educating our young people other vital national needs in housing social services and transportation which the reagan budget fails miserably to address are best met under the cbc alternative budget in short there is a way to move this nation toward the goal of reduced inflation without throwing millions of americans out of work there is a way to reduce the federal deficit without taking school lunches away from hungry children and snatching costofliving adjustments from the elderly there is a way to lower interest rates and to restore confidence in our economy without slamming the door on thousands of small businessmen and farmers the way is the fauntroy substitute i have a special concern in the area of health care and waut to discuss with my colleagues the cbc alternative budget proposals in this regard the fauntroy subutitute recommends that 85 5 billion be spent on health care programs in fiscal year 1p83 in order to provide the resources necessary to treat and prevent disease care for sick workers mothers children and the elderly this amount is a full 7 5 billion more than the reagan budget and 5 5 oillion more than the budget committee alternative as cochairman of the congressional black caucus health brain trust i enjoy the benefit of the special expertise of hundreds of experienced health care professionals throughout the country these health care professionals are appalled and rightly so about the ruthless impact of last years budget cuts on the ability of poor and disadvantaged americans to obtain high quality medical care it is all too obvious that the great progress that we have made in the last decade in expanding the availability and affordability of health care from inner city communities to isolated rural towns is swiftly being undermined last year 1 billion was slashed from the medicaid program forcing states to cut benefits and limit eligibility for the poor and working poor as a result over 1 million people lost med icaid coverage virtually all of the losers were women and children in lowincome families thousands of families with incomes at or below the poverty line when faced with overwhelming medical care costs have had to quit their meager paying jobs and go on welfare in order to keep or obtain vital medicaid coverage we believe that it is unconscionable to impose this type of pain and hardship on the poorest and most disadvantaged segment of the population the cbc budget therefore restores those cuts in medicaid imposed last year and maintains a basic level of medicald coverage for the millions of women children and lowincome famtlies who depend upon the government for basic health care similarly the fauntroy substitute restores cuts imposed last year in medicare and rejects any cuts for fiscal year 1983 more than 90 percent of medicare enrollees are senior citizens who have the greatest health care needs in this nation senior citizens have the highest percentage of heart attacks and the greatest number of strokes they are the individuals who for the most part have the greatest incidence of cancer and suffer the greatest incidence of crippling and debilitating disease moreover in addition to being the most sick the elderly suffer the double disadvantage of being sick and poor one out of six senior citizens is poor one out of every two black elderly is poor or marginally poor the cbc finds untenable any proposals which penalize our senior citizens and ask them to use their already limited resources to pay more for medical care the cbc also rejects as foolish and shortsighted any freeze in spendling on such vital health programs as maternal and child health alcohol drug abuse and mental health rervices health manpower and biomedical research additional spending in these areas now only serves to save money in the long run no where is the cost effectiveness of a strengthened federal investment in health care more evident than in the area of biomedical research the economic losses from illness and diseases which we still are unable to prevent and cure run into the billions of dollars last year i had the pleasure of hearing testimony from 10 nobel laureates who spoke about the fact that our nation is becoming scientifically and technologically illiterate they spoke about the need for more funding for biomedical research in order to maintain a leadership position in advancing new knowledge about medical care in order to continue progress in understanding the causes of disease and illness the cbc budget provides additional fundiqg to maintain a strong federal investment in biomedical research let us remember that the debate about health programs and out the larger federal budget is otri simply a debate about numbers and dollars and cents it is about human beingschildren parents elderly it is about their successes and failures it is about their hopes and dreams the cbc

minority member of the committee for his support of our efforts i also am particularly indebted not only to my democratic colleagues on the subcommittee but also to the gentleman from new york for his tireless work in effecting a responsible and workable authorization bill for noaa in a truly bipartisan way we could not have had a more diligent and cooperative colleague as ranking minority member of the subcommittee the atmospheric climatic and ocean pollution act authorizes 498 543 000 for the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa to conduct essential research and service activities in a wide variety of areas including weather forecasting climatic services tornado and hurricane warnings aviation weather ocean dumping research and atmospheric research included in this authorization figure are 2 2 million for reauthorization of the national climate program act and 5 1 million for noaa to operate a land remote sensing system from space landsat this is a bill which is responsive to our recognition of this nations budgetary problemsthe authorization figure in the bill is 4 000 below the administrations request h r 2803 marks the beginning of a new relationship between congress and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa was established by executive reorganization in 1970 with the mission of providing services and research in the sea and in the air over the past 11 years numerous environmental statutes have given naa additional duties so that the agency is now responsible for weather forecasting acid rain research fisheries conservation the national sea grant program the national ocean pollution office the national climate office conservation of muxine mammals and sensitive marine habitats and many more programs which the congress and the american people have regarded as legitimate and important government services throughout these 11 years the congress has voted on numerous occasions to authorize noaa to carry out a proscribed environmental responsibility however we in the congress have never reviewed and evaluated the missions and programs of this important agency as a whole with the view of understanding how its components ought to relate to each other and to the needs of the people we on the committee on science and technology for instance feel strongly that the primary mission of noaas weather arm ought to be protection of the public health and safety through timely and accurate weather forecasts and warnings however in the heat of the appropriations process it is easy for members for those evaluating these services and for the weather service itself to lose sight of the absolute primacy of the publics health and safety in setting priorities for the weather service i am confident that consideration of a comprehensive authorization bill for noaa will provide members with a good opportunity to review and if necessary reorder the agencys priorities and that this process will help noaa to keep its programs in tune with the needs of the public h r 2803 is the first step in a process which i hope will culminate in an authorization bill for the entire agency the bill authorizes funding for approximately 500 million of the agencys 800 million budget including all of its weather climatic and oceanpollution activities the noaa activities not included in this billfisheries sea grant ocean thermal energy and hard minerals development are under the jurisdiction of the committee on merchant marine and fisheries and we on the committee on science anbd technology are confident that in future years the two committees will report to the house a comprehensive authorization bill for the national oceanic and atmospheric administration in reporting h r 2803 the committee on science and technology increased funding above the administrations request for a limited number of noaa activities funding for these programs was increased either because they promise to provide needed informational services to policymakers or the public and they embody a critical transfer of research technology which will greatly enhance the usefulness of the service provided with respect to information services h r 2803 contains 500 000 for noaa to begin a comparative study of the environmental effects of waste disposal in various medialand sea and air there is increasing pressure to open up the ocean once again for disposal of wastes however because of the short sighted approach of federal agencies in the past crucial crossmedia comparisons of environmental impact have never been made so that the environmental protection agency must regulate waste disposal without an adequate understanding of what the relative impact of various disposal optionsl might be the committee feels that the most appropriate target for a pioneering study of this sort is the sewage sludge disposal problem in the new york city metropolitan area the bill also contains funding above the administrations request for upgrading the climatological data base at the national climatic center and for enhanced funding of the national climate program office both of these increases are based on the recommendations of the national academy of sciences the national climate offices 5year plan and our own committee that the greatest nearterm improve ment that can be made in our national climate effort would be to improve the accessibility and use of the data already available in government archives effective use of climatic data is an essential element in agricultural productivity and water management with regard to technology transfer h r 2803 includes enhanced funding for several projects which are expected to greatly improve the weather services ability to warn the public of severe weather the committee feels that the greatest challenge facing the weather service in the coming years will be in providing services particularly severeweather warnings in the face of stable or shrinking personnel levels thus in h r 2903 our committee strongly supported those projects which showed either promise for improving detection of severe weather or promise of automating routine functions a modest investment in capital equipment can produce substantial savings in labor and free up the time of skilled personnel in the weather service to perform important forecasting tasks we supported automation of field operations and services afos but agree with the committee on appripriations that a successful test of the system is needed before increased expenditures are warranted at this time funding was provided to accelerate design of the next generation radar nexrad system the weather service currently uses the outmoded and rapidly failing wsr57 radars built in the 1950s delay of nexrad would be a false savings in that it would lead to severely reduced service and to greatly increased maintenance costs additional funds were provided for testing and installing automated observing systems which will eventually be placed at over 500 airports to form the backbone of the groundbased observational network this program has the potential to free personnel to perform more critical forecast and service functions and any delay in this program would result in greatly reduced productivity finally the bill recommends enhanced funding for the national severe storms center in kansas city for its centralized storm information system csis csis allows the forecaster to integrate data from satellites radar and other observing systems at a finer scale than is presently possible and is recognized to be the most promising development in the detection of severe storms since the refinement of doppler radar in this bill the committee also strongly supported the administrations request of 1 876 000 for research in the sources and transport of acid rain this is a substantial increase from the 1981 appropriation for acid rain research which was under 100 000 acid rain is responsible for the biological sterility of hundreds of lakes in the northeastern united states and in canada and may fit the present time or in the near future be responsible for literally billions of dollars of damage to forests and to crops to metal and stone structures of all sorts and to human health in our hearings this year we had testimony that not only will the northeast and canada continue to be severely afflicted with the problems of acid rain absent a major intervention on our part but that also the west coast and the upper middle west are threatened with the poisonous problem of acid rain on their croplands on their forestlands on their waters and on their structures in the near future the administrations request for acid rain research was timely for several reasons including the importance of this issue to the clean air act reauthorization and the designation of noaa as a lead ageney in acid rain research by the energy security act of we have all observed from the newspapers that when president reagan visited canada shortly after he took office it was made very clear to him that acid rain was a matter of urgent concern to our canadian friends more recently i was a member of a group of american congressmen and senators who met with our canadian colleagues members of parliament and their environment minister in halifax and again it was made clear to us beyond a peradventure that the problem of acid rain and our contribution to their problem was a matter of most urgent concern to them so i congratulate president reagan and the administration for having requested a significant and timely increase in the budget to look into the question of acid rain in a comprehensive and holistic fashion i fully agree with the administration that we ought to know far more than we do now what will be the costs and benefits of our efforts to use inexpensive sources of fuel in terms of our environment and natural resources we should have information as to whether a given expenditure in scrubbing coal for instance will lead to a linear reduction of emissions and to improvements in the atmosphere and the fact is that today we do not know we need far more accurate information to make intelligent decisions from the point of view of cost and benefits when we pass legislation imposing major expenditures upon our utilities and upon our manufacturing industries this increase in the budget for acid rain research is totally consistent with this administrations concern that we make more thoughtful decisions affecting the regulatory

is of major importance our committee believes that a finite period of operation by the federal government would greatly mininize the technical financial and institutional risks involved in developing

gratified by the support my bills have receivedfrom my colleagues here in the house and from farmers and farm organizations around the country the american soybean association the national association of wheat growers the national corn growers association the unitedstates feed grains council the unitedstates wheat associates the american farm bureau federation and the national grange are just a few of the major groups representing farmers which have endorsed an export credit revolving fund secretary of agriculture john block has also indicated his support of the concept of the revolving fund he did so in an associated press article which followed the introduction of my bill and he confirmed this view when he appeared with me on a tv interview program no one can dispute the fact that the export of agricultural products has been a bright spot in our evonomy in recent years but while we are giving ourselves a pat on the back we should pause to consider the fact that we are in no way reaching our potential in this area nor is there any guarantee that we can even maintain our current level of performance this is a highly competitive area and our competition has adopted aggressive marketing tactics we must have the tools to meet this competition and to maintain and expand our agricultural export markets our current program of loan guarantees for agricultural export credit works fine for some nations but many others for a variety of reasons prefer direct credit they must turn elsewhere to nations which offer more attractive financing terms these financing terms are often enough to tip the balance in favor of a competitor nation and allow them to capture tl~xe export market despite other advantages offered by purchasing from the united states the commodity credit corporation revolving fund for export development and expansion created by the glickmanskeltonstenholm amendment would give us needed flexibility in the agricultural export area it would be available for shortterm financing of commercial export sales of unitedstates agricultural products export sales of unitedstates breeding animals and the establishment of facilities in importing countries to improve the capacity of such countries for handling marketing processing storing or distributing unitedstates agricultural commodities its purpose is to enable our nation to develop and expand commercial markets fqr unitedstates agricultural commodities it will help us realize our vast untapped potential in this area farm exports are vital to our entire economy they are the most important factor on the positive side of our balance of trade they provide jobs and they bolster market prices for farmers without adversely impacting food prices or requiring direct government payments unfortunately the budget will not allow us to put money in the revolving fund created by this amendment this year however i believe it is still vital to get the mechanism on the books when the budgetary situation does permit us to make it fully operational i am confident that the ccc revolving fund for export development and expansion will prove to be a sound investment for the nation and

which the house will consider the conference report for s 884 the food and agriculture act of 1981 the report is being considered in the last hours of the session with only 1 hour of dlebate this legislation should not be considered now certainly not under such rushed and restricted circumstanc s it is too complex too controversial and too important a measure to be rushed through the house under circumstances that do not permit careful consideration we are being required to act on this report under the pressure of adjournmnent under the threat that if the hill is not approved american agriculture will flounder and support programs will abruptly end this is incorrect and all members should understand that this is not the case all farm programs including the food stamp program have operated under a continuing authorization since october 1 a resoluh 98 17 tion has been introduced and could be considered today that would extend this temporary authorization through march of next year there is certainly no justification to push through an objectionable farm bill just to have some form of authorization on the books i must remind my colleagues that we will not have another opportunity to consider the provisions in this legislation for 4 years during this time many small farms will be forced out of business and constumers will have to pay billions of dollars in unnecessary costs because we acted in haste the conference report onl s 884 is clearly unfair and inadequate it discriminates against certain commodities in order to provide new or increased subsidies to more favored agricultural producers it makes major reductions in dairy supports and provides inadequate support fur corn feed grains and other commodities at the same time it provides new and unnecessary subsidies for sugar producers and continues the current peanut program with a substantial inicrease in supports the report also protects commodities such as tobacco rice and cotton from the kinds of reductions that have been made in all other domestic assistance programs thle conference report emphasizes reducing costs to the government at the expense of higher costs to consumers the sugar and peanut provisions alone could cost consumers in excess of 6 billion over the life of the legislation had this cost been paid by govermnent these programs would never have found their way into the bill i find it ironic that what we are attempting to save taxpayers in dairy and grain support reductions we are requiring them to pay as consumers for other support programs not only will the same people have to pay these costs but the burden will fall disproportionately upon the poor the elderly and others who are least able to pay these costs i am particularly concerned with the peanut provisions iq the bill the house conferees completely ignored the will of the house rwhich was clearly expressed in a 250to159 vote to end the current peanut allotment and quota systems the conference report changes only the terminology of the current program continuing the same restrictive and costly program provisions that now stifle peanut production and require consumers to pay unreasonably high prices for peanuts and peanut products the conference report provides peanut allotment holders with a support level of 550 per ton an imimediate 21percent increase above the current support level it provides an escalator that will increase price supports by 43 percent over the life of the bill no other commodity is so favorably treated in this legislation and this is a program that a overwhelming majority of the house and 47 senators voted to eliminate and replace with a loan program that would support peanuts at a level closer to the current 250 per ton world price of peanuts the conference action on peanuts as well as on sugar represents a repudiation of the house position on these issues and should not be accepted tile conference report does not encorage or expand american agriculture on the contrary it restricts production of key commodities stifles agricultural productivity and undermines the viability of many small family farms i am a little surprised therefore that almost all the national organizations representing farmers particularly family farmers are strongly opposed to this legislation let us not fool ourselves this is not a farm bill it is a corporate subsidy bill it benefits the large corporate producers the processors the nmiddlemen and the allotment holders it benefits a number of highly organized well financed agricultural lobbies at the expense of both farmers and consumners the argument is made in support of this bill that the american people are tired of business as usual in washington and demand change what are we talking about this bill is business as usual it continues the kind of commodity deals and tradeoffs that have dominated congressional action on farm legislation for the past 40 years i have little doubt that the rush to bring this legislation up for consideration now is to get members to vote before they have an opportunity to talk with constituents before both the farmers and the consumers find out just how bad this legislation really is the advocates for this legislation want to keep members from hearing the strong opposition that exists to this giveaway to large agricultural producers i strongly oppose the conference report and believe we are doing the american people a disservice by forcing a vote on this legislation in the final hours of this session"], [0.9947579046711326,

recessions since the 1930s already layoffs are staggeringly high in the automobile rubber steel and construction industries the statistics indicate that the country must agai trace itself for another recession however when the economy experiences a downturn the brunt of the cost of a recession is borne by the relative few who are put on indefinite layoff those who are laid oil totally suffer the loss of income jobrelated benefits and newly acquired work skills while the failure to pay the mortgage and car payments and loss of health insurance coverage can cause both physical and psychological stress but the employees are not the only ones who suffer the costs of a layoff new production schedules and exercise of bumping rights make layoffs costly to the company in terms of both money and productivity and to workers who though still at work have to move down into lower paying jobs moreover costly rehiring and retraining cut deep into productivity and profits in the long term unemployment is also costly to the taxpayer the congressional budget office estimates that when unemployment goes up one percentage point the cost of programs like unemployment insurance and food stamps go up 5 to 7 billion but of even greater impact on the taxpayer and the budget is that tax revenues go down 20 to 22 billion today i am introducing legislation that proposes an alternativ to costly layoffs the shorttime compensation act encourages states to permit payment of unemployment compensation benefits to employees who are laid off partially it encourages worksharing as an alternative to layoff where feasible under shorttime compensation workers will be paid their regular wages for the time they work and prorated unemployment insurance benefits for the time they do not under current law it is impossible for any state but california to pay unemployment insurance for a 1day layoff per week this bill authorizes the secretary of labor to develop model legislation make grants and provide technical assistance to states to assist in developing enacting and implementing shorttime compensation programs the bill proposes a voluntary approach use of shorttime compensation will be voluntary for states employers and employees in unionized firms while state experimentation is encouraged the legislation recommends some basic guidelines to protect employees and the integrity of the unemployment compensation trust funds it also establishes a controlled demonstration project we need to test the viability of shorttime compensation as a means to alleviate the burden of layoffs during recessions although shorttime compensation is a relatively new concept in this country it has been used for decades in western europe as an important tool to combat layoffs in the last recession more than 770 000 german workers received partial compensation california has had a successful shorttime compensation program since mid1978 it has worked well and the california workers employers and unions are satisfied with it although the legislation was introduced by senator william green in the aftermath of passage of proposition 13 the program was extended by the state legislature last year the advantages of shorttime compensation to workers is obvious it preserves their job attachment and fringe benefits it also may be a better way of doing business for employers as well even though it costs them more to maintain fringe benefits it reduces rehiring and training costs shorttime can improve longrun productivity since it helps employers retain a skilled work force the legislation can also benefit unions a number of unions have collective bargaining agreements that call for worksharing among employees before layoffs are permitted however under current law in most states this worksharing has to be done without compensation my bill would encourage the payment of unemployment insurance benefits to workers in those unions who already use reduced work hours before resorting to layoffs shorttime compensation is a costeffective way to fight unemployment the cost of my bill to establish this 3year experimental program is 10 million for the entire 3 years since employers will be required to certify that the use of shorttime is in lieu of an equivalent number of hours of fulltime layoffs it should not be more costly to the unemployment insurance trust funds moreover employers who are at their maximum tax rate can be charged an additional surtax or be required to reimburse the trust fund for their utilization of shorttime compensation second if shorttime were used there would be less need for costly public service jobs which pay the employee less than they would get from reduced wages supplemented by unemployment insurance benefits public assistance costs could also be reduced finally use of shorttime compensation would have a stabilizing force for the local economy employees on shorttime will come closer to maintaining their normal incomes especially since they will have reduced workrelated expenses and unemployment insurance benefits are nontaxable in addition their increased purchasing power will sustain local businesses and help the states economic recovery and there will be greater tax revenues for the state since we seem to be headed for another fullblown recession i think it is a good time for congress and the states

its commitment to that goal following such a mutual reduction the president should call a conference of all existing nuclear nations whose purpose would be to hammer out a program of percentage annual

identical to that of the amendment by senator hatch sj res 110 the effect of this amiendment should be clear first it declares that a right to abortion is not secured by the constitution thus reversing the holding in roe against wade that the right to privacy includes the mothers right to kill her unborn child it would remove jurisdiction over abortion from the judicial branch of government and place it again under the legislative branch where it was until the supreme court in 1973 usurped that power this amendment in effect merely asks the people whether they want a voice through their elected represent atives in setting public policy with regard to abortion or whether they would leave it entirely in the hands of judges since this amendment neither restricts abortion nor declares the unborn to be persons there can be no debate over exceptions nor any chiallenge to the question of personhooid by abortion advocates with claims that women having abortions would be prosecuted for murder and those miscarrying would be liable to charges of manslaughter last this amendment contains no restrictions on the use of any type of contraceptive drug or device because this amendment does not raise the question personhood it does not create a legal absolutism that could so easily bc challenged by its opponents who would claim that passage of this amendment would cause every woman having an abortion to be prosecuted for murder and those miscarrying liable to charges of manslaughter because it does not declare that either human beings or persons exist from the moment of fertilization it could not be attacked for outlawing the pill or the iud the simplicity of this amendment is its strength it merely gives congress the power to set a national standard to protect life which individual states can exceed but not fall below for too long the people of this country have been frustrated in their efforts to petition their government for a redress of grievances in this matter the courts have consistently struck down most legislatlve fforts to limit or even regulate abortion spousal and parental consent requirements are virtually nonexistent and in most instances minor daughters can obtain abortions even without parental knowledge what we have in this country today is nothing less than runaway wideopen abortionondexnand there are no real restrictions oni the socalled right to abortion that was created in the supreme courts 1973 decision many people erroneously believe that abortions are freely available in the first trimester subject to medical determination in the seicond and banned in the third when the fetus is viable this is simply not true a lot of people may think it is that way be cause they expected it to be that way or perhaps because subconsciously they wanted it to be that way but the facb is that abortions are allowed even into the third trimester of a pregnancy in its 1973 roe against wade decision the court said that in the first trimester of a pregnancy the abortion decision was solely a matter for the pregnant woman and her doctor that in the second trimester the state may regulate the abortion procedure but only for reasons of the health of the mother and that in the third trimester the state may regulate and even proscribe abortion except where it is medically necessary for the life or health of the mother in other words any doctor may perform an abortion at any time during the entire 9 months of pregnancy as long as hie feels it is medically necessary and as long as he does not kill or harm the woman in the process a state may not prohibit any abortion deemed medically necessary i doubt we could find many doctorswilling to perform an abortion who would also be willing to say that it was not medically necessary here are the courts own words on the subject a for the stage prior to approximately the end of the first trimester the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant womans attending physician b for the stage subsequent to approximately the end of the first trimester the state in promoting its interest in the health of the mother may ilt chooses regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health c for the stage subsequent to viability the state in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life may if it chooses regulate and even proscribe abortion except where it is necessary in appropriate medical judgment for the preservation of the life or health of the mother the keyword here is health which has been broadly interpreted to include all factorsphysical emotional psychological and even the womans agerelevant to her wellbeing both congress and state legislatures are virtually powerless to limit this specially created right in any way spousal and parental consent laws have been struck down by the courts the father of an unborn child cannot use legal means to protect its life even the husband of a woman who wishes to abort has no legal recourse to save the life of his own child the parents of minor daughters wishing to abort have no legal voice to prevent the killing of their grandchildren and in most instances they do not even have to be informed of their daughters intention to have an abortion the practice of abortion has gone well beyond what most people thought it would be when the court handed down its 1973 decision the hard cases that were so thoroughly publicized in the early 1970s were seen as the justification for allowing this practice but today these constitute less than 5 percent of the i1v million abortions in this country each year part of the reason for the rapid and expansivf growth of the antiabortion sentiment has been the frustration of the people who as americans believe they should have some voice in the public policy their government sets and who have been i effect excluded from representation in this area by the courts which have overruled or disallowed antiabortion measures at every turn even abortionfunding restrictions which certainly are supported by a majority of americans be they prolife advocates or just plain taxpayers have been challenged and tied up by the courts for years it is obvious that the supreme court 1973 decision legalizing abortion has not exactly enjoyed overwhelming popular support many americans are firmly opposed to it and many others though they may be willing to tolerate the current status of abortion feel that the practice has gone too far when the supreme court made its 1973 decision legalizing abortion it did not solve a problem it created one it legalized the taking of human life before that decision most people really had not given the matter of abortion much thought a few states had permissive abortion laws reports about some hard cases such as the thalidomide babies appeared in the media with almost predictable frequency the shock value of these reports did much to prepare a generally sympathetic reaction in the public mind a predisposition to accept abortion especially in those cases that might cause a lifetime of suffering and anguish there were those rare but wellpublicized pregnancies resulting from rape or incest as well as the everpresent children being born to the poor many of these and other pregnancies came to be called unwanted and some people could see some justification for some abortions and when the court announced a womans right to have an abortion they readily accepted that ruling as the law of the land the few people who did object found it difficult to challenge these justifications without appearing hardhearted and insensitive to the hard cases that had been dramatized so often and so effectively in the years preceding the courts decision the standard comment was i dont approve of aborti on myself but i can not deny a woman the right to have one if she chooses thus the right to have an abortion sanctioned by the court and promoted by a strong abortion lobby was accepted as part of the conventional wisdom but that was a decade ago and times change today the fallacy of that standard comment could readily be seen by substituting the word slavery to get i1 do not approve of slavery myself but i can not deny a slaveholders right to own slaves if he chooses people now have begun to realize that the unborn child is not a part of the mothers body it is a distinct arid individual human life people now realize that the right to choose does have limitations especially when one chooses to kill another human being they have begun to see that what started out as a few hard cases has expanded into a massive anid virtually indiscriminate elimination of more than 11 million unborn human lives a year for reasons much less compelling than a threat to the mothers life or that rare rape or fetal handicap case there has been a veritable parade of women into abortion centerswomen who wanted abortions for economic reasons for social reasons for reasons of convenience comfort and careers and even women who wanted unwanted pregnancies just to demonstrate that they were fertile according to an article entitled abortion chic in the village voice hardly an antiabortion periodical earlier this year feb 10 19831 p 32 many women are replacing having children with having abortions not only in the literal sense but also as a major rite of passage the author leslie savan wrote it provides a reallife experience and seemi to increase our participation in the great tlines of life and death 0 torn between femininity and feminism getting pregnant proves we are feminine while getting an abortion proves we are feminist today people are beginning to see what they did not see when they first accepted what they thought was a little bit of justifiable abortion they had not realized that in the wake of the courts decision there would be a booming business of fullscale wideopen abortionondemand they had not realized that this ruling was a violation of a right that was inviolable and an alienation of a right that was unalienablethe right to life they had not realizedt that once the barrier of protection for this right was broken for one segment of humanity the unborn other members of the human family would be in danger most importantly they had not realized that the precedent established by this deecksion would be used again and again to expand the application of a nowprevailing antilife mentalitya nowaccepted utilitarian ethic that says that only the useful or wanted are acceptable in our society columnist joan beck commented recently chicago tribune may 22 1981 that8ince the laws of this country permit normal healthy babies to be killed actively 4 or 5 months before birth many people are now finding it increasingly easy to tolerate passive euthanasia of severely handicapped infants immediately after birth to make it easier a few physicians refer to a defective newborn as a fetus ex utero 1 apparently calling it by another name would make it seem less human the fact is they are allowing babies to die she was writing in reference to the recent case in danville ill in which severely deformed siamese twins had allegedly been left to die she went on to comment that infanticide occurs in many hospitals where the death of newborns with severe birth defects is often tacitly encouraged and quoted john a robertson university of wisconsin law school professor as having said passive euthanasia of defective newborns is a pervasive and widespread practice in pediatric nurseries hospitals and intensive care units across america europe and elsewhere in his famous infanticidethe silent domino speech a few years ago dr c everett koop spoke of the quiet practice of infanticide and warned that it would become more widespread and accepted because it follows logically as the next step in the spread of the antilife mentality that was let loose when the abortion barrier was broken by the court in in recent months there have been efforts to delete amendments restricting abortion funding from appropriations bills the reason given for this is that authorizing committee chairmen are no longer refusing to deal directly with the abortion issue through substantive legislation and that therefore abortionfunding prohibitions are no longer appropriate nor necessary as riders on appropriations bills this matter it is said would be more appropriately addressed by legislation designed to deal specifically with that subject there is of course a difference between restrictions on abortion funding and restrictions on the practice of abortion itself funding limitations can be and have been enacted through amendments on appropriations bills i would hope that those in effect will remain and that those that are still needed will soon be passed so that taxpayer money is no longer used without limitations to finance abortions under any federal program do we continue year after year with the distasteful experience of debating and redebating this issue in the context of appropriation bills or do we as so many of our colleagues have recommended deal squarely with it here and now thus eliminating the need for annual battles during the appropriations process now is the time to remove the abortion issue from the court monopoly and to give it to the people through their elected representatives in congress and in the states to decide we can no longer allow access to the processes of representative democracy to be closed to those who rightfully

relations with our nato allies at no time in the history of the atlantic alliance is the need for allied cooperation greater especally cooperation with great britain with the soviet drive into afghanistan and the continuing crisis in poland it is clear that the western nations must be politically united it is with great reluctance therefore that i raise the issue of the current arms sales restrictions to the royal ulster constabulary in northern ireland i was glad to learn on march 5 1981 that president reagan has not seen fit to change unitedstates policy on this delicate and difficult question no member of this housc is unfamiliar with the long traffic nd bloody history of englishirish relations the roots of the current conflict in northern ireland are very deep indeed and no simple explanation in terms of reli gious difference economic inequities or social discrimination can suffice as a broadcast journalist i had the opportunity to visit northern ireland in fact i covered the unfolding tragedy in northern ireland four times my most vivid memories go back to bloody sunday january 30 1972 i was shot in the back with a british rubber bullet a projectile 5 inches long and as hard as a rock so i think it is fair to say that i can speak with some authority on the nature of the current disorders i understand very well the problems confronting british prime minister thatcher the irish republican army of 1981 is not the irish republican army of 1916 the great and fearless leaders of the 1916 rebellion who challenged the british army would be shocked by the outright acts of terrorism unleashed against innocent civilians in the name of political independence and social justice there is a real distinction between the conduct of irregular warfare against military opponents and the acts of terrorism perpetrated against noncombants there is in other words a real distinction between a patriot and a criminal and the irish republican army is in the main a band of criminals i do not think there is any need to belabor the point terrorism or violence from whatever quarter for whatever reason is worthy of the moral opprobrium of all civilized men and women whatever their political or religious convictions with that said i think we must learn to disabuse ourselves of the notion that all of the socalled peacekeeping forces in northern ireland are morally neutral defenders of law and order i am not now referring to the british army i would call the attention of the house to the fact that in every interview i had with enlisted welsh scottish and english soldiers assigned to duty in northern ireland the general them of their statements was always the same we dont want to be here this i our vietnam the role of the british army is a matter of another extended discussion i am referring to the royal ulster constabulary the ruc i have little confidence that the ruc is an agency of disinterested justice there have been serious allegations from many reputable sources including the european court of human rights the european commission on human rights and amnesty international that this force is guilty of inhuman and degrading treatment of suspects the british rule in northern ireland whatever independent sentiments one may harbor about the legitimacy of that rule or the rightfulness of the british connection has been unquestionably marred by derious human rights violations including the use of torture against internees moreover the british government has in fact acknowledged such violations in the conduct of its own investigations into charges of brutality in ulster and while the british government claims that it is no longer culpable of human rights violations reports of such violations still surface with an unhappy frequency current st te department policy is in accordance with unitedstates law on the conditions for arms sales it may very well be that the general law itself should be reviewed but its application in northern ireland should be reviewed only after extensive hearings into the conditions in northern ireland i would hope that the house foreign affairs committee on which i serve could address this issue in an exhaustive fashion in the meantime whatever the united states might or could contribute to resolving the extremely difficult problems of northern ireland certainly that contribution should include the shipment of additional weapons as a strong supporter of president reagans foreign policy initiatives i am heartenld by the presidents determination to support

year 1983 the budget committees report on page 132 tidicates that its recommendation related to the federal employees compensation act and we are in effect directed to save the moneys indicated rounded off to 0 05 billion at this point by adopting the presidents proposals for amending that act the administrations proposal was part of last years budget recopelliation and was rejected by the congress a gao report entitled injury compensation process delays prompt payment of benefits to federal workers issued on september 25 of last year undercut the administrations propos al very substantially in the course of oversight investigations and hearings the subcommittee on labor standards chaired by representative george miller of california it has been clearly demonstrated that many of the provisions in the administrations proposal are illfounded illconsidered unfair unworkable and unduly burdensome it is my understanding that chairman miller has some ideas he is presently having costed out by the congressional budget office he indicated that his proposals will save money and improve the program he should be given a reasonable opportunity to perfect his legislation he should not be driven under the gun of this socalled reconciliation process to accept the adminstrations proposal which would convert the federal employees compensation system to one of the most regreysive in the nation the administrations proposal imposes more of the cost of an injury on the victim than would any state workers compensation system in the country the cost reductions would be more apparent than real the conversion of feca benefits at age 65 to the civil service retirement system would reduce the cost of feca of course but would be an increased cost to the retirement system the post office and civil service committee should be party to these decisions the paperwork complexity of the administrations proposals create a disincentive to the federal employee even to file a claim they have thought of everythingthey even have a proposal to round off benefits down to the last whole dollar the benefits of a gs2 would be reduced by the last 99 cents i would hope the congress

to be a pattern the bill should require just one disclosure as far as i am concerned and then it should be punished if we leave the language pattern of activities in there we are going to have to

others have made the main point i would like to share is that we need to i think at a time like this remind ourselves what a budget actually is a budget is more than just a ledger of numbers it is not just a game of arithmetic it is not just subtraction and addition it is certainly a list of numbers but more than that it is a dollars and cents statement of national objectives it is a dollars and cents statement of who we are as a people i say that because where we choose to take money and where we choose to put money in the budget or take it out of the budget really defines our own political values as a people i must say as i look at who the winners are and who the losers are in the budget that has been presented to this congress i am appalled at the definition of the american people that we are being asked to approve the winners are the militaryindustrial complex the b1 bombers mx missiles we even have funds in this budget for 4 2 billion over the next 5 years for civil defense bomb shelters and evacuation plans which we know are not going to work which we know are not going to save this country if there is an exchange between the superpowers that is 4 2 billion that is coming out of the mouths of hungry children that is coming out of the health care needs of senior citizens it is coming out of teenage unemployment programs for inner city youth that is where that money is coming from in this budget we have funds proposed by this administration for nerve gas production that is another winner in this budget who are the losers they are the hungry children the hispanics they are the blacks they are the minorities they are the senior citizens the sick the weak the elderly they are the losers what kind of national definition is that of our values of who we are as a people i just say to my colleague when we evaluate the winners and the losers one can see very quickly that there are not one but two deficits before us for our consideration today at this time in washington d c first there is the obvious deficit the 182 billion deficit to the treasury that this administration proposes on top of all of the other inequities in its budget but then there is the more pernicious oneand i refer to it as the moral deficitthe moral deficit because there is no promise there is no economic boom that has been precipitated as promised by the reaganomics plan instead what we have is no boom at all 10 million people out of work nearly without hope teenage unemployment for minority youth nearly 50 percent there is no boom at all and so what we have instead is a raw shift of resources from those folks at the bottom of the society to those folks at the top i think for that reason we do have a moral deficit in the economic plan and it needs to be corrected the

american history on saturday february 13 1982 pete seeger is presenting a benefit concert at wayne state univeristy in michigans 13th congressional district to help establish a scholarship fund to honor the four wayne students who fought to defend democracy in the spanish civil war on july 18 1936 contingents of the spanish army and air force in spanish morocco revolted against the government in madrid and launched a civil war that was to cost over 650 000 lives during a 34month period the rebels represented the falange a movement inspired in part by the fascist regimes of hitler and mussolini dominated by socialists and social democrats the democratic republican government had ruled since 1931 after the monarchy was overthrown by a bloodless coup in an attempt to contain the civil war the european powers agreed to refrain from intervening in spain the thenisolationist united states approved of the noninterventionist policy and in 1937 extended its own neutrality laws to civil wars this policy which included an arms embargo was unprecedented since legitimate governments had always been able to purchase arms during civil wars italy germany and fascist portugal first violated the nonintervention pledge the italians sent 60 000 volunteers into combat in spain while the nazis sent their condor legion which soon established fascist mastery in the air the nazi fliers tried out tactics they later used successfully in poland belgium holland and france in a relatively feeble counter move the soviet union sent money military supplies and advisers to assist the republic moscow also helped organize the international brigades over 30 000 volunteers from 53 different countries joined the international brigades to aid the spanish republic among them were more than 3 000 americans who fought in the abraham lincoln and the canadian mackenziepapineau battalions violating their countrys neutrality laws they traveled past suspicious american agents to france from where they were smuggled across the french border into spain seamen students teachers miners longshoremen and steelworkers were among the wide variety of americans who fought for the republic in addition as many as 100 black americans helped to constitute the unitedstates first integrated armed service americans went to spain for a variety of reasons among the complex ii1127 mix of motivations that led them to join the brigades were a deep commitment to the survival of democracy in spain concern about the containment of european fascism support for the interests of the soviet union a lust for adventure and a feeling that their sacrifice might popularize the republican cause and thus force the democracies to lift their arms embargc four wayne state university studentsmarsden moran roy mcquarry joe rubenstein and robert naglejoined the hundreds of college students among the american volunteers the untrained but enthusiastic brigadeers were often used as shock troops on the front lines in those tragically bloody campaigns of the civil war fewer than half of the american brigadeers survived and of those more than three quarters required medical treatment upon their return for their efforts many of the survivors were hounded for being members of a subversive groupthe veterans of the abraham lincoln brigadeor for being communists or fellow travelers or for being permature antifascists this persecution took place despite the fact that the vast majority of the vets had served in the american military or merchant marine during world war ii although madrid fell in march of 1939 and spain was to suffer under a third of a century of fascist rule the courage and idealism of the americans who fought to defend democracy has not been forgotten
