the worst of times this tale is why i oppose the supplemental appropriations act the main characters in my story are an incompetent president and a corrupt congress the setting is an america desperate for honest leadership but the plot involves lies and coverups the problem is misplaced priorities but the solution is not this supplemental which provides another 67 6 billion for a failed war but only 19 billion to help the victims of katrina the first disaster the iraq war was predicated on lies iraq had no weapons of mass destruction had never attempted to buy uranium from niger and was not about to welcome american soldiers with open arms an incompetent president failed to prepare america for the postwar period as a result looting of stores and museums began shortly after the united states military gained control of baghdad months later sectarian violence has pushed iraq to civil war with shiite militia and security forces clashing with sunni citizens and insurgents yet our troops remain in iraq and in harms way two american soldiers and 40 iraqi soldiers and civilians are killed every day as long as we stay in iraq the insurgency will continue even as the socalled iraqi democracy experiment goes nowhere three months after parliamentary elections the iraqi parliament has yet to form a government finally large republican donors including halliburton have looted the american treasury using their connections to secure nobid contracts for services in iraq these firms overcharge american taxpayers and underserve our troops all the while republicans blind allegiance to the president causes them to write blank checks throwing good money after bad at a war that is making america less secure the second disaster was the republican response to hurricane katrina several days before katrina ravaged the gulf coast the president was briefed on the severity of the storm and the likelihood levees would be breached but after failing to cut short his extended vacation to help with the response the president told abc news and the american public he was not advised the levees were likely to collapse after years of underfunding levee construction and mairtenance republicans attempted to shift the blame for the disaster and the inadequate response onto state and local officials but it was president bush who nominated unqualified campaign hacks to head fema and congressional republicans who rubberstamped the appointment of michael brown as a result of insufficient preparation and incompetent administration tens of thousands of hurricane victims went without adequate food water and shelter in the storms aftermath six months after katrina relief workers are still finding bodies of victims in an attempt to atone for their sins the republicans have finally brought forth additional legislation to help katrina victims but in a pathetic and transparent attempt to prevent full debate on the disastrous iraq war president bushs republican cronies in congress combined two supplementals into one although i support additional funding for hurricane victims i cannot vote for a supplemental that appropriates 74 percent of its funds or 67 6 billion to a misguided iraq war on which we have already wasted 350 billionand the lives of 2 310 american soldiers and at least 37 000 iraqi citizens it is time to tell a new tale about bringing home our troops and rebuilding homes for katrina victims lets get this iraq monkey off our back and supplement housing rather than halliburton i urge my colleagues to vote against this bill and help me to tell

homes who are on medicaid and onethird of all babies who are born on medicaid and 8 million americans with disabilities who depend on medicaid and 36 million americans who have to worry about going hungry how do we as a congress reconcile the fact that these cuts will disproportionately affect lowincome americans the elderly and the poor the answer is we should not reconcile ourselves to such an action not for 1 minute not for a nanosecond if we are going to dramatically change for the worse the lives of millions of children and families and senior citizens across the country it had better be because we had to not because we chose to and there is no doubt that republicans have now chosen to rob the poor to maintain and create new tax breaks for the rich we are not simply robbing the poor of resources the proposedcuts are robbing the poor of opportunity the reconciliation budget targets programs that work to bridge the gap between rich and poor medicaid food stamps and student loans that strive to even the playing field for all american families eight weeks ago across the united states americans saw the faces of other americans staring up at them from television screens scratching out desperate signs on rooftops help us the signs said grandmothers brothers nieces nephews newborns the faces of families who could be our families neighbors who could be our neighbors but desperate alone and calling out to the world to see across the country americans answered with one voice we are better than this this is wrong this is immoral this must not be allowed to continue we must take care of our own it is our responsibility it is our duty it is who we are as a people as a country we saw that 100 000 people were trapped in new orleans because they did not have automobiles to escape the flood waters we found that 50 percent of all children in louisiana live in poverty in response to this national revelation republicans have revisited our national budget and made a decision to cut programs from the poorest of the poor while protecting a new tax cut giveaway to the richest of the rich instead of limiting these tax cuts to millionaires the republicans have decided to rebuild new orleans on the backs of the poorest people from the rest of the country this is a moral question not a budget matter the repjiblicans are building the high levees around their threatened tax cuts while letting the flood swamp the programs that matter for the rest of americans this is what the debate is really all about it is about our values as a nation and how they are reflected in how we govern how america should treat its neighbors our fellow americans who by an accident of birth came into this world unable to see or who were born into a family without the means to put food on the table or who had the misfortune to develop alzheimers should we let them starve should we tell their children they will never go to college because their parents cannot pay the tuition shall we turn them away from the hospitals because they cannot afford the care and do not have the insurance or should we as a country decide that in this land of plenty no one should go without basic human dignity as a catholic i was brought up to believe that character is judged by how we treat the least amongst us this budget does not pass that test and my hope is that tomorrow we as a congress will rise up to defeat it poverty is on the rise in our country 37 million americans are now in poverty i a family of two in povertya single mother with her child is living on 1 069 a

and each day in america 2 385 more babies are born into poverty the republicans will say that society has little obligation to help the poor because they fail to take personal responsibility for their lives the united states has highest gdp in the world we are first in military technology first in military exports first in gross domestic product first in the number of millionaires and billionaires and first in health technology but we rank 12th in living standards among our poorest onefifth 13th in the gap between rich and poor 14th in efforts to lift children out of poverty 18th in the percent of children in poverty and 37th in the health status of our citizens we should be working to close these gaps and ensure that all americans have a fair chance at life and are treated with basic human dignity instead this reconciliation plan will take away food health care education and the abilityto live in dignity in old age from people who have no other options this budget will proliferate existing inequalities i simply cannot reconcile this budget with my values because this budget does not reflect who we are as a nation and what we believe our responsibility is to other americans we

section 5 in the original voting rights act but we are also the only state to have jurisdictions that have exercised their right to bail out under section 5 in order to bail out a jurisdiction must have been in full compliance with the preclearanbe requirements for 10 years it can have no test or device to discriminate on the basis of race color language or minority status and no lawsuit against the jurisdiction alleging voter discrimination can be pending eleven jurisdictions some of which are in my district have bailed out successfully more jurisdictions should and will follow suit i have been assured by civil rights leaders they will support bailouts where appropriate where jurisdictions can meet the basic requirement i would like to note that the justification for the continuing of this act is not based solely on old data that in fact hearings have been held and i think the record is complete showing the continued need for this section 5 is important because it is still being

michigan the chairman of the subcommittee he and i worked in the last session along with the gentleman from texas and the gentleman from michigan and other members of our committee in order to draft legislation which is very similar to the legislation which we are passing here today i would like if it is permissible within the rules to also thank the democrat and republican members of the other body for their work on this legislation as well we truly passed this legislation in a bicameral bipaitisan fashion first let me state that back in ancient prehistoric political times back in 1991 that i was the principal house sponsor of the telephone consumer protection act which contained the original junk fax prohibition in 1991 that legislation passed this body and this general prohibition against junk faxes became law because of this intrusive form of advertising every time someone junk faxes you it is your paper that is coming out of the machine you are paying for that paper your machine is tied up it is just absolutely one of the most irritating things to people to have to pay for someone else coming into your hormie or your business when you do not want them there it is essentially a tax which is paid by the recipient of something that they never asked for in the first place this is something that ultimately takes up precious time as well the machine is tied up there is too much clutter that is associated with it and important faxes are lost in the midst of the pile of junk faxes how many people have just taken a pile of junk faxes throwi it away and in the middle of i t was a fax you really wanted from someone but you were just so ticked off by this generally unwanted clutter which has come into your home or your business so i think it is important to emphasize that the bill we bring to the house floor today retains the general prohibition against sending junk faxes in other words sending an unsolicited facsimile advertisement is against the law we are not changing the law or the policy with respect to this sending a junk fax was illegal and it remains illegal under this bill neither are we changing any of the statutory enforcement mechanisms available to the federal communications commission or to the individual consumers themselves in this bill the legislation we are proposing will address certain provisions affecting an exception to the general prohibition against sending junk faxes and will improve the bill in these areas i think that it cannot be emphasized enough how this bill is the product again of the bipartisan work that both parties have engaged in over the last 2 or 3 years to reach todays final product and i urge the house to adopt unanimously this legislation today i rise in support of this bill this legislation builds upon legislation that was passed by the house in the last congress and which this year was negotiated out between both democratic and republican members in the other body over a number of months i encourage members to support this legislation today first let me state that i was the principal house sponsor of the telephone consumer protection act tcpa of 1991 which contained the original junk fax prohibition congress endorsed my call in 1991 for a general prohibition against junk faxes because of the intrusive nature of that form of advertising junk faxes represent a form of advertising in which the ad is essentially paid for by the recipient the recipient of a junk fax pays for the fax paper and printer costs pays in the form of precious lost time as the machine is tied up and also in the form of the clutter in which important faxes are lost in the midst of a pile of junk faxes i think it is important to emphasize that the bill we bring to the house floor today retains the general prohibition against sending junk faxes in other words sending an unsolicited facsimile advertisement is against the law we are not changing the law or the policy with respect to thissending a junk fax was illegal and remains illegal under this bill neither are we changing any of the statutory enforcement mechanisms available to the fcc or consumers in this bill the legislation we are proposing will address certain provisions affecting an exception to the general prohibition against sending junk faxes and will improve the bill in these areas since the fcc originally implemented the 1991 junk fax provisions of the tcpa commission regulations contained an exception for faxes that were sent because an established business relationship existed between the sender and the recipient these regulations were in place and the ability to send junk faxes based upon this exception was permitted by the commission for over a decade this concept of an established business relationship perriiitted a commercial entity to invoke its ability to demonstrate such a relationship with a consumer in order to contact that consumer in spite of the general prohibitions of the law the fcc has more recently determined that the term established business relationship was not specifically included in the provisions addressing junk faxes in the tcpa and therefore changed its regulations the new rules proposed by the commission require written permission from consumers and these new rules have been stayed from going into effect until june 30th of this year just a few short days away the legislation before us is designed to put specific language into the statute permitting an established business relationship exception to the general prohibition against junk faxes many businesses have complained that written permission is too onerous a regulatory requirement for many of the faxes that they stipulate are routinely sent in the ordinary course of business to established customers or customers requesting such faxes this has been done by reputable business entities presumably without complaints from the recipients of such faxes we must recognize however that many small businesses and residential consumers find many of these unsolicited faxes including those faxes sent because a valid claim of an established business relationship was being asserted to be a considerable irritant and strongly object to receiving them the legislation therefore addresses additional issues including putting into the statute an optout ability for consumers to object to receiving junk faxes even when such faxes are sent to them based upon an established business relationship for the decade that the original fcc regulations were in place many consumers simply were not aware of the fccs established business relationship exception nor did very many know they had an ability to stop these faxes or any clear way in which to effectuate such a request the bill the house is considering includes new provisions requiring an optout notice and policy that we will add to the statute the bill requires junk faxes to include on the first page a clear and conspicuous notice to consumers that they have the right not to receive future junk faxes from the sender second the notice must include a domestic contact telephone number and fax number for consumers to transmit a request not to receive future faxes third the substitute requires the notice to conform with the commissions technical and procedural standards for sending faxes under section 227 d of the law which include the requirement to identify the entity sending the facsimile advertisement this is an important provision because one of the biggest complaints from the fcc at the hearing and with other law enforcement entities and aggrieved consumers is that they have had difficulty legally identifying the source of many of the unsolicited faxes in addition there were some senders of junk faxes who evidently and false ly believed that simply because they were sending an unsolicited fax based upon their ability to prove they had an established business relationship with a consumer and thus did not have to abide by the general prohibition against such faxes that this also meant they did not have to abide by the other fcc and statutory technical rules these statutory and regulatory rules include requirements that junk fax senders identify themselves in such faxes law enforcement entities and consumers need to be able to find the legal business name or widely recognized trade name of the entity sending a junk fax in violatioq of the rules in order to pursue enforcement actions fourth this bill makes it clear that a consumer can optout of receiving faxes to multiple machines if they have more than one rather than opting out solely for the particular machine that received the junk fax fifth in this legislation the commission is tasked with exploring additional mechanisms by which a consumer might optout such as in person or by email or regular mail and also requests that the commission establish costfree ways by which consumers can optout these notice and optout requirements all represent new provisions to the law for which existing enforcementremedies will apply this legislation also includes the ability for the fcc to limit the duration of an established business relationship notwithstanding the fact that the law would include an optout notice and ability which avails consumers of the right to optout of receiving faxes atany point in time i believe this is an important concept and one which deals with the legitimate expectations of consumers if a consumer buys something from a store consumers might expect to hearfrom that store within a reasonable period of time over time however a consumers expectation changes and there is a time after which the established business relationship can be said to have lapsed finally i think it is important to take a comprehensive look at overall enforcement of the junk fax law i am concerned that some of the most egregious junk fax operations the entities that broadcast such faxes to millions often escap6 enforcement they may be found guilty cited by the fcc and sometimes finedbut often it appears as if they either ignore the fines skip town or live overseas for these reasons the bill includes provisions that will give us an annual accounting of the fccs enforcement activities as well as a gao analysis of what additional enforcement tools may be necessary to provide sufficient deterrent especially to the most egregious and abusive junk fax senders again i want to commend chairman upton and chairman barton for their work on this bill and in particular for their willingness and openness in working with me and mr dingell in crafting the compromises needed to achieve consensus i encourage all the members to support it i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.9911967515945435,

the bataan death march who then were used as slave labor by the japanese they cannot even be compensated by suing the japanese and this is not something that happened just in history american pows

which is uncharacteristic for me i just couldnt have a resolution of this magnitude on the floor of the house without coming here and lending support two minutes could never be enough for me to speak on this issue and i am afraid even 2 hours might not be long enough for me to express my feelings and my views i grew up in a family where the very existence of israel changed our lives i was born in my grandmothers apartment on the lower east side of new york and grew up hearing stories of what their lives were like in europe before they came to this country and how important israel was to the survival of the jewish people and while the jewish people were people of the diaspora and had managed to survive without a nation for 5 000 years the very existence of israel gave each of us a tremendous sense of confidence and wellbeing knowing that we had a homeland of our own i was not alive in the 1948 war or the 1956 when israel was attacked again by its arab neighbors 1967 i was more aware and 1973 of course what i find incomprehensible and something i simply cannot understand that here we are so many years after the creation of israel after the aftermath of the holocaust and the very reasons that israel was established and we are still debating throughout the world whether israel has a right to exist i am so proud of my colleagues for introducing this resolution i think it strikes the exact right note at the exact right time in our worlds history we cannot allow this to continue israel has a right to exist have secure borders and lead a life for its citizens and i think

group was continuously lobbing rockets into my town where i live where my children play i would demand that my country do whatever they had to to eliminate the threatisrael should there should be no mistake about who is behind this crisis iran and syria irans president pledged to wipe israel off the map and he refers to israel as an illegitimate nation syrias troops occupied southern lebanon illegally until 2005 this is a strictly defensive action on the part of israel there is an internationally recognized border with lebanon israel unilaterally completed its withdrawal from lebanon over 6 years ago for 6 years the lebanese government has done nothing to stepin and establish control over part of its country they did nothing and left a power vacuum filled by hezbollah in the southern third of lebanon hezbollah uses southern lebanon to lob katusha rockets into israel with the hope of killing someone killing anyone they are not there to build a nation protecting a people laying a foundation for a better lebanonthey are there to kill israelis israel did everything it could possibly do to avoid a conflict in lebanonasking time and again that the government of lebanon take control and police their territory unfortunately these requests went unanswered and the terrorism continued to grow on its border with gaza israel also faces unrelenting terrorist attacks after years of waiting and praying and hoping for a peace partner israel chose to unilaterally withdraw from gaza it uprooted families who created beautiful settlements these families built homes from nothing

produces over 30 of our nations seafood including 50 of our shrimp crop our wetlands are home to over 79 endangered species and serve as a vital habitat for migratory birds the network of interconnected waterways and presence of several major port facilities are an important hub in our maritime industry over 70 of the grain produced in the united states travels through the area 30 of our domestic crude oil and 34 of our natural gas is produced by or travels through south louisiana making us a centerpiece in americas energy coast in addition to transporting much of our domestic oil supply coastal louisiana also refines 16 of our petroleum products knowing this we must ensure that this valuable part of our natiois infrastructure remains intact and its people remain protected our current levee system in new orleans dates back to the 1960s and since then our whole environment has changed the loss of coastal barrier islands and the erosion of our wetlands have led to a weakened first line of defense against hurricanes these islands and wetlands help absorb the storms tidal surge and weaken the strength of an approaching storm we are losing our wetlands at a rate of 25 to 30 square miles per year while we are making areas further inland more susceptible to flooding we have seen hurricanes become more powerful and more frequent as the years go by the risk of hurricanes will always be present in south louisiana it is up to us to decide how to best mitigate their destructive impacts looking at this situation i am reminded of what i saw firsthand in the netherlands after the devastating north sea floods of 1953 that nation committed itself to a system of water management projects that would ensure such a flood never happened again although the cost was high their determination to provide absolute protection was justified as a result the netheriands now has a significant number of its citizens living and produces 70 of its 480 billion gdp in areas that are fifteen to twenty feet below sea level safely protected by flood control projects by comparison the lowest areas of new orleans are only four and a half feet below sea level protecting the city is not beyond our technological capabilities it is simply a matter of making the commitment necessary to do so while the cost may seem substantial now it pales in comparison to the cost we would face in human and economic losses should another hurricane strike south louisiana directly it is time to get it right we must ensure the safety of the city of new orleans and the rest of the gulf coast

further the tsa concurred with the 9 11 commission recommendation that we must expedite the installation of advanced inline baggage screening equipment in addition inline baggage screening systems have a much higher throughput than standalone systems if we install inline systems more bags will be screened by explosive detection systems instead of less reliable alternative methods the tsa and

baggage screening systems at the 9 airports that received loi funding could save the federal government 1 3 billion over 7 years tsa further estimated that it could recover its initial investment in

cannot support changing the constitution along the lines of this proposal so i will not vote for this resolution under our federal system there are many matters where the states have broad latitude to shape their laws and policies in ways their residents think fit subject to the unitedstates constitutions provisions protecting individual rights and one of those areas has been family law including the regulation of marriage and divorce but this amendment would change that adoption of this amendment would for the first time impose a constitutional restriction on the ability of a state to define marriage and it would do so in a way that would restrict not protect individual rights that now are protected in at least some states i think this is not necessary or appropriate some of the resolutions supporters say it is needed so a state whose laws ban samesex marriages or civil unions will not be forced to recognize such marriages or unions established under another states laws they say this could happen because article iv of the constitution requires each state to give full faith and credit to another states public acts records and judicial proceedings but my understanding is that this part of the constitution has never been construed to require states to recognize the validity of all marriages of people from other states instead over the years various states have refused to recognize some outofstate mardages and the full faith and credit clause has not been used to force them to do otherwisebecause marriages are not judgments but civil contracts that a state may choose to recognize as a matter of comity not as a constitutional requirement as if this were not enough in 1996 congress passed and president clinton signed into law the defense of marriage act that law says no state territory or possession of the united states or indian tribe shall be required to give effect to any public act record or judicial proceeding of any other state territory possession or tribe respecting a relationship between persons of the same sex that is treated as a marriage under the laws of such other state territory possession or tribe or a right or claim arising from such relationship not everyone supported that bill at the time but it did pass and now that law is on the books and has not been successfully challenged given this history i am not convinced that this constitutional amendment is necessary to prevent the full faith and credit clause being used to compel a state to recognize a samesex marriage moreover when you focus on the language of the proposed amendment it becomes clear that protecting states is not its real purpose that purpose could be achieved by an amendment to the full faith and credit clauseperhaps by putting language along the lines of the defense of marriage act into the constitution itself but that is not what is being proposed here instead this amendment would restrict states by establishing a single definition of marriagethe only definition that any state could recognize and unlike other constitutional amendments it would not protect individuals either it would write into the constitution a new limit on what legal rights they could hope to have protected by a state or the federal government if adopted this amendment would restrict individual liberties instead of expanding them so i think it is clear the real purpose of this amendment is to lay a foundation for discrimination against some americans on the basis of their sexual orientation in good conscience i cannot support that no proposed constitutional amendment should be taken lightly on the contrary i think such proposals require very careful scrutiny and should not be adopted unless we are convinced that a change in our fundamental law is

been able to determine here vote against us so that if we extend the logic of the gentlemans argument i would suggest that maybe during the course of that debate when it comes to the floor if it
