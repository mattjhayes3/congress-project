trust fund congress and the president have come upon the historic opportunity to balance the budget without spending one penny of seniors social security trust fund for nearly 4 decades the raid on social security has gone on taking over 850 billion in social security funds and spending them on unrelated government programs 168 days ago just over 5 months this house passed my social security lockbox legislation by an overwhelming 416 to 12 vote the passage of this social security lockbox legislation showed that house republicans and democrats agree that social security dollars should not be spent on programs unrelated to social security congress made the commitment to stop the raid on social security shortly later however president clinton joined our bipartisan effort and committed the administration to protecting social security that was over 5 months ago unfortunatelyv i am afraid today is a different story while house republicans are continuing to honor our steadfast commitment to protect seniors social security i have great concerns about the recent actions of the clintongore white house and congressional democrats the current budget situation requires that every increase in spending be offset currently if spending is not offset it is drawn directly from seniors social security dollars over the past few weeks president clinton has vetoed five appropriations bills because he says they do not spend enough yet the president has not offered a single solid proposal to pay for those spending increases it appears the president may be willing to spend social security dollars to pay for his spending projects congress and the president are faced with a very clear choice ask federal agencies to save one penny just one penny of a dollar in waste fraud or abuse so we can protect social security or give in to the big washington spenders and raid seniors social security dollars amazingly enough there are still people in washington that do not believe the federal government can tighten its belt by just 1 percent but the american people know the truth a recent poll conducted by the national taxpayers union revealed let me show my colleagues this poll revealed that over 84 percent of americans believe that there is not just 1 percent waste in government but they felt there was at least 5 percent of waste in unneeded spending in the federal spending surely if 84 percent of the american people believe that there is at least 5 percent of waste the president and the congress can work together to find just 1 percent or one penny of waste in order to protect social security dollars so many seniors so many seniors rely upon let me present my colleagues with some examples of waste fraud and abuse that we have found in the federal government the national park service spent 1 million to build an outhouse at glacier national park in montana the expense was explained by the outhouses remote location the outhouse is located nearly 7 miles from the nearest road and it took hundreds of horse trips and more than 800 helicopter drops to get the construction materials to the site another one erroneous medicare payments that waste over 20 billion annually another the department of education maintains a 725 million slush fund which it cannot account for the department of housing and urban development hud estimated it spent 857 million in 1998 in erroneous rent subsidy payments in fiscal year 1998 about 5 percent of the entire program budget let me close with this for a moment and that is delays in disposing of more than 41 000 hud properties cost taxpayers more than 1 million per day these are all examples of how congress and the president can find one penny 1 percent out of a dollar in waste fraud and abuse in the federal government we are all in this together we want to work with the president and vice president gore to find this 1 percent so that we can protect social security dollars we will not however under any circumstances allow the clintongore administration to dip into the social security trust fund to pay for more government spending with that i yield to the gentleman from arizona who serves with me on

communities and farm towns too when one represents such a diverse district they learn to listen to the concerns back home and try and respond to those concerns i have had one very common message that i hear in the city and in the suburbs and in the country in the diverse district that i represent and that message is pretty simple people back home want us to work together and find solutions to the challenges that we are facing i am proud to say that over the last 41 2 years we have listened and we have responded to those concerns to work to change how washington works to make washington more responsive to the folks back home i am proud to say that we accomplished some things we were told we could not do we were told we could not balance the budget we were told we could not balance the budget and lower taxes we were told we could never reform our welfare system but we did i am proud to say in the last 4 years t jiat we balanced the budget for the first time in 28 years producing a projected 2 8 trillion surplus of extra tax revenues we lowered taxes for the middle class for the first time in 16 years and 3 million illinois children now qualify for the 500 per child tax credit back home in my state of illinois that is 1 5 billion that will stay in illinois rather than coming here to washington we also reformed our welfare system which was failing beyond imagination we reformed our welfare system for the first time in a generation as a result of our welfare reform we have seen the welfare rolls in illinois cut in half we have balanced the budget we lowered taxes for the middle class we reformed our welfare system that is pretty good folks often say those are real accomplishments but what is next on congress agenda we are working to continue responding to the issues and concerns of the folks back home and we have a simple agenda in this congress the republican agenda is simple good schools low taxes and a secure retirement for all america and our budget that were working on today reflects that i am often asked some questions in town meetings back home one of the most important ones we addressed this year i am often asked by folks whether at a senior citizens center a union hall or a vfw when are the politicians in washington going to stop raiding the social security trust fund that is a pretty important basic question of course washington has raided the social security trust fund for over 30 years back when lbj was president washington began that process and bad habits are hard to break i am proud to say this republican congress is going to lock away 100 percent of social security revenues for social security only let me point out here what this means and i will compare the republican budget with the clintongore budget on social security the republican budget of course locks away 100 percent of social security for social security i would point out that 137 billion of the social security surplus under our lockbox will stay in social security now the president talks about 62 percent of the surplus for social security and what the president and vice president gore are talking about doing is spending 38 percent of social security on othei things that is what the folks back home call raiding the social security trust fund republicans say 100 percent of social security for social security clintongore they say 62 percent and spend the rest on other things we want to put a stop to that and that is why the lockbox proposal republicans are moving through the congress is so important because it is the first step we should take as we work to save social security let us lock away social security first before we consider any other reforms another question i am often asked is no one ever talks about the national debt let me point out that in this budget this year we are in a position where we are going to be able to pay down 1 8 trillion of the national debt last year we paid off 50 billion this year we are projected to pay off 100 billion of the national debt and under our budget we propose the potential of paying down 1 8 trillion of the national debt saving social security paying down the debt i am also asked at the union halls and the vfws and the other community centers and the grain elevators in the district that i represent when are we going to do something about the tax burden on families today the average family in illinois sends 40 percent of their income to washington and springfield and the local courthouse in taxes the tax burden today for the middle class is at its highest level ever in peacetime history twentyone percent of our gross domestic product goes to washington that is the highest level ever in peacetime history and it is putting a tremendous squeeze on middle class families i believe as we work to lower the tax burden on middle class families we should simplify the tax code we should work to bring fairness to the tax code beginning with the elimination of the marriage tax penalty it is simply wrong that under our tax code 21 million married working couples on average pay 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married let us lower taxes by simplifying the tax code by eliminating the marriage tax penalty let us pay down the national debt and let us save social security"], [0.00012505054473876953, 0.9998749494552612, 1, "america is completely entranced

unrestricted trade with china they talk about access to 1 2 billion potential consumers in china what they do not say is that their real interest is in 1 2 billion chinese workers workers whom they pay wage on the level of slave labor these ceos will tell us increase trade with china will allow human rights to improve democracy will flourish with increased free trade as we engage with china but as these ceos speak their companies systematically violate the most fundamental of human and worker rights in the new report made in china the role of unitedstates companies in denying human and worker rights released by charles kernaghan and the national labor committee we see evidence of american corporations exploiting the horrible conditions of human rights in the peoples republic of china companies such as huffy and nike and walmart are contracting with chinese sweatshops to export to the united states often with the assistance of repressive and corrupt local government

from its celina ohio plant where workers earned 17 an hour huffy now outsources all of its production to developing nations such as china where laborers are forced to work 15 hours a day 7 days a week and earn an average of 33 cents an hour less than 2 percent of what ohio huffy bicycle workers earned walmart makes its line of kathie lee gifford handbags in china there are a thousand workers at the

workers earn nothing at all and in many cases owe the company money these people are indentured servants to kathie lee and to walmart some would simply call it slavery the findings in charles kernaghans report illustrates why democratic countries in the developing world are losing ground to more authoritarian countries in the developing world democratic nations such as india are losing out to more totalitarian governments such as china democratic nations such as taiwan are losing out to more authoritarian governments such as indonesia where people are not free and workers do as their told the share of developing country exports to the unitedstates from democratic nations fell from 53 percent 10 years ago to 35 percent today corporate america wants to do business with countries with docile workforces that earn belowpoverty wages and are not allowed to organize to bargain collectively in manufactured goods developing democracies share of developing country exports fell 21 percent from 56 to 35 percent corporations are relocating their manuficturing bases to more authoritarian regimes from democratic countries where workers do not talk back for fear of being punished western corporations want to invest in countries that have poor environmental standards no worker benefits belowpoverty wages no opportunities to bargain collectively and worse as developing countries make progress toward democracy as they increase worker rights and create regulations to protect the environment the american business community punishes them by pulling its trade and investment from developing democratic countries to totalitarian governments and developing countries decisions about the chinese economy are made by three groups the chinese communist party the peoples liberation

those armenians who lost their lives and national identity during one of historys most tragic examples of persecution and intolerance the armenian genocide of 1915 to 1923 many armenians in america particularly in indiana are the children or grandchildren of survivors in fort wayne we do not have very many armenians to be precise one sometimes two but my friend zohrab taizan is a classic example of many of the armenians in america whose family was chased out of turkey and down into lebanon who moved around having as a child to live in a tent because he saw his family members slaughtered and chased from their homeland coming over to america where they had a chance to succeed with an american dream as armenians actually throughout world history who have been persecuted because of their successes as merchants and often their very success has led to persecution in many lands that they have been over time he came to america to the indiana institute of technology like many other foreign students who came in learned engineering and became a very successful engineer in our hometown i first saw a slide presentation on the facts of this terrible genocide about 20 years ago when i was a young businessman in fort wayne belonging to the rotary club mr zohrab taizan made a presentation that will forever be burned into my mind about the terrible persecution not just discrimination and not just random persecution but the attempt to exterminate an entire people the facts as we have heard a number of times but i think it is important that we have these burned into our head on april 24 that is the particular day we commemorate the tragedy because it marks the beginning of the persecution and ethnic cleansing by the ottoman turks on april 24 1915 armenian political intellectual and religious were arrested forcibly moved from their homeland and killed the brutality continued against the armenian people as families were uprooted from their homes and marched to concentration camps in the desert where they would eventually starve to death by 1923 the religious and ideological persecution by the ottoman turks resulted in the murder of 1 5 million armenian men women and children and the displacement of an additional 500 000 armenians in our lifetime we have witnessed the brutality and savagery of genocide by despotic regimes seeking to deny people of human rights and religious freedoms that is stalin against the russians jptler against the jews mao tsetung against the chinese pol pot against the cambodians and mobutu against the rwandans but genocide has devastating consequences on society as a whole because of the problems created by uprooting entire populations the survivors become the ones who carry the memory of suffering and the realization that their loved ones are gone they are the ones who no longer have a home and may feel ideological and spiritual abandonment part of the healing process for armenian survivors and families of survivors involves the acknowledgment of the atrocity and the admission of wrongdoing by those doing the persecution it is only through acknowledgment and forgiveness that it is possible to move past the history of the genocide and other sins unfortunately those responsible for ordering the systematic removal of the armenians were never brought to justice and the armenian genocide be came a dark moment in history as we heard earlier quoted by hitler and others who then proceeded to use it as an example to commit genocide on others to be slowly forgotten by those in america and the international community it is important that we remember this tragic event and show strong leadership by denouncing the persecution of people due to their differences in political and religious ideology by establishing a continuing discourse we are acknowledging the tragedies of the past and remembering those awful moments in history so they will not be repeated i want to thank all of my colleagues those members who have supported this resolution as well as all the armenian organizations in this country and throughout the world who have worked so hard to establish an understanding for

opportunity for girls it means dire poverty for families in some parts of the world there is a great stigma attached to contracting tb this leads to increased isolation abandonment and divorce of

no prospects for another marriage turning to prostitution in order to support their families currently an estimated one third of the worlds population including some 1015 million people in the united states are infected with the tb bacteria because there is no way to stop tb at national borders the only way to eliminate tb here in the unitedstates is to control it worldwide especially in nations

been in the news a lot recently many members of congress have been justly critical of the irreparable damage that has been done to his reputation no one should be subject to unfounded smears by government officials but unfortunately over the past several years a pattern has emerged in which members of congress have done just that members of congress have repeatedly made sensational public allegations against individual american citizens many of these initial allegations have received widespread coverage in the media further investigation however often has shown that the allegations are unsupported by the facts and when the facts eventually do emerge the news media inevitably gives little ittention to the truth and the public record is rarely corrected let me give you an example in june 1997 former representative gerald solomon the chairman of the house rules committee claimed he had evidence from a government source that john huang the former commerce department official and democratic national committee fundraiser had coinmitted economic espionage and breached our national security this allegation of espionage was very serious it amounted to a claim of treason the most serious accusation that can be brought against an american it was reported on national television and in newspapers across the country but it turns out that that allegation was based on nothing more than gossip at a reception when the fbi interviewed mr solomon about this allegation he told the fbi that he was told by a senate staffer at a capitol hill reception that the staffer received confirmation that a department of commerce employee had passed classified information to a foreign government according to the fbi interview notes the senate staffer did not say that the employee was john huang nor did he say that information went to china representative solomon did not know who the staffer was in a second interview with the fbi representative solomon recalled that what the staffer said to him was congressman you might like to know that you were right there was someone at commerce giving out information again in this interview representative solomon told the fbi that he did not know the name of the staffer who made this comment in fact the only way mr solomon could identify the staffer was to describe him as a male in his 30s or 40s approximately 5 feet 10 inches tall with brownish hair here is another example in june 1999 representative dan burton issued a press release accusing defense department officials including colonel raymond a willson of attempting to

other inmates they have higher incidents of alcohol and drug abuse by barents and guardians while they were children mentally ill offenders were more likely than other offenders to have been unemployed and homeless prior to their arrest and these offenders are more likely than other offenders to be involved in fights with other inmates and to be charged with breaking prison rules over the last year law enforcement and corrections officials prosecutors judges and mental health officials have called and written to the subcommittee on crime to urge the subcommittee to address the problem of mentally ill offenders in the criminal justice system in response the subcommittee on crime held a hearing on tb~s issue just last month at that hearing representatives of all these groups urged congress to develop a special program to address the needs of these offenders so that they will be incarcerated less often and so that they will be less likely to commit repeat crimes when they are released from custody the bill before the house today will help to do just that this bill introduced by senator dewine of my state of ohio in the other body is similar to a bill introduced in the house by the gentleman from ohio it authorizes the attorney general to make grants to states state courts local courts units of local government and indian tribal governments for up to 100 programs that involve specialized treatment for mentally ill offenders these programs inclhide continuing postconviction judicial supervision of nonviolent and misdemeanor offenders training for law enforcement and correction officials on how to appropriately handle mentally ill offenders in their custody and centralized case management of cases involving mentally ill or mentally retarded defendants i believe this is a good bill the testimony before the subcommittee from officials throughout the criminal justice system from both republicans and democrats was that by taking just a few minor steps the government can have a great impact on the treatment of these offenders simply incarcerating the mentally ill is not going to address the underlying cause of their behavior but if we deal with their illness they are less likely to commit future crimes and that is a result that benefits us all i urge all my colleagues to support this bill i reserve the balance of my time"],

came under heavy fire from a numerically superior enemy force the intense fire severely wounded several soldiers and repulsed repeated attempts by fellow soldiers to rescue their fallen comrades ignoring this and directions to stay behind shelter mr rascon repeatedly tried to crawl forward to assist the wounded soldiers but was driven back each time by the withering enemy fire despite the risks to his own safety and realizing that the point machinegunner was severely wounded and still under direct enemy fire he dashed through gunfire and exploding grenades to reach his comrade to protect him from wounds mr rascon intent tionally placed his body between the soldier and the enemy machine guns and in doing so sustained numerous shrapnel injuries and a serious hip wound from an enemy bullet despite his wounds he dragged him from the fireraked trail and then crawled back through the area of heaviest fire with ammunition for a machine gunner allowing the soldier to resume life protecting covering fire for the beleaguered squad as mr rascon crawled through the murderous fire to retrieve an abandoned machine gun and ammunition a grenade exploded directly in front of him severely wounding him in the face and torso although weakened by loss of blood and his painful wounds he recovered the machine gun and ammunition for another soldier who was then able to provide badly needed suppressive fire for the pinneddowned unit as mr rascon went forward to aid a badly wounded grenadier he saw grenades fall near the stricken soldier with complete disregard for his own life he dove on the wounded man and covered him with his body absorbing the full force of the grenade explosion but saving the soldiers life although he sustained additional fragmentation wounds to his face back and legs mr rascon continued to treat the wounded seeing grenades land near the wounded point squad leader and without regard for the consequences he again rose to his feet and dove on the wounded man again absorbing the blast of the grenades with his own body and suffering additional multiple fragmentation wounds after treating the wounded sergeant mr rascon remained on the battlefield providing medical aid to the wounded and inspiring his fellow soldiers to continue the battle after the enemy broke contact he treated and directed the evacuation of the wounded and only then allowed himself to be treated while making his way to the evacuation zone mr rascon collapsed from the result of his wounds and blood loss and was carried from the battlefield because of the selflessness and bravery he demonstrated that day mr rascons unit members submitted a recommendation for him to receive the medal of honor unfortunately the written recommendation never made it up the chain of command

every day we recognize the fact that congress cannot bind future congresses in terms of the action that they will take but if we pass this legislation today we are enabling future presidents to bind future congresses because if we pass this proposal and discover as we most assuredly will that it does not work the way we intended we will not be able to change it without the permission of the president of the united states that is not a position which any independent legislative body should be in secondly on 2year budgets there is a vast difference between multiyear planning and multiyear budgeting i favor longterm planning i favor 5 and 10year planning but when we go to a 2year budget we put the house at a huge disadvantage visavis the senate in the house we have germaneness rules so if we pass an interior supplemental through the place no one can attach an education item or an agricultural item to it we stick to the subject but in a world of 2year budgeting we will have constant supplementals when supplementals move through this body and move to the senate we will have individual senators free to add any item they want to any supplemental that moves through there that means a giant loss of control of spending and it means a giant transfer of powers and prerogatives to the senate most perniciously i believe it ruins our ability to keep agencies on a short leash the healthiest thing that occurs in this town is in the annual appropriation process when senior program managers discover that they are not ordained by god to follow policies of their own making they have to answer to the congress the problem is that if we put them on a 2year leash rather than a 1year leash it will be very difficult to get them to follow congressional intent in legislation that we pass people will say oh well dont worry about it as long as they need supplementals they will need the support of the congress but supplementals are different than regular appropriation bills

department of interior and those of us on the committee first my amendments added provisions regarding the headwaters nature of the black ridge lands to make clear the rationale for following the approach of the 1993 colorado wilderness act by including an express disclaimer of a federal reserved water right with respect to the wilderness area secohd the amendments added language to make clear that the bill will not affect any existing water rights including those of the united states third the amendments revised the boundary of the nca and the wilderness along the colorado river which made it possible to omit language that had been proposed regarding issues that some felt might arise had the boundary been closer to the river itself fourth my amendments added provisions to make clear that the boundary revision will not compromise the ability of the secretary to properly manage recreational or other uses of public lands adjacent to the river finally my amendments added a provision similar to that included in the 1993 colorado wilderness act to prohibit new water projects in the wilderness area designated by this bill these changes addressed most if not all the major concerns of the various colorado groups both the environmental groups and those representing other points of view regarding these aspects of the bill at the same time they left intact the basic balance of the

the bill before us provides a moratorium on access taxes on the internet for 5 years i think this is important to allow the development of this new technology that is truly in its infancy stage there is an amendment that has been offered that would limit this moratorium to 2 years i believe that is too temporary it is not long enough and therefore i will oppose that amendment the present amendment that is offered makes that permanent or for 99 years and i appreciate my colleague from ohio for raising this point in the debate and allowing us to have this discussion but i think everyone here in congress knows that a permanent ban is probably not in the dictionary when it comes to the actions of congress because we can change that down the road so i think it is somewhat of a meaningless gesture however i believe it is important because of the other issues surrounding this moratorium that we do reengage in this debate down the road one of the issues that are on the periphery of this moratorium is the states concern that this somehow impedes their collection of sales taxes on distance sales i know that my governor of arkansas has written a letter expressing the concern about this moratorium impacting the collection of sales taxes by the states when in fact as it has been pointed out this clearly would not prohibit the states from trying to develop a means to collect sales taxes on distance sales via the internet or catalogue sales i am sympathetic to that concern and i believe it is important that the committee on the judiciary engage in hearings to address this issue to continue the debate on that we need to continue to watch to see the impact on sales tax collections by our states that impact our schools and other services provided but i am also concerned about the brickandmortar businesses the main street businesses those that rely upon instore shopping they are obviously concerned about the internet having a competitive advantage those engaged in ecommerce i think we need to wait and see but the debate is very important and i hope that will continue in hearings in the committee on the judiciary and i know legislation will be introduced to clarify and reduce the obstacles that states face in collecting the sales taxes it is not an obstacle created by this moratorium but it is an obstacle created by the fact that there are no collection methods at present that the supreme court has not found creates an undue burden on interstate commerce so therefore i think we need to look at what we can do to help the states make sure that there is not a burden as well as the problem with the brickandmortar businesses as i mentioned the internet development clearly should be encouraged i believe that if there is a possibility that taxes would be imposed on access to the internet that that would be a hinderment i believe that we should support this moratorium for thtt reason in my district in arkansas where middle america is rural america i be lieve the internet explosion the opportunities for ecommerce the development of dotcoins represents the future of rural america even we see it in the silicon valley we see it on the east coast but in rural america we have in my district a dotcom which has developed that is employed i think we are going to see more of that and so i do not think we want to hamper it right now with the potential for new taxes on access to that great future that is really in its infancy now for that reason i oppose the amendment to make the moratorium permanent i support the underlying bill and i ask my colleagues to join in that effort"]]}
