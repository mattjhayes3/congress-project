regulation and rugged individualism we even heard talk of lebron james but one thing is really true we havent heard anyone on the other side of the aisle talk about hunger and even lebron james is not hungry so i want to talk about a really simple economic theory and its called hunger it means when you wake up in the morning and youre a young child in this country and your parents cant afford to feed you youre hungry the demand of hunger when youre going to school and you cant think through the school day because youre hungry its about going home on a weekend after receiving a school lunch on a friday but not eating through the entire weekend because youre hungry and really mr chair thats the only economic theory we need to discuss this afternoon so just before i came to the floor earlier in the day i had a physical i had to go 10 hours without eating i described myself as starving but clearly neither i nor any member of this house of representatives knows what its like to be really hungry today and so before i came to the floor i had my piece of chicken and you know what that was more than the republicans are prepared to give americas women infants and children and so i rise today in opposition to these extreme cuts to the women infant and children program and the underlying bill we know the program is essential to providing nutrition to our nations most vulnerable children now i dont need a study to know what it means to be hungry but studies show that women infant and children programs reap tremendous benefits to the participants they lead to fewer premature births fewer fetal and infant deaths and result in better cognitive and physical health for children thats the difference between eating a nutritious meal and being hungry i also rise today in support of my colleague lynn woolseys amendment to block the gops attempts to roll back our usda nutrition standards for our children because not only are some of our children hungry but we need to make sure that they are eating to a standard that allows them to learn in our classrooms the wic program is essential to ensuring our youngest americans receive the nutrition they need and the underlying amendments will ensure that children continue to receive nutritious foods throughout their school day now when i first came to congress i worked with our thenchairwoman and our friend rosa delauro to secure the afterschool supper program in my home state of maryland for hungry children we have fed millions of meals through this program and so i know that in my state and all across the country the women infant and children program served 140 000 women infants and children every month in the last year the program serves 9 2 million lowincome families across the country and as our nation continues to recover from a recession the benefits provided to these families are an essential safety net for our vulnerable populations and according to feeding america theres a 50 percent increase in need amongst families seniors and children right now this is a time when ensuring the economic security of the american people is critical and we cant stand by the republican pledge to cut essential safety net programs its no surprise to the american people that the republican conference selected yet another vulnerable group to slash while continuing to support big oil companies farm subsidies and huge tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires instead of supporting women infants and children in this 112th congress this new and bold republican majority began with an attack on women they proceeded to attack our seniors with a plan to eradicate medicare and now they are committed to an attack on our neediest and the health of our neediest infants and children its actually really shameful its even hard to talk about because its hard to believe in america that even those who sit on the other side of the aisle are willing to take away nutrition programs for needy women infants and children rather than take away the tax breaks for billionaires and take away the subsidies for oil companies while our gas prices rise i think that those on the other side of the aisle should be absolutely ashamed of themselves i know that some of my colleagues have quoted bible passages i dont know maybe quote the statue of liberty what is happening in this house is not american at

republicans break that promise rather than reducing costs through payment and delivery system reforms the republicans do nothing to contain costs and they simply shift the cost burden onto our seniors

consume i am pleased that the legislation before us today gives us a chance to begin to mitigate the worst effects of sequestration but it is not enough as my colleague has stated our nation canand shoulddare to once again dream big we are a nation that built one of the largest interstate highway systems in the world which is presently crumbling launched the internet pioneered the creation of gps and created the largest middle class on earth through a fair and balanced tax code that asked everyone including the wealthiest among us and the biggest corporations to pay their fair share we are home to public institutions like the national institutes of health which have helped to find the cures for countless diseases and conditions and saved millions of lives great achievements like these are only behind us if we so choose i strongly believe that we can rebuild our crumbling runways our roads and rails restore our middle class and invest in the breakthroughs that will once again make us the envy of the world but in order to do so we have to make responsible fiscal choices that are a reflection of our values that means restoring smart and targeted funding to programs and agencies that drive our country forward asking the most fortunate among us to pay their fair sharenot more than that but their fair shareand protecting the programs that serve hardworking americans at times when they need help the most to that end it is shameful that the legislation before us does not extend unemployment benefits for the 1 3 million americans who are scheduled to lose them within a matter of weeks3 days after christmas actually in the united states of america we believe in providing a hand up not a kick while you are down unemployment insurance is that hand up studies have shown that unemployment insurance allows jobseekers to purchase necessities such as groceries and gas without accruing further debt in so doing it helps to increase economic activity while easing the financial burden of unemployed americans and making it easier not harder for themas we areto find a new job that is why my democratic colleagues representative levin representative van hollen and representative barbara lee introduced an amendment in the rules committee last night to extend the unemployment insurance for an additional 3 months this bill was paid for i want to make that perfectly clear it would not have cost an extra dime inexcusably the majority rejected my colleagues amendment despite inserting language to fix medicare payments to doctors over the coming year which is certainly important fixing the medicare payments to doctors is a worthy and important goal but it is certainly troublingand should be to all of usthat we are unwilling at the same time to ignore the needs of the unemployed the majoritys refusal to extend a helping hand to jobless americans stands in stark contrast to the defense of tax loopholes for big corporations and powerful special interests for far too long our nation has allowed wealthy individuals and powerful corporations to hide billions of dollars in offshore bank accounts and create tax loopholes instead of paying their fair share indeed some corporations in america pay no taxes at all it is unfortunate that not a single one of the loopholes is addressed in the bill that is before us today to help us reduce the national debt despite these shortcomings todays legislation does take an important first step toward easing the painful budget cuts contained in sequestration it has been an unmitigated disaster that has hurt our economy and our country and there is an urgent need to avert the next round of budget cuts that are scheduled to take effect and i am grateful for that in a study conducted earlier this year by the association of american universities 81 percent of the respondents declared that sequestration cuts had immediate and detrimental effects on research activities seventy percent of the respondents cited delays in research projects and 58 percent of respondents stated that sequestration led to reductions in staff students and fellows through attrition and layoffs a recent study showed that sequestration and other budget cuts have resulted in an actual institutes of health budget far too low to support our biomedical research community in addition to that point let me say that during the government shutdown which cost the economy 24 billion and was useless of the five nobel laureates employed by the united states of america only one was declared essential four nobel laureates were said to be nonessential that blows the mind doesnt it these types of drastic budget cuts have profound impacts on our country reduced funding means that new discoveries and breakthroughs are delayedor never realizedand that our public health knowledge is stunted for years to come as a microbiologist i can tell you that you cannot simply turn research off and on like a faucet but that is exactly what we do when we arbitrarily slash the budgets with no regard for the consequences of our cuts that is why todays legislation is an important step forward for our country we must end the selfinflicted wound that is sequestration and get back to investing in our own wellbeing and the future of america by restoring funding across our government we will help to jumpstart our economy and get back to work on the cuttingedge research and on infrastructure that will benefit the nation in years to come in closing todays bill is an important step forward but our work is not done until we add an extension of unemployment insurance to this legislative package we will give you an opportunity to do that at the end of the rule in so doing we can ensure a brighter more

together in recognition of our shared values from world war ii to 9 11 to hurricane katrina americans came together when needed thats why its so sad to see house republicans draft a budget reconciliation bill that carries dangerous implications for millions of americans and will fundamentally erode our shared values of course this is nothing more than political theater because authorization for budget reconciliation has to pass both the house and senate which it hasnt but that hasnt stopped the house republican majority from trying to deem it to be so therefore the republican majority has directed six house committees to use this reconciliation ruse to find drastic and damaging investment cuts not to reduce the deficit mind you but to prevent any cut in military spending which they originally agreed to and to give the richest 1 percent yet another big tax cut last year congress agreed in a bipartisan fashion after the majority brought us to the brink of default to cut 2 1 trillion from federal deficits establishing automatic cuts designed to be universally painful to encourage us to reach an agreement on a longterm deficit reduction proposal that more equitably spreads the burden a bipartisan majority of the supercommittee including every senate republican did come up with just such a plan to put everything on the tablespending cuts revenue increases entitlement reformbut it needed a supermajority and sadly every republican house member on that committee voted no which leaves us where we are today facing damaging automatic cuts to defense and nondefense spending but republican reconciliation ruses wont stop the automatic cuts to the nations seniors and disadvantaged it doubles down on the pain the republican reconciliation ruse literally takes food out of the mouths of needy children and senior citizens it eliminates social services block grants providing assistance to states and localities across the nation to serve millions of disadvantaged americans it ends the meals on wheels program for 1 7 million seniors it guts the supplemental nutrition assistance program formerly known as food stamps that serves 46 million of our fellow americans every month under their plan 1 8 million people would lose the most basic of assistance in addition 300 000 lowincome children lose their free and reduced lunches at school this reconciliation ruse once again singles out federal employees for ever more sacrifices federal workers already have contributed 60 billion to deficit reduction through a 2year pay freeze theyve contributed another 15 billion through recent changes to their retirement system the ryan budget demands an additional 3year pay freeze the new proposal goes further and cuts paychecks by 5 percent to shift more of the burden to employees this draconian measure would add another 79 8 billion in the sacrifice put on the backs of federal workers more than double the 75 billion theyve already made the reconciliation ruse actually will increase health care costs for millions of american families it eliminates tax credits that help lowerincome families maintain affordable health insurance premiums in fact 350 000 people will actually lose their health insurance with their plan of course the one glaring omission in the republican reconciliation ruse is not surprisingly revenue while millions of lower and middleincome families are being forced to sacrifice what do republicans ask of the wealthiest 1 percent nothing over the last 4 years oil and gas companies made a profit of 290 billion private companies should make profits and its a good thing but in that same time frame they lobbied to keep their 16 billion in tax breaks representing less than 6 percent of their profits but it sure would make sure a lot of hungry kids go to bed with full bellies at night the ryan budget actually seeks to cut the top income tax bracket from 35 percent to 25 percent who pays the current top tax bracket those making more than 388 000 each year not only are they not asked to join in any of the shared sacrifice but theyre actually offered a new christmas present early just for them its time to call the republican budget plan what it is an outright attack on american values how else do you explain shifting the burden from partisan priorities entirely to the middle class and

and live out their american dream encouragingly president obama understands that we cannot speed up economic recovery without investments that create jobs i was pleased to see in his 2013 budget proposal critical investments to create good jobs and job training programs for communities hardest hit by our struggling economy by targeting economic assistance where its most needed the presidents proposed budget goes a long way to level the playing field to give every american the opportunity to succeed theres a lot that my republican colleagues can learn from the presidents budget especially this that fighting poverty and reducing the deficit can be achieved together but let me be clear this budget is not perfect there are cuts in this budget that would undermine some of the progress our economy is making cuts to safety net programs like the community services block grant low income heating assistance and affordable housing programs will hit already struggling families especially hard during these difficult times we really do need to protect programs that are a lifeline for the most vulnerable we need to increase funding for programs like snap and wic which keep millions of

right thing to do if we are ever going to reduce the staggering deficit we are going to have to make some hard decisions so that is what this is all about but that is the point it is hard to do

two sides to reach a balanced deal it hasnt happened yet as i said earlier with general eisenhowers statement i didnt make that up that is what he said my complaint about the republicans being so unreasonable about everything is something where i am not a lone wolf crying in the wilderness we have two longtime nonpartisan watchers of congress one from the american enterprise institute which is a conservative think tank another from brookings institute that wrote an article saying it is the republicans cant you see what they are doing here is one thing they said we have been studying washington politics in congress for more than 40 years and never have we seen them this dysfunctional in our past writings we have criticized both parties when we believed it was warranted today however we have no choice but to acknowledge that the core of the problem lies with the republican party they further said the gop has become an insurgent outlier in american politics it is ideologically extreme of scornful compromise unmoved by conventional understanding of facts evidence and science and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition what brave men to do that to write these commentswhich are true i have been saying that i dont want to fight about everything republicans insist on balancing the budget on the backs of the middle class seniors students single mothers and those who could least afford it that is what they are doing over there today it is their refusal to compromise that leaves us facing the threat of sequester and it is difficult but it is balanced going back to the august budget agreement now in order to protect wealthy special interests is no solution neither is refighting the battles of last year democrats agree we must reduce our deficits and make hard choices but we believe in a balanced approach that shares the pain as well as the responsibility is the sequester the best way to achieve that balance no but republicans refuse to consider a more reasonable approachone for example that asks every american to pay his fair share while making difficult choices to reduce spending democrats will not agree to a onesided solution that lets the superwealthy off the hook while forcing the middle class and those in greatest need to bear all the hardship democrats believe we can protect americans access to health care create jobs while investing in the future and protect the poor and elderly but we cant do it alone it will take work and compromise and so far republicans have been unwilling to make a serious effort to achieve that result republicans have rejected our balanced approach their onesided solution to acrosstheboard cuts would take away from the many to give to the few here is what the plan would donot all of it

it would punish americans who receive tax credits to purchase health insurance when their financial circumstances change causing 350 000 americans to have no coverage this would add to the tens of millions who already exist that way it would weaken wall street reforms protecting big banks at the expense of consumers their legislation would once again target middleclass workers food inspectors

particular small business while much has been made about the debates surrounding tax rates there is i think a larger picture that we need to consider we should focus on employment and jobs instead of trying to necessarily aim for fairness just by using this weapon against small business we should focus i think on job creation we understand that if the presidents bill passes we will lose 700 000 jobs that means 700 000 americans and their families would then qualify i presume for unemployment and it would mean that we begin the new year once again on a negative pathway thats why we are here today talking and trying to have our leaders of this great nation make sure that we avoid this this country is in desperate need of an economic kickstart lower taxes we believe through stimulating job creation and job investment and by stimulating the economy will allow all americans not only to keep their jobs but also to keep more of their own hardearned pay in fact president john f kennedy i think agreed with us when he said it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to increase revenues in the long run is to cut rates now thats exactly where we are republicans are arguing not to increase taxes at a time when the american economy is struggling when families are struggling lets not ask them to go into their pockets and pay more to a government that simply wants to spend more of this money my republican colleagues and i remain committed to staying in washington d c to try and get this done between now and then what this rule is all about is saying that were going to put us to work on solving some of the ideas and issues that remain in the workplace where there are answers with suspension votes so thats why were here

into the health care bill knowing that we cant do without it then the administration looked carefully at the cost factors and it did the right thing it informed the congress that it was suspending implementation of the class act it certainly did not repeal it or ask for its repeal nor should we here is why the medicare crisis before us as i speak is dwarfed by the longterm care crisis we know it because that crisis the class crisis if you will is already here that crisis my friends is longterm care who pays for it we pay for it we the taxpayers because medicaid pays for it theyre coming at an increasing clip because the fact is that the number of americans who are living longer who dont have the resources themselves grows exponentially government is now paying 100 percent lets look at the class act that is a 100 percent privately financed plan it means that we should all not wait for longterm care to be needed when we would have to ask the government through medicaid to pay for nursing home care we should begin now to take care of our own longterm needs what are you going to do if we dont have the class actpass off the elderly who are in the nursing homes to where to whom clearly the class act is the only solution unless you want the federal government to continue to pick up the loss for those who need longterm care and that is what people in nursing homes are there

doing none of that we are not encouraging people to do what the class act would encourage them to do instead we are saying repeal this private sector solution that makes no sense because when the crisis comes the elderly are going to come to us they are going to say they have no longterm care they want what the last generation had you spend down your resources and then medicaid picks it up thats the solution on the table now if you want a private solution this is golden it is in law we should grab it keep it have hearings on it how can we make it feasible thank the administration for deciding not to implement it they had an alternative they could have allowed it to lie dormant gone on with the rest of the health care bill instead they told the truth now we are here trying to

to thank the gentleman from new york for his leadership on the other side of the aisle last week congress took a rare break from our work here and from partisanship we came together to remember those who died on 9 11 and during the war on terrorism we stood together on the capitol steps and we pledged that we would never forget the heartbreaking events of that fateful day one of the ways we can honor the memory of those who lost their lives is to be prepared so that our country will never again experience such a tragedy thats why im standing before you today thanking you and the members of the body for putting partisanship aside and for working together to keep our families and our communities safe from new and emerging threats to our nation we are all aware of the iranian nuclear threat in the middle east and globally but there is another potential threat from iran and its proxies that is closer to home that threat is an emerging iranianbacked terror network here in the western hemisphere what we already know is very alarming we know about last octobers foiled iranian plot to assassinate the saudi arabian ambassador to the unitedstates here on american soil we know that iran has vastly expanded its diplomatic and economic footprint in latin america for example we know about the department of defenses 2012 annual report on iran that stated during the past three decades iran has methodically cultivated a network of sponsored terrorist surrogates capable of targeting unitedstates and israeli interests just this month the brazilian journal veja and others reported on a police seizure in bolivia of 2 tons of minerals believed initially to contain uranium but more likely tantalum which is the mineral that is in demand for among other things nuclear reactors and missile parts we know that 2 weeks ago an israeli news organization revealed that iran has established a hezbollah terrorist training base in northern nicaragua with operatives being trained at the base to attack israeli and unitedstates targets in the event of a raid on iranian nuclear installations and we know that just last week press reports revealed that three suspected hezbollah members were arrested just south of our border in mexico none of this should come as a surprise iran has publicly stated that increasing their presence and ties to latin america is one of their top foreign policy objectives however we must have the capabilities to defend ourselves from potential iranian attacks here on the homeland we must be able to clearly identify this emerging threat and develop strategies which include working with our neighbors here in this hemisphere to prevent iran from being a danger to our country here at home thats why this bill h r 3783 establishes a strong unitedstates posture policy and relationship with latin american countries it protects unitedstates interests and assets in the western hemisphere such as embassies consulates energy pipelines and cultural organizations including threats to unitedstates allies it addresses the vital national security interests of the united states by ensuring that energy supplies from the western hemisphere are free from the influence of any foreign government that would attempt to manipulate or disrupt global energy markets this bill requires a secure unitedstates border with the unitedstates working in coordination with the governments of mexico and canada to prevent iranian operatives from entering the united states this bill counters the efforts by foreign persons entities and governments in the region which may assist iran in evading unitedstates and international sanctions mr speaker and madam chairwoman i urge that members of this body come together and vote for this very important issue h r 3783 last week marked the 11 th anniversary of al qaedas attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon al qaeda responsible for the tragic deaths of nearly 3 000 people on 9 11 has long operated with extensive ties to the government of iran the 9 11 commission documented that al qaeda operatives traveled to iran to receive training in explosives in the 1990s that iran facilitated the transit of al qaeda members into and out of afghanistan before 9 11 and that some of these were future 9 11 hijackers this past february the treasury department designated the iranian ministry of intelligence and security for its support of terrorist groups including al qaeda today the iranian regime continues pursuing nuclear weapons against unitedstates and international sanctions it warns of striking unitedstates military bases with its ballistic missiles in the event of an attack on iran it bullies the global energy market with its threats to block the strait of hormuz last octobers foiled iranian plot to assassinate the saudi ambassador to the unitedstates revealed as dni director clapper stated a change in calculus and a willingness to conduct an attack in the united states this year alone a string of assassination attempts by iran and hezbollah in azerbaijan bulgaria thailand georgia and kenya have only intensified this drumbeat add to these dangers a growing iranian presence in the western hemisphere and we have a serious security threat that demands a unitedstates response since 2005 iran has increased its embassies from 6 to 11 and built 17 cultural centers in latin america irans diplomacy has led to soaring trade with latin american countries brazil increased its exports to iran sevenfold over the past decade to an annual level of 2 12 billion iranian trade with argentina and ecuador has grown and economic contracts between iran and venezuela have exploded to more than 20 billion in trade and cooperation agreements iran has also boosted its military ties with latin america the defense department assesses with high confidence that during the past three decades iran has methodically cultivated a network of sponsored terrorist surrogates capable of targeting unitedstates and israeli interests the unitedstates army war colleges strategic studies institute has labeled this threat tied to the explosion of relationships between transnational crime and criminalized states in latin america an emerging tierone national security priority two weeks ago an israeli news organization published a story that iran has established a hizbullah terrorist training base in northern nicaragua with operatives being trained at the base to attack israeli and unitedstates targets in the event of a raid on iranian nuclear installations last week press reports revealed that three suspected hezbollah members were arrested in mexico none of this should come as any surprise to us iran has publicly stated that the promotion of allout cooperation with latin american countries is among the top priorities of the islamic republics foreign policy a 2009 dossier by israels ministry of foreign affairs put it bluntly since ahmadinejads rise to power tehran has been promoting an aggressive policy aimed at bolstering its ties with latin american countries with the declared goal of bringing america to its knees the unitedstates must have the capabilities to defend itself from a potential iranian attack on the homeland we must have a strong posture in our region and deepening relationships with our neighbors so we can protect unitedstates interests and keep the western hemisphere free from hostile agents of foreign influence we must have secure borders to prevent iranian operatives from entering the unitedstates it is unconscionable that we should let iran use latin american countries as a base to prepare for potential attacks against the unitedstates homeland iran poses an incalculable risk to the safety of the

is now we can pretend that there arent major policy changes being made under this agricultural appropriations bill but there are there are deep cuts in the conservation title we just had a large consortium a coalition of outdoor sporting groups write a letter expressing their concern about the deep cuts in the voluntary and incentivebased land and water conservation programs and the impact that is going to have on quality water and habitat protection or the ability of our farmers to be good stewards of their land there is a huge demand for these programs which will be dramatically affected with the deep spending reductions that are contained in this appropriation bill the same goes for the nutrition programs the huge funding reductions will have an impact on tens of thousands of families throughout the nation lowincome children that rely on these programs the women infants and children program in particular seniors on these nutrition programs they are going to feel the effects of the decisions that we are making in this agriculture appropriation bill now for so many of my colleagues to stand up this evening and claim we cant mess with title i program funding we should wait for the next farm bill i think is disingenuous at best i ask my colleagues tonight mohair subsidies is that the best we are going to be able to do and i would submit to my colleagues that the reason why mohair was picked on is because they are not a particularly wellorganized sophisticated politicallyconnected entity out there so it was easy to go after them as my colleague from utah showed with his amendment but we have known for a long time now that these subsidy programs under title i do distort the marketplace they do distort our trade policy as my brazil cotton subsidy amendment highlighted a little earlier this evening and we are long past time to start making these revisions in light of the huge budget deficits that we are facing 2320 when 80 percent of the producers in our nation get nothing under title i subsidiesnot a dimethat leaves a very small group of entities that is receiving the bulk of these taxpayer subsidies and we all know who they are theyre the big five grainproducing entities of this countrycorn soybeans cotton rice and wheat theyre the ones who are receiving the bulk of these title i subsidy programs under the farm bill there are multiple programs which they can be eligible for from the ldp program to countercyclical to the new acre program under the last farm bill to the direct payment program many of us were arguing in the last farm bill whether it was necessary to go forward with direct payments that bear no relationship to current market pricesall based on past production history today we are facing world record commodity prices in these categories not only did we continue them but we increased the direct payments and were allowing double entities on the same fund to qualify for the direct payments yet none of that is being discussed in the context of this agriculture appropriations bill as to my original point im not sure if 125 is the right level but the concept isnt new and its definitely a step in the right direction i think its trying to bring more sanity to the title i subsidy programs which we shouldnt be delaying until the next farm bill which may or may not happen next year we know its tough to get major pieces of legislation through during an election year let alone a presidential election year it could be years from now before we have the next farm bill ready to go with any potential change so i commend my colleague for offering this amendment and for continuing the discussion and i encourage my colleagues to seriously consider supporting it im sure the senate will have
