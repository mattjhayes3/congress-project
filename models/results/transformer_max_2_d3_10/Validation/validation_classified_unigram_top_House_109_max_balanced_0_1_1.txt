friends from the great state of massachusetts mr bill delahunt i am so glad mr delahunt is here we were talking earlier i had to chuckle there for a minute because mr delahunt always takes the opportunity and the privilege to share with us the printed word and it is good to have him here mr ryan will be joining us a little later if i could just take a moment here to let the members know that the great debate took place here on this floor a number of amendments were proposed to make sure that we pass a budget that is just and fair for every american but i must bring to the members attention because i think members do not realize what is happening or if they do realize what is happening i want to make sure that it is in the record that they know we talk about debt a lot in our 30 something working group and talking about debt and doing something about debt are two different things the republican majority continues to spend in a recordbreaking way that is bankrupting this country and changing the philosophy of this country which is payasyougo democrats we are the only party in this house that can say that we balanced the budget we have actually done it we have actually had surpluses as far as the eye can see republicans can only talk about well we would like to cut it in half and we would like to cut it back a quarter or what have you but i just want to make sure that folks understand that there was an article written on tuesday of this week entitled another possible bump to the debt ceiling 2 7 trillion budget plan pending before the house would raise the federal debt ceiling by nearly 10 trillion less than 2 months after the congress last raised the federal debt borrowing limit the provision is buried on page 121 of a 151page blueprint it serves as the backdrop for congressional action this week i think it is important and i usually have my letters here from the secretary of the treasury but i think it is important that the american people and the members of this house understand that what they are doing to this country recordbreaking debt i just want to make sure before we start off and then i am going to be kind of quiet here tonight because i know that we have a lot to share it is almost too much to share but i just want to share this with the members one more time we are talking about who are we borrowing from we are borrowing from japan at 682 8 billion china 249 8 billion the uk 223 2 billion the caribbean 115 3 billion taiwan 71 3 billion opec nations including saudi arabia and a number of nations that we have issues with 67 8 billion germany 65 7 billion korea 66 5 billion canada 53 8 billion and climbing if we do not stop this republican majority from continuing to raise this debt ceiling and burying it within the federal budget on what they believe their members have to vote for and this budget vote has been postponed and postponed and postponed not because the republican majority did not have time to deal with it they just did not want to do to their constituents what the majority wants them to do as long as we are here and we have breath in our bodies we are going to share with the members of this house that we will not allow this to be a back room with the lights off in the middle of the night proposition for the american people that they do not have any choices in but the special interests do i just in closing again history making this is not the kendrick meek report debbie wasserman schultz bill delahunt or tim ryan report this is facts not fiction the unitedstates department of the treasury backs this up 1 01 trillion borrowed in 224 years since 1776 to the year 2000 versus 1 05 trillion that was borrowed from 2001 to 2005 and counting from the president and the republican

and we are going to begin to fund the incredible needs that will arise and have arisen from this disaster it is the beginning of a long process and it is probably only a down payment but some say that we cannot as the house of representatives or the legislative branch examine the causes of the miserable response that caused unnecessary loss of life while recovery efforts are still ongoing some say that we cannot question the work done by the administration and the appointees in place who failed to act adequately they say that would be unseemly but during world war ii harry truman in a democraticcontrolled legislature chaired a special committee investigating the procurement scandals of a democratic administration in the greatest crisis of our history world war h we can do both we can provide aid and assistance and we can get at the root causes of unnecessary loss of life and unnecessary disaster we can do that there are a number of lessons to be learned we need to be able to respond better today or tomorrow hurricane season is not over yet we might have another another might follow tragically that same path that might be an incredible disaster and we are going to have the

communications that were identified as a principal problem on 9 11 the bush administration zeroed them out in this years budget and the congress has not yet seen fit to restore that money i hope they will do that in one of these emergency spending bills then there are the cuts at fema the aggregate budgetfor fema during the term of the bush administration the federal emergency management agency has been reduced we are not quite sure how much yet because we do not have the final numbers on this bill i guess with this disaster assistance that will not be the case but in terms of their preparedness and mitigation it has been reduced the corps of engineers has hundreds of critical infrastructure problems including the levee around new orleans underfunded and unfunded i had a dam in my district that was failing a flood control dam with the largest cities in the state downstream and the corps of engineers simply said we do not have the money finally they scrambled around and they found the money but unfortunately they were not able to do that in new orleans for the corps budget had been dramatically reduced in fact the corps own people predicted that this could happen because of the underfunding of the ongoing maintenance and the needed improvements in the diking system there but alls well deputy press secretary trent duffy said things are on track to privatize social security because we are going to borrow so much money for the disaster we are going to need to privatize social security what the bush plan for privatization of social security requires borrowing more money that is absurd then he says oh and the tax cuts are all on track too the tax cuts for the wealthiest among us are on track in face of a war and a disaster why because trickledown will help the

when millions of children do not have access to early childhood programs cutting child care is wrong let us go back over these areas medicaid the house bill would allow states to charge lowincome working families substantial new premiums and copayments in order for their children to participate in the medicaid program access health care services or obtain prescription drugs while the house bill would permit states to impose costly new fees on nearly all medicaid beneficiaries those most likely to face significantly higher premiums and copayments are the 6 million children who receive

just above the pov erty line are working families struggling to get by let us turn to child support and faster care cbo projects that the cuts in federal child support enforcement funding will mean that an additional 24 billion in child support will go uncollected in this congress we have been so proud in the past that we have finally been able to create a system in this country so that deadbeat dads will be forced to pay the child support that the courts have ordered them to pay now in this republican budget they have decided that they are going to reduce dramatically the support for child support funding in addition the house ldget reconciliation bill would reduce federal supports for children in foster care and for grandparents and other relatives who are taking care of these children

of fema in terms of what is happening in the middle east and here lately in terms of those who were asleep at the switch when the deal was cut in terms of the port security all show a considerable lack of judgment and a lack of responsibility to the american people that has been a characteristic within this administration especially in the area dealing with one of the most precious responsibilities we have which is determining and being responsible for how we spend the taxpayers money for this administration in the last 5 years to have squandered a surplus the facts are there they are plain as one can see when the clinton administration left office there was a surplus of billions and billions of dollars and now in this last year the deficit has been shot up over 4 trillion there is a reckoning for that and i am here to tell you that as a member of congress the american people are looking for members of congress to stand up for them and to do what it is we need to do

terrorists or a country where two of the terrorists came from that attacked this country that is sort of like after the bombing of pearl harbor turning over the security of pearl harbor to the japanese the only reason i am mentioning that is to show that the same mindset that allowed this to happen for our ports the same mindset that allowed the fema to happen to have those trailers setting

called the distinguished alumni she and i join others who are blessed to have had our portraits hanging in the law school each year about this time we cohosted a reception for the newly elected students from the washington d c area to the emory law school that reception is coming up soon but most importantly tillie was a friend to me and that friendship was because of my friendship with her father and her brother just a couple of weeks ago when i was in atlanta i ran into her brother and i inquired about tillie and he told me she was doing fine little did we know that we would be coming here tonight to say these wonderful things about tillie because she had gone all the world is a stage and all the men and women are players tillie served in so many capacities she was wife to buck and mother to tillie and elizabeth but through all of that she touched our lives in so many ways we are sad and only one who has worn the garment of bereavement can truly understand the pain that comes when one has been taken from the midst yet as we reflect prayerfully our pain must turn into joy because truly all of us have been blessed to know love and to have shared this life with such a wonderful woman as tillie kidd fowler"], [0.9856898719444871, 0.014310128055512905, 1, "i rise in support of the legislation before us tonight the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc is dangerously underfunded current pension law is antiquated and this congress must do all it can to shore up americas private pension system the bill addresses the concerns of both workers and employers and makes necessary changes to shore up the federal pension system among the welcomed reforms are greater transparency and accountability in the pbgc the special consideration given to airlines and the overall tightening of rules so that companies will meet their financial obligations to their employees and retirees as a cochair of the new democrat coalition i believe it is important to reform pensions so that promises to workers are kept taxpayers are not left footing the bill and companies can continue to be good actors and offer pension plans in addition any discussion of pension reform must include an increased emphasis on personal responsibility americans are not saving enough for retirement in fact the national savings rate is at its lowest level since the 1930s declining from 9 4 percent in 1970 to just 1 percent in 2004 in response to these weak savings rates we need to create new simpler incentives for middleclass americans to save fewer than 40 percent of unitedstates workers have calculated how much they will need to retire 30 percent have not saved anything for retirement and only 20 percent feel very confident about having enough money to live comfortably in retirement therefore i am pleased by provisions in this bill making the savers credit permanent and encouraging automatic enrollment in 401 ks this legislation makes the necessary reforms to strengthen the federal pension system to the benefit of workers retirees and taxpayers alike"]], "top_unsure": [[0.00011453032493591309, 0.4998854696750641, 1, "our nations families face a growing threat from the proliferation of child ekploitation and pornography on the internet one in five children report having been sexually solicited on the internet 3 5 million pornographic images of children of american children are now estimated to be in circulation on the internet this is a rapidly growing problem and one which has already grown far beyond what most americans are aware of last year alone child pornography brought traffickers 20 billion in profits as compared to only 3 billion for legitimate internet music sales the energy and commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations on which i sit as the ranking member recently held hearings to highlight this growing threat during the course of these hearings members of the subcommittee had a chance to hear about the excellent work the immigration and customs enforcement cyber crime center is doing to combat child exploitation since the center was founded in 2003 less than 3 years ago its work has resulted in arrests of over 7 500 child predators the cyber crimes center was funded at only 6 million last year but has already been recognized as being at the forefront in fighting in the fight against child exploitation and internet crime my amendment would add 5 billion to the immigration and customs enforcement salaries and expenses which would be used by the cyber crimes center to expand their operations the 5 million would be offset by reduction in the office of the secretary which is funded over 95 million in the base bill i believe that this 5 million amendment is the least we can do in the fight against a 20 billion criminal industry that preys on our children this is a chance to reward and expand the excellent law enforcement work being done at ice and to take steps to combat the increasing threat to our children and families if you look at the committee report it indicates and i quote from the committee report in support of this legislation here today this year the committee notes gaps in funding for drug interdiction human smuggling cyber crimes child pornography secret service investigations and funding for our first responders the committee recommendation includes 5 million the same as fiscal year 2006 for memory and technology support for the cyber crimes center we are doing what the committee is asking us to do who are the victims of child pornography eighty percent of these predators have material depicting children under the age of 12 40 percent under the age of 6 and 20 percent are victims under the age of 3 victims are 28 times more likely to become prostitutes 86 percent of the victims develop serious longterm mental illness we are working on this amendment here tonight and we are taking it from the secretarys budget and i am sure that the chairman will once again say we are going to take this secretary away and have nothing left well there is 95 million we want 5 million because this is a growing problem it has been by leaps and bounds in fact we are doing more hearings as soon as we get back first part of june we have had hearings in which 15 000 names addresses credit cards internet provider addresses were turned over to the department of justice and nothing is done because the resources are not there to follow through so reality is that internet child pornography and exploitation is growing more rampant more horrific and more sophisticated the cyber crimes unit employees know all too well how daunting their job is we owe it to these dedicated men and women to give them all the resources we can this additional 5 million will make a meaningful difference the appropriations bill while an increase over the presidents request essentially has flat funded this program i thank the committee for their tontinued commitment and i know we have to make some tough decisions but this is one we should do for americas children and to stop this horrific crime of child exploitation and pornography over the internet"],
