chairing the cbc health braintrust and all the work she does related to health disparities in this country i thank all of my colleagues for their tireless work before i begin my remarks let me just say that i sat on the floor a moment ago and listened to congresswoman corrine brown it was an incredible 1minute speech she gave i want to share in her sentiments this evening and align myself with the pain that she and her constituents are facing in orlando the mass shootings were absolutely horrific and unthinkable under any definition they are just unthinkable my prayers go out to the families in orlando for their pain and for all that they are having to endure because of these mass shootings as someone said a few moments ago a moment of silence is not enough it is time for this congress to act it is time for this body to have a serious debate about gun violence and to pass legislation that will deprive people the right to own a highcapacity assault weapon and highcaliber bullets and use them to kill innocent people now is the time 136 mass shootings have taken place during the first 164 days of this year it is a sad statistic that we must address the united states is 5 percent of the worlds population yet we are 31 percent of the mass shootings in the world it is time to act let me talk about the topic tonight very briefly the congressional black caucus has been committed to advancing access to affordable health care for all americans so that we can eliminate racially based health disparities that has been our mission for many years eliminating health disparities means addressing inequities in environmental social and economic conditions in all of our communities by all measurable statistics from health outcomes to participation in health professions african americans lag so far behind for example more than 40 percent of african americans have high blood pressurea rate that is one of the highest in the world african americans are more likely to develop hypertension at a younger age and are at higher risk of stroke heart failure endstage renal disease and death from heart disease stroke is the third leading cause of death in the united states african americans are 50 percent more likely to experience a stroke than white americans that is a fact according to the federal centers for disease control and prevention african american children are twice as likely to have asthma as white children and black children are 10 times more likely than white children to die of complications from asthma african americans were on average 6 years younger than whites when they suffered sudden cardiac arrest cardiac arrest incidence among african american men was 175 per 100 000 whereas the incidence for white males was just 84 per 100 000 cardiac arrest in african american women was 90 per 100 000 as opposed to 40 per 100 000 for caucasian women another illness which disparately impacts the african american community is that of prostate cancer in june of last year i introduced the national prostate cancer plan act a bipartisan bill which seeks to establish the national prostate cancer council on screening early detection and assessment and monitoring of prostate cancer prostate cancer impacts one in seven american men and is the second leading cause of cancerrelated deaths among men in the unitedstates with nearly 30 000 deaths anticipated just this year african american men are particularly vulnerable as they are twice as likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer and 2 5 times more likely to die from the disease than their white counterparts just last week house republicans released their a better way agenda to address poverty but that proposal like others they have released will not lift americans out of poverty in some cases these types of proposals can actually push lowincome americans even deeper into poverty further limiting their access to health care and exacerbating health disparities so it is time for us to continue our efforts to address the health disparities and barriers that is what the congressional black caucus is advocating the evening we are going to continue

for joining me in leading the cbc special orders this year i am truly honored to take on this new role and i look forward to working with her as we help carry out the critical mission of this caucus 50 years ago in the midst of the civil rights movement hundreds of brave men and women gathered in selma alabama to begin a long arduous march to montgomery in support of the fundamental truth that every american regardless of what they look like has the right to vote on march 7 1965 600 men and women set out from selma following the death of 26yearold jimmie lee jackson a deacon from marion alabama who died from gunshot wounds inflicted by a state trooper at a nonviolent demonstration theirs was a peaceful nonviolent march but it was met with fierce brutality it would take the marchers two more attempts to arrive at montgomery but on march 25 after a 12day journey they did arrive since that day our country has made significant strides in achieving equality and justice for all but significant challenges remain unmet tonight we will examine where we have come from where we are and where we would like to go as a society we must be ready to go in 1965 selma became the focal point of voter registration efforts in the south at the time only 2 percent of the citys eligible african american voters had been able to register the impact of selma to the montgomery march was profound as dr king said selma produced the voting rights legislation of 1965 the voting rights act of 1965 banned discriminatory voting requirements that disenfranchised african american voters throughout this country yet today the dream of full equality is still something many african americans can only dream of where we are nearly 6 years after the end of the recession people still struggle to find work and the gap between the rich and poor continues to grow for african americans this situation is severe given the disproportionate effect of unemployment on our communities at the same time there remains widespread poverty a defining challenge of our time this persistent economic inequality threatens to undercut the gains that african american communities have made and it undermines the idea of economic mobility the idea that if you work hard in this country and have ambition you can get ahead the economic crisis is not only facing african american communities where we are in education education is the most important economic investment we can make now and for future generations yet across the country we still have seen cuts to education at all levels and attacks on critical programs like head start and pell grants these attacks undermine the ability of african americans to get aheadthat is why i strongly support president obamas new bold initiative for free access to community collegesso too do efforts to dismantle social safety net programs which our communities depend on those efforts are irresponsible unjust and contrary to who we are as americans the congressional black caucus will make criminal justice reform a centerpiece of our agenda we will work to reduce the epidemic of poverty in this country we will work to create educational opportunities for african american children and we will support efforts to strengthen our 105 historically black colleges and universities the cbc also remains committed to fighting against efforts to dismantle the social safety net we are determined to restore section 5 of the voting rights act and to make sure everyone regardless of what they look like or where they come from has equal access to the polls and

thompson brought to the floor just last week that resolution called for the immediate removal of the confederate battle flag from the capitol grounds and my colleagues across the aisle moved quickly to banish that resolution to die in committee earlier today the original home of the confederacy argued but agreed that the confederate flag and the history it represents belong in a museum they decided that the flag should not serve as a bright waving reminder of the discrimination and disparity of treatment for people of color that still lingers in communities across our countryhateful sentiments that resulted in the loss of nine lives at emanuel ame church in charleston they decided that that flag should not hang high above the halls of state government forcing all those who see it to wonder whether the emotions and ideology so closely tied to it are present in the hearts and minds of those who serve in that statehouse they decided that the flag had flown long enough and that taking it down would be one small but critical step in healing the deep divisions present in their state they stood against the symbol of bigotry they stood against years of complacency and they stood for the principles of equality justice and unity for this nation they will take that flag down tomorrow but republican leadership in this body refuses to do that they took the path of cowardice and turned a blind eye to the struggles of generations of americans they used backhanded tactics last night to muddle the language of the interior and environment appropriations bill including language intended to satisfy members who would rather see that flag fly the fallout from that language led to the disappearance of that bill from todays scheduled debate and resulted in the chairman of that subcommittee disowning the final product leader pelosis resolution offered another opportunity for my colleagues across the aisle to stand on the right side of history but they turned that chance down resoundingly lets not mince words while i stand with my brothers and sisters of the south the confederacy itself fell far below even common decency for fellow man violating human rights and taking advantage of every part of the lives of the men and women they enslaved sometimes for profit and sometimes purely for pleasure the confederacy used extreme violence and terrorism to subjugate millions purely on the basis of the color of their skin and started the deadliest war ever to take place on unitedstates soil to defend a disgraceful system that flag is a symbol of the confederacys effort to keep that system intact that is why before the holiday i stood in this very spot on the floor to denounce the hate bigotry malice discrimination and division that the confederate flag stands for but i also reminded my colleagues that a symbol while significant is only a standin for something far stronger a symbol will never have the strength of a bullet fired from the barrel of a policemans gun at an unarmed black man because of ingrained bias a symbol will never have the impact of a prison sentence that permanently prevents a young person from becoming a fullfledged member of society a fate far more likely to befall a person of color a symbol will never eradicate black and latino wealth like the predatory loan structures that put their homes underwater in a recession at rates that dwarfed their white peers but if we are not even willing to get rid of a symbol as this body has so clearly expressed its disinterest in doing how can we possibly move on to the real underlying problems issues like education for young people affordable housing and access and training for jobs removing a symbol is an easy thing to do an easy thing that would have signaled one country indivisible with liberty and justice for all today republican members across the aisle did more than just stand up for that symbol of hate and that symbol of degradation these members treated me and those issues that are vitally important and extremely sensitive to me in a manner that was both disrespectful insensitive and very hurtful nonetheless this will not go away we will continue to raise this issue every day that it is needed every week that it is needed every month that it is needed until my colleagues can recognize that a simple act of decency the removal of this symbol of hate and

the department of energy to establish updated light bulb efficiency standards by january 1 of next year it also provided that if final updated standards are not issued by then a more stringent

colleagues in the consideration of h r 3059 a bill to designate the facility of the united states postal service in del city oklahoma as the james robert kalsu post office building we have heard about this amazing individual who was blessed with such amazing athletic skills who was selected to play football at the university of oklahoma and received allamerican honors in 1967 leading his team to a 101 record and an orange bowl win the following year after being drafted into the nfl the buffalo bills and starting in 9 of his 14 appearances he was again recognized as rookie of the year it was more than his efforts on the football field that made robert or bob kalsu a standout he always put others first and chose to lead by example he joined the rotc at the university of oklahoma and took to heart the pledge he made to serve his country in the army while many athletes elected to serve in the reserves he insisted that he was no better than anyone else and choose to serve on active duty we know that after 8 months of being stationed in lawton oklahoma lieutenant bob kalsu received orders to go to vietnam and less than 1 year later in 1970 he was killed by enemy fire it is significant to note he is the only active nfl player to give his life in vietnam and one of only a handful of professional athletes to serve in active duty lieutenant kalsu is survived by a family and amazingly a son who was born just 2 days after his tragic death we should pass this bill to honor this individual lieutenant bob kalsu and recognize the last full measure of devotion he made on behalf of our great country i urge the passage of h r 3059 i just want to say as this is our last post office naming that we have on the floor tonight that so many of us go to postal facilities across the country i was a postal employee for 30 years and i know the service that is given in a postal service but the ability to name a building in a community where so many of us go i would like americans to pause and recognize the names that are given to these facilities do take the time to learn about these individuals this is done so that their service will never be forgotten and that as we go about our day it is one of the things that we can do to give tribute to make sure that their service is not forgotten and to give some comfort to the families who lost someone in service to our country i yield back

for persistence this is the fifth time this legislation will have been on the floor of this house of course it is threatened by a veto should it ever pass the senate but it wont so aplus for persistence i will give him an a for creativity because this is the same bill five times under four different guises first it was for west nile okay then it was the pest management and fire suppression flexibility act so when we had west nile they called it a west nile bill when we were having a bad fire year they called it a fire suppression flexibility act then they were honest and they said it is the reducing regulatory burdens act the piece of paper the report you have to file after you apply the pesticides so at least that was from their side honest but then now it is the zika vector control act renamed 2 weeks ago zika is a serious problem of course on their side they are refusing to put forward an adequate budget to partner with communities who want to do mosquito reduction and control efforts but that is a story for another day and it is a different committee but that would be a real thing we could do here are a couple of points zika is very bad for pregnant women and is also implicated in guillainbarre syndrome in both males and females and other potential links to other diseases really really bad stuff we have to get ahead of it we also know that pesticides and herbicides are bad for pregnant women so is the current state of affairs such that vector control districts cant go out right now today and apply pesticides to deal with a potential zika with tiger mosquitoes and aedes aegypti no actually they can under the law they can go out and apply whatever they think would be effective they just need within 30 days to send a forma form a piece of paperavailable online to the epa saying what they applied and where they applied it now why would we care about that well because we are worried about loading up drinking water with stuff that is harmful to pregnant women and to babies and to other living things just like the 90 000 steelhead that were killed in my district all we are saying is we would like to keep track and then when we see certain concentrations in certain areas we will actually test the water your local water authority does not routinely testfor the most part very fewfor pesticides and herbicides but if they knew a bunch had been dumped upstream they might want to do that or the epa might want to follow up and do some testing so what we are saying is we dont want to know we dont want to know what where how this stuff was applied now the horrible burden of submitting an online form this horrible horrible horrible burden has led to no well we heard last time there may have been an aerial applicator who didnt apply something because of this regulatory burden or maybe because they had misapplied it or maybe the wind was blowing too hard who knows we dont know that was one anecdotal report but from the 50 states assembled and the epa there are no documented instances of delays or prevention of necessary application of pesticides or herbicides because of the reporting requirement to epa so we will know what when where and how this stuff was applied so the gentleman gets an aplus for persistence an a for creativity but unfortunately a d for dangerous in terms of what this legislation would lead to i include in the record the statement of administration policy i will put the whole thing in the record but the administration does not agree with that truncated quote talking about how important this is or something from someone at epa h r 897 would weaken environmental protections under the clean water act by exempting pesticide spraying from the currently required pesticide general permit general permit creating a new statutory exemption to the permit is unnecessary because the permit itself was explicitly crafted to allow immediate responses to declared pest emergencies
