reduction it consists of straightforward cuts which denies the government a means to spend more we cut 160 programs and we tell how we did it in contrast to the democratic plan the republican plan gets to work immediately by cutting federal spending 38 billion in the first year compared to the democrats 6 billion cut unlike the democrats who slapped on 60 billion in generic cuts at the last

administrative overhead and personnel we aim to reduce the waste fraud and mismanagement in government simply we intend to increase the governments toothtotall ratio increasing the part that works and reducing the part that gets dragged around behind in the area of overhead we went straight to what is called object class 20 of federal spending which includes what the government spends on travel transportation rental payments printing consulting communications and supplies these categories add up to a whopping 340 billion annually we then made sure that we took everything out that was not real direct federal spending so that there could be no quibbling that the cuts we made werent possible we got down to what are called the direct expenses the money the goverment actually spends and that came to 222 billion but we didnt stop there either we went all the way down to the clinton number of 55 billion and from all these billions of dollars we took out 7 billion in the first year and

supporters mr lasater was known to use cocaine and distributed cocaine freely at many parties and he was convicted convicted by the arkansas authorities of trafficking in cocaine he received a prison sentence and his prison sentence was partially reduced after he got out of prison he was in a halfway house for a few months he was pardoned exonerated by thengovernor clinton his friend during the time that he was incarcerated in this halfway househe really was not in a penitentiary he was in a halfway house most of the time during the time he was incarcerated a lady named patsy thomasson who is his chief financial officer took over control of his businesses and she ran his businesses as the chief financial officer while mr lasater was away at prison when he got out and was pardoned by president clinton ms thomasson continued to be the chief financial officer of his companies and she also became the chief officer of what was called the phoenixthe phoenix group a subsidiary of the phoenix group was the phoenix mortgage co and mr lasater became the president of the phoenix mortgage co so the relationship between patsy thomasson and mr lasater and bill clinton was of long duration and continued even after he went to jail and was out as a matter of fact mr lasater paid an 8 000 drug debt drug bill for cocaine use that bill clintons brother had incurred so he paid off a drug bill for bill clintons brother so there was a very close relationship between the clintons and mr lasater now patsy thomasson to give you some more background my colleagues now is one of the chief officers at the white house she is the personnel director at the white house she conducts quote unquote the drug testing of personnel at the white house now yesterday the people of albuquerque nm awoke to another tale of corruption that may involve the president president clinton the front page of tuesdays albuquerque journal reports that ajoint federal state narcotics investigation of the presidents friend mr dan lasater was called off before it was completed a former arkansas state police investigator j n doc delaughter told two journal investigative reporters that the investigation included lasater a close friend of the president and highdollar contributor to mr clintons campaign and the presidents brother roger clinton delaughter said the investigation was cut off prematurely for political reasons the state police investigators say he briefed the clintonappointed arkansas state police director tommy goodwin twice by telephone about the lasater clinton investigation on both occasions tommy goodwin the state police investigator was using a phone in then governor clintons personal office mr delaughter who was then on the force was not sure whether or not governor clinton now president clinton overheard the conversations but it is very clear that governor clinton now president clinton was very close to the arkansas state police director who was getting the information about the investigation delaughter said and i quote moneys could have been seized and planes could have been seized because we had evidence that cocaine was being used on planes used by mr lasater as i said before mr lasater quite frequently flew then governor bill clinton around in these planes delaughter told the newspaper that he and another investigator were barred from interviews with lasater roger clinton and another lasater associate in other words his superiors on the state police said you cant go and investigate this they stopped him cold in his tracks eventually lasater was convicted of possession and distribution of cocaine as i said before he was sentenced to 30 months in prison but served only 10 months most of which was in a halfway house before being released on parole lasater was later paroled by his friend thengovernor bill clinton now right in the thick of all this is patsy thomasson who is now the personnel director at the white house she took over the daytoday operations of the lasater companies while lasater was in prison as i speak to you tonight she is responsible for the daily administration of the clinton white house the newspaper is careful to point out that there is no evidence to support any indictment of ms thomasson or establish a direct connection between the illegal activity that led to the conviction of lasater and the presidents brother now harkening back to an earlier washington scandal one has to wonder what did ms thomasson know about the illegal activity which surrounded her and when did she realize that her boss lasater was a largescale drug pusher the albuquerque journal found no one in that firm no one in that firm other than ms thomasson the chief financial officer had any doubt about what was going on in the lasater companies i quote the newspapers story former lasater employees interviewed by the fbi said tney left or joined the firm between 1982 and 1985 because of its reputation tor cocaine use as the chief financial officer for lasater during that period are we to believe that ms thomasson now the chief personnel director at the whitehouse haa no clue about what was going on in the company the albuquerque journal reported that the fbi received sworn statements from lasater employees therethat were there at christmas parties at which cocaine was available in ashtrays cocaine was freely available at lasater company outings in lexington ky hot springs ar and elsewhere according to lasater employees reporters dick lynch and mike gallagher quote federal grand jury testimony which said that cocaine was served like hors doeuvres but we are asked to believe that the chief financial officer even though everybody else in that firm knew about it knew nothing of this and we are talking about ms thomasson ms thomasson patsy thomasson was a key player in the lasater operations the newspaper cites numerous public and court records which show her as president of the various lasater enterprises including new mexicos angel fire corp which lasater purchased in 1984 and sold in 1987 articles of incorporation show that thomasson as an incorporator of the phoenix group which was the successor to lasater co records of the sale of angel fire in 1987 to a texas investment partnership bear patsy thomassons signature she was tied to mr lasater all the way through all of his operations at the time of this sale the customs service and the fbi were busy investigating money laundering and drug trafficking she signed the partnership agreement the two agencies formed an organized crime drug enforcement task force and named lasater as the chief target of the probe pasty thomasson was given power of attorney power of attorney by mr lasater in january 1987 while he was in prison and surprisingly appears to still be acting as a registered agent for lasaters phoenix mortgage co calls by the newspaper to patsy thomasson at the white house were not returned i understand ms thomasson has taken leave of absense from her position as the director of administration for the president i continue to be concerned about the presidents association with people like mr lasater pardoning him after he was convicted of dealing in drugs giving him 65 million i believe in state bonds during the time he was being investigated and later indicted by the arkansas state police and the federal authorities for drug trafficking i continue to be concerned about his association president clintons with people like mr lasater and ms thomasson in the very limited hearings that we had on

trying to sell the american people into believing that his huge tax hike the largest in american history will go towards reducing the federal deficit president clinton and the democrats are conning the american people and this is why i checked with my doctors yesterday to get their approval to cast my vote against president clintons budget this vote is the first i have made since i underwent triple bypass surgery on july 16 to remove arterial blockage i believe this vote is crucial to my constituents and the country and this is why i am here before you instead of at home recuperating the democratic leadership claim that the goal of the clintons tax package is to pare 500 billion from the federal debt over the next 5 years what president clinton and the democrats fall to say is that even if they pass the presidents budget the nations debt will still increase by a staggering 1 2 tillion if this doublespeak is not insulting enough to the intelligence of taxpayers clinton and the democrats are trying to pull a fast one on american families and businesses by frontloading 275 billion of gross tax increases without significant spending cuts the clinton tax package heaps taxes on americans already struggling to provide a decent standard of living for themselves and their families rather than making americans pay their fair share the clinton tax plan will ensure that americans will be sharing most of their income with the federal government maybe the president and the democratic leadership in congress have convinced themselves of this but my constituents are not persuaded history has demonstrated to us time and time again that increasing taxes does not reduce the deficit higher taxes means increased spending i ask you my colleagues the question my constituents have asked me how can these tax increases be justified with the knowledge that no mechanisms exist to cut spending in the budget three parts of this budget represent a particularly onerous tax burden that will affect the middle class seniors and anyone else in america who breathes the gas tax the social security tax and surprising new retroactive taxes first the gas tax this federal gasoline tax of 4 3 cents per gallon will be more burdensome to families living in the large states of the west and south california will not escape the affect of this tax this increase will tax gasoline diesel compressed natural gas and noncommercial aviation fuel california will be hit extremely hard since it has a large population that utilizes various forms of transportation transportation costs will inevitably increase the clinton energy tax is inflationary and will escalate the already spiralling tax burden passed on to american families the energy tax will stifle the economic recovery we see occurring right now according to the tax foundation it is estimated that 54 299 jobs will be lost in my state of california behind every number there is a human face a family someone who can blame their unemployment on clintons tax package next the tax on social security benefits or if you listen to the president a spending cut seniors will be penalized for working and saving for their retirement under the clinton tax plan even though in his manifest putting people first candidate clinton promised to protect the integrity of the social security trust fund he hag decided to balance the budget on backs of senors cintons proposal will affect seniors with incomes of over 32 000 or coups incomes over 44 000 by inrea the tax on 85 percent of their social secuty benefits in addition to this these taxes increase the elderly surtax on pensions ira withdrawals interest from municipal bonds and certifcates of deposit the tax revenues generated by these new taxes on seniors will then be used to fund other programs rather than going into the socal security trust fund the president should not wonder as he pillages senlors benefits to pay for other programs why in addition to te budget deficit he also must contend with the trust fund this elderly surtax is anything but fair the increase in the elderly surtax hits the prudent and frugel who live on ixed incomes accordlng to the heritage foundation it is estimated that in calilomia 566 328 households over 65 with incomes greater than 3 000 will be hit and more spedlically in my district 13 884 households affected the 29 billion clinton hope to rsm at the expense of our seniors could easily be achieved by implementing just a handful of seniors wastecuting recommendations that have been put before him seniors should be appalled that a president who was not even born while many of them were fighting in world wars to make the world safe for democracy and wordng to feed their families is now trying to pick their pockets to pay for his new spending programs ad speaking of new taxes id like to call my colleagues attention to language ticked away in the budget reconcillatlon bill the measure imposes an unfair rate increase in estate gift and generallonskipping taxes th would be retroactive to january 1 1993 the proposed increase which would raise the top rate from 50 percent to 55 per cent would hit many states and beneficiaries inciud many owners of famiyowned busnessee and famis this change is a radical deperture from tradition no retroactive change has been imposed since the estate tax was enacted

of small busineses who file as individuals will be hit by these taxes president clinton conceded that up to 1 25 million smal business men and women could be paying this jincreased tax this is a huge sacrifice for the most vibrant facet of our economy the president and the democrat should follow the lead of every previous corgess that has consldered the issue and change the budget reconcillation

that it will but certainly not all and probably not even most the american people will remember this as they watch more and more of their paycheck go toward federal taxes president clinton portrays this package as change for america saying that it is lime the rich pay their fair share however president clinton is robbing everyone in america to pay for the congress insatiable appetite for

members of the house to focus just for a second on what is special about this debate on the bartontauzin amendment this debate today focuses not necessarily on whether or not one supports the concept of a balanced budget amendment i believe agreat majority of this house does this debate focuses on how we are going to achieve that balanced budget amendment this amendment the bartontauzin amendment is very much like the stenholm amendment the only difference in the balanced budget features of this amendment and the stenholm amendment is the year 2000 date for the accomplishment of the balanced budget goal but the major difference the thing we ought to be focusing on today is the feature of the bartontauzin amendment that provides for some restraint on tax increases as a vehicle for achieving balanced budgets now what restraint is in here the restraint that is in here is a simple provision that says in achieving the balanced budget that all of us or a great majority of us i think want to achieve that we ought to do it without raising taxes any higher than any greater than the income of americans is growing at the time we raise taxes in other words government should not grow faster than the pocketbooks of americans americans individually and american businesses it says in effect that we can raise taxes if we need to in short the amendment we debate today says that while the government of the united states may in fact have to raise taxes it ought not do it except with a supermajority any faster than the rate of growth of income in american pocketbooks and businesses in short it says balance the budget over the term allotted principally by reducing spending wherever you can if we were to poll americans across the width and breadth of this country today i think they would agree with that principle so we are debating an amendment today that really incorporates the stenholm balanced budget amendment with the addition that the balanced budget amendment ought to be achieved with as little as possible in tax increases and as much as possible in spending cuts if members agree with that principle they will want to vote for this version of the balanced budget amendment those who have said they are concerned about this version ought to be concerned because this is a real amendment if we really want to achieve a balanced budget for america we ought to be concerned that this amendment will do it and other amendments may not do it so if we have a concern about the effect of the unitedstates constitution commanding those of us representing this nation in this body to abide by responsible spending limits then we ought to be concerned abut this amendment it will require this congress and this nation to put our fiscal house order without unnecessarily raising taxes again on the american public people have asked us why should we do this at all let me give the members an illustration of the most important reason why i think it is important for congress to enact not only the balanced budget amendment but this version of it with a limitation on tax increases it is incumbent because we need to examine the reason the mandate is normally sent to washington in town meetings across my district folks ask why do you guys keep spending money over and above the income of this government why do you keep putting us in debt why do you keep crowding out money we could be using for useful purposes in america by paying all this interest on the debt conservatives and liberals make this same request why dont you put your house in order quit paying all this interest and spend the money we send you on projects that are good for america instead of paying interest on debt to countries all over the world who buy our tbills the answer is that most congressmen come to washington with a simple mandate the mandate is go to washington get as many of those federal dollars we send you backinto your district and spend them at home the truth is that we all carry out that mandate pretty doggone good the truth is that most of us end up bringing more money home than our folks have sent up here that is why we are out of balance we carry out the mandate pretty good i think what americans want to do in this balanced budget debate is to ask us to give them a chance in voting for a constitutional amendment that would send a new mandate to all of us who come up here and the mandate would be very simple do what you can about bringing projects home do what you can about carrying out the necessary spending in government but dont spend more money than we send you each year at some point stop this crazy borrowing trend that is crowding out the funds we need to carry on a progressive and good economy for our country in short i think the message americans have been sending us in town hall meetings in our mail and in messages to members of congress is that while we want you to do a good job in making sure that projects come home and federal programs are still carried out we also want you to carry out a new mandate and the mandate is dont spend more money than we have sent you and quit raising taxes on us in order to accomplish the purpose of a balanced budget amendment the bartontauzin amendment is the only one that carries out those two mandates of urging americans to live in this government within our means and second to stop

fitting that we consider this legislation this year before we adjourn 1993 marks the 100th anniversary of the overthrow of the sovereign kingdom of hawaii with the assistance of unitedstates military forces that overthrow brought to an ignoble end this countrys recognition of the kingdom of hawaii as a sovereign independent nation a status we repeatedly recognized in treaty and international agreement treaty relations between the united states and the hawaiian government began with the signing of a bilateral agreement between the parties in 1826 by a capt thomas jones on behalf of the united states and the regent kaahumanu on behalf of the hawaiian king kaulikeaouli after that date the united states concluded a series of treaties with the sovereign kingdom of hawaii the 1849 treaty of commerce friendship and navigation the 1855 treaty concerning rights of neutrals at sea the 1870 postal convention an 1875 treaty of reciprocity the 1883 convention for the exchange of money orders the 1884 treaty of commercial reciprocity and the 1888 parcel post convention because the increased number of rights granted to americans that accompanied this treaty process and accompanying increase in trade greatly swelled the numbers of whites on the islands native hawaiians became a minority in their own land from a population of approximately 300 000 in 1778 by 1890 the hawaiian people were reduced to a population of 41 000 that owned a little under onequarter of the land in response to the growing commercial power of the whites and their demands king kamehameha i introduced land reforms in 1848 called the great mahele in which hawaiian lands became alienable for the first time by 1852 thousands of acres were owned by a few westernersthe early land baronswhile native hawaiians owned only a tiny fraction the white 9 percent of the population owned 67 percent of the taxable land in the kingdom having asserted economic dominance over the kingdom by the late 1880s the westerners turned to establish complete political control as well the principal white landowners founded the hawaiian league in 1887 to increase their power at the expense of the monarchy in consequence they staged a coup d6tat on july 6 1887 and forced the king to promulgate a new constitution the bayonet constitution of 1887 which supplanted the power of the monarch with that of the white landowners under the constitution the voting class was limited to landowners a move which disenfranchised 75 percent of the native population in 1893 the american merchant community dissatisfied with its lack of total political control and fearing a diminution of the control it did possess organized to overthrow the constitutional monarchy that ruled the kingdom the merchants formed a committee on public safety made up entirely of nonhawaiians the fact that the revolt was led solely by nonnative mercantile interests was evident even on the mainland at the time a contemporary article in the fresno daily evening expositor noted that the uprising was formulated by the sugar producing elements of the islands the unitedstates minister in hawaii john l stevens was openly hostile to the monarchy as one historian has put it he desired that the monarchy should fall and that the islands should be annexed to the united states stevens conspired with the merchants and sent a letter to the state department stating that the hawaiian pear is now fully ripe and this is the golden hour for the united states to pluck it his letter outlining his intentions would not reach the state department until several months after the revolt on the day the merchants planned their revolt stevens unilaterally ordered 162 marines from the unitedstatess boston to land in honolulu to lend support to the merchants he had already informed the rebels of his plans and that diplomatic recognition of their cause would be quickly forthcoming the troops would be ready to land any moment and would recognize the existing government whatever it might be e the rebels overthrew the monarchy and proclaimed a provisional government which stevens was quick to recognize in the name of the united states even though he had no authority to do so the reigning monarch queen liliuokalani was forced to surrender her authority in a document stating that she yield to the superior force of the united states whose minister has caused united states troops to be landed at honolulu and declared that he would support the said provisional government the republic of hawaii was proclaimed soon thereafter in 1894 and among its official acts was the expropriation of all lands belonging to the crown without compensation to the queen lilluokalani or the hawaiian people the lands were immediately made available to westerners for purchase in 1898 the united states unilaterally annexed the kingdom as a territory thereby abrogating the independent status of the kingdom that we had recognized in treaty over the preceding 70 years with that annexation the united states without paying any compensation to the native hawaiian people took title to the crown and government lands previously expropriated by the republic the responsibility of instrumentalities of the unitedstates government for the overthrow and subjugation of the native hawaiian government and people is clear in a report to congress in 1893

with the hawaiian people and in commenoing a reconciliation between them and the united states the goal is to bring together not to divide second there are some who are worried that the resolution

committee and the senate commerce committee this legislation has been passed in essentially the same form by the house in this congress and in the 102d congress when it narrowly missed enactment at the end of the session the key feature of this bill is a directive to the federal trade commission to adopt rules specifically targeting deceptive telemarketing practices once those rules are in place the bill authorizes state attorneys general to enforce the rules this kind of constructne statefederal partnership is a very effective technique for making im1ed enforcement resources go as far as possible it will also vastly reduce the ability of flybynight telemarketing scam operators to use state lines as a basis for potential legal sanctuary i am particularly conscious of the need for a redoubled effort against deceptive telernarketing because i know how important telemarketing is as a retail tool to bring many goods and services to consumers who reside in rural areas including those who reside in my district unfortunately a few bad actors can undermine the credibility of the thousands of legitimate businesses who use telemarketting as a key part of their retail strategy it is therefore doubly important that we crack down on deception and traud not only to prevent injury to consumers but also to avoid further harm to legiuiate businesses and by the way in many cases businesses themselves are the targets of fraudulent or deceptive techniques by tastbok artists who employ the telephone as their preferred insirument of attack i also want to note that in fashioning this bill the committee was especaly careful to avoid interfering with the existing antifraud jorisdiction of the securities and exchange commission and the conmmodities futures trading commission through the cooperative efforts of the affected irkstries as well as the agriculture committee this bill coordinates the efforts of the sec and the cftc with those of the federal trade commission and avoids any conflict or overlap in their authority to combat deceptive telemarketing the bigl also makes if easier for credit card organizations and other business victims who are left with

you to support this amendment which would delete the qualifying words permanent and irreparable from the definition of damage on public lands to be declared unsuitable for mining leaving only the threshold of significant damage necessary to declare such lands offlimits mr pope offered an example from coal mining case law not hardrock mining to attempt to demonstrate the need for the defazlo amendment however the substitute to h r 322 does not allow for an unsuitable designation to lie against existing mines where substantial legal and financial commitments have been made prior to enactment of the bill in other words the defazio amendment would not affect the ohio litigation or cases like it even if it were to be applied to coal mines another flyer drew a parallel to the exxon

the ukraine unsuitable for continuing nuclear power however that is not the worst of the disinformation campaign on h r 322 by the environmental lobby this bill is more properly titled the mexican mineral development incentives act of 1993 because it is already a huge disincentive to exploration and development of our domestic mineral resources latin america is where united states exploration dollars are now headed notwithstanding the sierra clubs protestations h r 322 allows no actual development if a miner cannot demonstrate compliance with the impossibletomeet reclamation standards h r 322 contains so many ways to stop exploration for and development of mineral deposits that the proposed unsuitability threshold is barely relevant the sierra club believes that mining companies would actually be better protected under the defazio amendment because mining investments would not be made in the first place finally the truth is out about h r 322 it is an attempt to thwart mineral development of the public lands that congress has not set aside for special uses but the sierra club knows unsuitability is the key to administrative withdrawals quite frankly i dont understand the need for unsuitability when this secretary almost daily flexes his administrative muscles he is using flpma authorities unknown or unused by previous secretaries to accomplish mining withdrawals for example the sweet grass hills have been segregated from mineral exploration on the basis of indian religious freedom act concerns because this unsuitability determination is for lands greater than 5 000 acres the natural resources committee will have opportunity to overturn it later but that is not about to happen mr pope wrote in the nov dec issue of sierra magazine about the need for an environmental impact statement on nafta arguing for eis preparation mr pope said we cannot afford to entrust the north american environment to unaccountable bureaucrats yet that is exactly who would

for yielding to me on this important subject that unites us and so many others in this chamber in solidarity with a people who have been suffering for too long i saw an article in the newspaper today may 19 also an important date in cuban history because the great day that is celebrated may 20 as the gentleman from new jersey has stated the birth of tne republic afteralmost 100 years of struggle by the cuban people in 1902 may 19 is also remembered as another kind of day it is riot a day that is celebrated it is the day on which the person who did more than anyone else to see may 20 become areality the day that he was killed that marti was killed at 44 years of age after having left his native land at age 16 he finally returned and within a few weeks of setting foot on his beloved island he was killed on may 19 and so he never saw may 20 1902 and yet the republic that was founded on may 20 1902 owes more to him than anyone else in that republic and during that republic so much solidarity was manifested was constantly shown by the cuban people for peoples throughout the world and especially in our hemisphere who had lost their freedom what civic or labor or professional association during the republic did not have for example a committee for the liberation of the dominican republic during the dictatorship of trujillo had a committee for the liberation or the reinstatement of the republic in spain during the 39yearold dictatorship of general franco and many other committees in solidarity with dictatorships especially especially in this hemisphere and yet today after 35 years of suffering the most brutal dictatorship in the history of this hemisphere where where are the committees for the liberation of cuba in what latinamerican universities in what latinamerican labor associations in what latinamerican professional associations do we find committees for the liberation of cuba where is the act of reciprocity the elemental act of reciprocity with the cuban people after the solidarity that was demonstrated in an unparalleled way during the years of the republic with exiles from throughout the hemisphere unfortunately i do not recognize i do not see that solidarity and yet just as after almost 100 years of struggle one nation one nation stood with the cuban people and helped the cuban people achieve its independence from colonialism european colonialism and that one nation that stood with the cuban people was the united states of america history repeats itself and now after more than 30 years of brutal dictatorship one nation in this earth one nation on this planet tells its business community we will not allow you to profit from the oppression of the cuban people we will not allow you to profit from the lack of the ability to unionize and to collectively bargain in other words we will not allow you to profit from the slave labor that castro maintains and forces upon the cuban people and that one nation that one nation that stands in solidarity with the cuban people again as a hundred years ago is the united states so not only do we see the acts of repression more than ever not only do we see the total economic devastation of a previously prosperous land at the hands of the dictatorship but also on a daily basis and especially us in southern florida who are able to meet with people who risking their lives and the lives of their loved ones reach our shores with their stories every day we are able to witness the acts also of humiliation that the dictatorship commits upon its people today today i read in the newspaper may 19 1994 of the 90yearold widow of one of cubas most famous writers enrique labrador ruiz she is 90 years old a few weeks ago reading the newspaper she comes across a painting that was achieved that was produced in 1942 of her late husband as the new exhibit at christies the new sale of cuban art christies had announced a sale of cuban art works and had given it much publicity this lady seized the photograph of the painting of her husband she is a 90yearold widow without means and christies states no that is a painting that was obtained from h3748 cuba that was sold by cuba in other words think of what this means the impotence that the cuban people have to live on a daytoday basis the humiliation that they have to live on a daytoday basis the lack of power of empowerment of that people all of these sad realities all of these sad realities not only this example which touches the heart of the 90yearold widow who could not believe that her precious painting that had been left in a relatives home even that was being sold by the dictator to achieve currency even that was being sold by the dictator and that she was impotent to stop it she settled apparently i settled says the 90yearold widow it was very poor compensation but at least it will pay for my burial enrique always said nobody buries me i pay my own burial that is the widow of enrique labrador ruiz one of the greatest writers produced by the cuban nation in this century so this is another example of what the cuban people have to live in a day the humiliation and the impotence that the cuban people have to live on a daytoday basis and we see the lack of solidarity in the hemisphere and yet we see the solidarity in this nation the congress of the united states just a few weeks ago as you know i say to
