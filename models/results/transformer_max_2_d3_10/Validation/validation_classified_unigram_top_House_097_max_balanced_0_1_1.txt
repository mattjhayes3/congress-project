speaking this evening about an hour and 10 minutes before the president of the united states will address the country on the issue of tax cuts and turning the american economy around the president i anm certain will explain to us that he is concerned with economy recovery with creating jobs with fighting inflation and with developing what once upon a time was called prosperity and that he has a tax bill the conablehance bill which president reagan supports which is essentially an economic bill designed to develop more jobs to allow people to have more real takehome pay and to fit into a general economy recovery plan i am very pleased this evening to be able to put into the record the statement of the honorable normal b ture the under secretary of treasury for tax and economic affairs which was made this morning before the republican house task force on economic policy dr ture is an expert on taxes and economics he is one of the foiunders of the supplyside school of economics and i think if i may quote from his statements which i will insert at the end of my special order that he as much as anybody has drawn the lines between the rostenkowskioneiul tax bill and president reagans efforts on a bipartisan basis with mr conable and mr hance to develop a genuine economic recovery tax bill dr ture points out and i quote the conabiehance bill has been designed to provide families at all income levels with meaningful and permanent tax relief it is the only bill now being offered which does this he continues dr ture continues the presidents tax program is the only plan which will provide real longterm tax relief for the american people be~ause it includes indexing the conablehance tax cut will not be repealed by bracket creep and inflation the president and members of congress of both parties who support the bipartisan bill are making this pledge we will get your tax rates down we will keep your tax rates down there will be no hidden tax increases there will be no ifs ands or buts about it in other words the reagan tax program is clear it is long term it is permanent and is a genuine tax cut dr ture goes on then to explain the alternative and i quote by contrast the~ ways and means bill is a temporary 2year 15percent tax cut which turns into a tax increase in 1984 it is not even large enough to offset builtin tax increases of about 22 percent due to bracket creep and higher payroll tax between now and 1984 the ways and means bill is not a real tax cut at all unless you only plan to live for two more years i mentioned earlier today in a iminute speech the distinction that president reagan has drawn as the reason we were wearing the button that says i plan to live president reagans tax cut is a real tax cut for your illetime it genuinely changes the tax code permanently on the other hand the rostenkowskioneill tax bill is a shortterm gimmick designed to buy time and then after time taxes go back up the difference is immense in the long run in fact as dr ture points out the oneillrostenkowski bill actually increases the steepness of bracket creep it actually means that if you get pay raises in the future the jump will be higher and steeper the way he puts it and i quote the ways and means bill has a shock in store for middle bracket taxpayers some of the biggest steptips in tax rates from one tax bracket to the next ever to appear in the tax code middleincome taxpayers filing joint returns would find themselves leaping through brackets in which they pay 25 percent 34 percent 41 percent and 48 percent of additional income to the government stepups of 9 7 and 7 percentage points in taxable incomes of 30 300 and 46 200 in other words after 2 brief years of delay under the rostenkowskioneill bill suddenly you start leapfrogging into higher and higher brackets dr ture compares the rostenkowskioneill tax increases with the world war ii surcharges frankly since i was born in 1943 this is history to me but i think it is relevant hlitory for everyone who lived through it and it is relevant history for everyone who wants to learn from it in world war ii faced with this nations greatest crisis we had a tax surcharge which carried taxpayers from 22 percent to 47 percent with six steps in between they did it over a span that was almost three times as wide as the span in the rostenkowskonetu bill in order words without a war in peacetime the rostenkowskioneill bill is going to leapfrog us higher and higher at a very rapid rate it is in effect a bill which encourages you to get a pay cut rather than a pay raise dr ture concludes and i quote this is a clear demonstration of the cynical intent of the ways and means bill to give a tax cut next year while rigging the tax code to take it all back at record rates just as quickly as possible nothing could be plainer the committees bill provides the form not the substance of incentive tax reduction i am inserting dr tures testimony i believe that every american who is concerend about the decay of our economy about high interest rates about high unemployment every american who wants to see us go back to an economy to become again a country in which you can work and save and which you can get a pay raise and keep the raise every american should read what dr ture says tonight president reagan will address us on wednesday this house will decide we do have an opportunity to

country to achieve the compromises necessary to pass a budget that will guide fiscal policy for the next fiscal year the latta substitute represents such compromises not only among republicans with

of the democratic party it moves toward the freespending pollcies of the past the very policies that dragged the formerly great american economy into stagnation and then recession as i examine the alternatives before us i find that the jones substitute would spend 19 billion more than the latta budget it would increase the tax burden by 11 billion more than the latta budget and the deficit would be 8 billion more than that of the latta budget that makes the choice very easy for me at a time when the american economy appears to be on the threshold of recovering from a long and deep recession it makes no sense whatever to adopt a budget that would spend more tax more and borrow more to cover deficits last year we embarked on a new economic program for america based on less government spending less inflation ant lower taxes it is a program that offers real hope for strong economic growth in the months and years ahead and the latta budget would keep us on course the biggest remaining problem is the budget deficit which some estimates have placed at far more than 100 bmion for the 1983 fiscal year the prospect of such huge federal borrowing is a prime cause of high interest rates that are plaguing the economy the latta substitute has the virtue of keeping the budget deficit under the 100 billion mark sending the right signal to the nervous financial markets that we intend to apply stern controls on spending that is the message to permit a decline in interest rates it is important to understand how our economy fell into such deep economic trouble from 1970 to 1980 federal spending almost tripled the per capita tax burden increased 150 percent and consumer prices went up 112 percent as measured by the consumer price index congress was on a spending spree that created waves of inflation and a rising tax burden while some of us were struggling against the tide and demanding a slowdown in federal spending there has been almost no real growth of the armrican economy in 3 years we had the recession of 1980 followed quickly by the recession of 198182 and it should be obvious to everybody that government cannot spend us to prosperity last year with a new president and a new congress we started correcting the causes of the economic blight we have endured the dramatic fall of the inflation rate and the tax cuts taking effect this year and next

figures presented in the presidents budget instead of adopting the presidents figures that would put us on the road to economic recovery the democraticcontrolled committee has adopted those figures presented by chairman jones why the administrations figures rather than those proposed by the chairman there are several reasons chairman jones did not like ombs numbershe did not like cbos and he did not like the results of his own first two sets of assumptions he sent to cbono he had to send them a third set before he received the numbers he presented to us now i personally cannot give too much credence to his figures since they were arrived at in such a manner i elect to go with omb since they have a specific charter from this congress and the american people to give us their best advice on this subject we cannot forget there was an election last november and the people voted overwhelmingly for ronald reagan why because the american people did not like the direction in which their country was heading and they wanted a change and he promised them a change he did not say elect me and i will give you more and more spending money necessitating higher and higher taxes and bringing on higher and higher inflation no he said i am opposed to these things and i will do what i can to change them he promised them less government less federal regulation and redtape more dependence on the individual american and less dependence on government more productivity and greater competitiveness in the world marketplace after that election and even before his inaugurationronald reagan started putting together a package a package to accomplish what the people indicated they wanted from government this package has many integral and vital partsthe tax part and the budget part being two of the most vital parts certainly he cannot give this country the new direction it so desperately needs without these two parts being adopted without significant change does the democrat budget proposed by chairman jones give us that change well take a look at the numbers and answer your own question his aggregate spending outlays will go from the 632 billion provided for in the fiscal year 1981 resolution passed last november to 713 5 billion in fiscal year 1982 this would give us an increase in spending by the federal government of 133 9 billion in just 2 years to get some idea of the magnitude cf this increase one merely needs to recall that the total i repeat total spending of he federal government never reached the 100 billion mark for 1 year until the second year of the kennedy administration yet spending under the jones proposal would increase spending over 1980 by 133 9 billion is this the turnaround the people wanted and the country so desperately needs i think not the jones proposal will not admittedly reduce inflation according to his own projections in flation will remain in the doubledigit range12 percent for 1982 i thought high inflation is the one thing the people wanted brought under control the same with higher unemployment his projections would give us higher unemployment why the answer lies in the fact that he merely nibbles at the problems and does not take a whole bite his spending aggregate is up considerably over the presidents there is no meaningful reversal of past policies as a matter of fact in glancing at his budget last night i find he is restoring 8 345 billion in reductions that the president had recommended the bloc grant concept of returning many of these functions to the stateswhere they could be performed cheaper and with less redtapehbas been scuttled taxes would be decreased by a net of only 30 5 billion and new taxes in the amount of 7 6 billion would be added to the government take these reductions would not become effective until 1982 and would be pssed around in a manner which obviously would be to gain votesas has been the case in the past several tax reduction billsrather than to cure the ills now facing our rapidly fading and once very competitive economy the reagan tax reductions would be for 3 9 billion 51 3 net and would be directed at awakening that sleeping giant and putting people back to work in the private sector producing goods and services to add to our gnp and to increase our productivity this cannot be accomplished when we permit the inflationary bracket creep in our tax laws and they would continue under the jones proposal interest rates would remain in the 12 percent bracket and they must come down if inflation is to come down i could go on and on but in the interest of time i

public offering of d c bonds notes and other obligations second make those technical and conforming amendments which are necessary to resolve several ambiguities relating to the procedures for authorizing and issuing d c bonds notes and other obligations and third give the district of columbia government debt management flexibility comparable to that afforded many other jurisdictions from the beginning of home rule the district has had the authority to issue taxexempt bonds and notes while none have been issued to date passage of this legislation will place thedistrict well on the road to entry into the bond market this proposed legislation does not significantly nor materially alter any provision of the home rule act but simply removes certain ambiguities and legal hurdles which have been noted by the district government and its excellent bond counsel one of the major legal hurdles the district has experienced in contemplating a bond issue is the inability to pay for certain necessary planning costs this inability is due to the current definition of the term capital project in the home rule act section 1 of the bill amends that definition to include certain costs which are not now expressly included reimbursement of expenses for planning payment of incidental financing costs and expenditure for the purchase of equipment or furnishings is expressly provided in the definition these costs are typically included in capital projects in the states the district is simply being placed on equal and in my view firmer footing in this area another legal hurdle lies in the appropriations process for the district because of the line item congressional review of the districts budget there is a cloud of doubt on certainty of payment for bond issues marketing the bonds would thus be difficult the bill removes the annual formal ity of congressional enactment of debt service appropriations and provides assurance to bondholders that bond proceeds will be available as needed under current law debt service payments must be made opi an equal basis this rigid requirement results in limited access to the bond market section 8 of the bill deletes the level debt service requirement thus allowing greater flexibility and improving the prospects for success for district bond issues negotiated sales of bonds is permitted under this legislation the bill also authorizes the issuance of general obligation notes in anticipation of revenues thus positioning the district to respond more easily to cash flow problems the prohibition in subsection b of section 490 of the home rule act against the mortgaging of property as additional security for an issue of revenue bonds is removed by provisions of h r 4910 removal of these legal hurdles is necessary to assure success of district bond issues there are other clarifying and enhancement provisions embodied within h r 4910 one of the important features of this bill is to shore up section 490 of the home rule act which allows in part certain classes of organizations including our local colleges and universities to request the district to issue taxexempt revenue bonds in their behalf a new subsection a of section 490 would remove a perceived limitation and permit the district to issue revenue bonds or notes for refinancing or assistance in refinancing of undertakings by such organizations whether and how referendums on bond issues is to be conducted is unclear under current provisions of the home rule act the bill clarifies the process of referendum when issuing general obligation bonds by mandating that the district of columbia council establish a firm policy questions have been raised about the federal governments obligation to repay the districts debts from a bond issue in the event the district fails to do so h r 4910 affirmatively states that the full faith and credit of the united states is not pledged to the payment of principal or interest on any bond note or other obligation issued by the district because of these impediments to the districts entry into the bond market that i have described the district goverrnent has had no alternative but to continue to borrow funds at a premium from the unitedstates treasury to finance its capital improvements this borrowing authority will expire on october 1 1982 or on the date of enactment of the d c appropriations act for fiscal year 1983 whichever is later if the congress is to avoid a further extension the district must be given the legal means of accessing the municipal bond market passage of h r 4910 will remove the impediments and will facilitate less dependence by the district onthe unitedstates treasury a goal which all of us share the provisions of h r 4910 will in no way relieve the district from adequately addressing and resolving all financial problems and satisfying the creditworthiness tests of the municipal bond market bond ratings will be necessary and the district must convince potential investors that it will sustain balanced annual budgets and develop and pursue an acceptable method of eliminating the existing accumulated operating deficit in short the market will ultimately determine whether the bonds can be sold or not it should also be noted that the 14percent limit on the use of bonds as contained in the home rule act remains in place on november 12 1981 following the hearing the

seem to be enough of an incentive to save in fact studies show that an estimated 95 percent of all the money saved in america is earned by individuals and businesses whose interest and dividends income exceed the 200 400 limit earlier this year i introduced a bill h r 3049 to remedy this situation my legislation would make permanent the current 200 400 tax exclusion on interest and dividends and raise it to 1 000 2 000 for savings interest only in addition my bill would allow all persons age 65 and over to earn taxfree interest on their savings deposits the conablehance substitute offers similar relief aimed at providing a shortterm and much needed boost to our slumping savings and loan and thrift industry under the terms of this legislation depository institutions would be authorized to issue 1year taxexempt savings certificates they would allow single taxpayers to earn as much as 1 000 2 000 for couplesin taxfree interest the certificates which would cost 500 and above would yield 70 percent of the interest rate on 52week treasury bills and would be available for a 15month period beginning on october 1 the certificate would allow depository institutions to retain and attract many of the investment dollars that have recently gone to competing investment opportunities that currently offer higher returns i might add that these pavings certificates are far more prefprable than a proposal that has been offered to lower the returns on competing money market funds rather than penalizing the small saver by eliminating one of their few opportunities to get a fair market return on his or her dollar additional investment opportunities should be made available the taxexempt savings certificates provide such an opportunity as an original member of the house select aging committee i would like to emphasize however that these taxexempt savings certificates are not the final solution to our nations dismal savings rate especially as it relates to the elderly first the certificates would only be offered for a 15month period allowing the troubled depository institutions to revitalize thermselves over a 2year period but falling to provide any longterm relief for either the institutions or the saver second many senior citizens cannot afford to tie up 500 or more of their savings for a 1year period they depend heavily on their savings to pay for daily living expenses including emergency medical needs under the proposed certificate plan a person would receive stiff interest penalties for withdrawing funds early i favor a more flexible savings incentive plan that would incorporate the taxexempt savings certificate idea with the bill i authored providing acrosstheboard taxfree interest for senior citizens unfortunately i am restricted by the rule from offering such a compromise proposal in the form of an amendment as a result i am supporting the taxexempt certificate plan as the most responsible plan under these circumstances and another major step toward permanent and meaningful small saver relief we must not forget however that savings interest represents nearly 25 percent of the total income for persons age 65 and over in additions twothirds of all savings accounts in the united states belong to persons 5 years and older certainly then any longterm small savers relief should address the special needs of our elderly that is why i continue to offer my bill h r 3049 as an effective solution to the savings rate problem in our nation let me finally express my support for the additional savings incentive contained in the substituteincreased retirement investment opportunities under the conablehance amendment the current 1 500 limit on individual retirement account ira contributionrq would be increased to 2 000 2 250 for couples in addition for the first time employees contributing to an employersponsored pension plan could also claim the 2 000 2 250 ira tax deduction in addition the maximum tax deductible contributions to selfemployment keogh retirement plans would double from 7 500 to 15 000 both of these retirement savings in centives are expected to attract millions of new savings dollars while allowing individuals to plan for a more financially secure retirement simply stated increased savings by americans will do as much to stimulate our economy and increase productivity as any other economic tool the

chairman of the committee it will correct a shortcoming in the secretarys authority pertaining to longterm leases of community facilities financed under the loan programs of the farmers home administration no express authority exists in present law to allow the secretary to approve longterm lease agreements between recipients of farmers home administration loans and third parties my amendment simply extends this authority to the secretary with the restriction that it can only be exercised when necessary to assure the continuation of services for which the financing was originally extended to the qualifying lessor to illustrate the anomaly that results from the lack of this authority i bring to the attention of my colleagues a situation that has arisen in my district the boronda water district is the recipient of a farmers home administration loan which was made for the purpose of digging wells and constructing facilities to extend potable water services to some 260 accounts in the rural boronda area located near the incorporated town of salinas calif since the completion of this pro ject a combination of factors including seepage inadequate construction and inexperienced management have led to well water contamination periodically necessitating reductions and temporary termination of water servlees the boronda water district recognizing its inability to carry out its maintenance and management duties and unable to generate additional funds necessary for capital improvements negotiated a longterm lease agreement with the california water co a privately owned utility which services the neighboring city of salinas and is regulated by the california state public utilities commission the lease agreement would extend over the lifetime of the farmers home administration loan and provides that lessee water company will make periodic payments sufficient to meet the lessor boronda water districts loan repayment schedule in addition the lessee water company in a public minded gesture has offered to perform the necessary canital construction to repair existing wells and facilities to dig a new well to insure a reliable supply of potable water to the residents of the boronda area under present law however the farmers home administration does not have the authority to approve such a longterm lease agreement the farmers home administration has indicated that the law does permit it to approve a shortterm lease agreement and to consider periodic renewal of such a lease it has also indicated that it would consider such an arrangement in this particular situation the catch 22 however arises from the fact that the california water co is a private utility regulated by the california state public utilities commission the commissions rules provide that no utility can impose an unfair burden upon one segment of its customers the capital construction costs arising from the necessary repairs to the boronda system must be born by all the users of the system over the useful life of the facility a shortterm lease subject to termination by the federal farmers home administration would place the california water company in violation of the state public utilities laws in that if termination of the lease were to occur the rest of california water companys customers would unfairly shoulder the burden of paying for the cost of the repair of borondas facilities the solution to this terrible dilemma is the adoption of my amendment it would permit the secretary to approve such longterm lease agreements despite other restrictions on the program provided that such an agreement is necessary to insure the continuation of the services for which the loan was extended my staff has discussed this matter extensively with committee counsel and the department i am assured that adoption of this measure will remove the legal obstacle to the secretarys approval of the longterm lease agreement between boronda water district

incentive to innfficiency in government in recent times the private sector and indeed the government have become increasingly aware of the time value of money todays high interest rates have deepened our understanding of the axiom that money too has its price the irs for example raised the rate of interest due on delinquent taxes to 20 percent this year likewise the house govern ment operations committee is considering the cost of money in its recent reporting of a bill requiring that interest be paid to private businesses the government owes money under contracts for goods and services the full senate has already passed a similar bill it is noteworthy then that literally millions of dollars are being snatched yearly from the pockets of americansnot through taxes mr speakerbut because the government owes them money and the debt is overdue the particular program our bill deals with is authorized by the federal employees compensation aft feca its benefits are analogous to those provided under workers compensation programs administered by the states for employees injured in the private sector the federal program however is supposed to protect those workers who are injured while working for the federal government the engineers forest workers lab technicians as well as administrative and clerical people who report to work for uncle sam every day the labor standards subcommittee has found however that the benefits which are supposed to protect these workers from economic loss as a result of federal onthejob injuries are often delayed for months and even years leaving the claimant strappedsometimes financially ruined under the federal program not 1 penny of interest is paid to the claimant on accumulated benefits even if they represent years of delay in processing and thousands of dollars it makes no difference if the claimant has to borrow money at todays high rates to survive in connection with the subcommittees hearings we found that fr6m june 30 1981 to july 1 1982 the office of workers compensation programs which administers the federal comp program made 2 820 individualpayments in the range of 5 000 to 10 000 during that time the office made 1 196 payments in the range of 10 000 to 20 000 and 600 payments of 20 000 or more since lumpsum payments under the program are very rare these sizable accumulated payments are an indication that too many claimants are waiting months and months for the money to which they are entitled if interest hid been paid on these amounts at a flat annual 20percent ratethe rate the irs charges delinquent taxpayersit would have ranged from some 6 to 7 million our bill which we hope will be incorporated into the amendments to the federal employees compensation act being considered by the subcommittee would do the following first require that any approved payment to a feca claimant which is delayed for more than 6 months will bear the same rate of interest irs charges for delinquent taxes second provide that this interest be paid on a 5050 shared basis by the office of workers compensation and the claimants employing agencyboth of which have major roles in the claims process third provide that the claimant would be entitled to the interest unless the delay in payment was the result of the claimants failure to respond to a request for information or required medical examination within 45 days of the request several of the state laws regulating private sector compensation require interest or penalties for delayed payments so our proposal is not without precadent a further point is that a federal comp claimant only has recourse through the feca program he or she cannot go lo court to obtain a compensation benefit or settlement with or withour interest the law does not allow court review or review by other officials of claims denied by the secretary of labor the inefficiency of the feca program then is a primary concern since there is no further means under the law for a claimant to obtain benefits the present administration came into office agreeing with the people of this country that something must be done to improve cumbersome ineffi cient government programs to shift this responsibility to the rightful beneficiaries of a program by making it harsher and less responsive to their needs as the administration has proposed in its amendments to feca ignores the

a key role in strengthening our relationships with the some 100 nations of the developing world provides needed support for the unitedstates business community in the highly competitive international marketplace generates growth and new jobs in the domestic economy and does these things without using the taxpayers money the reagan administration is committed to the encouragement of private sector enterprise as the most effective means for fostering continuing economic growth and selfsufficiency in the nations of the developing world at the same time the administration is well aware that increased unitedstates private investment abroad will be a critical factor in sustaining our own economic growth traditionally the major source of capital for support of badly needed economic and social programs in the developing countries has been governmenttogovernment assistance or concesslonal aid but the need to combat inflation and to reinvigorate industrialized economies has led to severe cutbacks not only in the united states but in other countries as well and this decline comes at a time when the needs of the third world are accelerating the hard fact of the matter is that their needs today are far in excess of capacity of public assistance programs and thus there is a widening development gapg which must be filled the most immediate and practical solution is the encouragement of more private sector investment and virtually all of the friendly developing countries are actively seeking unitedstates investment foreign investment is not a oneway street obviously host countries can derive many benefits from the infusion of foreign capital which creates new jobs brings with it management expertise and training generates tax revenues and helps people to help themselves but it is also true that the type of investment supported by the opic political risk insurance and 11nance programs contributes to our own growth by providing access to new markets for goods and services creating job opportunities and making positive contribution to our balance of payments in short eveyone can come up a winner in spite of all this there are those who contend that all unitedstates companies investing abroad are suspect and that they are exporting jobs reducing our export capacity and neglecting the need for domestic growth certainly there have been cases in which unitedstates companies have sought out cheap labor but i would point out that opic maintains a rigid screening process and provides support only for the kind of enterprise that will help the host country and return positive benefit to our own economny in fact the job export theory has been largely refuted in a series of nine studies made by business international inc an independent research publishing and advisory organization based in new york city which recently published the effects of unitedstates corporate foreign investment 107079 this study involved 104 unitedstates companies with combined worldwide sales of 459 billion of which 202 billion were made to overseas customers in 1979 they accounted for 28 billion in unitedstates exports and their gross worldwide investment at the end of 1979 was 240 billion of which 70 percent was in the united states perhaps the most significant fact of all revealed by a study of unitedstates manufacturing employment during the period 197079 showed that the coinpanies in the study increased their domestic payrolls by 27 8 percent while unitedstates manufacturers as a whole increased by 4 4 percent the gross trade surplus for the manufacturing companies included in the sample rose from 5 5 billion in 1970 to 18 4 billion in highlighting the positive impact of private investment abroad and opics role in unitedstates
