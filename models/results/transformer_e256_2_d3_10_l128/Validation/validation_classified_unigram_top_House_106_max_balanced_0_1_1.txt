the budget for giving us this opportunity to face americans and define for them what kind of country we would like to be i had the pleasure of organizing the congressional childrens caucus a group of about 60 members who have committed to promoting children first in the national agenda we look forward to hearing from mrs tipper gore the wife of the vice president on the mdrch 25 1999 issues of mental health services for children keeping that in mind i am very concerned with the budget as proposed by the majority leadership because our children must face the challenges of competing in a global environment and the new millennium we have got to invest in children this budget does not children cannot learn if they are hungry tired and improperly prepared the majoritys budget proposal reduces domestic spending in programs aimed at protecting the interests of children allow me to call the roll a program of which many members of this house have testified that they graduated from head start is being cut 501 million a 10 percent cut the wic program that provides for women infants and children being cut 425 million job corps which has allowed many inner city and rural community youth to find an opportunity out of the seat of degradation cut 141 million child care there is not a time that i go home to my district when women and men parents who say give me the ability to work provide child care and help me provide child care for my children sometimes onethird of their income 119 million the summer youth program where a mother gave me the good news of her young person who had graduated through the summer youth program now gainfully employed cutsome 109 million community services block cut 54 million runaway and homeless youth which i confront all the time in our community cut 4 7 million native american head start cut 3 8 million child abuse 2 2 million abandoned infants assistance 1 3 million i can only say oppose this majority leadership budget realize that our children are our best investment let us support the democratic alternative and invest in our children i rise in opposition to fy 2000 budget resolution offered by the majoritys leadership i come in the spirit of hershey and bipartisanism i come to request a budget that protects the social security trust fund for americas citizens i rise to request a budget thact will protect the medicare trust fund we must authorize a budget that will protect the social security trust fund while women tend to collect benefits over a longer period than men because of a greater life expectancy women on average receive lower monthly social security benefits since they have lower earnings and are more likely to be widowed or unmarried in retirement the majoritys budget proposal does not protect women or children or the social security trust fund under this budget proposalprograms directed toward improving the quality of life for women and children are the first programs to be reduced and cut in order to give a tax break to the wealthy the majority is suggesting that their budget proposal will save 100 of the social security surplus but 0 of that money goes to the social security trust fund and 0 goes towards strengthening medicare this simply is not true domestic programs are not a priority in this budget resolution offered by the majority we must authorize a budget that will appropriate financial resources to reduce the average classroom size to promote a learning environment and to modernize public schools educating americas children should be our number one priority our children must be prepared to face the challenges of competing in a global environment and the new millenium children can not learn if they are hungry tired and improperly prepared the majoritys budget proposal reduces domestic spending and programs aimed at protecting the interest of our children 425 1 million would be slashed from the wic budget head start would becut by approximately 501 4 million ard liheap funding would be reduced by 109 million nevertheless the majoritys budget resolution reserves 800 billion for tax cuts we must authorize a budget that will protect and extend the medicare trust fund this budget must ensure that patients will have access to high quality healthcare by guaranteeing important protections such as access to the specialists coverage for emergency medical services and affording prescriptions for seniors the majoritys budget proposal leaves the medicare trust fund in a precarious position and its future in question the congressional budget

improvement of the human rights these last couple weeks i am not so sure during the weeks approaching the vote for permanent normal trade relations for the peoples republic of china corporate ceos flocked to the hill to lobby for increase unrestricted trade with china they talk about access to 1 2 billion potential consumers in china what they do not say is that their real interest is in 1 2 billion chinese workers workers whom they pay wage on the level of slave labor these ceos will tell us increase trade with china will allow human rights to improve democracy will flourish with increased free trade as we engage with china but as these ceos speak their companies systematically violate the most fundamental of human and worker rights in the new report made in china the role of unitedstates companies in denying human and worker rights released by charles kernaghan and the national labor committee we see evidence of american corporations exploiting the horrible conditions of human rights in the peoples republic of china companies such as huffy and nike and walmart are contracting with chinese sweatshops to export to the united states often with the assistance of repressive and corrupt local government authorities 1 800 huffy bicycle workers have lost their jobs in ohio as huffy shut down its last three remaining unitedstates plants over the last 17 months in july of 1998 huffy fired 850 workers from its celina ohio plant where workers earned 17 an hour huffy now outsources all of its production to developing nations such as china where laborers are forced to work 15 hours a day 7 days a week and earn an average of 33 cents an hour less than 2 percent of what ohio huffy bicycle workers earned walmart makes its line of kathie lee gifford handbags in china there are a thousand workers at the factory where they put in 14hour shifts 7 days a week 29 or 30 days a month one off day per month the average wage of the factory is 3 cents an hour workers live in factory dormitories housed 16 in a room their id documents have been confiscated they are allowed to leave the factory only for one and a half hours a day for half of all factory workers rent for the dormitory exceeds their wages workers earn nothing at all and in many cases owe the company money these people are indentured servants to kathie lee and to walmart some would simply call it slavery the findings in charles kernaghans report illustrates why democratic countries in the developing world are losing ground to more authoritarian countries in the developing world democratic nations such as india are losing out to more totalitarian governments such as china democratic nations such as taiwan are losing out to more authoritarian governments such as indonesia where people are not free and workers do as their told the share of developing country exports to the unitedstates from democratic nations fell from 53 percent 10 years ago to 35 percent today corporate america wants to do business with countries with docile workforces that earn belowpoverty wages and are not allowed to organize to bargain collectively in manufactured goods developing democracies share of developing country exports fell 21 percent from 56 to 35 percent corporations are relocating their manuficturing bases to more authoritarian regimes from democratic countries where workers do not talk back for fear of being punished western corporations want to invest in countries that have poor environmental standards no worker benefits belowpoverty wages no opportunities to bargain collectively and worse as developing countries make progress toward democracy as they increase worker rights and create regulations to protect the environment the american business community punishes them by pulling its trade and investment from developing democratic countries to totalitarian governments and developing countries decisions about the chinese economy are made by three groups the chinese communist party the peoples liberation army which owns many of the export factories and western investors which of these three want to empower workers does the chinese communist worker want the chinese people to enjoy human rights i do not think so does the peoples liberation army want to close the labor camps i do not think so do western investors want chinese workers to make better wages have more democracy and bargain collectively i do not think so none of these groups has any interest in changing the status quo in china i repeat none of these groups western investors the chinese communist party the peoples liberation army none of these has any interest in changing the current situation in china all three profit too much from the status quo to want to see human rights and labor rights improve in china unitedstates trade law forbids the trade of any products of slave labor forced labor the 1992 bilateral agreement between the unitedstates and china prohibited the trade of goods manufactured by imprisoned workers congress needs to know more about working conditions in chinese factories before we vote on permanent mfn for china american people need to know more about how our major corporations are behaving outside the borders of the united states before we vote on permanent mfn for china based on evidence released into the kernaghan report many of us in the congress call on the department of labor and the department of treasury to conduct an extensive investigation into the working conditions and factories in china which are owned by american

like anything is possible unfortunately they with the new surplus and the new millennium it looks like anything is possible unfortunately they are in for a huge disappointment last weeks unveiling of my republican colleagues new budget proved to be more of the same all bad ideas despite predictions of medicare and social security catastrophes looming on the horizon the republican budget does nothing to extend the life of either social security or medicare for even one day but it still manages to siphon 775 billion into tax cuts for the richest americans instead of investing in education health care to prepare this country for the next century like nero the republican budget fiddles while social security and medicare burn the chief actuary of the social security administration has said this budget will have virtually no effect on the date that social security becomes insolvent it will just make sure that it goes broke on schedule that is not me speaking that is the chief actuary of the social security administration in contrast the democratic budget has a lock box which will protect social security until the year 2050 and protect medicare until the year 2020 my republican colleagues propose a plan that is less secure than the democrats and treasury secretary rubin recommended that the president of the united states veto it because in reality the republican lock box is more of an open till the differences do not stop there the democratic budget reduces the debt more than the republican budget every year that it is in effect the democratic budget provides 40 billion more for veterans health care over the next 10 years than the republican budget we made our veterans a promise we must keep that promise americas fighting men and women risk their lives for this country they deserve the very best health care the best services we can give them but my republican colleagues will not allow a vote will not even allow a vote on the clement veterans amendment the democratic budget provides more for defense spending over the long run than the republican budget because in the later years my republican colleagues had to choose between defense spending and tax cuts what do my colleagues think mr speaker they chose the tax cuts meanwhile the democratic budget still manages to provide some balanced tax cuts and keep our economy from slipping back into deficit the republican budget on the other hand will create a whole new deficit by the year 2014 the democratic budget does more to reduce class size and modernize our schools than the republican budget which will cut spending for head start cut spending for pell grants and cut money for work study the democratic budget protects important programs like wic which the republican budget cuts by so much that 1 2 million women infants and children will lose their benefits next year 16 400 of them live in my home state of massachusetts the wic program provides essential nutrition and education during the early years of the childrens development in order to make sure that they start school ready to learn if we do not give them good nutrition when they are very young we lose our chance forever some of my democratic colleagues tried to make sure that we got that chance but this rule does not make in order the defazio amendment on the progressive budget the clement amendment on the veterans budget or the mink amendment on education this rule does make in order the shadeggcoburn amendment which some people are equating with president clintons budget they say it reflects some cbo comparison i want to make something perfectly clear the shadeggcoburn amendment looks as much like president clintons budget as i look like gwyneth paltrow looking at this budget we would think that my republican colleagues have very sharp memories when it comes to bad habits that gave us the budget deficits in the 1980s and the tripling of our national debt now that our budget finally is in the black we should be very very careful about repeating those mistakes so i urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question if the previous question is defeated we will make in order the clement amendment to take care of our american veterans our veterans deserve every bit of care we can give them this country made them a promise this country should live up to that promise yesterdays unitedstatesa today

congressional action the american people expect us all to work together in a spirit of cooperation and bipartisan so that we can renew national confidence for a strong and unifled america it is now time to set aside the differences that have divided us along party lines and work together for the good of the country yesterday we commemorated george washingtons birthday an everlasting model of leadership and achievement 200 years ago as our first president ably led the united states from revolution into democracy today there are many issues that claim congressional attention for immediate action including specific improvements for social security education greater access to health care employment taxes the environment and economic opportunity and prosperity our nation faces many challenges on the eve of the millennium but inherent in those challenges are a great many opportunities our nation has flourished during this decade and right now as we face the new millennium the most appropriate message we can provide to all americans is to express our commitment to the fundamental values of our democracy as new initiatives to benefit american citizens immigrants and the children of undocumented immigrants in the country are developed and implemented i do not see the same concern for the 3 8 million united states citizens in puerto rico the americans in the island continue to be neglected and discriminated against by being barred from equitable participation in the most fundamental rights of citizenship the right to vote and the right to representation not to mention participation in the safety net programs that provide basic relief to the neediest in the nation the disadvantaged the aged the handicapped and the children it is distressing to behold that by virtue of living in a territory some american citizens do not have the same rights and benefits as all other americans in the nation why are citizens in the territories denied what all other citizens are guaranteed are there two different kinds of citizenship in our nation the example of democracy what is even more discouraging is that not only the great expectations for future success and equal participation do not apply to puerto ricans in the islands but that residents in the island will continue to lag further and further behind as they are fenced out from the rest of the nation throughout my political life i have fought to provide equality for the united states citizens in puerto rico and i wonder how our nation can continue to maintain separate but equal policies similar to the discriminatory policies that were the force that brought about the enactment of the civil rights act of 1964 i am compelled to provide a voice for the thousands of low income disadvantaged the handicapped elderly and children who are deprived of the most basic safety net programs that all other americans and immigrants can participate in the 50 states of the union it is terrible to consider that our nations commitment to equality in health does not extend to the american citizens in puerto rico or in guam or in the virgin islands and thus deprives us of the necessary medical care that may prove the difference between life and death by virtue of the fact that we reside in a territory health discrimination is an abomination this includes medicaid for which puerto rico contrary to the policy for all other states receives a block grant capped this year at 171 5 million i am also talking about our exclusion from supplemental security income the supplemental income that ensures blind disadvantaged and handicapped individuals have income protection i am also talking about medicare and how reimbursement for providers has been set at a lower rate despite the fact that costs are comparable to the provision of services in many states unfortunately as the nation benefits from the tremendous budget surplus the americans in the territory will also be excluded from many of the most significant policy initiatives presented this session the 500 billion social security enhancement proposed by the universal savings accounts commonly referred to as the usa accounts will not apply to the citizens in the island even though we contribute to social security equally as all other citizens what is more money from our contributions to the social security funds will be used to manage and administer the program which will be denied to us but this initiative is just one of the many new proposals that will not apply to the nearly 4 million unitedstates citizens in puerto rico many other proposals ranging from welfare to work to building new schools to providing incentives to workers and even the empowerment zones and the new market initiatives that aim to simulate the economic will bypass us in the next century we will not have the opportunity to contribute to the wellbeing of the economy nor participate in the tax credits that are being proposed i feel compelled to bring these matters to your attention and to the attention of all my colleagues in congress because our nation must do something to ensure that the american citizens in puerto rico are equal americans how can our nation stand as a model for the world when it maintains a policy of discrimination a policy of economic and political apartheid for 100 years we have stood shoulder to shoulder as we have defended freedom and democratic values wherever and whenever it has been needed in the world as we enter the millennium we should not be pushed behind our fellow citizens in the 50 states

evenings address few have done as much to express the frustration that we are feeling on this side of the aisle as the gentleman from new jersey has so readily done on a weekly and daily basis here in the house i rise today to express my outrage and my disappointment as a freshman member of this house with the actions or should i say the inaction of this body we are more than twothirds of the way through this session and the republicanled congress has had no major accomplishments this is despite the efforts from within their own party and by democrats working together to pass meaningful hmo reform school construction legislation and even a minimum wage bill instead the republican leadership has been playing games with the budget giving tax cuts to the wealthiest 1 percent of the people in this country and their special interest friends blocking meaningful attempts at gun safety legislation and taking money away from class size reduction and new teacher initiatives as a freshman i arrived last january prepared for action and believed that with gop promises of less partisanship that we could all work together to help the american people yet the last 10 months have been partisan and without any intelligible agenda instead the special interests and their whims have dominated leaving the american people out in the cold rather than passing a meaningful tax bill complete with estate tax and marriage penalty changes and modest tax cuts the republican leadership pushed through a tax package thatbenefited only the wealthy and corporate special interests almost 1 trillion to the wealthiest in this country in fact if you are not in the top 1 percent of wage earners the tax cuts would not mean anything to you or very very little now maybe all the constituents in republican districts make that kind of money but the working class people in districts like mine do not why not provide a family of four living in a place like new york city a high cost place like new york city in the bronx in queens in my district earning 40 000 annually some tax relief what is wrong with that well it is probably because they will not be contributing to the republican leaderships political action committee this year or next year what about our patients bill of rights we finally voted today on a motion to go to conference on the bipartisan patients bill of rights it has been 4 weeks since the house passed by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 275 to 151 the norwooddingell bill the senate appointed conferees back on october 15 and yet it is only today november 2 that the house gop leadership is finally bringing up a motion to go to conference as far as i can see this delay strategy by the gop leadership is their attempt to stop the momentum that was obtained by very strong bipartisan vote in favor of the norwooddingell hmo reform bill why are we stopping what members of your party want what the american people overwhelmingly want why are we stopping it we cannot even get on the runway or get off the charts a prescription drug bill to reduce the cost of prescription drugs to our senior population let me tell you a story that i heard recently i received a letter from two constituents mr and mrs done and gertrude schwartz of long island city in queens he is 89 and she is 84 years of age recently he went to have a prescription filled for his wife he bought 100 tablets of prilosec an extremely popular drug among our seniors it cost him 394 89 394 for 100 tablets of a vitally needed prescription people are making life and death decisions as to whether they will pay the rent buy needed groceries or skip a day of taking a needed prescription drug or simply not buying the prescription drug at all and we are here in congress doing nothing as far as i can see to help them then there is the budget debacle we are 34 days into a new fiscal year and still we do not have a budget what is the republican solution to send the exact same d c appropriations bill that we have seen vetoed twice to the floor again today without removing the riders that caused the vetoes in the first place it makes absolutely no sense to me the republican leadership did not even bring to the floor the laborhhs appropriations bill for a debate they went straight to conference without any democrats represented at all at any point in time but having said all i have said it is education that is most troubling to me we passed ed flex which impacts the elementary and secondary education act before we even considered esea reauthorization then the republican breakup of esea into pieces passing the flawed teacher empowerment act and i want you to know this was not supported by one not one teachers organization we just passed a dramatically underfunded title i bill when crafting tax packages the republican majority will not even consider adding school construction assistance even though our deteriorating school infrastructure and classroom overcrowding is a national crisis then we have social security republicans say they want to save social security well we will just go back to history a little bit here back in 1935 in the early thirties nearly 40 percent of americans were dying in poverty it was a democraticled congress and a democratic president who signed into law the current social security system this despite fierce opposition from the republican party in fact all but one republican in the house voted for a motion to recommit title ii of the bill to conference and would have thereby struck the social security act and killed social security as we know it today only one republican in that entire conference now we are to expect that the republicans are going to protect and save social security something they never wanted in the first place in fact let me just show you some of the comments made by majority leader dic armey when he ran for congress proposing to abolish the social security system ultraconservative economics professor dick armey who has based his campaign on his support for the abolishment of social security the federal minimum wage law the corporate income tax and the federal aid to education that is from united press international october 31 1984 again we see mr armey in 1984 said that social security was a bad retirement and a rotten trick on the american people he continued i think we are going to have to bite the bullet on social security and phase it out over a period of time see that is the republican side of this issue they never wanted it in the first place i do not see how we can expect them to save it the american people do not want this they do not want a partisan congress living up to its donothing billing i urge you to work with the president and the democratic leadership to craft budget bills we can all support i implore you to let the majority rule and move the bipartisan norwooddingell bill on to the president unchanged finally i want to invite you to come to my district and tell the students that are being taught in closets in hallways tell the children in kindergarten classes with 60 kids and two teachers tell those children going to school in buildings that arestill burning coal that they do not need to have school modernization provisions added to any tax bill now i know there are very decent people on the republican side of the aisle i have had the pleasure to work with so many of them in this my first term in congress and i can call many of them my friends but i am not giving up on the rest of you either but we need to work together we need to end the

"i do not know what it will take for my colleagues on both sides of the house to acknowledge as i said earlier this morning that more than 83 percent of the american people are asking us to vote for a freestanding upstanding hmo reform bill today and i think one of those is little steve olson a 2yearold who went hiking with his parents as he was hiking he fell ill went to an emergency room and was treated for meningitis but the little boy still experienced pain could not express himself they went back to that emergency room but they could not get any more care they could not get him to do a brain scan because the hmo denied it and now this little boy because he had a lump on his brain has cerebral palsy the american people are asking us to stop the parliamentary maneuvers that would not allow us to have a freestanding bill on managed care access to emergency rooms the sanctity of the physicianpatient relationship and the american people are asking us to deal with the uninsured in a separate manner because there are working poer who cannot pay for their insurance and this bill does not do it the american people have asked us to have an amendment on 7 billion to ensure that we pay for this i just conclude by saying my colleagues let us join together and get a real hmo reform bill the dingellnorwood bill i rise to strongly oppose the rule for todays managed care bills the rule is a sham and seeks to undermine these two vital health bills instead of providing a fair and open rule for considering the patients bill of rights the majority has written an unreasonable rule that combines the managed care bill with a measure riddled with special interest poison pills designed to kill the measure this rule guarantees that we will not be able to offset any potential revenue losses from the measure and we will not be able to establish the health care services that we hoped to provide for the citizens of this country the majority has shown a grave error in judgment by including special interest provisions in the managed care bill this act is fiscally irresponsible because no funding is provided for these provisions worse yet this rule denies a bipartisan group of members from offering an amendment to pay for this bill because the access bill and managed care bill are combined in one rule managed care reform may be defeated through parliamentary maneuvering this is untenable merging these bills into one rule is unacceptable because it combines a bill that helps those who need health care h r 2723 with a bill h r 2990 that simply helps the nations most healthy and wealthy and not the uninsured we must separate these two bills so we can ensure that h r 2723 provides new patient protections sets nationwide standards for health insurance and expands medical liability these issues are vitally important to all of the american people not just the privileged yet these bills these once glimmering symbols of managed care reform that sought to stretch their healing arms around each of our citizens have now been twisted and manipulated into one hideous unrecognizable heap of special interest slag in particular poison pill amendments have been offered to the bipartisan consensus managed care improvement act of 1999 the boehner amendment benefits the healthy and wealth instead of the uninsured those who need the most help the gosscoburn amendment weakens patient protections cap noneconomic damages and guts enforcement provisions the houghtongraham amendment provides far too weak federal remedies and internal reveiw procedures an open rule would allow us to correct these problems but by providing only one rule for both hmo bills we prevent ourselves from doing any good today do we want to tell the american public that it will not receive the managed care reform it has so desperately sought because of a procedural bar the sobering truth is that our citizens need health care reformespecially those living in poverty over onethird of the unitedstates population was living in or near poverty in 1996 the majority of africanamerican 55 percent and persons of hispanic origin 60 percent lived in families classified as poor or near poor in the southern portions of the united states the poverty rate is 15 percent my home state of texas had poverty rate over 16 percent of those suffering from poverty 44 1 percent are uninsured 44 4 percent of africanamericans in poverty are uninsured and 58 7 percent of hispanics in poverty are uninsured these numbers are sobering and we must do something about them people living in poverty and many minority citizens simply cannot afford health insurance and in tum cannot obtain quality health care their lack of access to quality health care has devastating effects because many minority groups and people living in poverty are particularly susceptible to health problems racial and ethnic minorities constitute approximately 25 percent of the total unitedstates population yet they account for nearly 54 percent of all aids cases for men and women combined blacks have a cancer death rate about 35 percent higher than that for whites the ageadjusted death rate for coronary heart disease for the total population declined by 20 percent from 1987 to 1995 for blacks the overall decrease was only 13 percent the bipartisan consensus managed care improvement act of 1999 is also important due to the reforms it provides because even when people do have insurance quality health care is not guaranteed take for instance steven olsona once healthy thriving twoyear old child after falling on a stick while hiking with his parents twoyearold steven was rushed to the emergency room where he was treated his mother returned him a week later because he was in great pain he was treated for meningitis and sent home steven continued to complain about pain but despite his parents protest the hmo doctors refused to perform a brain scan even though it was a covered benefit steven eventually fell into a coma due to a brain abscess that herniated he now has cerebral palsy an 800 brain scan would have prevented this tragedy in an even more tragic case a woman attempted to switch doctors when it became clear that her original doctor would not fully examine a growing and discolored mole on her ankle paperwork and bureaucracy resulted in a sixmonth wait once the woman finally visited a seconddoctor she was immediately sent to a dermatologist who determined that the mole was a malignant melanoma the woman died one year later both sides of the aisle should be working together to ensure that these stories never surface ever again yet this rule encourages special interest gutting of the bill and negates any amendment that would provide the necessary 7 billion in offsets for revenue losses estimated to result from increased deductions for higher medical premiums over 200 organizations support the bipartisan consensus managed care improvement act of 1999 including aids action the american academy of pediatrics the american heart association the american medical association and the national association of public hospitals but these organizations cannot support the bill as offered the special interest additions and weakened bill language undermine the goals of these groups without an open rule that would allow us to correct these problems we will essentially slam the door on the very groups who can provide us with the greatest support and resources this rule does not penalize the minority side it penalizes the very people we representthe american taxpayers we need an open rule that will permit the enactment of effective managed care reform i urge my colleagues to vote no against this unfair rule and against this distorted version of

last year the republicans tried to enact their tax cut agenda at a cost of 929 billion over 10 years this sweeping bill failed because it was obvious that such a large package shoved aside all other priorities and put the nations fiscal health in jeopardy this year republicans have devised a more clever political strategy of breaking up their tax agenda allowing them to focus attention on the same attractions of each part of their agenda while obscuring the total cost but the cost is the same so far this year republicans have pushed through tax cuts that would eat up 739 billion of the budget surpluses when you add this to other tax cuts and spending increases they vow to bring up the republicans will have spent 88 billion more than is available once social security and medicare are protected today congress is on its way to invading medicare as well while we are currently in an era of surpluses we must not forget that medicares fiscal future is troubled according to the most recent trustees report part a will begin running cash deficits again by 2010 totaling neariy 7 trillion by 2040 despite these looming deficits the republicans have introduced yet another tax cut that robs the medicare program of roughly 100 billion in dedicated revenues over the next ten years and 464 billion through 2024 the social security benefits tax relief act repeals a portion of the tax on social security benefits thereby eliminating a dedicated source of revenues to the medicare trust fund without this income medicare part a will go into the red again five years earlier than under current law the result will be a significant threat to the viability of the medicare program for future generations and an even greater squeeze on hospitals and other health care providers dependent upon medicare payments h r 4865 purports to replace the lost revenue to the medicare trust fund from the projected onbudget surplus however while the revenue loss to the medicare trust fund is guaranteed the budget surplus exists only in projections and faces many other competing demands furthermore the revenue loss to the medicare trust fund would be permanent while the projected budget surpluses are temporary once the projected surpluses run out the medicare trust fund will be left with a large hole unless a future congress is willing to raise taxes or cut other programs perhaps most egregious like other republican tax cuts h r 4865 only benefits the wealthiest americans the national council of senior citizens calls h r 4865 an irresponsible political gesture to upper income persons which will have severe consequences for the social security system and the solvency of the medicare part a trust fund the massive amount of general revenues that would be consumed by this bill will leave fewer resources extending the solvency of the medicare program and creating a medicare prescription drug benefit the democratic substitute amendment on the other hand provides the same tax relief as the republican bill but offers it to more seniors at about half the cost whereas the republican bill only benefits the wealthiest 20 percent of social security recipients the democratic substitute would provide tax relief to 95 percent of seniors rather than eliminating the tax for all seniors the democratic substitute keeps the tax in place for only the very wealthiestsingles earning more than 80 000 and couples earning more than 100 000 a year the democratic substitute is also more fiscally responsible unlike the republican bill the democratic substitute protects social security and medicare by conditioning the tax cut on a certification from the secretary of the treasury that the onbudget surplus is sufficient to replenish the lost tax revenue thus it cant go into effect in years in which there is not enough of an onbudget surplus to replace lost revenues we are at a historic fork in the road if we continue down the path of irresponsible tax cuts for the wealthy there will be nothing left for shoring up medicare and social security enacting a medicare prescription drug benefit or paying down the public debt i urge my colleagues to vote yes on the democratic substitute and no on the underlying bill congress must reverse its course and get back on the road to fiscal discipline"], [0.0019848004449158907, 0.0019848004449158907, 0, "over the last several years we have asked a pretty fundamental question and that is is it right is it fair under our tax code a married working couple where both the husband and wife are both in the workforce a married working couple with a twoincome household pay higher taxes under our tax code than an identical couple with identical income who choose to live together outside of marriage is it right is it fair is it fair that under our tax code that 25 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married of course not the goal of this legislation i am proud to say is to wipe out the marriage tax penalty almost entirely for 25 million married working couples i think it is pretty fiscally responsible to take onehalf of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus to eliminate the marriage tax penalty to listen to my friends on the other side of the aisle you think we would be breaking their piggy bank to take onehalf of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus to help 25 million married working couples who pay higher taxes jut because they are married i for one and i am pleased to say that 222 republicans and we were joined by 48 democrats who broke with their leadership who believe it is time to eliminate the narriage tax penalty that this house has voted to send to the senate today we are voting on theagreement between the house and the senate we hope the president will join with us to eliminate the marriage tax penalty let me introduce a couple of constituents from the south suburbs of chicago which i represent shad and michelle hallihan they are public school teachers shad is at joliet high school and michelle is at manhattan junior high school their combined incomes are about 62 000 they pay just around 1 000 in marriage tax penalty just because they are married under our tax code now this photo was taken when they were married it was about the time we introduced our legislation about 2 years ago since then shad and michelle have had a little boy little ben and little ben of course is this little guy we hope some day he does not have to pay the marriage tax penalty our hope is for his parents we can eliminate it this year i would point out under this legislation we provide middleclass tax relief for middleclass couples like shad and michelle hallihan this year because our legislation is effective january 1 of 2000 so if the president would join with us to eliminate the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working couples shad and michelle hallihan would see their marriage tax penalty eliminated this year now under our legislation we do several things we double the standard deduction for those who do not itemize to 8 800 twice that for single filers we also widen the 15 percent bracket to help those who do itemize shad and michelle hallihan are also homeowners and because they are homeowners they itemize their taxes and the only way to help people middleclass families who own a home or give to church or charity or their synagogue is to widen the 15 percent bracket so that they too can receive marriage tax relief under our proposal we eliminate the marriage tax penalty suffered by shad and michelle hallihan think about it in joliet illinois the marriage tax penalty of 1 400 the average marriage tax penalty is one years tuition at our local community college it is 3 months of day care for little ben at a local child care center in joliet it is 3 000 diapers for little ben but it is also if we also think about it if shad and michelle had that money that they currently pay in the marriage tax penalty were able to set it aside in an education savings account for little ben by the time ben is 18 they would have been able to set aside almost 20 000 that they currently send to uncle sam they could put in little bens college fund that is what marriage tax relief means for the hallihans now we have heard a lot of excuses from our good friends on the other side let us do just a little bit so we can say we have done something we have other priorities we want to spend it on but think about this one half of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus is being given back to middleclass working married couples like shad and michelle hallihan so they can take that marriage tax penalty that currently goes to washington gets spent on other things and use it to take care of their families needs little ben in particular so let us do the fiscally responsible thing let us help middleclass workingmarried couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty there are 25 million of them that is almost 50 million taxpayers who pay higher taxes just because they made the choice of getting married my hope is the president will join with us and sign this legislation the president joined with us when he changed his mind on irs reform he was opposed to it decided to support it he was opposed to balancing the budget now he takes credit for it he was opposed to welfare reform now he takes credit for it my hope is the president will join with us and sign the elimination of the marriage tax penalty the legislation we are going to hopefully pass today we will certainly share the credit with him because it is the right thing to do so again i urge a yes vote i invite every democrat to join with republicans let us vote to eliminate the marriage tax penalty i ask for an aye vote"],

member of the subcommittee on immigration and claims i am mostly concerned about the latino immigration fairness act lifa the phrase compassionate conservatism has very hollow meaning if you just talk the talk and not walk the walk this lifa proposal is the modern day civil rights issue of our time and just 12 days to election day the republicans are thumbing their noses at immigrants who have contributed to our society and are trying to play by the rules i say not deal to this proposal and i urge a no vote this involves amnesty for immigrants who have paid their dues and have been in this country since 1986 parity for liberians guatemanlans haitains and hondurans and restoring section 245 i which allows immigrants to adjust their illegal status pay a fee and remain in this country with their spouses and children these are reasonable proposals and the republican leadership has a blind eye for fairness for justice and equity the republican proposal to provide relief to only 400 000 immigrants who were unable to take advantage of the 1986 law for those entering the country before 1982 is unacceptable it is unacceptable because it leaves and locks too many people out this is a proposal that is thinly veiled as an open door but it really is a feeble attempt to play up to the hispanic vote during the political season the republican legislation is a piecemeal correction of the flawed implementation of the 1986 legalization program basically those individuals who sought the counsel of a specific lawyer and filed suit with him are protected while countless others are left out of those people who are covered in the flawed proposal less than 40 are expected to prevail if the gop acknowledges that the 1986 law was not implemented correctly they should try to right the wrong entirely not pick some winners and losers based on what law firm they signed up to represent them also it is important to understand that this amnesty program in fact is just a long overdue update in the registry provision of the immigration and nationality act the registry provision gives immigrants who have been here without proper documents an opportunity to adjust to permanent status if they have been here for a long enough time and have nothing in their background that would disqualify them from immigrant status the legislation would just update the cutoff date for registry which is now set at 1972 then there is juan gonzalez who has been working for a construction company in houston texas for more than 13 years recently he lost his job because he was not able to present his employer a renewed employment authorization since then his family is living a nightmare juan and his wife luisa are having problems and close to a divorce they lost their home and rented a 2bedroom apartment unfortunately their children are paying the consequences we also need to remain ever vigilant on nacara parity this would address an injustice in the provisions of the nicaraguan adjustment and central american relief act of 1997 nacara nacara currently provides qualified cubans and nicaraguans an opportunity to become lawful permanent residents of the united states the proposed legislation would extend the same benefits to eligible nationals of guatemala el salvador honduras and haiti the bill that the republicans have brought to the floor has completely left nacara parity out i say no deal and a no vote like nicaraguans and cubans many salvadorans guatemalans hondurans and haitians fled human rights abuses or unstable political and economic conditions in the 1980s and 1990s the united states has a strong foreign policy interest in providing the same treatment to these similarly situated people in addition returning migrants to these countries would place significant demands on their fragile economic and political systems like senator jack reed i have worked very hard to ensure that the 10 000 liberian nationals who have been living in the united states since the mid1980s and have significantly contributed to the american economy are not deported this legislation should also include these liberian nations if the latino immigrant fairness act is not enacted hundreds of thousands of people will be forced to abandon their homes will have to separate from their families and return to countries where they no longer have ties the inclusion of the latino immigrant fairness provisions would evidence our commitment to fair and evenhanded treatment of nations from these countriesand to the strengthening of democracy and economic stability among important neighbors the republican proposal creates a v visa for people waiting in the family backlogs but not all including us citizens this counterproposal treats the family members of some legal permanent residents better than us citizens the gop proposal leaves out us citizens applying for their children over the age of 21 ironically the gop fails to help even united states citizens seeking to reunite with their spouses and children if the spouse of the child fell out of status for six months or more in contrast the latino immigrant fairness act 245 i proposal would cover all people in the pipeline to becoming legal equally i say no deal and a no vote the republicans are failing to correct their flawed legislation of 1997 and 1998 it was the republicans who passed piecemeal programs in 1997 and 1998 for some refugees these flaws failed to correct years of uneven treatment to legitimate refugees from central america haiti and does nothing for liberian nationals it is baffling why today the republicans are now turning their backs on the lifa proposal for long time refugees that have been in the unitedstates for years worked hard and paid their taxes when a few short years ago they advanced these same proposals in conclusion there is not compassion here congress should stop trying to trade some deserving immigrant groups for others and move to help all deserving immigrants

100 percent of social security revenues and surpluses for retirement security republicans want to pay down the national debt and republicans also want to lower the tax burden for middleclass working families i believe this year as we work to lower the tax burden for middleclass families that we should focus on making our tax code simpler and making our tax code fairer to families and let me raise a series of questions today that really illustrate what i believe is the most unfair tax and that is the tax on marriage the marriage tax is not only unfair it is wrong is it right that under our tax code married working couples pay higher taxes than two single people living together outside of marriage do americans feel that it is fair that 28 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married that is right under our tax code today a husband and wife who both are in the work force pay higher taxes than two single people living together with identical incomes that is wrong let me give an example here of what it means as i pointed out earlier there are 28 million married working couples paying on average 1 400 more in higher taxes here is an example of a south chicago suburban couple i represent the south suburbs of chicago if we take a machinist who works for caterpillar in joliet and a schoolteacher in the local public schools of joliet and they have a combined income of 62 000 the machinist makes 35 500 and as a single individual when he files his taxes if we subtract the personal exemption and the standard deduction he pays a certain amount of taxes but if he chooses to marry and his schoolteacher wife with an identical income and when they are married they file their taxes jointly their combined income of 62 000 when he subtracts the standard deductions and exemptions under our current tax code this machinist and his schoolteacher wife making 62 000 a year pay the average marriage tax penalty of 1 400 now there are those particularly on that side of the aisle who believe that this is no big deal that is money that we have to spend in washington back in joliet 1 400 is 1 years tuition in joliet community college 3 months of day care in the local child care center and also several months worth of car payments the marriage tax elimination act which i am proud to say has 230 cosponsors a bipartisan majority of this house we propose to eliminate the marriage tax penalty for all americans under our legislation we double the standard deduction for joint filers to twice that for single filers we double the brackets so that those who are married filing jointly can earn exactly twice what a single filer can make and be treated fairly under taxes the bottom line is the marriage tax elimination act would eliminate the marriage tax penalty for this machinist and this schoolteacherwife who are married in joliet illinois eliminating the marriage tax penalty is really an issue of fairness and will help simplify the tax code what is the bottom line the marriage tax elimination act puts two married people on equal footing with two single people that is fair and that simplifies the tax code i am proud to say i was part of this congress when republicans succeeded in passing into law the adoption tax credit to help loving families find a home for a child in need of adoption we accomplished that as part of the contract with america in 1996 and we followed up in 1997 by enacting into law the centerpiece of the contract with america the 500 per child tax credit which benefits 3 million illinois children that is 1 5 billion that will stay in illinois rather than coming to washington and of course i believe the folks back home can better spend their hardearned dollars back home than we can here in washington we can build on that helping working families by working to simplify our code by working to bring fairness to our tax code by eliminating what is the most unfair tax of all and that

and i think we are going to have to bite the bullet on social security and phase it out over time this is the house majority leader dick armey what my friend from north dakota has said is right the majority has never felt good about medicare as my friend has said in 1965 when medicare came into being there really wasnt a need for prescription drugs because prescription drugs were in their infancy and it didnt matter the vast majority of the time whether someone was going to live or die be comfortable or not now how can we the only superpower in the world a nation that is leading the world in research and medical products how can we have a medicare program a program for health care for senior citizens that does not include the prescription drug benefit we cant do that i also say to my friend the reason we are here is this morning a senator came over and gave this presentation and said what my friend from north dakota said sure we want to do something about medicare but i have gotten letters from my constituents saying im against the big government plan this is exactly what we hear on the radio advertisements and the television advertisements that are paid for by the health care industry they want the american people to think that the program the democrats are propounding is a big government plan there could be nothing further from the truth what does this have to do with big government a woman by the name of gail rattigah from henderson nv writes i am a registered nurse who recently cared for an 82yearold woman who tried to commit suicide because she couldnt afford the medications her doctor told her were necessary to prevent a stroke it would be much more cost effective for the government to pay for medications that prevent more serious illnesses and expensive hospitalizations these include but are not limited to blood pressure medications antistroke anticoagulants and cholesterol medications the governments current policy of paying for medications only in the hospital is backward get into health promotion and disease promotion and save money this is a registered nurse from henderson nv i want everyone on the majority side to know they are not going to be able to come over and make these statements as if there is no opposition to it what my friend from tennessee says is wrong he states he has gotten all of these letters saying i am against the big government plan that is because of the radio and tv advertisements from the powerful health insurance industry but the real people are like the 82yearold woman who wanted to commit suicide because she couldnt get medication also i want to spread across this record that my friend from tennessee who came and said we need the republican plan makes the statement that he wants to involve senator breaux in this the majority cant have it both ways they either support the bush plan the plan of the person running for the president of the united states on the republican ticket or they dont support the nominee it appears what my friend from tennessee is doing is trying to have it both ways because the senator from louisiana does not support governor bushs plan the majority realizes that their medicare plan simply can not work because of their nominees 1 6 trillion tax cut proposal senator breaux pointed this out quite clearly today my point is i say to my friend from north dakota people who come here and make statements on the floor need to have substantiation i say the senator from louisiana does not support the bush medicare plan i also say the majority has introduced a proposalso we understand it but it is a medicare prescription drug benefit in name only a new york times writer states all indications are that this plan is a nonstarter insurance companies themselves are very skeptical there havent been many cases in which an industrys own lobbyists tell congress that they dont want a subsidy but this is one of them i take just another minute or two of my friends time the gop plan subsidizes insurance companies not medicare beneficiaries health insurance companies continue to say the republican plan is unworkable the majority tries to give this to the insurance industry but the insurance industry doesnt want it because it wont work charles kahn president of the health insurance association of america has stated we continue to believe

senior citizens of this country be able to afford prescription drugs that is all we are saying and we want everyone to know the program put forth by the minority is a program that helps senior citizens it is not something that is means tested but a program that helps all senior citizens not people who make less than 12 000 a year it is a program that is essential it is essential because people as we speak such as gail rattigan who is a registered nurse who wrote to me write that people are considering suicide if they are to take one pill a day they are splitting them in two they are

gentleman from colorado for yielding me time and i appreciate his giving me the opportunity tonight to be able to make some comments of my own on such an important subject but first i want to thank him for his giving the attention to such a complex sensitive and yet important subject that it deserves and also thank the gentleman from colorado for his expertise and for his knowledge of immigration which i think provides a great contribution to those of us here in the house who certainly can benefit from his personal knowledge firsthand knowledge of immigration as it impacts his state of colorado i would like to call the attention of my colleagues to the destructive effect of our current immigration policy it is having a destructive impact on recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens and also how a more enlightened immigration policy would benefit american minorities and in fact the overall american economy each year close to 900 000 legal immigrants enter the united states of these about 300 000 have less than a high school education and their competition forscarce jobs does have a destructive impact on the opportunity of american workers with no more than a high school diploma who are disproportionately and unfortunately recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens among reports of a growing prospering economy are other more troubling reports on a growing gap between the welltodo and the working poor the national unemployment rate is about 4 percent where for those with less than a high school education it is more than twice as high over 8 percent in many cities where there are high recent immigrant populations the unemployment rates are in double digits for those with less education where is opportunity for these individuals and their families numerous polls indicate that black and hispanic americans know this only too well this is no surprise given that they are hurt disproportionately by our immigration policy today we cannot pretend that the adverse impact of mass immigration on minorities does not exist we can and should find solutions to protect the jobs and wages of recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens how often do we read about the longterm unemployed or the working poor or single mothers with no mention of the serious impact of immigration on their employment wages and working conditions how often do we hear comments about the growing gap between the welltodo and the working poor that do not mention that almost half the relative decline in wages of those who do not finish high school is caused in fact by competition from immigration think of a single mother barely surviving in a minimum wage job who sees her annual wages depressed by 2 000 because she must compete with more and more unskilled immigrants she very well might be a recent immigrant herself seeking a better life for herself and her children or she might be able to trace her roots in this country back generations and is simply seeking the american dream that has been denied her ancestors think what she can do for herself and her children with that lost money buy a used car so she does not have to take a bus to work put a down payment on a modest home or even fix the furnace before winter comes worse think what would happen if she actually loses her job because of the neverending competition from new arrivals it is certainly not the immigrants themselves who are to blame and who understandably want to come to america it is our immigration policy that is to blame but who knows how many people have been hurt by the unintended consequences of our outdated immigration policy a series of recent studies have all documented the effects of immigration policy on lowskilled american workers and recent immigrants the national research council of the national academy of sciences concludes that immigration was responsible for about 44 percent of the total decline in relative wages of high school dropouts between 1980 and 1994 the rand corporation reports that in california the widening gap between the number of jobs available for noncollegeeducated workers and the increasing number of new noncollegeeducated immigrants signals growing competition for jobs and hence a further decline in the relative earnings at the low end of the labor market the unitedstates commission on immigration reform chaired by congresswoman barbara jordan finds that immigration of unskilled immigrants comes at a cost to unskilled unitedstates workers the hudson institute states that unitedstates immigration policy serves primarily to increase the number of unitedstates residents who lack even a high school degree america must stop recruiting workers for jobs that do not exist or exist only at the lowest wages the brookings institute published a paper concluding that immigration has had a marked adverse impact on the economic status of the least skilled unitedstates workers the center for immigration studies calculates that immigration may reduce the wages of the average native in a lowskilled occupation by over 1 900 a year cis also found that the poverty rate for persons living in immigrant households of 1997 was 22 percent almost double the 12 percent rate for persons in native households it concluded that reducing the flow of less skilled immigrants who enter each year would have the desirable effect of reducing job competition between more established immigrants and new arrivals for lowwage jobs reducing the supply of this kind of labor would create upward pressure on wages and benefits for the working poor including immigrants already in the country over time this should reduce poverty among immigrants who work these studies reinforce what common sense already tells us in addition add three other facts together first immigrants will account for half of the increase in the workforce in the 1990s second the skilled level of immigrants relative to americans has been declining for years thirtyfive percent of immigrant workers who have arrived since 1990 do not have a high school education compared to only 9 percent of nativeborn workers some 300 000 illegal immigrants without high school educations arrived last year and will total 3 million this decade third close to 90 percent of all future jobs in america will require more than a high school education the mismatch is clear nearly half of all immigrants today are not prepared for the jobs of the future current immigration policy has many americans and recent immigrants competing with hundreds of thousands of newcomers without high school degrees for a fixed number of lowskilled jobs this is a recipe for disaster for millions of bluecollar workers and their families no one should complain about the plight of the working poor or the persistence of minority unemployment or the levels of income inequality in america without acknowledging the unintended consequences of our present immigration policy of course immigration is neither all good nor all bad immigrants benefit america in many ways but we should design our immigration policies so that it enhances rather than diminishes opportunity for american workers we should protect the jobs of working americans and we can make a better life for all americans wherever they were born just as american minorities would benefit from a reduced number of lowskilled immigrants the american economy and american firms trying to prosper in this era of global competition would benefit enormously from an increased flow of more educated immigrants american industry is pleading for more skilled and educated workers the chairman of the national association of manufacturers recently stated that the shortage of skilled employees is not a distant threat anymore the skills gap is now catching up to us and could threaten the amazing growth and productivity gains of the past decade finding an adequate supply of qualified employees is the number one issue for american industry today nam found that 88 percent of manufacturers are experiencing a shortage of qualified workers 60 percent find that current workers lack basic math skills and that 55 percent find serious deficiencies in workers basic writing and comprehension skills these problems can be solved with more educated workers and because immigration accounts for such a high percentage of workforce growth almost onehalf an emphasis on more educated immigrants would be an important part of the solution the result would be a more productive american economy and more productive american businesses as the productivity of the american economy increases so will the prosperity of all americans american citizens and legal residents will benefit in another way from more educated immigrants to borrow a line from a new book by george borjas skilled immigrants earn more pay higher taxes and require fewer social services than less skilled immigrants the national academy of sciences states that over his or her lifetime each immigrant with less than a high school education will cost american taxpayers 89 000 that is the government benefits consumed by each immigrant will exceed taxes they paid by 89 000 to citizens concerned about how we are to rebuild our schools and protect and preserve social security in the next century these numbers should set off alarms more than 300 000 immigrant workers with less than a high school education entering our country this year will require 27 billion more in government services and benefits than they will contribute in taxes that is 27 billion for example that will not be available to rebuild our schools and protect and preserve social security and medicare next year another 300 000plus immigrants will enter the country with less than a high school education over their lifetimes they will claim another 27 billion that could provide education and training to recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens who have less than a high school education and who are disadvantaged in our economy common sense tells us that we should align our immigration policy with the needs of america the economy is crying out for more educated workers and one of the easiest and most costfree ways of providing these workers is through immigration reform doing so would mean more economic opportunity for all americans now

security surplus you are saying is something that you as a member of congress will not tolerate and certainly some of the creative thinking and deciding which you are using ombcbo it means what we are going to have to do democrats and republicans is send a message to the leadership that is it is time for us to come together you cannot possibly do the things that you want to do and talk about a 92

to the floor make declarations saying do the right thing and then go into the committee on appropriations and do the wrong thing so what i am suggesting is that if you can get your leadership to come out not with a resolution not with a vote but just to come to the well of the house and say how are we going to do this without intrusion on the social security surplus the president says let us

a northeastern state on behalf of a member of the senate who voted for our patients bill of rights the norwooddingell patients bill of rights that was passed on a bipartisan basis by the house a member of the senate who voted for thata republican there were only a very fewis running a commercial paid for by the republican senatorial campaign committee that says this senator voted for a real patients bill of rightsmeaning ours it is fascinating to me that we now have a circumstance where the republican campaign committee is saying that the patients bill of rights we proposed was the real one we will have more to say about that and have a more aggressive debate about that in the days ahead my expectation is that there will be a tie vote when another vote occursand it will happen again we fully intend it to happen again fortunately we will have a vice president to break that tie the patients bill of rights issue is very important let me mention a couple of other issues and then i will conclude we also have a responsibility to deal with the farm crisis and we have not done so very well we have a farm bill that doesnt work the freedom to farm bill does not work it has been a failure since it was enacted in 1996 the promise was produce what you want we will sell it overseas and get rid of the farm program and things will be better off since that time prices have collapsed and family farmers have had an awful time trying to make ends meet in most cases they are receiving far less now in real terms than they received during the great depression for their product these are not people who are slothful these are not people who arent being productive they are economic allstars they produce in prodigious quantity the food the world needs so desperately yet the market says by the way your food has no value while people climb trees to pick leaves to eat in countries around the world where there is not enough food family farmers driving a 2ton truck to a country elevator are told by the grain trader your food has no value something is wrong with that what really has no value is the current farm program it doesnt work it is long past time to fix it we are within three or four votes of doing that i encourage help from the other side to give us the votes needed to pass a farm program that provides real assistance for family farmers while we are on the subject of freedom those who wrote the freedom to farm billi didnt and i voted against itshould understand there is something called the freedom to sell the freedom to sell means if you want to give family farmers the freedom to produce whatever lets also give them the freedom to sell their products in markets such as iran iraq cuba north korea and others that have been off limits to them because this country has imposed economic sanctions against countries whose behavior we dont like i am fine with economic sanctions slap them with sanctions but dont ever include food as a part of those sanctions using food as a weapon is unbecoming to this country a country as big and as good and as powerful and as important as this country ought never use food as a weapon the freedom to sell is a pretty important principle whichwe ought to care a bit about there is an amendment that i put in the appropriations bill now in conference and i know there are a couple of house leaders who are intending to try to kill that as we get to conference i am hoping with the bipartisan support we received in the senate that we wfll prevail on this issue finally one of the other important issues we face as we wrap up this congress is trying to do something to strengthen the education system in our country we have the opportunity to do that it is just that we have all of this bickering back and forth we have things that we know need to be done everybody here understands that if you are in a classroom of 15 people there is more learning going on than if there is a classroom with 1 teacher and 30 kids class size matters we have proposals to reduce class size which will dramatically improve education we also understand you cannot learn in schools that are in functional disrepair no wonder there is disrepair in the schools they were built 50 or 60 years ago after world war ii when we had soldiers coming back having families and building schools for their children all across the country many of these schools are still in use today and are in desperate need of repair and remodeling if anyone doubts that take a trip to the ojibwa school on the turtle mountain indian reservation or the cannon ball elementary school south of bismarck nd take a look at those schools and ask yourself whether those schools need help the third grader who walks through the classroom door in the cannon ball school ought to be able to expect the same opportunity for a good education as all kids in this country yet these children dont have the same opportunity we know that yet legislation to improve and modernize our schools languish in this senate because some people dont believe it is important or some people believe they cannot do it because if they did somebody would declare victory for a public policy that makes sense lets declare victory for a little common sense in all of these areas education health care agriculture there are so many areas the agenda in this congress is the agenda we establish if we are a congress of underachievers that is our fault not something we blame on anybody else i wish i were in the majority here but i am not the majority establishes a schedule we dont i accept that we have a right and insist on the right between now and the 5 weeks when this congress wraps up its business to try to bring to the floor of the senate once again a real patients bill of rights and have another vote we have a right to try to push these policies to get them done we have a right to try to push education policies that we think will enhance and improve education in this country we have a right to try to push policies that say we want to add a prescription drug benefit to the medicare program we have a right to insist that the american consumer pay prices for prescription drugs that are fairnot the highest prices of anyone in the entire world we have a right to address all of those issues and we should there is time it is just a matter ofwill will the members of the senate who do the scheduling who plan the agenda exhibit the will to do what is right in the final 5 weeks and pass this kind of legislation as i said when i started when people sit down at the dinner table and talk about their lives they are talking about things that matter to them all of the things i have talked about are things that matter to them are our kids going to good schools do grandpa and grandma have the opportunity to get decent health care when they are sick are the neighborhoods safe do i have a decent job does it pay well does it have security all of those

terms of attacking its victims in their most productive years medical costs rising families that are dissipated children that are put to work lack of educational opportunities according to the who recent studies in india found that 100 000 women are rejected by their family because of tb every year because there is no way to stop tb at national borders the only way to eliminate it here in the

drugresistant tb can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to treat in the united states let us ratchet the amount up i rise today in support of this amendment to increase funding for global tb control because although we have a cheap effective treatment for tb the tragic fact is tb will kill more people this year than any year in historysomeone every 15 seconds tb is the biggest infectious killer of young women in the world in fact tb kills more women than any single cause of maternal mortality tb is the biggest killer of people with aidsaccounting for 40 percent or more of all aids deaths in africa and asia in the developing world tuberculosis also destroys girls and womens futures tb tends to attack its victims in their most productive years often killing or sickening the primary breadwinner of a family in order to pay for medical costs and generate income families frequently take their young girls out of school and put them to work tb means the loss of educational opportunity for girls it means dire poverty for families in some parts of the world there is a great stigma attached to contracting tb this leads to increased isolation abandonment and divorce of women according to who recent studies on india found that 100 000 women are rejected by their families because of tb every year in nepal there are numerous stories of young widows with no income and no prospects for another marriage turning to prostitution in order to support their families currently an estimated one third of the worlds population including some 1015 million people in the united states are infected with the tb bacteria because there is no way to stop tb at national borders the only way to eliminate tb here in the unitedstates is to control it worldwide especially in nations with the greatest tb burden the real tragedy is that effective tb treatmentwith drugs costing as little as 10 for a full 6 month course is only reaching 20 percent of those ill with tb it is crucial

subcommittee especially chairman callahan and ranking member pelosi for their efforts this year and over the past several years to give tb greater priority i stand here today because i believe we need to ratchet up that effort even more to go even further 100 million is needed to help jumpstart effective control programs globally this is not just a matter of doing what is right it is a matter of

opposition to the amendment i have listened with interest to the debate that has been going on this evening and i have listened to my distinguished colleague and friend from wisconsin and i share some of the concerns that he expresses about what has happened in our country in our society as a result of the proliferation of gambling which no doubt has in large measure stemmed from the extent of gambling on indian reservations i listened to my colleague from arizona talk about why we need to allow this to be settled by the courts and i have listened to the people talk about the issue of tribal sovereignty and i have listened to the people talk about states rights and i am aware of what has gone on in my state where our governor has taken a position and we have had a struggle in our state with many of the indian tribes trying to reach compacts but i want to talk to my colleagues tonight for just a moment about it from a different level because just 5 days ago i was on one of my reservations in southern arizona where i saw the impact of what has happened as a result of this gaming the pasqua yaqui tribal reservation is a very small tribe and a very small reservation in an urban setting on the edge of the city of tucson with land that has no economic value other than what they have been able to do in terms of scraping it together to make their homes but which now has a casino there which is used by those in the urban area of tucson i was there last saturday for the dedication of the boys and girls club now the construction of this came from a department of justice grant that goes to the boys and girls clubs of america and by the way this was the 49th boys and girls club on a native american indian reservation by the end of next year we will have over 100 of those boys and girls clubs on indian reservations i think that in itself speaks monuments to what we are accomplishing but the operation of this boys and girls club and the programs that are going to take place there come as a result of the revenue that they receive from indian gaming i talked to the director of the tribal health service and he told me about some of the programs that they are doing with teenagers with teenage mothers and the prevention of pregnancies and what they are doing to prevent diabetes which has been so rampant in so many of the other native american tribes of the southwest and some of the other programs they are doing to deal with heart disease and all kinds of medical problems it is the most innovative program in health care probably in our whole area i talked to an anglo doctor who is their consultant on medical issues and he told me what this tribe is doing with the limited amount of resources they have been receiving from the small casino that they have on their reservation is truly remarkable and has really turned around this tribe and made them a healthier people and created a better life for them i talked to many of the young men who were there as policemen that day who were providing protection for people who live on this reservation that they had never had before an area which was subject to rapes to burglaries to robberies and i talked to some of the firemen that were there that day during this dedication and they are providing fire protection and emergency medical care that was not available before and all of this comes as aresult of this revenue that comes from indian gaming this was not there before for this tribe this was a tribe that lived in absolute abject poverty that was shuttled off to the edge of the city of tucson and they have been able to make something of themselves as a result of this now i realize there are legitimate questions which have been raised by the gentleman from florida mr weldon the gentleman from virginia earlier spoke very eloquently about what gambling does in our society and i think these issues need to be addressed but as long as we have this in our society as long as this is there i think we need to understand what a difference this can make for native american tribes and how it has changed the lives of their people for that reason alone i think that what we are trying to do with the indian gaming legislation as we try to maneuver our way through this we ought to think very carefully about any kind of changes that we make to this and it is for that reason that i would oppose the kind of amendment that is being proposed here today which i think would really stop it in its tracks and make it impossible for tribes to really enjoy the economic fruits of the rest
