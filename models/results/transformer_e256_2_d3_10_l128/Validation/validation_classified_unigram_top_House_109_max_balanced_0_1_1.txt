lawlessness in the united states and failure to protect our borders is a national security issue and i come to you tonight with some doturbing news the threat is even more serious than many americans know tucson arizona is 65 miles from mexico i have it here on the map it is shown by the red dot it is the route to two interstates one going north and south and one going east and west just southeast of tucson arizona is the university of arizona technology park on that park which is surrounded by an oldfashioned chain link fence is a technology firm called raytheon raytheon is a defense contractor that makes tomahawk cruise missiles well neighbors in tucson arizona have sent me some pictures of what appears to be illegal entry into the perimeter of this plant here we have the chain link fence this photograph is taken inside the perimeter on these premises 400 acres is the raytheon plant it is true there is another fence around raytheon that is a fence that is a cable type fence that keeps trucks from coming through but someone of course could crawl underneath or over that particular fence and you see there is all types of litter inside the fence and the question occurs where does this come from these are trails that are similar to what you see along the texas border where i am from but border towns down in southeast texas dont have a plant that makes tomahawk cruise missiles tucson neighbors say these trails are filled with trash backpacks water bottles and clothes and why is that well it seems that the illegals that come from mexico sneak under this fence and hide on these 400 acres until the human smugglers come back later and pick them up and transport them throughout the united states raytheon public relations officials have said well they hadnt heard anything about it from the security and they have strict security procedures to enter that facility but a supervisor at raytheon security said yes illegals have been known to come through the grounds but they were just passing through and some illegals have been found working at the raytheon plant by subcontractors but they were ordered off the premises i would like to show you some more disturbing photographs that the tucson neighbors have sent me this is a photograph taken inside the perimeter of the chain link fence and you see numerous backpacks where illegals have come in to the perimeter have hidden on the premises when the human smugglers come to pick them up and take them into the heartland of america they bring with them the backpacks that allow them to change clothes it is somewhat disturbing to me that we have this contractor that makes tomahawk missiles that allows this to occur on their premises because you see lawlessness on the border breeds more lawlessness in the united states and you would think that a company that has submitted a border security plan for the department of homeland security just 2 weeks ago would be concerned about their bordertoo after all it is a national security issue i have one more photograph to show you taken on the same premises but on the other end of the perimeter a similar photograph of backpacks water bottles left by the people that illegally entered the united states how ironic that it is that they hide on the premises of a place and an institution that is trying to protect the national security of the united states the raytheon problems are our problems because the unitedstates mexico border is not secure we have to stop the illegal entry at the border between the united states and mexico otherwise we will continue to see these backpacks throughout the united states and some may have clothes but some may also bring in to the united states property and explosives that could damage the united states it is

spirit and our colleagues in the other body i am blessed to be on a couple of committees where there is bipartisan spirit at least some of the time and we are able to get a few things done and this is one of them the perkins act aims to prepare youth and adults for the future by building their academic and technical skills in preparation for postsecondary education and or employment the bill we are considering today enhances perkins by ensuring both secondary and postsecondary students participating in the program are acquiring rigorous academic and technical skills and will have the opportunity to transition into further education and or successful employment the perkins act governs widely supported programs of both the secondary and postsecondary level for example nearly all high school students complete at least one vocational education course and approximately 26 percent of students are considered vocational concentrators those students who focus on a single occupational area in my home state of delaware we have five career and technical high schools that enroll a total of 5 500 of the 29 500 total high school students at the postsecondary level the perkins act supports a broad array of options primarily at the community college level including delaware technical community college in the 19992000 school year over 50 percent of all students enrolled at the less than 4year postsecondary level reported that they were majoring in vocational areas todays conference report seeks to build upon reforms made in past reauthorizations and seeks to enhance this popular program to ensure its success in years to come the legislation before us today makes significant reforms to academic achievement and accountability to ensure students have the skills necessary to enter the workforce or continue to an institution of higher learning as i mentioned there are five career and technical high schools in delaware while all these schools met adequately yearly progress under the no child left behind act there is more to be done in academic achievement in these schools and schools across the country today we will improve vocational and technical education by increasing the focus on academics in conjunction with the skill attainment that is incumbent of the program one of the unique attributes of vocational and technical education programs is their ability to show students a path that could end in a certificate credential employment military or postsecondary education the techprep program within the perkins act is intended to focus on a welldefined link between high school and at least 2 years of postsecondary education research has shown however that funds are rarely if ever used to meet this goal rather funds are often used for purposes within the larger vocational and technical education program therefore the conference agreement revises requirements of the program in order to ensure articulation agreements between secondary and postsecondary institutions are in fact being implemented along this same track we include a new requirement for state development of career and technical programs of study for career and technical program areas these sequences of course will incorporate a nonduplicative progression of both secondary and postsecondary elements which will include both academic and vocational and technical content local recipients at both the secondary and postsecondary level would adopt at least one model sequence of courses as developed by the state i believe this will also help drive program improvements by ensuring that states clarify the progression of academic and vocational technical courses needed for the postsecondary education training or employment of a students choice it is clear that we are making some significant and positive changes for the schools and students impacted by this program one of the biggest changes that i think we are making is for congress to finally make the switch from vocational and technical education to career and technical education in my opinion this was an important statement for the congress to make while the president has proposed another avenue for high school reform in the perkins act i believe strongly that the reforms we consider today go a long way in driving program improvement and ultimate success for students across the country the dialogue surrounding high school reform is important and is happening in earnest i trust that the conference agreement will complement these efforts as a result of the changes in the bill i believe it will

senate judiciary committee staff over several months from hearings in the house and from other reports we have learned that current federal law designed to protect animal enterprises have been proven to be reasonably effective in protecting animal enterprises however serious gaps and loopholes have been identified in current law with respect to protecting employees and associates of animal enterprises present law protects employees of an animal enterprise but we have found that employees board members and family members of businesses and nonprofits affiliated with or doing business with such enterprises are complaining that they are now being stalked harassed intimidated or threatened with some individuals even being physically assaulted and had their homes businesses or cars vandalized since the animal enterprise terrorism law was enacted in 1992 there have been some1 100 complaints of such incidents with property losses reported of being more than 120 million those complaining include farmers scientists biomedical and biotechnology industries research universities teaching hospitals financial institutions magazines newspapers and other advertising groups and others who are viewed as assisting or enabling targeted animal enterprises the evidence is that in many instances extremist elements among the animal rights groups are taking advantage of the fact that the animal enterprise laws do not cover affiliates and associates by using threats harassment intimidation and fear and other extreme tactics to pressure them into severing their activities with such enterprises s 3880 is designed to cover these gaps or loopholes by providing to employees businesses and associates of animal enterprises similar protections to those already covered in other words the bill prevents a person from doing indirectly to an animal enterprise what they are prohibited to do directly now citizens engaging in legitimate animal enterprise activities and anyone associated with them are entitled to be protected from criminal acts and to be able to go about their daily a tivities free from threats to their person or property and that of their family and associates state laws are generally good at providing those protections however the interstate nature of the planning and execution of the criminal harassment tactics used by some individuals or groups skilled at exploiting gaps or weaknesses in the laws have made it difficult for states to get at problems effectively that is why this bill is deemed necessary while we must protect those engaged in animal enterprises we must also protect the right of those engaged in first amendment freedoms of expres sion regarding such enterprises it goes without saying that first amendment freedoms of expression cannot be defeated by statute however to reassure anyone concerned with the intent of this legislation we have added in the bill assurances that it is not intended as a restraint on freedoms of expression such as lawful boycotting picketing or otherwise engaging in lawful advocacy for animals in addition we also wanted to recognize that there are some who conscientiously believe that it is their duty to peacefully protest the operation of animal enterprises to the extent of engaging in civil disobedience if a groups intention were to stage a sitin or liedown or to block traffic to a targeted facility they certainly run the risk of arrest for whatever traffic trespass or other laws they may be breaking but they should not be held more accountable for business losses

specifically intended for the law to be applied if there is no damage or economic loss or damage or loss is less than 10 000 the offense is a misdemeanor not a felony this bill does not satisfy

would like to thank the gentleman from virginia for his comments with the permission of the chair i will now submit for the record an additional statement detailing the situation at this mendota facility and commit to continue to work with you chairman wolf and ranking member mollohan i commend you for your leadership and good work on the science state justice commerce appropriations measure given the limitations of the budget i was particularly pleased with the report language addressing the administrations shortsighted request to rescind prison construction funds bearing in mind the increasing demands on our already overcrowded federal prisons on behalf of my constituents in the small rural town of mendota i would like to call your attention to an issue of pressing concern in the congressional district i am proud to represent at its core this is an issue of smart budgeting addressing security demands and the federal government following through on its commitments in may of 2000 the city of mendota was approached by the federal bureau of prisons proposing to build a medium security federal correctional institution in mendota california the required environmental impact study followed after which mendota was selected the local elected officials and community leaders have been strong supporters of the project proud to provide a public service to the country and encouraged by the economic stimulus the prison would create the demand for such a prison is imperative and the mendota facility will provide much needed bed space for 1 152 mediumsecurity male inmates with crowding at mediumsecurity facilities currently 37 percent over capacity this institution is of critical importance worse yet an additional 7 500 new federal inmates are expected to enter our federal prisons annually today californias corrections institutions are the secondlargest prison system in the nation after the federal bureau of prisons californias prison population according to a june 11 2006 report in the washington post has surged in recent months to more than 173 000 resulting in the worst overcrowding in the country and costing taxpayers more than 8 billion a year just today the sacramento bee reported that california prisons are more overcrowded than ever some 200 percent of design capacity in response california governor arnold schwarzenegger called for a special legislative session and proposed an initiative to expedite the construction of state prisons the funding history for the mendota facilityis an embarrassment should the administration get its way in the fy2007 budget it is the american taxpayer that will bear the burden of increased costs funding for this facility includes 11 9 million in fy2001 for site and planning development and 147 million in fy 2002 for remaining construction funding however rescission of 5 744 million in fy 2002 and 51 895 million in fy 2004 has jeopardized the entire project to maintain the existing contract the final option must be exercised by october 8 2006 should this contract expire it is anticipated that any new contract will cost at least 20 percent more however the presidents fy2007 budget contained no funding for the completion of the mendota facility the federal government has made a long term commitment to construct and operate the mendota facility over 100 million in federal funds has already been spent on the facility with 40 percent of the construction complete to bring this project to a virtual halt at this stage would be unfair to the citizens of mendota a city with an 18 6 percent unemployment rate and 42 percent living below thepoverty line mendota is counting on the government to keep its promise"], [0.0007011592388153076, 0.4992988407611847, 0, "i yield myself such time as i

families coping with these dreaded diseases the occurrence of mps in the general population is thought to be about 1 in 25 000 births increased public and professional awareness are important to further the development of treatments and techniques to help cope with and eventually cure these diseases because mps diseases are not commonly known and well understood in the medical community diagnosis is often delayed early detection and intervention can help to improve the quality of life for children like brittany i applaud the efforts of the national mps society to support research to
