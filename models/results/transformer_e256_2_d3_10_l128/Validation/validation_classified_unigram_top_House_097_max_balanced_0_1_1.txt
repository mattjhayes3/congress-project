eloquently has given us there should be no reason for any member to be ignorant as to the exact thrust and nature of what is being foisted in the house but in general terms the chairman has done this i would like to be given the privilege to get into some matters of special importance the committee on banking had the biggest cuts to make of all the committees in the house of all the subcommittees in the house the subcommittee on housing had the biggest amount of the outlays and authority to cut the current service estimate for programs within the subcommittee on housing and urban affairs jurisdiction is 40 8 billion in authority we were told and mandated by the budget resolution to take the standard omb cut of 25 percent now for reasons beyond the reach of rational minds to understand the stockman formula says that domestic programs must be cut by 25 percent it matters not whether the program is for education housing or sidewalks if it is a program for people it goes down by 25 percent needless to say this arbitrary kind of target leads to the necessity of making equally arbitrary decisions nevertheless the subcommittee with the great help and leadership of the overall chairman of the full committee struggled with the numbers juggled the programs and produced budget authority cuts of 10 5 billion we made those cuts in as rational and humane a way as possible with the steady constant and undiluted opposition of the minority but there is no denying the reality that there will not be enough money in this budget to provide anything like the level of community development assistance that our cities require and neither will there be anything like the commitment needed to provide decent and affordable housing for those millions of h 3506 co citizens who are living in substandard and high cost housing we started with a current services level that was already inadequate and then faced the command to cut those services by onefourth thus we began with an assisted housing production level that meets about onethird of a reasonable goal and we ended up with an assisted housing production level that will meet perhaps a fourth of the goal in short beginning with inadequate program levels we were forced to go to absurd and inhumane levels there is no way to accomplish that kind of task without pain the results of this vast budget cut will be with us for years to come in the form of overcrowded overpriced housing in the form of growing numbers of substandard homes and in less visible but equally damaging forms of inadequate community services and underdeveloped local economies if the administration gambles luckily and we do not have more immediate social eruptions and disturbances as are being registered in less fortunate countries such as belgium france and even west germany under very similar conditions in housing that is the commitment that this administration has demanded and which the majority here has accepted we have done our duty to produce the required cuts to protect the existing housing stock we acted to provide 1 64 billion in operating subsidies for public housing this covers operating and maintenance requirements and will enable housing authorities to begin restoring operating reserves that have been depleted through extraordinary utility costs the operating subsidy goes largely to utility costs40 percent of it in fact budgets for 1980 and 1981 assumed that utility costs would increase by only 11 4 and 12 percent respectively when in actual fact utility costs went up by twice those amounts the utility cost shortfall for 1981 alone was 250 million housing authorities were forced to deplete their reserves in order to pay their bills the administration also has failed to provide 100 million to make adjustments in cases where the performance funding system formula does not accurately reflect the real needs of housing authorities which often happens in the case of larger housing authorities altogether the administration budget request was 440 million short of what is required to make the housing authorities whole this bill provides a sufficient amount to cover that shortfall failure to do so will only mean that housing authorities will be forced to cut further back on maintenance and other services which in turn would lead to loss of housing that we cannot afford to lose the public housing stock is valued at 60 billion and it is imperative that this housing be preserved which this bill provides for second this bill alms to protect the poor the budget resolution assumes that housing subsidies will be cut by 60 million through imposition of rent increases we reject that because the evidence is that the rent increases could well result in either no increase in revenue or an actual decline in revenue information we gathered shows that in san antonio for example public housing rents could go up by 5 to 36 a month the trouble is that the people who occupy this housing are so hard pressed that they do not have that kind of money to spare witnesses told us that they would have to move out of public housing into substandard housing rather than pay the increased rent the reality is that these are people who would have to choose between shoes for children and rent increases or choose between food and higher rent the administrations rent increase proposals would hit hardest at working poor families who already pay most of the rent received by housing authorities these are the families that would move out in order to be able to buy ordinary necessities even at the cost of moving into substandard shacks who would replace them in all likelihood even lower income tenants who would pay far less in rent i do not believe that the administrations rent increase proposal would produce the revenues claimed and i know that it would only create greater hardship among people who already have as much as anyone can bear therefore in rejecting the rent increase proposal we believe that we are not just protecting the poor but acting to protect the housing authorities from losing the very families that now provide the greatest rents and the greatest stability aside from turning back the counterproductive rent proposal we acted to provide at least a minimal level of modernization funds too many of the nations public housing units are in a state of disrepair it is imperative that we keep those units in operation it will be far less expensive to do that than to pay the cost of replacing them again we acted to protect the interests of the poor people who live in public housing so that the units they occupy will be safe and decent and at the same time we acted to keep the housing stock from declining third this bill provides as much new housing production as possible a realistic national housing goal requires that 600 000 assisted housing units be produced but in 1981 we expect only a third that many to be started from that already inadequate base the budget resolution called for a vast reduction there is in fact no way to keep up existing production levels and still meet the requirements of the budget resolution however we have provided funds for 1 billion in annual contribution commitments for a total of 20 billion over the life of the resulting contracts this will produce 176 000 assisted housing units55 percent of them in the form of existing homes and 45 percent of them in the form of either new or substantially rehabilitated homes the minority substitute offered a level of 158 000 units which is 17 000 below what the president proposed what we have provided in this bill is far from enough to meet any reasonable goal but is the most that can be done within the budget targets it would be a genuine tragedy to see any further cuts in housing production at a time when we know that the supply of the decent and lowcost housing is actually falling in relation to the need for it there is no disputing the fact that in this decade the nation needs to produce more housing than at any other time in history unless that need is met we will see continued demand pull on housing prices and we will see the continuation and worsening of the pressures that have already priced housing out of the reach of all but the most fortunate of our citizens for that reason we rejected the administration plan to stop ginny mae tandem plan operations and provided 1 1 billion in tandem commitments which should enable the purchase of mortgages with an aggregate value of 1 9 billion during 1982 this is essential in light of the continued high interest rates that make housing unaffordable without some form of relief and assistance we do not believe that the administrations plans to kill fha are realistic and this bill extends fha authority and adjusts insurance limits to reflect existing market trends we also provided an extension of the 202 program for elderly housing at a level of 850 million in fiscal 1982 those are the highlights of the housing portion of this bill i want now to turn to the community development issues for the community development block grant program this bill provides 3 64 billion in fiscal 1982 which is a slightin todays termsreduction from current levels the reduction is 220 million the bill also provides for continuation of the udag program at a 425 million program levela reduction of 250 million the administration proposed vast changes in the community development programs taken as a whole these cuts would have killed off the provisions that assure that community development funds are targeted and used in ways that put the funds into the areas with the greatest needs in short what the administrations changes in cdbg would have done would be to make this into another form of general revenue sharing in addition the administration proposed to put small city cdbg money under control of the states a move that even secretary pierce says the states are not prepared to cope with it is also a move that no city asked for and that an overwhelming number of small cities are opposed to we believe that community development block grants ought to be kept in their present form the program was developed after years of effort and in a bipartisan effort it has been subjected to thorough review by the committee most recently in 1980 we concluded that there is nothing to be gained and much to be lost by the radical changes put forward at the last moment by the administration likewise we rejected the notion of putting the urban development action grant program into a block grant in point of fact the arrangement proposed would have destroyed the merit of udag which is that it has a specific purpose for specific areas it is a highimpact program and its impact and effect would simply be frittered away if it were placed into a general revenue sharing type of program at a time when aid to cities for community development is going down taken as a whole the proposals for community development asked for by the office of management and budget and putatively supported by hud would merely create revenue sharing unders new name both parties have agreed for a decade that the cities need flexibility but they also need funds that are targeted and directed toward their areas of greatest need that is what community development block grants and udag does and that is the concept this bill preserves the housing and community development provisions of this bill are intended to keep essential programs alive some programs have been killed701 planning and others on the whole however our aid is to provide the greatest assistance to the areas and people of greatest need and in the most sensible way possible we have avoided any radical action we have been judicious and prudent we have met the requirements of the budget resolution this is a bill that has been painful to draw and ispainful for me to have to support but in the circumstances it is the best that can be done the housing and community development title is realistic and it merits your support i yield back to the distinguished chairman of the banking committee and in so doing want to take this opportunity to commend him and my colleagues for a splendid job under the most distressing and painful circumstances imaginable i yield back to the distinguished gentleman"], [0.0035924315452575684,

the housing industry of those who depend on it and those millions of americans who cannot now afford to buy or rent a decent home this program speaks not only to the needs of urban dwellers but to those who live in rural areas as well the reagan budget program would actually cause a reduction of 46 000 housing units that are now planned and for which funding is available the reagan program is a wholesale abandonment of efforts to provide affordable housing for the majority who are shut out of the housing market today the bill my colleagues and i are offering today will provide about 250 000 new assisted housing units in fiscal year 1983 under the programs of the department of housing and urban development and it will also provide 57 000 new assisted housing units in the rural areas served by the farmers home administration the cost of our program is modestno more than is available for the current fiscal year for housing assistance which in turn is much less than was available last year modest as it is however our bill is critically needed and is a positive program as against the reagan program of wholesale iandonment and retreat the housing act of 1982 will provide assistance for homebuyers who have modest incomes these are people who could if interest rates were anything like reasonable afford homes without assistance the bill would make available up to 100 000 homes under the section 235 q program and buyers whose incomes are up to 130 percent of area median income could qualify the subsidy would be used to reduce interest payments to a rate of 9 percentsteep by historic terms usurious by my own standards but still affordable by people who have modest incomes the subsidy provided in this program would be limited to 10 yearson the belief that as incomes rise people will be able to eliminate their need for the subsidy moreover there is provision in the bill for a recapture of the subsidy payments additionally our bill will create a new program to replace the existing section 8 multifamily housing program under our bill local government agencies could work with private developers to develop affordable rental housing the subsidy payment would be extremely flexible so that the maximum incentive will exist to create efficient and effective financing plans the subsidy could be in the form of an outright capital grant it coul8a be in the form of a loan a rent subsidy or even a loan for purchase of land it could be any reasonable device that would make the project financially feasible and at the same time modest in cost to the federal government additionally the bill encourages local units of government to do their part by contributions in kind or in cash toward project development this encouragement comes through a preference to project applications that show local participation in the development cost again flexibility is the keythe kind of flexibility that made the urban development action grant the efficient effective program that it has been the bill continues the current level of effort with respect to lowcost public housing development and rehabilitation and provides for adequate operating subsidies as well we recognize that there is an urgent need for lowrent public housing that there is a need to maintain the existing stock and that adequate operating funds are essential to prevent the financial failure of numerous housing agencies we provide in this bill for a full range of rural housing programs at least maintaining existing levels of effort the amount of substandard housing in rural america is disproportionate and our program does not turn its back on the need for better housing in small towns and on farms our bill also recognizes the ravages of unemployment with the resulting rise in mortgage foreclosures we do not believe that the involuntary victims of the nations economic distress should have their misery compounded through the loss of hardearned home equity accordingly the bill provides for an emergency homeowners assistance program one that makes loans available to people who are faced with foreclosures because of involuntary and temporary economic distress the bill extends the various insuring and secondary credit market authori ties all of which are vital tools for the financing and production of homes all of which have proved their worth and all of which have earned the support of everyone who is concerned with housing we recognize that the depression of the housing industry will not end until the economy is set straight but we also recognize that doing nothing is worse than nothing doing nothing will only accelerate the growing crisis among those who seek affordable housing only deepen the depression of the housing industry and worst of all constitute a retreat from our historic commitment to decent and affordable housing for this nation the administration is not offering a housing program it is offering an antimarch 4 1989 housing programan attempt to dis mantle and discard programs that an needed that work ahd that make positive contribution not only to thi wellbeing of the american people bu a positive contribution to the economy as well our bill by contrast is a reaf firmation of the historic and necessary national commitment to housing we understand the certali truth tha without a national housing policy there will never be sufficient housing let alone decent and affordable hous ing for the nation we offer a con structive effective program that learns from the lessons of the past the nonpolicy and antipolicy of

is underway combined with the grassroots efforts for a nuclear weapons freeze ground zero week represents the basic sanity of the body politic which is increasingly rejecting the insanity of the nuclear arms race those who are absorbed in the arms race do not see things this way whether sovietor american military planners are able to construct scenarlos which they are convinced are reasonable it is even possible that a small nuclear war can look like a relatively attractive option it is probably the fact that major policymakers in the reagan administration including the secretary of defense the secretary of state the vice president and the president himself have all discussed nuclear war as both survivable and winnable although undesirable that public concern has grown perhaps of even greater concern should be the republican party platform of 1980 which called for the united states to develop nuclear supe riority in contrast to the policies of presidents eisenhower nixon and ford who sought eqyality or a balance of terror since this unreasonable and dangerous goal was in a political party convention platform many did not take it seriously reviewing the nuclear weapons policies of the reagan administration it is now clear that they are attempting to implement this part of the party platform and seek nuclear weapons domination of the united states over the soviet union the calls for a nuclear freeze are a justified reaction to this irresponsible policy a great deal has been written recently about the causes of the nuclear arms race and how it can be stopped or even reversed more than enough blame exists for all who have been involved to share responsibility i am thinking of the governments of the united states and the soviet union the military establishments of each country and the political leaders of each nation former secretary of defense under presidents kennedy and johnson robert mcnamara is a man who shared in the decisionmaking that got us in the mess we are in today his insights are therefore unique frankly i find his current candor and perspective to be truly amazing and an important contribution to our understanding of the nuclear arms race the los angeles times recently printed a fascinating interview with robert mcnamara which i will shortly the main point of this interview is mr mcnamaras observation that the nuclear arms race was spurred on by fears in the soviet union that the united states in the early sixties was seeking to achieve nuclear superiority the current goal of the reagan administration and a unitedstates firststrike capabilitya goal the reagan administration does not claim as its own robert mcnamara should know what he is talking about he in fact received memos from senior air force officials calling for a unitedstates firststrike capability while that policy was officially rejected the roots of our current nuclear arms dilemma go back to those days before i close i would like to announce that this week i will be inserting a number of additional statements ing the nuclear arms race the folly of either great power seeking a firststrike capability and the desirability of a nuclear weapons freeze at this time i wish to insert the interview with robert mcnamara in the record intervimw w i mcnamarafear of a unitedstates first strike sun as cause or arms race by robert scheer soviet fears of a surprise unitedstates nuclear first strike after the cuban missile crisis may have triggered the massive soviet buildup of intercontinental missiles in the 1960s and set off the nuclear arms race according to former secretary of defense robert s mcnamara in a recent interview with the times mcnamara cited a recently declassified document which indicates that the unitedstates air force wanted the united nations to build a firotstrike capability in 1962 mcnamara and president john f kennedy vetoed the proposal the memo given to the times by mcnamara was released under the freedom of information act to author fred kaplan mcnamara in the interview challenged the notion held by president reagan and others that the soviets nuclear buildup of the late 1960s and 1970s was designed to gain a firststrike nuclear attack capability rather mcnamara contended the buildup could be seen as a reaction to the earlier unitedstates military buildup and to rumors that the united states was preparing to strike first at the soviet union i have no doubt but that the soviets thought we were trying to achieve a first strike capability mcnamara said we were not we did not have it we could not attain it we didnt have any thought of attaining it but they probably thought we did had he been the soviet defense secretary at the time he said i would have been worried as hell about the imbalance of force and i would have been concerned that the united states was trying to build a firststrike capability because i would have had knowledge of what the nuclear strength was of the united states and i would have heard the rumors that the air force was recommending achievement of such a capability in the document titled memorandum for the president and dated nov 21 1962 mcnamara warned president kennedy it has become clear to me that the air force proposals are based on the objective of achieving a firststrike capability in mcnamaras judgment the air force recommendation went beyond the requirement of deterring a soviet attack as he wrote what ia at issue here is whether our forces should be augmented beyond what i am recommending in an attempt to achieve a capability to start a thermonuclear war in which the resulting damage to ourselves and our allies could be considered acceptable on some reasonable definition of the term mcnamara cited a memorandum he had sent kenyedy the year before in which he defined a full firststrike capability as a capability that would be achieved if our forces were so large and so effective in relation to those of the soviet union that we would be able to attack and reduce soviet retaliatory power to the point at which it could not cause severe damage to unitedstates population and industry"],

program consists of supertight money a fiscal 1982 expenditure cut of around 50 billion in which military increases areoffset by cuts in the social budget and a 148 billion a year income tax reduction when fully effective in 1984 heavily weighted toward personal income tax cuts for the affluent is the program equitable will it work is there an alternative neither the proposed budget cuts not the proposed tax cuts are equitable no doubt cuts in budgetary expenditures are needed they are needed because the mandate of the november 1980 election is qite clear cut expenditures reduce the present federal take of some 23 percent of gross national product budget cuts are desirable too because of the need to get the deficit under control only a budget deficitwhfch is under control can eliminate the treasurys need to borrow heavily to meet the deficit with a lowered deficit the nations savings could get through to the needed ultimate investment in plant and equipment so the question is not whether there should be budgetary retrenchment the question rather is on whom the burden should fdl and here even a cursory look at the reagan budget shows that a disproportionate part of the cuts fails upon those in the dawn of life the children those in the twilight of life the elderly and those in the shadows of life the disadvantaged the handicapped and the poor health programs are ruthlessly cut med icaid is slashed 1 2 billion which means not only less medical care for the needy but a greater burden thrust upon state and local governments w~hose principal fiscal reliance is on regressive taxes like the real estate tax on the homeowner the 78 million pnrumonia immunization program for the elderly is completely abandoned the 91 vietnam veterans outreach centers providing

the stormtossed who cannot afford a private lawyer is to be ended mass transit is drastically curtailed all these cuts could have aved some 50 billion and i have no qua el with the idea of a 50 billion deficitnarrowing measure but it would have been entirely possible to save that same 50 billion without shortchanging really needy people and without eviscerating programs which foster economaic development for example billions could have been saved by cutting down the federal tax deduction subsidy for interest paid on vacation homes sometimes the third and fourth such home and on interest pr~id largely by the top one~fiftb of income receivers on loaru to carry consumer purchases in addition to putting needed funds into the budgetbalancing column sxch measures woula at least partially remove an incentive which now induces people to overconsume and thus have feer eevtngs to make available for productivityenhawking inflationaryfighting industrial plant and equipment huge savings could also have been achieved by doing something about taxexempt industrial revenue bonds for unnecessary shopping centers and in some cases porno bookstores uneconomic power projects like clich river in tennessee or corps of engineers and bureau of reclamation water projects bonanzas to the oil industry such as the depletion allowance which make no sense in a world where oil brings 40 a barrel but equity aside will the program work will it produce the victory over unemployment and inflation and budget deficits which reaganomics proclaims it will flaith over and beyond the call of duty is required to make one believe that it will the theory is that the supertight money will fight inflation and the superheavy tax cut will stimsulate growth much more likely the tight money and high interest rates wiill retard growth increase unemployment and bring about hankruptcies and the tax cut will simply stimulate higher interest rates if patterns in the current inflationary period are projected only about 5 percent of the total reduction will be nsaved by the beneficiaries of the reduction with the other 95 percent as a present spent indeed since much of it will be spent by the wealthy itis likely to be spent on expensive imported consumer goods ranging from mercedess to claret thus worsening our trade balance and the international dollar and in the next round inflation moreover even the uttle bit theoretically saved from current consumption may in todays inflation be spent by speculating in corporate takeovers or in commodit la such as bunker huntand his blillondollar silver manipulations the administration projects the 1984 workout of its policies as producing a balanced budget and inflation unemployment and interest rates all hovering around the 6 percent level the administration disdains econometric studies and derived its euphoric results largely by hoping or guessing that everyone would conclude from the reagan program that hard times were over businessmen should reduce their prices labor lower its wages and banks make available their money for lower interest rates a number of economic forecast4 rs who still hold the view that logical prediction is possible among them the congressional budget office data resources the wharton school and chase econometricscome up with vastly gloomier 1984 scenarios but these economic thinktanks in programming their computers all assumed that the reagan program in all its brute severity would not actually be carried out hence they softened the assumptions the federal reserve would actually not keep money as tight as the administration is ordaining congress would not by its spending and taxing measures allow the kind of budget deficits that reagan arithmetic postulates so al of these projections fell to take reaganomics nt its word however forbidding the word might be so i asked the joint economic committee staff to put into the computer the reagan program without improving a line of it and out came the result unemployment no better than today inflation down to 8 percent but underlying inflationthe general trend of wage ratesstill at its present 9 percentplus level ~ and a budget deficit of 111 billion the greatest in history rather than a budget in balance what would be happening the computers were telling us was that the reductions in social spending would be more than outweighed by the increases in military spending and the reductions in income tax revenue the added deficits coupled with a very stringent monetary policy would bring about high inbierest rates and slow growth these in turn would further increase the deficit in short the republicans far from learning by the mistakes of the democrats seem doomed to repeat them in 196l the democratic ndministration combined guns and butterguns for a major war in vietnam butter for a whole gamut of new social programs and the result was years of stagflation now fourteen years later along come the republicans and want to repeat the same mistakeguns for the greatest peacetime increase n military spending in history and butter in the form of outsized tax reductions for the affluent with a resulting renewed bout of stagfiation and budgetary deficits a particularly unfortunate element in reaganomics is what it will do to income distr~budion it is too much perhaps to hope for the moment that amnerica can achieve a fairer income distribution a diminution of the gap between rich and poor and a closer approximation to the situation which prevails in countries like germany and japan but income distribution in the united states has been getting worse for the last 16 years and now is certainly no time to accelerate the worsening during 19651978 the share in the national income earned by the lowest quintile of american families the poor remained about even but only because of the treniendous increase in transfer payments such as health welfare education food and housing benefits asto the second and third quintilesthose making 10 00020 000 a year and 20 00030 000 a year today respectivelythey definitely lost their share of the national income declined from 28 percent to 26 percent the fourth quintile those in the 30 00040 000 bracket just about kept even and the top quintile not surprisingly absorbed what the lower middle income second and thi1rd quintiles were losing it raised its share of the national income from 42 percent to 44 percenta total of many billions of dollars under reaganomics the people in the lowest 60 percent are going to lose more the poor will have their transfer payments shorn the second and third quintiles dont have those transfer payments to lose but they will get piddling income tax cut benefitsthe reductions from keniproth will be swallowed by the increases in the payroill tax and in inflationary bracket creep being borrowers rather than lenders they will be hurt by a perpetual high interest rate regime and the tax loopholes that gladden the hearts of the upper income bracketsitemized deductions oil and real estate shelters investment creditsare simply not available to them the top ten percent of american families will profit mightily from reaganomics with the lowest 60 percent taking it on the chin this does not sound like a good way to keep up the demand necessary to take off the market what the economy can produce and thus avoid a recession nor does it seem a good way to make for social peace either in the central city or in the lower middleclass suburbs the view that rehganomics in not likely to w~ork is not held just by congressional democrats reaganomics is also viewed with some private skepticism by a good many congressional republicans ranging from those on the moderate wing who see super tight mones as a real barrier to the necessary growth to those on the conservative wing like the three conservative republican senators who outraged the white house by voting against the budget on the senate budget committee just before the april recess who fear with considerable reason a huge reagan budget deficit down the road and many a market letter from many a respectable wall street firm nowadays is pointing out that the markets are not exactly prophesying success for reaganomics as indicated by the fact that longterm interest rates auguries of inflation have been stead ily rising since the inaugural the president in hisstate of the economy address on february 18 asked anybody with a better alternative to step forward and present it very recently the democrats led by chairman jones of the house budget committee and chairman itostenkowskl of the house ways and means committee have done just that mr jones proposes a slightly gentler hand on social program budget cuts than mr reagansomewhat on the order of 10 percent rather than 25 percent cuts for economic development mass transit food stamps school lunches legal aid and so on by cracking down on military waste and by mandating a somewhat smaller tax cut mr jones is aiso able to reduce the 1982 reagan budget deficit of 40 billion to 25 billion mr rostenkowski would cut 1982 taxes by only 40 billion rather than by mr reagans 52 billion and would shift the benef its very modestly from those at the top of the income scale to those in the middle the democratic alternative represents as does the democratic party nowadays a pale and somewhat more human imitation of the republican programa little tougher on fatcats a little easier on thincats and a bit more responsible about the deficit in short an improvement if hardly a call to the barricades while the two great parties of the middle square off on the minutia of macroeconomics nothing much is being done about the structural problems of our economy yet it is in improving our economic structure that the game will be won or lost for even the most admirable monetary and fiscal policies are insufficient to bring both steady jobs and stable prices at the same time the structural aspects of costpush inflation productivity energy and national defense must be addressed 1 against inflation our only policy is supertight money by itself as thatchers england is proving it cannot lay a glove on inflation without creating unacceptable stagflation recession and unemployment yet the administrations freemarket mythology immobilizes it from addressing the wagepice spiral in steel in automobiles in coal and in a score of other major sectors there are overseas examples of what to do about costpush inflation that we seem intent on ignoring in austria the government has for ycara successfully worked a social contract in which labor and management agree on a compact which puts a productivityrelated ceiling on the spiral in holland the government has had a comprehensive system of wage and price controls in place for the last couple of years and inflation is today less than 7 percent 2 in productivity we have only a fragmentary policy though accelerated productivity increases are one of the best inflationfighters going republicans and democrats are generally agreed on the need for liberalized depreciation for business investments and on the simplification and reformp of regulatory excesses but labormanagementgovernment cooperation for productivity improvement is still frowned on despite the splendid results of cooperation in the two postwar miracleworkers germany and japan in lsth these countries labor has been weened away from inefficient workrules and management from concentration on shortterm and financial fetishism why not hfarerica nor does the reagan budget do anything noticeable for productivity infrastructure programsrebuilding america ruined streets and bridges and sewer systems and waterworks and railroads and utilities and mass transitis badly shortchanged so is manpower training and industrial research and development both public and private 3 the administration is considering killing the department of energy but there is precious little of an energy policy to kill to stand up to opecand in the process make ourself the hero of the nonoilproducing worldwe need to build up a strategic petroleum reserve we need to conserve gasoline but instead of discussing an increase in the present 4centsagallon gasoline tax with a builtin rebate for workers who need it to get to work and other essential

oklahoma for really having done a brilliant job in putting together the resolution which was reported out of our committee and which is under consideration today i think it is very important at this stage of the debate to be very clear as to exactly what the differences are between the two resolutions we are about to vote on if we eliminate tile differences between them which are due to differing economic assumptions it is quite clear that both the grammlatta substitute and thle house budget committee resoluition~ call for roughly the same level or federal spending in the next fiscal year and both of them therefore require roughly the same lcvel of reductions in federal spending the issue therefore is not whether to cut federal spending or for that matter even by how much to cut federal spending but where to cut the federal budget and how to cut the federal budget it seems to me that when we look at it in that respect it is very clear that the resolution reported out by the budget committee is infinitely more desirable by adding to defense interest and the socalled safety net programs thle grammlatta substitute decreases the allother categories of the budget from 28 1 percent of the total in 1981 to 17 9 percent in 1984 as the house budget committee resolution makes clear it is possible to cut the budget more equitably than the administration has done reagan is using budget cutting as an excuse for an attack on social programs cuts in afdc food stamps and medicaid will reduce the spendable income of over 7 5 million poor and working poor families at a time of high inflation and high unemnployment the proposed cap on medicaid will place an intolerable burden on states and localities and will inevitably result in service cutbacks the house budget committee restores 700 million and rejects the cap the proposed education block giantsi will cut 1 5 billion or 25 percent irn fiscal year 1982 the administration claims that increased efficiencies will result in the same level of service to our schoolchildren when administrative costs average 4 percent it is more realistic to assume savings on the order oi 1 or 2 percent rather than 25 percent the school districts which will suffer from these cuts will be those with the largest enrollments of lowincome students the budget committee restores 900 million or 15 percent of these education cuts the administration proposes 700 million in afdc cuts that eliminate the work incentive this cut is shortsighted and bad social policy the budget committee restores 500 million and preserves the work incentive the administration cuts 2 3 billion in child nutrition programs which will force many schools to elin~inate their school lunch and nutrition education programs altogether the budget committee restores 1 1 billion of these cuts and fully funds the wic program for mothers and infant cliiidren at a time when rental housing in urban areas is in short supply and rents rising the administration proposes to reduce subsidized housing from 250 000 units to 175 000 units the committee resolution funds a level of 250 000 units while we are still dependent on foreign energy supplies the administration proposes to rely on the inequitous technique of energy conservation through price grammlatta proposes to cut 1 billion from conservation and solar programs the committee restores 350 million for these programs qrammlatta suggests a cut of 25 percent in lowincome energy assistance the committee restores 400 million or 80 percent of these cuts finally grammlatta assumes that the strategic petroleum reserve can be entirely funded through the sale of bonds it is bad policy to rely totally on untested schemes in so important an area as quickly filling spro the committee provides for partial financing with government backup with the administration cuts we mortgage our future the latta proposal guts the guaranteed student loan and pell grant programs at a time when we must educate young people to be more productive in a world where our ability to compete is eroding the committee restores 650 million for these programs grammlatta guts ceta training at a time when minority youth unemployment is between 40 and 50 percent we will create a permanent underclass with this kind of proposal the committee restores 600 million for training grammlatta mainly assumes that the private sector will provide capital resources for highways railroads mass transit longterm scientific research and development and support for the arts and humanities it assumes the private bar will provide legal services for the poor the reason the federal government is involved in these activities is because the private sector cannot or will not afford them in all of these areas the committee assumes that there must be a federal presence equally bad is that grammlatta assumes the kemproth tax cut its obvious inequities aside kemproth is inflationary we need no more proof that the recent rise in interest rates which the administration is now blaming on the federal reserve the committee tax cut is smaller and more oriented to productivity than consumption when the economy declines further the administration will find another scapegoat in the end the american people will put the blame where it belongson poorly conceived and poorly implemented shortsighted reagan policies the real issue is whether we attempt to cut the budget on the backs of the poor the elderly the hungry the unemployed the deprived and the disabled or whether we move in a more equitable and

that is renewable that now supplies more net energy than nuclear power that can be used as a liquid gas or solidfuel that is labor intensive that is available in great supply in the northeast midwest that is economical now and could provide several times the amount of clean lowcost energy that it does now that energy source is wood the office of technology assessment estimates that wood can provide up to 10 quadrillion btus between 10 and 20 percent of our protected energy needs by the year 2000 the ota adds that this can be done without disrupting the supply of wood or agricultural products for uses other than energy however ota points out that this depends on the level of government involvement in fact unless the federal government cin provide better information and assistance on wood energy we will be taking some serious risks with the combined pressures of possible price increases for most other energy sources and the ever present threat of foreign oil shortages energy users may turn to whatever sources are at hand the maine audubon society has studied the issue and concluded that with a strong wood energy program forests can be improved but without a strong program an energy emergency could do great damage to forests particularly in the oildependent northeast with proper planning and assistance now our wood reserves could take the sting out of an oil boycott or a severe winter a study done for the federal emer gency management agency concluded that dispersed energy sources such as wood are best for the nation in terms of security reliability and national defense the vast potential for renewable energy that can be generated where it is needed rather than imported and the fact that the federal government was not paying much attention to this source of energy led to the formation of the congressional wood energy caucus in early 1980 although the wood energy caucus has members from the south and from the west over twothids of its 29 members are from the northeastmidwest region in briefings and hearings initiated by members of the wood energy caucus the federal wood energy efforts have been shown to be far short of efforts recommended by the government accounting office and off target in terms of the greatest potential for energy supply and secuirity as identified by ota and other expert groups let me give some concrete examples the gao points out that over 120 million is spent every year just to dispose of wood residues on forest service land often by simply burning the wood in the forests the gao recommends that a small fraction of that amount could pay for pilot projects around the country to show how these residues could be used productively for energy the agriculture department has the authority to do those studies and to spend the money that way the gao reported that if the 600 million dry tons of unused wood residue that is available each year could be used to replace oil we could reduce imports by almost 85 percent the gao identified barriers that exist which prevent more efficient use of this waste wood these are lack of information on the availability of wood lack of investment capital needed for harvesting and using residues and a limited awareness of wood energy and product technology among industrial firms utilities and state and local bodies among others the gao testified before the forests family farms and energy subcommittee of the agriculture committee on their recommendations saying it may also be necessary for the federal government to promote markets for these wood residues by making potential customers aware of the resources and more importantly of existing and emerging technologies which make increased wood use feasible this communication process may require that the federal agencies demonstrate the use of wood residues and sponsor demonstration of new technologies let me provide an example from my own district of what this can mean to the private sector the dow corning corp is now finishing a 22megawatt cogeneration plant that will be fueled primarily with waste wood thei supervisor of natural resources testified at another hearing that with management less than 2 percent of the private forest land within 75 miles of midland mich can supply all of the energy the dow corning plant will need on a regular renewable basis 1 asked him earlier why this was not being done by the private sector everywhere that forests and industry are near each other he felt that the main reason is a lack of information he said that the information the private sector needed is in the hands of the federal government he said this could be provided by an extension service type of approach when president reagan first took office several of the founding members of the congressional wood energy caucus wrote to him we reminded him that one of his own radio commentaries was devoted to promoting waste wood for clean renewable energy on a scale large enough to produce far more energy that we import in oil yet we pointed out that the entire doe budget for wood and other biomass energy was only onetenth of 1 percent of the overall doe budget and wood was only a part of that from a high point of over 40 million under the last administration the doe biomass budget has been reduced at the request of the administration to 20 million with a recommendation that it be cut to less than 7 million for fiscal year 1983 furthermore the very programs most urgently needed according to gao and private sector experts have been eliminated excellent and vital work remains but key efforts to bridge the gap between industry and government have been stopped in wood as in other areas of renewable energy and energy conservation even the energy information agency has backtracked on wood energy information they refuse to publish information in the monthly energy review that has already cost a considerable amount to produce several members of the wood energy caucus were joined by other key members this year in urging the appropriations committee of the house to specifically require a more balanced wood energy program of a size more suited to the potential energy reward wood for energy can provide significant income for farmers and other rural landowners it can even turn a disposal problem into an asset for cities and towns it caln keep muchneeded cash in the northeastmidwest and other forested areas it can provide ethanol methanol methane and various forms of solid fuels for home or industrial use while producing almost no sulfur dioxideacid rainunlike coal it can provide jobs in large numbers for workers with relatively little training it can complement other forms of energy and other sources so that we can use the right technology and the right energy source for every job and do it economically can you imagine that even ireland is growing short rotation wood crops for energy on top of the same peat bogs that they have cut for fuel for centuries meanwhile similar programs are scheduled to be cut in next years budget in this country we could be exporting wood energy technology to a world that derives 8 percent of its energy from wood but not as efficiently as it could instead we keep importing oil this administration continues to make the same mistakes in the area of energy what can we say at this point but there you go again i want to thank

summary of the news and one context in which to view it cocoa fla 15 building trades workers were killed when an underconstruction condominium collapsed 51 workers died when a platform fell 3 years ago at a construction site in west virginia kellogg idaho one silver miner was killed and another injured by a rock burst in the sunshine silver mine 91 men died in the sunshine mine in 1972 the worst

cold stares the everaccurate critic that tears down the success stories and monuments mankind would offer as masterworks of imagination reality is a rude relentless uncooperative fatherless maverick and it is with us always the only way to master reality is to use it not fight it someone more experienced than i in the affairs of mankind once offered this formula regulate the imagination by reality instead of thinking how things may be see them as they are i would amend the advice to read see them as they are and act accordingly i worry that in our collective rush our collective mandate to fix the economy to revitalize industry in short to make a political masterwork we forget the harshest most unforgiving critic much regulation in all fields has been approached idealistically foolishly unimaginatively stupidly dogmatically harmfully and this has firmly written the terms catch 22 and murphys law into the language but that means it should be made better not erased reality also is that the mine safety and health administration brought about a reduction in mining deaths of about 15 percent comparing last year with the year before the reduction is respectable and significant it shows regulation will work further reality is that the gao has attributed recent declines in coal production to labormanagement problems and failure to adopt new technology rather than to safety regulation and reality is that all mining activity particularly coal will increase greatly under the spur of developing markets and administration policy but no one has been nominated to direct the mine safety and health administration as yet grain elevators particularly the big export elevators will be more active now that the grain embargo is gone the 62 deaths of the 2 explosionfilled months 3 years ago came at a time of high activity reality has warned us australia and other grainexporting nations handle their elevators without such a high cost in blood and bone labor secretary donovan and occupational safety and health secretary auchter set aside careers as construction executives to work in government and they are aware of a reality that might have escaped most of the house the reality is that 20 percent of all jobrelated deaths in 1979 were in construction which accounted for only 5 percent of the industrial employment the primary cause falls one brand of dogmatic idealism that ignored reality led to regulatory excesses that needed correcting because many dealing with regulation thought only of what might be but correction is not in dogmatically applying another kind of idealism that seeks to write what might be in production graphs and costbenefit curves and looks not for the total reality reality is that workers die violently and reality is that many deaths are avoidable either brand of dogmatism makes only controversy and strife not progress recently i read an old summation of an official report from last year that reviewed the handling

report on the foreign aid authorization we are under strong pressure from the administration to enact this legislation before the recess i want to say that the reason we can take up this conference report today only a week after the house passed its bill is because of the skill of chairman zablocki in conducting the conference and the hard work of the committee staff in getting the conference materials together literally overnight i hope this cooperative attitude on the part of our committee will be reciprocated by the administration in the form of faithful implementation of the provisions of this act as chairman of the subcommittee on interamerican affairs i want to comment on some of the major provisions pertaining to latin america on el salvador we succeeded in retaining language in the bill which will insure that our military aid to el salvador is used only to support human rights economic and political reforms and a political solution to the conflict in el salvador under the compromise bill the president will be able to continue to provide military aid to el salvador only if 30 days after the enactment of this act the prepident is able to certify the following first that the government of el salvador is making a concerced and significant effort to comply with internationally recognized human rights second that the government of el salvador is achieving substantial control over alland i emphasize the word all elements of its own armed forces so as to bring to an end the indiscriminate torture and murder of salvadoran citizens by these forces this condition will strengthen the hand of president duarte in curbing abuses by his military and security forces that just drive people into the hands of the left i would call attention to the language of the foreign affairs committee report on this condition which is governing since the conferees adopted the house provision the committee wants to make its intent clear it expects that the president will certify that this condition has been fulfilled only if the salvadoran government has actually made bubstantial progressin inng control over all elements of its are focs neither vague commitments to enact reforms at some point in the future nor public statements by government leaders to the effect that they were trying to achieve such control would be a sufficient bases for a presidential certification that this condition had been satisfied what the committee is looking for is real rather than rhetorical progress third that the government of el salvador is making continued progress in implementing essential economic and political reforms including the land reform program although we lost the specific reference to the private sector contained in the house bill i believe it would be in accord with the will of the congress for the administration to include in its certification information on the governments support for the private sector fourth that the government of el salvador i~s committed to the holding of free elections at an early date and to that end has demonstrated its good faith efforts to begin discussions with all major political factions in el salvador which have declared their willingness to find and implement an equitable political solution to the conflict with such solution to involve a commitment to a a renouncement of further military or paramilitary activity and b the electoral process with internationally recognized observers this is perhaps the most important condition in that it reverses the fundamentally mistaken aspect of the administrations policy which precludes a political settlement of the conflict by opposing talks unless the left gives up and lays down its arms under this language the government of el salvador could receive no further military assistance from the united states if it refused to enter into discussions with the left so long as the left declared that it was willing to seek a political solution and that the political solution would involve an end to violence and elections this langauge does not require negotiations about power sharing nor does it prejudge what topics the discussioffs would cover each party would be free to propose its own agenda all the language requires is a willingness to talk no one loses anything by talking fifth that the government of el salvador has made good faith efforts to investigate the murders of the six united states citizens in el salvador in december 1980 and january 1981 and to bring to justice those responsible for those murders all conditions except the fifth would have to be recertified every 6 months for the aid to continue it is clear that the president could not make these certifications at this time the intent of the language is to give the administration leverage with the salvadoran military in order to induce it to cooperate with president duarte in improving the human rights situation furthering reforms and achieving a political solution to the conflict without these conditions the military has no incentiv e to cooperate and a favorable solution to the conflict is impossible be ember 16 1981 december 16 1 981 co i want to close by talking briefly about the provisions relating to argentina and chile the cinferees adopted provisions repealing prohibitions on security assistance to argentina and chile these sanctions were imposed as a response to massivea human rights violations by the governments of those two countries and in the case of chile to the murders of orlando letelier and ronni moffitt i believe the repeal of these prohibitions represents a recognition on the part of the members that these sanctions have served their purpose and it is time to begin to try to improve relations with these two countries that is debatable but it is the will of the congress and the president and i am prepared to support it no sanction can last forever sooner or later the time comes when sanctions must be removed it is the judgment of the congress that for argentina and chile that time is now but it is very important in removing these sanctions not to send the wrong signal it is important that this action be construed not as an abandonment of our human rights policy but as a new stage in the implementation of that policy it must be clear that we are taking this action because of improvements in human rights in those countries and in expectation of further improvements i have opposed removing the sanctions not because i do not believe in removing them but because of the administrations refusal to make this clear i am gratified that the conferees have agreed to make clear in the ian guage the continuing commitment of the congress to human rights in argentina and chile and our intent that the development of a military relationship with those countries should go hand in hand with human rights improvements specifically under the language before he can provide security assistance to argentina the president must certify that argentina has made significant progress in complying with internationally recognized human rights in making that certification he must consider efforts by the government of argentina to provide information on the disappeared and to release or bring to justice the pen prisbners to provide security assistance for chile the presi~dent must make the same certification with respect to human rights and must also certify that chile is not aiding or abetting international terrorism and has taken appropriate steps to bring to justice those indicted in connection with the leteliermoffitt murders in addition the managers state that in determining whether chile has made the requisite progress in human rights the president must consider whether the government of chile is ending the practices of internal exile and forced expulsion and is allowing those citizens who desire to return home to do so and whether the government of chile is permitting internationally recogized human ri ghts commissions to investigate human rights abuses i believe the house did well in the conference with respect to those provisions of the bill affecting latin

assistance it is also clear that the congress did not intend this determination to be made publicly finaly the record of the carter administra~tion demonstrates without any doubt that it did make determinations that a government was a consistent and gross violator of human rights it did so in the course of policy making as a matter of law the reagan has staked out its legal position in testimony before the subcomamittfes on international development of the house banking committee and the subcommittees of human rights and interamerican affairs of the house foreign affairs committee

is not characterized by a consistent pattern of gross violations in other words the administration contends that it does not have to make a human rights judgment even a private judgment on every country considered for assistance it only has toshow after assistance has been grante d that the recipient government is not a gross and consistent violator these are very clever arguments they are

congresses i feel today as strongly as i ever have that the 25th amendment is a threat to orderly and most important elected government in this country we value our constitution because it assures that the government is elected and that it is bound by laws but laws and constitutions are only as strong as the will of the people to keep them a government respects law only if its leadership is committed to law and we know that this is not always the case in the 25th amendment we have a device that is intended to provide for an orderly succession in the office of president but what we also have is a standing invitation to overthrow the president through the operation of the disability clause we have already lived through the reality of an unelected vice president who succeeded an elected president in that circumstance it was the criminal culpability of the vice president that led to his resignation and later the criminal conduct of the president that forced him to resignleading to the first and only time in our history that we have had an unelected president what few people remember is that before president nixon resigned it was his chief of staff together with the secretary of state who contemplated using the 25th amendment to force him out of office if he did not quit even though the 25th amendment was not invoked the presidents powers were effectively shorn because those same two individuals issued orders that they had to approve anything ordered by the president in other words the president might issue commands but they were dead letters this is as close to a palace coup as this country has ever been the fact was that mr nixon was viewed by his staff as dangerous and irresponsible they were operating outside the law and outside the constitution by isolating him and not invoking the judgment of anyone else it was perhaps a wellmeant conspiracy but a conspiracy nevertheless they had the tool of the 25th amendment to use as a last resort but they did not need to now we see alexander haig who was that chief of staff as the secretary of statethe keeper of the seal he is in a position of great power greater by far than he enjoyed as chief of staff under nixon we know that mr haig did not then and will not today hesitate to use his considerable powers to get his wayand the way could be inviting whereas mr nixon was criminally guilty and under broad attack mr reagan is of an age where his powers might suddenly wane mr haig did not hesitate to become de facto president in 1974 and he would not hesitate to do so again the 25th amendment allows the president to be declared disabled but by whom by unelected officers of the government i do not think the constitution ever intended that the unelected should have the power to unseat the elected the amendment assumes that all the presidents staff and cabinet are loyal to him that they will not develop ambitions to unseat him but we have already seen what happens when the country is in the grip of a political firestorm the president finds himself isolated and then gently forced from office by his friends who it turns out have other loyalties other wishes than to serve their erstwhile leader i certainly am no apologist for nixon but i say that it was the power and duty of the congress to remove him if march 1 1 981 that were to be the outcomenot the power of his staff to force him out the constitution gave the power of judgment to the congress which is elected and not to al haig or henry kissinger who were not the actions of haig and kissinger were taken they say because they were responsible to the office of president more than to the president himself but that begs the issue the fact is they were not being loyal to the constitution which provides a way to eliminate a president who has commit ted high crimes that is a power not delegated to anyone but the congress but there is the rub the 25th amendment blurs this power by delegating it to those who surround the president by allowing the president to be declared disabled the amendment hands the presidents advisers a complete power to force him out of office in a time when he faces the judgment of congress or of the people this is exactly what happened in 1974 this should not be the case it is extremely unlikely that any circumstance would every arise when a president would in fact by justifiably removed by operation of the 25th amendment even if you did have a case in which the president were gravely ill this would not develop so fast or last so long that the congress could not in behalf of the people make that decision if there were a wilson situation congress would have the time to make the necessary judgment of the presidents ability to serve if there were a repetition of the garfield case there would be time to let congress judge the disability the point is the right to judge a presidents ability to serve in office ought never to be given to the hands of a small unelected undefined group of people as it is in the 25th amendment that kind of power should never be exercised by any but the representatives of the people the congress it is far less likely that the congress being large and diverse and directly accountable would ever seek to conspire against a president than would a small group of ambitious cabinet officers a congressional conspiracy would in fact be impossible quite unlike the possibilities that exist under the arrangements of the 25th amendment possibilities that have been clearly revealed in 1974 and which we ignore today at our own peril if we must have a power given to declare a president disabled or the office vacant we should not dare give that power to anyone but the congress the best thing that can be said about the 25th amendment is that it might work but it is far less likely that it really protects the constitution than it is that it endangers the right of the people to elect a president who will remain in office

escalation in armed hostilities in el salvador over the last several weeks and the administrations stepped up security commitments to the duarte government indicate that the circumstances of the conflict in el salvador are changing rapidly from those a year ago when the administration assured members of this house it had no legal obligation under the war powers resolution to report to congress on the involvement of unitedstates military personnel in el salvador in a memorandum early last year the administration argued that unitedstates advisers in el salvador were not engaged in hostilities nor equipped for combat nor located in areas where such involvement would likely occur it is no longer clear that such a legal judgment holds true today the war powers resolution by which our current military involvement in el salvador must be judged calls on the president to consult with congress before introducing unitedstates armed forces into hostilities or into situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances further in any case in which such forces are introduced into hostilities or are in danger of imminent involvement in hostilities or when forces are introduced into the territory of a foreign nation while equipped for combat with certain exceptions such as training of in numbers which substantially enlarge unitedstates armed forces equipped for combat already located in a foreign nation the president is required to submit a report within 48 hours to the congress stating the circumstances requiring the involvement of unitedstates military personnel the statutory basis for his declsion and the estimated scope and duration of hostilities or involvement the resolution provides further that such forces will be withdrawn within 60 days after the president reports to congress that he has introduced such forces unless congress acts to authorize the continued presence of unitedstates military personnel in the area concerned in response to questions raised concerning the administrations obligation under the war powers resolution a year ago the state department submitted a memorandum to the congress stating that provisions of the war powers resolution did not apoly to the serding of unitedstates military advisers to el salvador because they had not been introduced into hostilities nor were they in danger of imminent involvement in iuch hostilities instead unitedstates personnel would be stationed in carefully selected areas and special precautions would be taken to provide for their constant security unitedstates personnel would neither accompaty salvildoran forces in combat situations nor act as combat advisers and would carry only personal sidearms recent events in el salvador have proved sufficiently alarming to the administration to prompt a tripling of our security assistance to the duarte government and to publicly leave the door ajar to the possibility of sending additional advisers and even unitedstates combat troops these events require that the administration thoroughly reevaluate its legal obligations to the unitedstates congress under the war powers resolution the bold guerrilla attack on ilopango air bape on january 27 1982 the destruction of the golden bridge over the lempa river in october and other examples of major guerrilla operations in the countryside and cities suggest a new level of confidence combat capability effectiveness and determination on the part of the armed guerrillas in stark contrast to the lack of such qualities a year ago during the socalled final offensive not only are the guerrillas apparently stronger today than they were a year ago but their effective military reach has expanded no longer is violence limited primarily to rural areas but it has instead spread into the capital and major salvadoran governmental military installations even the secretary of state has acknowledged that an unpredictable environment exists in el salvador today no longer can the administration have the confidence that unitedstates personnel can be safely stationed in areas of security rather there is the increasing prospect that unitedstates personnel may be inadvertently drawn into the crossfire between government and guerrilla forces the guerrillas have also made it abundantly clear in recent weeks that they intend to continue to escalate their violence in an effort to disrupt the elections scheduled for the end of march although the administration assured us a year ago that unitedstates advisers would be limited exclusively to training roles and would in no fashion be involved in combat or operational patrols nor in combat advisory roles it is increasingly unclear where the line between training and implicit us involvement in the actual planning and conduct of salvadoran government military operations is drawn the recently publicized film unitedstates personnel armed with m18 rifles suggests first that the administrations commitments to congress that unitedstates personnel would carry only personal sidearms has been violated and second that the level of danger of unitedstates personnel has increased to the point where our advisers themselves feel a compelling need in the interest of selfdefense to carry more than just personal sidearms under such circumstances it is clear that the prospect of american soldiers becoming casualties in the salvadoran war has increased dramatically finally the reporth last week regarding the stationing of a unitedstates navy destroyer off the gulf of fonseca add to the apprehension of many who view the presence of unitedstates warships with unitedstates military personnel on board in an area of tension and hostilities as a risk of potentially great consequences it would appear that the administration is treading dangerously close to the legal borderline and is at a minimum testing the authority of the war powers resolution if the administration believes that it is in the vital interests of the united states to keep or increase unitedstates military personnel in el salvador it should reconsider seriously its obligations to comply with the war powers resolution many observers inside and outside the unitedstates government have already concluded that the sending of unitedstates military advisers has been counterproductive to unitedstates policy interests and find now the difficult question to be one of how the united states can reverse this illadvised policy decision before the consequences of one wrong decision are compounded by the consequences of others accordingly this past week in a series of letters to the president i have proposed that tbe administration accept the offer of president lopez portillo of mexico to use his good offices as an intermediary in seeking political reconciliation in central america as a first step i have urged the president to anrounce that the unitedstates advisers will be withdrawn from el salvador upon the successful completion of the march elections regardless of who wins these advisers have become a symbol of american reliance upon military means of support for a government unable to control the excesses of its own military esthblishment in a situation where the fundamental problems are rooted in poverty illiteracy and social injustice the very presence of american military forcesregardless of whether they are carrying armshas had the unfortunate effect of closely identifying the united states with the human rights violations of the salvadoran military and converting what bevr s an essentially internal conflict i ato an anticolonialist struggle one of the problems of n great power is how to extricate itsulf from an illconsidered policy in vietnam 3he commitment of a small number of troops and the failed polities that followed led to the commitment of greater numbers and to policies that failed to an even greater degree by removing the advisers from el salvador at an early stage president reagan has a unique opportunity to rectify rather than multiply a mistake few american policymakers consider our sending of advisers to have been anything but a mistake not only have the advisers opened the unitedstates to international criticism from friend and foe alike but it is difficult to believe that a contingent of this minimal size could have a significant impact on the ability of salvadoran authorities to cope with insurgency the problem from a policy point of view is how to establish an appropriate quid pro quo for disengagement in the midst of the vietnam conflict henry kissinger proposed a series of very reasonable deescalation measures to the north vietnamese the problem was they were rejected and the nixon administration got locked into escalating a conflict at a time when prudence indicated the reverse course of action while vietnam analogies are not all appropriate the reagan administration would be well advised not to tie as secretary haig has proposed reduction in the number of our advisers to the actions of other states in the region policy options should be controlled in washington and not become subject to the whims of militaristic potentates bent on irrational behavior the objective of unitedstates cooperation with el salvador should be to encourage and facilitate the holding of free elections not to determine the outcome there would seem little reason to maintain military advisers after elections are successfully completed if the moderate forces of president duarte should prevail a good case could be made that having won a mandate in free elections the presence of american military advisers would no longer be needed less direct forms of support and assistance would be sufficient if the extreme right should emerge in power as many now conjecture withdrawal of our advisers would be a desirable means of disassociating the united states from the human rights violations that would likely insue at the same time announcement that a fiee election is our objective and that the advisers would be withdrawn following its successful completion would remove one of the main justifications for the extreme lefts effort to prevent salvadorans from going c the polls at the heart of the problem in central america and the caribbean basin is an assessment of whether problems are essentially rooted in longstanding patterns of injustice as the unitedstates catholic conference asserts or whether fundamentally the dilemma is one of castroite intervention as secretary haig contends if the former view is given greater weight a policy of economic assistance seems most in order if the latter military options come more to the fore conservative advocates of interventionism have a tendency to exaggerate the castroite dimension of the problem and underestimate the potential counterproductive effects of an overt unitedstates response liberal critics of american foreign policy on the other hand have a tendency to be overly generous in their assessments of the ideals and intentions of insurgency movements perhaps the most appropriate perspective is to recognize the social and economic inequities that exist but not to sympathize with the radical alternatives presented the united states has a profound influence over events in the caribbean but that influence is exercisedmost effectively when active american involvement is limited to economic assistance and peace corps kinds of activities military options dont solve social problems on the other hand economic assistance in some circumstances may not be enough but the united states acting alone on behalf of and within the confines of a smaller latin state is likely to exacerbate rather than diminish hostilities strategic options are far better exercised in concert with other latin states and at this time the most hopeful strategic initiative would appear to be the one proposed by mexican president lopez portillo his specific suggestions may be imperfect but the offer of his offices as a neutral intermediary may be the best chance to achieve a reduction in central american tension available president reagan risks a great deal if he too lightly spurns the assistance of our increasingly important neighbor to the south the president also risks support of congress and the american people if he does not comply with

reauired under section 303a h 2 a the thrust of these amendments which were worked out by the minority and majority staffs of the education and labor committee is to more closely conform language in h r 5540 to language relating to labor standards agreed upon in h r 5320 the job training partnership act passed by the house august 4 and approved by the conference committee i understand those amendments are also acceptable to the banking committee two of these amendments concerning safety and health standards and workers compensation coverage relate to amendments which i offered before the education and labor committee and which were adopted by the committee the language i propose today tracks the health and safety language precisely and is a modification of the workers compensation language the health and safety amendment provides that where federal and state safety and health standards apply they shall be applicable to working conditions of participants the banking committee bill speaks of appropriate standards for health and safety and other standards but does not define them this amendment makes clear that standards already law apply and that this bill is not preempting or expanding them in any way as i just mentioned the health and safety amendment is that which was adopted by our committee not that which was adopted in h r 5320 let me explain why in h r 5320 there might be instances where participants could be state employees within a state which does not have a state plan under osha in such a case the amendment in h r 5320 provides that the secretary of labor shall prescribe health and safety standards as may be necessary to protect participants in h r 5540 however all participants fall into the private sector none will be state employees therefore the additional protections afforded in the job training bill are not relevant here the first part of the workers compensation amendment i propose todaythat when state workers compensation laws are applicable they shall be available to participants if in accordance with such lawis identical to my committeeadopted amendment and to the first part of my amendment to the job training bill however there might be participantsunlikely but possiblein a state with a voluntary workers compensation lawthere are threeand whose employer does not subscribe to workers compensation coverage to assure coverage of participants in this narrow category the second part of my workers compensation amendment states that where state workers compensation laws do not apply the secretary shall prescribe regulations requiring recipients or subrecipients of funds to secure insurance to cover injury to participants it is questionable whether congress could constitutionally mandate state workers compensation on recipients where state workers compensation laws do not cover participants to the extent those state laws cover recipients the amendment recognizes those state laws where participants are not covered by state laws the amendment offers protection through requiring insurance coverage consequently no interference with state workers epmpensation laws the third amendment strikes subsec tion j vii involving union security which we agreed to strike in the job training bill union security should not be a concern of a training bill union security is already covered in labor law in the national labor relations act administered by the nlrb one agency and one law is sufficient to govern the issue and it should not be a training law at very least requiring a state to certify union security conditions is superfluous the fourth amendment provides that recipients of funds available under this act have given assurances to the state that such funds have not been used to assist promote or deter union organizing an improper use of funds under this bill or under current law although the language in the banking committees bill does not suffer the same defects as did the job training bill prior to my amendments the language is still imprecise and does not comport with the amended language in the job training bill to which the majority and minority of my committee agreed the job training bill originally provided as a matter of law that no funds could be used for such purposes this created a separate cause of action rather than create a separate federal cause of action apart from the national labor relations acts prohibitions and permissions the erlenborn amendment confined such prohibitions to contractual requirements and assurances in this manner the secretary can determine contractual language but no longer may conflict in his rulings with possible decisions of the nlrb the prohibitions in h r 5540 are similarly cast as contractual requirements and assurances but the two bills differ as to who gives those assurances in the job training bill recipients of funds provided those assurances while in h r 5540 the state provides the assurances my amendment would conform the bill to the job training bill to require a state to give such assurances rather than a recipient places an unnecessary and inappropriate burden on the state agency submitting the plan the responsibility for giving any necessary assurances in a certification process should rest with the party to whom the prohibi tion is directedin this instance the recipient i move the adoption of my

members of this body will be pleased to hear that most of the provisions of h r 5235 the foreign trade antitrust improvements act were included in the very form passed by the house on august 3 1982 the one fatality was the provision exempting joint ventures limited to export trade and foreign trade from coverage of section 7 of the clayton act i regret the loss of this provision which i attribute more to our hurried conference negotiations than to insuperable substantive objections on the part of the senate i hope that this issue can be addressed at some future time but we can be pleased that we did win provisions directly amending the sherman act and the federal trade commission act to place jurisdictional limits on these laws so that they will not apply to our export trade or to purely foreign trade unless the conduct in question has a direct substantial and reasonably foreseeable anticompetitive effect on our domestic commerce or on the commerce of exporters in the united states these provisions will benefit all american exporters whether or not they apply for certification the compromise certification procedure contained in the conference agreement is good legislation while the house had placed this procedure in the department of justice the compromise agreement places the procedure in the department of commerce but retains veto authority in the department of justice this veto authority was very important to the house since the matters to be decided when an exporter applies for a certificate of review are essentially antitrust mat ters the arrangement agreed upon in conference thus gives the primary administrative responsibility to the department of commerce without interfering with the mission of the department of justice to enforce the antitrust laws the most important issue regarding the antitrust title of s 734 concerned remedies to be accorded persons injured by certified conduct the normal rule is that victims of antitrust violations are accorded treble damages the senate version would have accorded zero damages to an injured partyeven to a unitedstates exporter even to a unitedstates exporter holding a certificate of review the house version itself was a compromise according the injured party single damages plus interest in lieu of treble damages for a violation of the antitrust laws the conference agreement retains the house version on single damages but does not retain the standard of the antitrust laws as such instead it adops the senate approach of substituting specific standards for the general antitrust laws standard but i wish to assure the members of the house that these specific standards four in number which are contained in section 303 a in no way compromise the purpose of the house version first of all the joint statement of managers makes clear that the general antitrust laws standard of the house version is contained within the four specific standards agreed to the difference is that the specific atandards are easier to understand andthis is importantthey are broader than the general antitrust laws standard thus under the conference agreement single damages could be assessed against a certificate holder for the reintroduction in this country of exported goods while such reintroduction may in fact be procompetitive and thus consistent with our antitrust laws a court could find that this violates the fourth standard of section 303 a and could subject the violator to singledamage liability also it should be noted that the third standard embraces unfair methods of competition today damages cannot be awarded for violations of this standarda standard generally agreed by antitrust experts to be broader than the provisions of the sherman act for violations of which damages do lie under the conference agreement certificate holders are subjected to this broader standard finally it should be noted that the first and second standard may also be broader than antitrust prohibitions for prices may be enhanced and coinpetition may be lessened even substantially without necessarily violating the antitrust laws the terms of these two standards are not exact antitrust terminology and thus some period of refinement will be necessary but w h respect to all four of them the house should be assured that they are at least as broad in their coverage as the antitrust laws how much broader the antitrust division the commerce department and the courts will have to hammer out over time since the conferees agreed to adopt these four specific standards in lieu of the general antitrust laws standard it was necessary to adopt other provisions to make clear that the disposition of these cases which will otherwise be antitrust cases proceed on the same procedural basis as antitrust cases it was also necessary to make clear the applicability of the antitrust civil process act to possible antitrust violations of the section 303 a standards other minor changes were made but in general the compromise agreement follows the format of the house version the house position has been ably defended in conference the four antitrust conferees voted for the

which rocked the streets of our nations capital on saturday was indeed shameful just as shameful as the prejudicial attitudes of the klan in this country we should not concentrate on criticizing groups at this time but rather emphasize that washington d c is supposed to reflect the best of this nation the frightening ugly display on our citys streets did not do justice to the city or what it represents i wholeheartedly agree with the post editorial in calling for vigorous prosecution of those involved in the acts of violence and destruction which rocked the downtown area we must let these lawbreakers know that their action will not be tolerated i want to especially mention the police of this city many of whom sustained injury in the line of duty on saturday they responded with professionalism in quelling the disturbance and protecting the citizens and property of the city and they deserve special commendation use noven ber 29 1982 now we must go forward if anything saturdays demonstration has focused on the need to solve our problems not through hatred and violence but through love and reconciliation just think of the good which could have come if those in this

the label of antiklan protesters gives them a status they dont deserve to enjoy it is equally bubbleheaded to explain the violence and destruction as an outburst in reaction to unemployment the reagan adminis tration israel south africa or any of the other named objects of complaint all it took was a handful of practiced delinuents and troublehungry instigators to stir things up there are some episodes that have no handy builtin insights or great moral lessons to impartbut only selfevident truths to be understood foremost among such truths this weekend is that the ku klux klan is no less despicable because a crowd of vandals behaved so recklessly if the klan members bid for attention and trouble was an objective consider it accomplished but they were still bit players in the action their message no less ugly than it ever has been who got hurt not the klan all it may have gotten is the last laugh and thats a shame too bystanders were physically hurt police officers were injured people with messages of tolerance and words of peace were knocked around worst of all the people of washingtonthose whom the klan would like to hurt the mostended up with wounds that will be long in healing police chief maurice turner as much as anyone had his hands full and responded professionally to the pressures so did the rank and file who were stretched beyond instantresponse capabilities in many instances but who did what they could to arrest as many suspects as possible prosecution we expect will be vigorous this may not calm the understandably furious mer chants whose downtown stores and offices were destroyed but everyone deserves assur ances that the laws of the city are being enforced as effectively as possible washington has been and will continue to be host city to demsonstrators with messages that run the full range from the bigotry of the klan to what many would consider to be significant and important peti tions to their government in the past this city has reacted as well as any in ensuring the rights of peaceful protest while protecting all people from violence that was the assignment of the authorities on saturday and it will remain so"],

united statesa bill of rights which has helped guarantee all americans the liberty which we so cherish one hundred and fiftyseven years later on december 10 1948 the united nations adopted the universal declaration of human rights an effort aimed at securing basic human rights for the people of ail nations each of these great documents was born after the bloodshed of a bitter war we remember the great sacrifices americans have made for 200 years from the revolutionary war in which our ancestors pledged their lives their fortunes and their sacred honor to the wars of this century in which hundreds of thousands of young americans and millions of others gave their lives on the battlefields of europe asia andl africa in the struggle for freedom and yet even today as we celebrate bill of rights day and human rights day we all arb only too well aware that the individual rights do clared in these documents are not yet respected in many nations we have learned that the lesson our founding fathers taught is as true today as it was two centuries agoliberty depends not upon the state but upon the people liberty thrives in the free association of citizens in free institutions families churches universities trade unions and a frqe press mankinds best defense against tyranny and want is limited governmenta government which empowers its people not itself and which respects the wit and bravery the initiative and the generosity of the people for above all human rights of individuals rights of conscience rights of choice rights of association rights of emigration rights of selfdirected action and the right to own property the concept of a nation of free men and women linked together voluntarily is the genius of the system our founding fathers established we will continue to strive to respect these rights fully in our country and to promote their observance abroad we could have no greater wish for mankind than that all people come to enjoy these rights this year after nearly 20 years of effort the united nations human rights commission and the un general assembly have approved a declaration on the elimination of all forms of discrimination based on

children to worship god and that all religions must have the right to teach their faith to train their clergy and to observe their customs and holidays we in america are blessed with rights secured

designed to coordinate the disparate tourism activities of the different federal agencies t1 is council should serve to prevent policies from being adopted which are potentially injurious to the
