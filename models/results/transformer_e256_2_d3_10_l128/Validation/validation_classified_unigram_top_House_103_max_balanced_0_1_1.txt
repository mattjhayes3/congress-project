historically black colleges and universities this bill was introduced on august 6 1993 and was approved by the natural resources committee on november 10 1993 many of the historic structures located on historically black college and university campuses are threatened and a significant effort is needed to preserve and protect them the department of the interior in cooperation with the united negro college fund has launched a project to preserve these structures in 1988 a special survey to identify candidates for inclusion in this program generated responses from 46 hbcus nominating 144 structures for consideration the department and uncf eventually selected 11 of the most historically significant and critically threatened structures on such campuses the department and uncf estimate that it will cost 20 million to preserve these particular structures and uncf has agreed to match a departmental contribution of 10 million for this purpose under the hbcu historic preservation initiative however no funds were requested or appropriated for this purpose for fiscal year 1994 h r 2921 as reported by the committee on natural resources authorizes the use of appropriations from the historic preservation fund to provide grants for the preservation and restoration of historic buildings and structures at eligible hbcus in fiscal year 1995 a total of 20 million would be authorized 5 million of which may be used only for fisk university and 10 million of which may be used only for grants to those hbcus identified for inclusion in the interior departments hbcu historic preservation initiative for each of fiscal years 1996 1997 and 1998 15 million would be authorized federal funding for structures listed on the national register of historic places must be matched equally unless the secretary determines that an extreme emergency exists or that such waiver is in the public interest the bill as amended also stipulates that structures receiving federal funds may be altered later only with the concurrence of the secretary these structures represent the hopes and achievements of a group of people denied equal opportunity and justice and who succeeded despite the imposition of almost insurmountable legal and social obstacles in many cases the buildings were constructed by the students themselves many of them former slaves and came under constant attack particularly during the civil rights struggles of the 1960s and 1970s as symbols of africanamerican pride and progress national park system resources representing africaffamerican themes are notably scarce these institutions provided the only avenue to a better life for many africanamericans and provided this country with some of its greatest leaders including many current members of congress the inadequacy of the africanamerican theme representation in the national park system makes this program to recognize the importance of hbcus to our nation critical the historic preservation fund through which this grant program will be funded is authorized at 150 million each fiscal year through 1997 and the total amount authorized for the fund since fiscal year 1977 remains available until appropriated of the funds appropriated for historic preservation through the hpf the amounts cited in this bill may be used for preservation specifically at hbcus this bill does not authorize new spending but allows already authorized funds to be spent on these significant and underfunded resources the testimony received at the hearing from the many presidents of hbcus provided moving and eloquent affirmation of the significance of these resources and their importance to the africanamerican experience many of our colleagues have expressed strong support for this legislation and several were able to attend the hearing and voice powerful personal confirmation of the education and cultural values represented by these structures with enactment of this legislation we will have taken an important step in recognizing the importance of these institutions to africanamerican advancement in this country and i urge my colleagues to support this bill"], [0.009530282579362392,

distributed cocaine freely at many parties and he was convicted convicted by the arkansas authorities of trafficking in cocaine he received a prison sentence and his prison sentence was partially reduced after he got out of prison he was in a halfway house for a few months he was pardoned exonerated by thengovernor clinton his friend during the time that he was incarcerated in this halfway househe really was not in a penitentiary he was in a halfway house most of the time during the time he was incarcerated a lady named patsy thomasson who is his chief financial officer took over control of his businesses and she ran his businesses as the chief financial officer while mr lasater was away at prison when he got out and was pardoned by president clinton ms thomasson continued to be the chief financial officer of his companies and she also became the chief officer of what was called the phoenixthe phoenix group a subsidiary of the phoenix group was the phoenix mortgage co and mr lasater became the president of the phoenix mortgage co so the relationship between patsy thomasson and mr lasater and bill clinton was of long duration and continued even after he went to jail and was out as a matter of fact mr lasater paid an 8 000 drug debt drug bill for cocaine use that bill clintons brother had incurred so he paid off a drug bill for bill clintons brother so there was a very close relationship between the clintons and mr lasater now patsy thomasson to give you some more background my colleagues now is one of the chief officers at the white house she is the personnel director at the white house she conducts quote unquote the drug testing of personnel at the white house now yesterday the people of albuquerque nm awoke to another tale of corruption that may involve the president president clinton the front page of tuesdays albuquerque journal reports that ajoint federal state narcotics investigation of the presidents friend mr dan lasater was called off before it was completed a former arkansas state police investigator j n doc delaughter told two journal investigative reporters that the investigation included lasater a close friend of the president and highdollar contributor to mr clintons campaign and the presidents brother roger clinton delaughter said the investigation was cut off prematurely for political reasons the state police investigators say he briefed the clintonappointed arkansas state police director tommy goodwin twice by telephone about the lasater clinton investigation on both occasions tommy goodwin the state police investigator was using a phone in then governor clintons personal office mr delaughter who was then on the force was not sure whether or not governor clinton now president clinton overheard the conversations but it is very clear that governor clinton now president clinton was very close to the arkansas state police director who was getting the information about the investigation delaughter said and i quote moneys could have been seized and planes could have been seized because we had evidence that cocaine was being used on planes used by mr lasater as i said before mr lasater quite frequently flew then governor bill clinton around in these planes delaughter told the newspaper that he and another investigator were barred from interviews with lasater roger clinton and another lasater associate in other words his superiors on the state police said you cant go and investigate this they stopped him cold in his tracks eventually lasater was convicted of possession and distribution of cocaine as i said before he was sentenced to 30 months in prison but served only 10 months most of which was in a halfway house before being released on parole lasater was later paroled by his friend thengovernor bill clinton now right in the thick of all this is patsy thomasson who is now the personnel director at the white house she took over the daytoday operations of the lasater companies while lasater was in prison as i speak to you tonight she is responsible for the daily administration of the clinton white house the newspaper is careful to point out that there is no evidence to support any indictment of ms thomasson or establish a direct connection between the illegal activity that led to the conviction of lasater and the presidents brother now harkening back to an earlier washington scandal one has to wonder what did ms thomasson know about the illegal activity which surrounded her and when did she realize that her boss lasater was a largescale drug pusher the albuquerque journal found no one in that firm no one in that firm other than ms thomasson the chief financial officer had any doubt about what was going on in the lasater companies i quote the newspapers story former lasater employees interviewed by the fbi said tney left or joined the firm between 1982 and 1985 because of its reputation tor cocaine use as the chief financial officer for lasater during that period are we to believe that ms thomasson now the chief personnel director at the whitehouse haa no clue about what was going on in the company the albuquerque journal reported that the fbi received sworn statements from lasater employees therethat were there at christmas parties at which cocaine was available in ashtrays cocaine was freely available at lasater company outings in lexington ky hot springs ar and elsewhere according to lasater employees reporters dick lynch and mike gallagher quote federal grand jury testimony which said that cocaine was served like hors doeuvres but we are asked to believe that the chief financial officer even though everybody else in that firm knew about it knew nothing of this and we are talking about ms thomasson ms thomasson patsy thomasson was a key player in the lasater operations the newspaper cites numerous public and court records which show her as president of the various lasater enterprises including new mexicos angel fire corp which lasater purchased in 1984 and sold in 1987 articles of incorporation show that thomasson as an incorporator of the phoenix group which was the successor to lasater co records of the sale of angel fire in 1987 to a texas investment partnership bear patsy thomassons signature she was tied to mr lasater all the way through all of his operations at the time of this sale the customs service and the fbi were busy investigating money laundering and drug trafficking she signed the partnership agreement the two agencies formed an organized crime drug enforcement task force and named lasater as the chief target of the probe pasty thomasson was given power of attorney power of attorney by mr lasater in january 1987 while he was in prison and surprisingly appears to still be acting as a registered agent for lasaters phoenix mortgage co calls by the newspaper to patsy thomasson at the white house were not returned i understand ms thomasson has taken leave of absense from her position as the director of administration for the president i continue to be concerned about the presidents association with people like mr lasater pardoning him after he was convicted of dealing in drugs giving him 65 million i believe in state bonds during the time he was being investigated and later indicted by the arkansas state police and the federal authorities for drug trafficking i continue to be concerned about his association president clintons with people like mr lasater and ms thomasson in the very limited hearings that we had on whitewater"],

a future im happy to say that several members of this body have joined me in this call of support for our children the families and children of america are suffering and we cannot rescue one without saving the other as a noted child advocate has said and i quote it a community values its children it must cherish their parents my colleagues the care and nurturing of our families and children must become a national priority it is no longer acceptable to pay lip service to this issue not when 22 percent of all childrenmore than 1 out of 5live in poverty as a woman of color i cannot in good conscience keep silent when i know that more than half of those children 55 percent to be exactare africanamerican or hispanic in this land where the american dream still looms large as the one thing for which we should all strive there are people who toll at hardlabor every day of the week and only to find themselves still below the poverty level almost 12 percent of the families in this rich nation of ours make up the working poor and again for families of color the figure doubles to over 25 percent members of the house it is meanspirited and disgraceful that we continue to allow these conditions to exist there are those members in this body who would vote against any initiatives to help families and children while at the same time professing a deep love and devotion to our nation and this democracy to those members i say this is a shortsighted and hypocritical way to do business if you want to prove your allegiance to america then do it by standing up for those who will lead her into the 21 century members of the conference committee will have the opportunity to do that over the next few days as the budget reconciliation bill takes shape the measure that was approved by the house held four provisions that would put both our children and our families first those programs are childhood immunization earned income tax credit the mickey leland hunger program and the family preservation and support program i ask the members of the house for their continued support for these programs lets start with the immunization program dont let anybody tell you that parents can get their children immunized if they simply would make the effort to do it the numbers dont support that myth right now the rate of immunization against deadly childhood diseases in this country is a measly 55 percent how can we look ourselves in the mirror and say its ok for 55 000 children to be crippled or killed by a preventable disease like measles it happened in 1991 and will most certainly happen again how can we simply stand by and allow polio mumps rubella and meningitis to take this terrible toll on our children i submit to you that we cannot and before you tell yourself that the vaccines are available to everyone so we really dont need to do anything about this problem let me quickly tell you that the cost of immunizing a child jumped from 11 in 1977 to 133 in 1992 its called an economic deterrent many low and middleincome families who lack health insurance simply cant afford the service included in the house reconciliation legislation is a universal vaccine assurance system which would serve 11 1 million children who are now currently uninsured or underinsured medicaideligible or native american in north carolina 290 000 children would receive vaccinations 116 000 more than are currently eligible under medicaid i argue that providing vaccines for children is not only the morally right thing to do it is also fiscally sound let me remind my colleagues that 1 spent on immunizations now saves at least 10 in treatment down the road to sum it up briefly we can pay the bill now or pay it later the choice is ours with the issue of hunger i make the same plea we can provide children with the proper nutrition to grow strong bodies and healthy minds now or pay the consequences later the mickey leland food stamp provisions are critical to addressing the grievous problem of hunger the nationwide community childhood hunger identification project released in 1991 reported that 5 5 million american children under age 12 are hungry this means 1 out of every 12 furthermore an additional 6 million children find themselves in families that are at risk of hunger because sometimes these families in order to pay their utility bills in the winter can not afford to buy food these figures are astonishing in light of the abundance that we find in american agriculture onehalf of the recipients of food stamp benefits are children while 80 percent of the benefits in the program go to families with children put simply the food stamp program is the frontline of defense for preventing hunger in america over 96 percent of the benefits go to people at or below the poverty line most58 percentgo to households that are so poor that their income does not exceed half of the poverty line we must not accept hunger as a standard in this country the mickey leland provisions of the reconciliation bill speak to the problem of hunger by providing basic subsistence to those who are in desperate need i deeply urge my colleagues to support the efforts of individuals like the late mickey leland who died while attempting to address the deplorable conditions faced by the hungry on the african continent after we have fed our children and provided for their health we must help empower their working parents to lift themselves out of poverty that is the goal of the earned income tax credit program currently about 5 million americans work 40hour weeks and still remain below the poverty line it is a disgrace that individuals in america can work full time and never rise out of poverty in the house reconciliation bill families with two or more children that earn up to 8 500 a yearwhat fulltime minimum wage work now pays would receive a wage supplement to bring them to the poverty line i believe that an expanded eitc is essential to reward work and pave the way for welfare reform further the eitc would be of great benefit to low and moderate income working families in north carolina some 485 000 working families with children in north carolina received the fjtc in 1992 the expanded eitc program in the house passed reconciliation bill would have ensured that those workers with families and childless workers were brought up to the poverty line this is especially important in light of the increasing tax burden on the poor without an expanded eitc program which includes childless workers we will be taxing those poorest among us deeper into poverty i urge all members to show their support for this program especially to the finance committee of the senate and the ways and means committee of the house to work for its inclusion in the conference report finally i ask that my colleagues on the conference committee pay special attention to the family preservation and supportprovision contained in the housepassed reconciliation legislation last year 2 9 million children an average of about 8 000 a day were reported abused and neglected more than three children a day died of maltreatment the 1 5 billion included in the house package would help prevent this neglect and abuse and possibly offset more expansive social service programs by providing funds for family support programs that teach parents early how to protect nurture and support their children the funding will help states develop and expand programs for families in crisis to help keep children and parents together and will improve the quality of foster care for those children who cannot be protected at home the senate did not include the family preservation and support program in its version of the budget reconciliation legislation it is my sincerest hope that my house colleagues will prevail with the house provisions today we have the opportunity to tell the world that america values its children and families above all other things that we respect the sanctity of the family unit and will do all we can to support and encourage families to stay together and work for their goals with a vote for the initiatives i have outlined this evening we can begin to erase the social deficits that have plagued our society for more than two decades my dear colleagues let us begin today to secure americas future i yield to the

of the ocean we have been traversed by pirateers socalled discoverers interlopers and strategists all eager in some way so it seems to disposes us of our land for some grander purpose which we understood only imperfectly the land which is being returned through this bill was taken by the military after world war ii from families and individuals who are still very much with us today their saga is filled with stories of false promises and the inability to contest in a civilian court the militarys takings the land in question has not been used for decades the land has been declared excess by military strategists over 15 years ago it is about time that we return it to the people of guam it is about time that we do the right thing there is bitterness anger rage over the how the land was originally taken in guam but there is also hope and opportunity it is up to us here today to demonstrate that such hope and opportunity can override bitterness and rage through responsible

together to have a conversation with the american people on what is a watershed moment both for our nation and for this the 103d congress as we approach the approval of the economic package the budget package that the president of the united states has moved forward and has presented to the representatives of congress that will speak on behalf of those that they are privileged to represent we not only have the opportunity to reduce our federal deficit by record levels a half a trillion dollars the largest deficit reduction plan in the history of our nation but we have the opportunity to invest in the engine that drives our economy namely small businesses i am the daughter of a small businessman my father is 89 years old he retired at 82 and he was a watch maker and a jeweler all of his life i grew up in that business i was educated as a result of the benefits of that business i saw other people in our community employed in that business unfortunately in the last decade the federal government could have done a much better job in supporting this critical segment of our economy where 85 percent of all new jobs are created indeed during the last administration only 1 million private sector jobs were created one of the chief reasons in my view behind the small number was the lack of attention to small business and the lack of support for growth incentives we have the opportunity now to change this i am privileged to represent californias 14th congressional district the home of silicon valley where fledgling startup companies are the backbone of our local economy these companies are responsible for making the united states unbeatable in cutting edge high technology including electronics computers and biotechnology and many of these small companies have grown into some of the larger and more successful companies of our nation hewlettpackard apple and genentech are just a few that come to mind these companies employ thousands of americans and generate billions with a b of dollars of revenue each year but the other myriad small businesses in silicon valley employ thousands and contain within them the potential to grow and increase our nations competitiveness indeed silicon valley has been an incubator of small business ventures but we are in tough economic times and the companies in my district need the kind of incentives incorporated in the plan that president clinton has presented to the congress they need this not just to succeed but they need it to survive this should concern everyone because it is the brilliant minds behind these small companies that create the ideas and products that revolutionize our society and boost our international competitiveness key to the success of entrepreneurism and small business is its abilityto attract capital and obtain credit and loans president clintons plan will increase a companys ability to expense capital investments it includes a targeted capital gains tax which will produce the outcome we axe looking for job creation it will also produce something for investors in small businesses and it will result in lower borrowing costs the presidents plan also includes provisions that are critical for small businesses including a retroactive extension of the 25 percent deduction for health insurance premiums of the selfemployed a retroactive extension of the ability of state and local governments to issue taxexempt bonds for small business and i would like to add here that i came from local government i have regard for what they try to do and we need to be better partners with them this part of the presidents plan speaks to that also a retroactive extension of targeted jobs tax credit and relief from the alternative minimum tax for capital investments where did we come up with these ideas these ideas were hammered out and brought forward to the congress as a result of a young person who went across this country with senator gore campaigning and people across this nation especially small business owners said governor clinton this is what we need it is now contained in the plan that the president has presented to us these provisions are not only important to the high tech industry they are important for all small businesses in my district like robert cevasco who runs a nursery out on my coast side whole foods market that is next door to my district office in palo alto ca and spirals a gift center and contrary to opponents arguments the higher tax rate embodied in the clinton reconciliation bill will not adversely affect small business ninetysix percent of small businesses are exempt from new taxes i want to repeat that because there are so many people that are reading and being misled by so much of the rhetoric this is the truth 96 percent of small businesses are exempt from new income taxes i think that this is very good news if my dad were still in business he would applaud as we attempt to get our economic base in order it is most critical to reduce our deficit but we also have the opportunity to recommit ourselves to the creation of jobs and enterprise presidents clintons economic plan does this i urge my colleagues in both houses to take a second look if that is in fact what they need to at the attacks coming from those opposing the presidents plan in my view this plan to a handsdown winner not only for the people of my district the

the interstate to which my colleague from new york refers and the bridge that connects it is not a local road it is a road that is a part of the federal interstate highway system and the verrazano narrows bridge connects those two it is also the subject of a federal navigable waters bridge act and verrazano narrows bridge was implicitly constructed under federal statute so therefore the tolls on that bridge can in fact be regulated by congress the last point is that if this was in fact a local issue that pitted one district against another this would not have only been an issue handled by senator damato in the senate it was in fact an issue that despite the please of the mayor of the city of new york received the support and the assurances of senator franx lautenberg from new jersey as it did with the majority of the members of this body relative to both democrats and republicans from new jersey who believe that this is a federal interstate and therefore a very important venue of travel for residents of new jersey also into new york city and out so this is a lot more encompassing than just one borough against another let me make just one more point when we talk about revenues please understand and to those of you who are not from new york city this may be a subject that is absolutely inconceivable to you but please understand i represent a borough from the city of new york my colleague represents a borough from the city of new york my borough staten island is the only borough that does not have a free access road to another borough in the very same city the people that i represent have to pay in order to get home from work every day a 6 toll 5 out of that 6 leaves staten island and the majority of it goes into another borough called manhattan where it subsidizes mass transportation on the subway systems it subsidizes the long island railroad and train routes in new haven ct so this is an issue for the federal government to get involved in because it is an issue that discusses transportation fairness it discusses the ability of staten islandere to receive some relief while we continue to support the subsidies of other boroughs and also lastly it is an issue that affects two states new york and new jersey for that reason i understand when the issue did come up in the other body the support of senator lautenber helped to persuade this institution and
