of the committee mr de la garza and the subcommittee chairman mr paneita for supporting this important amendment i also want to note that this amendment is supported a wide range of organizations which represent farmworkers throughout the united states incuding the farmworkers justice fund the national council of la raza the association of farmworker opportunity programs and the unitedstates catholic conference the united farmworkers of california and texas the farm labor organizing committee of ohio and michigan the east coast farmworkers support network the american friends service committee and cata which represents puerto rican farmworkers in the united states the legislation before us today is intended to assist the victims of drought who are suffering economically as a result of agricultural losses this is a national calamity and it deserves a national response from the congress we need to respond to the economic needs of farmers and those in farmrelated businesses but let us not in our haste ignore the urgent needs of the most vulnerable drought victims americas farmworkers across this nation in ohio in michigan in the farm belt in the southwest there are thousands of homeless jobless and stranded farmworkersmany of them childrenwho are special drought victims they cant lose their farms they own no farms they cant lose their housing they have no housing they cant lose their unemployment benefits and their health care coverage they have none and in addition to homelessness and destitution they face another urgent crisis malnutrition that is something we can do something about today in this legislation that is what this amendment is about this special plight of farmworkers may sound familiar because the congress in 1982 enacted special rules to expedite the processing of food stamp benefits to migrant farmworkers but the reagan administration issued regulations last fall which severely underminded that law leaving thousands of farmworkers stranded without the ability to secure the food stamps they and their children desperately require and for which they are eligible those regulations say that vendor paymentslike emergency housing for destitute farmworkerscount as income and can deprive them of eligibility for food stamps as a result thousands of farmworkers must choose shall they endure homelessness to qualify for food stamps or nutritional deprivation in return for temporary shelter is that what this congress intended is that justice for farmworkers i am reminded of the proposed regulations by the reagan administration to deny supplemental security income benefits to the elderly who own a car or their home those regulations were withdrawn because of protests from elderly groups and their supporters in the congress i remember the refusal of the reagan administration year after year to require sanitation facilities and clean drinking water for farmworkers finally the courts and congress rose up to demand that the rules finally be issued i recall the proposal of governor reagan to reduce food stamp allocations to a pregnant woman because she was providing housing for her baby the courts threw out that twisted logic now in 1988 the reagan administration tells us that the poor family of a migrant worker must choose beween rudimentary housing and food between homelessness and starvation is it possible that we are describing america in 1988 sadly it is all time this amendment will restore the original intent of the congress action in 1982 by excluding emergency housing assistance to destitute migrant and seasonal farmworkers such as housing from designation as food stamp income and it should also be noted that under the law such emergency allocations as fuel car repairs and transportation home must be excluded as well this amendment deserves the support of every member in this chamber this amendment will also assure that migrant farmworkers will receive food stamps for their entire month in which they apply with any overpayments being subsequently deducted this will assure that a destitute farmworker family is able to buy necessary food immediately rather than await the start of a new month throughout this country there may be 50 000 farmworkers or more who are stranded by drought without crops to pick and therefore without an ability to support themselves or to return to their homes i want to commend chairman de la garza for taking the initiative of writing to secretary of labor mclaughlin requesting that she utilize the national activities account to direct emergency transportation and financial support to farmworkers and i call on secretary mclaughlin to act immediately if anyone doubts the emergency nature of this amendment or its appropriateness to the drought relief bill let us recall this fact a field which is not harvested this year will spring back again with next years rain a farmworker family decimated by impoverishment a child deprived of adequate nutrition a pregnant mother denied basic foodsthese drought victims cannot recover with a rainfall they will bear the scars of the drought of 1988 for a lifetime for amelia chavez a single mother of two stranded in liberty center oh for the six members of aurora ruiz family in texas rio grande valley for frank mcqueen a migrant fruit picker in the midwestfor these drought victims who have no voice to speak for them except this congress let us pass this amendment even in good times these farmworkerswho pick the crops and provide all of us with our foodlive close to poverty and despair now when the skies are clear and the fields are dry can we in good conscience tolerate any obstacles which prevent them from receiving the food assistance they so desperately need and which weby this votecan provide them i urge a yes vote on this amendment"], [0.0018569231033325195, 0.9981430768966675, 1, "senate concurrent resolution 149 is substantially identical to house concurrent resolution 33 which was ordered reported favorably by the committee on foreign affairs earlier today haiti today once again stands at a crossroads after 2v tumultuous years the haitian people have again gotten back to the point where they may be able to break with the past a past market by repression cruelty and corruption after the downfall of duvalier the people of the united states proved their willingness to help the haitian people in their struggle for economic development and social justice today we stand ready to help again once we know that the hand of tyranny has again been truly thrown off and we are certain that the will of the haitian people will not again be thwarted make no mistake about it this congress likes what it hears general avril saying with the support of the noncommissioned officers and the haitian army general avril and those supporting him have stated their desire to return haiti to the path toward democracy he has reached out beyond the army to involve the opposition leadership and other key groups in a national dialog and that is an important step toward national reconciliation we like what has been done with the removal from office some of the most notorious defenders of the old order determined to halt a transition to democracy the last few weeks have seemingly brought about an almost unbelievable transformation where there was despair there now is hope but we in the united states have learned through harsh experience that the performance of haitis leaders seldom has reflected their democratic rhetoric while we hope and pray that the apparent alignment of the haitian army with the desires of the haitian people will bring a new day united states policy must be based on reality and not expectations if we are to again provide large amounts of assistance to haiti it must be on the basis of haitian government performance toward achieving the goals of liberty justice and prosperity laid down by the haitian people in the constitution they approved overwhelmingly in 1987 general avril has spoken well of democracy but without free open and fair elections there is no democracy it is to be hoped that the new government of haiti will promptly set a date for elections in the not too distant future and that it will establish an electoral process that will have the respect and support of the haitian people the concurrent resolution before us today is offered neither in a spirit of concession or confrontation the resolution sets forth clearly and simply the sense of congress with respect to those goals to which we deem the haitian government must be committed if in behalf of the american people the congress is ever to approve providing assistance to the haitian government today no such assistance is provided it is forbidden by the appropriations law just enacted while assistance to the haitian people continues through private voluntary organizations this resolution would make explicit the intent of congress that aid to the haitian government not be resumed until and unless the government of haiti has taken clear and decisive actions to acheive certain specified goals these are not washingtons goals but goals repeatedly called for by the haitian people themselves what are the steps we expect the haitian government to take to embark on a credible transition to democracy based on the 1937 constitution and announcement of an election date to respect human and civil rights to reform the corrupt bureaucracy to promote economic development and to assure the personal security and right to assembly essential to grassroots development to step up cooperation with us on narcotics trafficking and to demonstrate the militarys willingness to accept civilian rule and to abide by haitis constitution section 2 of the resolution provides that it is further the sense of congress that we not have a regular and sustained assistance relationship with the government until a civilian government has been elected through free and open elections and further provides that no assistance should be given until after there have been full consultations with the congress by the executive branch sectioti 3 of the resolution declares congress support for the aspirations of the haitian people for an elected civilian government and for economic government and urges appropriate committees of congress to take whatever actions they deem appropriate to promote free elections either through positive steps such as assistance or through the enactment of economic sanctions such as those now pending in h r 4152 if progress is not made toward free elections section 4 of the resolution calls on the executive branch to work with our friends and allies to shape a multilateral policy toward haiti this resolution enacts no sanctions it lifts none it is offered at a time of hope and expectation as an expression of our willingness to work with haiti to achieve a democratic and effective government based on values shared by the haitian and american peoples i am confident that if progress in haiti is reflected by concrete actions the congress will give high priority next year to reviewing existing aid restrictions and especially to assure appropriate financial support for elections and a transition to democracy as chairman of the committee on foreign affairs i certainly intend to give haitian

california in san francisco at a commemoration a memorial tribute to one of the great people of the house sala burton basically what i said was that to me sala burton had the glamour of a marlene deitrich and the heart and good will of a mother teresa and the political savvy of a golda meir if anyone read the congressio al record when my distin guished colleague mr edwards dean of the california delegation introduced the privilege resolution they would know the overwhelming expression of grief and love for sala she was really a mother a sister and a friend to all of us she cared in a very special way for people she really did love her roots her family her country the congress and she had a real affectionthose callfornians stick togetherfor the california delegation she certainly loved san francisco she was extremely proud to represent and it was americas perfect city with its great diversity of people she meant very very much to the wives of the members of course she was the cofounder of the congressional wives task force and always reached out to make them feel a part of congress sala often told me of the pride and love she had for her daughter and her soninlaw and her grandchildren she admired her daughters abilities and independence her parents meant very very much to her her mother still is living god bless her and she had a marvelous impression from her parents she often talked about her fathers brilliance and her mothers common sense and their interest in current affairs she was very proud of her brotherinlaw john and believed he had tremendous values as did her husband and values that are known in california indeed nationally as the great burton tradition she was proud of johns personal courage as well and proud of her brotherinlaw bob as well she was very very proud of her brother and her nephew tom who was so gracious to so many of us during salas illness i want to say this about her staff she felt that they were an extended part of her family and they ought to know how much affection sala had for them and how much it meant to her that they carried on during her illness so in a very special way all of us can claim sala in a very real way of course she loved her beloved phillip as she would say you could not talk to her for any length of time without knowing of the respect and love she had for her husband she quoted him often she felt even after he died that she was an extension of him but sala in her own right was a magnificent congresswoman and a very savvy politician she was intensely political and long before she became a congresswoman she served her political apprenticeship she traced her interest to her childhood in prewar poland she said i saw and felt what happened n western europe when the nazis were moving you learn politics is everybodys business she had instant clout in the house when we look at her assignments we see that she was practically hmmedlately after a term of being here assigned to the prestigious committee the committee on rules she was a delegate to the north atlantic assembly where 60 parliamentarians from nato elected her vice chair of the political committee last spring in luxembourg i saw her chair the committee and i saw the love and esteem of our allies and our fellow and sister parliamentarians who really thought that she was so outstanding she knew how to get things done one can recall the many instances in which sala did in fact buttonhole her friends i said in san francisco that she buttonholed the men in congress by flicking the lint from their lapels rather than twisting their arms her style was different from phils to say the least but it was equally as effective so how do we accept her death one of the things that sala was most proud of really was her jewish background so i quoted from the mourners kaddish in which there are a line or two that indicate that thru the long centuries and this is a quote from that beautiful prayer thru the long centuries we have learned to rise in the face of every storm out of the abyss of anguish on the ashes of every destruction to praise gods name to maintain a stance of human dignity and to affirm our consecration to the task of life that was her goal life was so important to her and she was consecrated to this the wednesday before salas death i had the great privilege of visiting her along with senator alan cranston and my friend and colleague the gentleman from california don edwands and at the end i whispered a few words to sala and she said to me and the last words she said to me were tell everyone i think of them and love them and she said goodbye mary rosewell talk which was a common expression of saas we will talk about salafor we will think of her legacy and her values that wonderful burton tradition we know that already there have been a number of things that people are proposing to name after her such as the sala burton maritime museum which of course was part of her legislation to have that funded properly and the gentleman from arizona mr mo udall did change the name in the legislation naming it after her one of the things that i would like to suggest i have introduced a bill that would allow the staff and people who work on the hill to have access to a daycare center and that has been passed i think that it would really be an honor for me to know that my legislation somehowand the gentlewoman from colorado mrs pat schroeder is the one who suggested it and i think it is a great ideato somehow dedicate that daycare center to the memory of our friend sala burton so we accept her death in the sense of alfred lord tennyson when he recalled in his wonderful poem in memoriam when he had the death of one of his dear friends thrust upon him and he was wondering how he could accept this great tragedy one of the lines that he uttered then and which is recorded for all of us immortally is something that consoles me very much when i think of her and that is ris better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all we all loved sala burton and we will talk to her many many times"], [0.0025774240493774414, 0.9974225759506226, 1, "as chairman of the congressional black caucus i am pleased to join the members and friends of the caucus in paying tribute to the memory and accomplishments of dr martin luther king jr i regret that i am unable to join my colleagues in person today this year the nation formally celebrated dr kings birthday for the second time celebration i believe is the appropriate word to describe the feeling that should surround our observance of the king holiday to be sure we will always be saddened that dr kings life was cut short by an assassins bullet leaving a young widow four young children and an entire nation to mourn but dr king was taken from us for a reason and we were left to grasp his strength his spirit his wisdom and his compassion and thus armed to carry on his dream so instead of mourning our loss we celebrate our good fortune our fortune to have had a man of dr kings caliber lead us through trying and difficult times a man whose spirit mirrored all that is good in the world and whose dream left cowering all that is bad what does it mean to have a federal holiday in honor of one individual there are only two other americans whom we have chose to recognize in such a waygeorge washington and abraham uncoln clearly the standard for determining who merits this distinction is not mere greatness if this were the case every day would be a holiday but in thinking about what distinguished dr king from so many other leaders we realize that his greatest contribution was the legacy he bequeathed to a people and a country a legacy of promise hope and vision dr king left us the opportunity to rebuild the very foundation of our social structure upon which every person black and white would find secure footing if only we could look beyond the insecurity and the fear that permeated like a plague the moral fabric of our communities then surely we would find the common bonds that had so eluded us and dr king was prophetic for he saw the harm inflicted by segregation not only from the black mans perspective he saw the wounds of a nation which could not realize its full potential because of fear and intolerance since dr king marched in silent protest along hot and dusty southern highways the united states has made notable progress in shaking the vestiges of a devisive past this is particularly true in the area of equal participation in our political system last year black americans played a decisive role in many elections both at the state and national levels why do i place emphasis on the political gains made by black americans in the past 20 years because it is as true today as it was when dr king and other civil rights leaders called for real enforcement of the 15th amendment to the constitution economic justice cannot be achieved without political power and it is as true in the united states of america where the constitution guarantees one man one vote as it is in south africa where the denial of political power guarantees continued oppression yes progress has been made and yet in 1986 and 1987 we are shocked to learn of a racially motivated gang attack in howard beach ny harassment by the ku klux klan at a military academy in south carolina racial attacks by white college students in amherst ma violence against black families who move into white neighborhoods in chicago and philadelphia and just this past weekend civil rights marchers who could not walk through an entire county in georgia because that area has been allwhite since the turn of the century but should we be surprised dr king once said morals cannot be legislated but behavior can be regulated the habits if not the hearts of people altered by federal action as a new order as dr king called it developed in this country in the 1960s and 1970s it became less acceptable to wear ones hatred on ones sleeveand the voices of resistance were drowned out by the voices of peaceful coexistence but in the 1980s the tone of federal action changed once again the department of jus tice no longer went before the supreme court to enforce compliance with school desegregation orders but instead joined the battle against affirmative action against bilingual education and against separation of church and state the voices of nullification gave courage to those who would find security only in isolation from their fellow man and they inevitably sanctioned more public displays of intolerance and hatred there are still many americans not only in the south who believe that dr king was not speaking to them or about them that dr kings dream was only a dream for black america and that somehow they would be hurt by it i think we need to ask what teachings of dr king do these people object to do they really fear people of different cultural backgrounds religious beliefs and skin color or are they intolerant out of fear for their own ability to live the american dream as we strive to further fulfill dr kings dream we must look beyond the civil rights which were guaranteed to all americans by the constitution yet were effectively denied to many through interposition on the part of certain state and local governments it is important that we critically review our efforts to achieve economic justice and to ensure equal access to the bountiful resources this country has to offer in a very real sense economic justice is only a byproduct of basic human justice and equality we must first believe in our hearts that every person is worthy of and entitled to a decent standard of living only then will we take action to put food on every table a roof over every head and a paycheck in every hand that is why on one level political participation is an essential spoke in the wheel of economic justice political power is needed to achieve economic justice on a national level for we must as a nation set economic priorities that speak to our concern for the wellbeing of our citizens what testimony to our humanity is heard when we spend money for a war in a foreign land before spending money to improve the education of our children when we build weapons which could destroy the entire planet before building shelters for the homeless if we are to be a nation of compassion and fairness our budget priorities must reflect this but there is a second level of economic justice that must concern usthat for the individual and the family it is interesting that dr king foresaw economic inequities that might heighten as we moved toward an integrated society and it is true that where black businesses once flourished in allblack communities today many blackowned businessesparticularly small businessesare struggling to survive if they have in fact survived this long larger minority firms find that their markets are diminishing as other national companies reach out to black consumers and integration spurned economic difficulties for the individual worker as well because as more and varied jobs became accessible to black americans the question of whether our economy could support increased employment became painfully relevant if there are not enough jobs for every person capable of working many people point the finger of blame at their fellow workers instead of at domestic economic policies and priorities which have led many government officials to accept a 7percent unemployment rate as inevitable and acceptable the same principle applies in the area of education as both black and white americans realized that higher education was a key to further economic success the competition grew for limited slots at colleges and universities once again those seeking an education and training turned against each other instead of questioning the lack of opportunity for all people who desired to improve their status through education but i submit that the achievement of economic justice need not come about through competition between blacks and whites between whites and hispanic americans between blacks and asianamericans in its failure to increase employment opportunities and educational resources the government has created a false competition among people encouraging them to see their fellow workers their neighbors and their peers as the enemy the myth of reverse discrimination in the workplace and in higher education is but a manifestation of this effort to pit man against man man against woman and black against white we live in a time when divide and conquer has become once again an acceptable means of retaining power and obfuscating the real issue we are increasingly a society of haves and have nots and we are fast losing sight of our common needs and goals yes economic justice in dr kings beloved community is within our reach but we wilt not fulfill this promise until our leaders believe that we can all benefit from the plentiful resources of our nation not at the expense of some but for the good of all we are at a crossroads but now is not the time to turn back this is no time dr king wrote for apathy and complacency this is a time for vigorous and positive action a whole generation is now growing up without the visible foundations of the civil rights movement to bolster its spirit its determination and its understanding of what lies ahead the answer to our frustration lies within us as it did 20 and 30 years ago and we must not be thrown from our course by obstacles planted to diverge our paths let us not forget the words that we pledge to our flag the symbol of our nation that we are one nation under god indivisible the highest tribute we can pay to dr king is to find within ourselves the courage compassion and creativity to continue living the dream martin luther king set out to lead a nation gone astray onto the proper road of humanity and justice but it was not one mans burden to change an entire nation it was a nations burden to climb to the mountaintop with him we meet now in the middle of that mountain and we must continue our journey for the dream cannot be deferred i have no doubt that together we can meet his challenge"], [0.002629399299621582, 0.9973706007003784, 1, "i rise to speak on an issue which i consider myself somewhat of

largest is in miami fl but in brooklyn in my district the 12th congressional district we have the largest number of haitian americans and probably the largest number of haitian refugees these haitians are in constant contact with their brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers and the people they left behind in haiti they know like nobody else knows what is happening in haiti they tell me daily of stories of terror and fear and they are worried about the process of democracy that is supposed to be going forward in haiti they have a lot to be proud of the people of haiti have a lot to be proud of after several decades of exploitation of the worst kind of terror of the worst kind the people of haiti rose up and they threw out the dictator jean claude duvalier who had succeeded his father francois duvalier they threw him out and then it was said there would be nothing but chaos but the people of haiti again showed that they understand far better than they have been given credit for what is at stake the people of haiti agree that for a group to write a constitution and after that consititution was written they turned out in an overwhelming turnout 90 percent of them and they voted to support that constitution that constitution was ratified by a large majority of the haitian people in the constitution there was a timetable for the election of officers at the local level an assembly for senators and finally at the conclusion of the electoral process timetable they would elect a president they also set up an election commission it is written into the constitution so the people the majority and i am talking about the majority of the people in haiti the overwhelming majority are on the right track they love democracy they know how to get democracy but the great fear of the people who live in my district the relatives of people who live in haiti is that terror and guns and the military will prevent the democratic process from going forward they have good reason to be afraid they have good reason to be afraid immediately after the constitution was passed the military junta tried to abrogate the whole process they wanted to obliterate the whole process and come in and take over the role of the election commission the military junta the people in charge they wanted to be in charge of the election themselves and although they professed to have no ambitions with respect to being elected to public office it is clear that they do want to control the elections and decide who would be elected only after the people of haiti again rose up with demonstrations and strikes did the military junta back down and give the electoral process back to the election commission but in the meantime hundreds of haitians were slain not only in the demonstrations in the city but in the hillsides in the provinces hundreds of people were slain most of the time they were slain by terrorists the old remnants of the tontons macoutes a terrorist organization established by francois duvalier the tontons macoutes hacked people to death while the omnies stood by and did nothing the most grizzly example of what was going on was reported in most of the papers here in this country that is that a politician campaigning for president on a sunny day in the middle of the day before a crowd of people was leaped upon he and his assistants by these tontons macoutes hacked to death in front of the crowd and they walked away and nobody still to this day has apprehended them that was a presidential candidate a person running for office who was hacked to death along with his assistant under these conditions can democracy go forward no the people of haiti need help they have shown that they can do part of a job it is up to us to give them the help to do the rest of the job

processes go forward we have seen governments elected by the people and then we have seen military outlaws come in and take over declare that things are not running properly and they come in and take over something has to be done on the international level haiti is just 90 miles from our shores and i say we should do something first in haiti there is no reason why the organization of american states and the unitedstates government should stand by and allow the democratic process which the majority of the people of haiti want to go forward to be taken over by a band of thugs military outlaws and armed terrorists they are the ones that we have to fear i want to congratulate arthur schlesinger for an article which appeared on this subject in the new york times on wednesday september 9 1987 as we all know arthur schlesinger is presently professor of humanities at city university of new york we all know that arthur schlesinger jr is one of the greatest historians alive that he played a major role in shaping american policy for many years i want to thank arthur schlesinger for his brilliant article which states the case very well and i would like to read it into the record it is entitled yes washington there is a haiti i think every american ought to hear this and understand the kind of abandonment that we are guilty of it is immoral to neglect haiti the way we have neglected haiti over the years and now we are into the same thing we are neglecting haiti at a crucial moment in the history of the country and allowing it to sink back into the morass of confusion and terror mr schlesinger begins as follows what a collection of fakes we americans are we endlessly proclaim our devotion to democracy and human rights we endlessly rebuke the rest of the world for falling short of the high standards of liberty and probity that we unfailingly achieve ourselves or do we and with our selfcongratulatory habits of the heart and undaunted lack of selfknowledge we overlook the fact evident to others that our concern for democracy is to say the least partial and selective so we block a peace settlement in central america because of our alleged commitment to the future of democracy in nicaraguaa commitment not visible to the naked eye when the somozas ruled nicaragua and hardly visible today in our policy toward say the pinochet dictatorship in chile and we righteously denounce lapses from democratic purity in angola mozambique and yemen our capacity to shed tears for oppression and misery in the communist world appears unlimited but we remain marvelously oblivious to the tragedy overtaking a forlorn country well within our own sphere of influence haiti was once one of the most prosperous islands in the antilles it was once frances richest western hemisphere colony it was the first country in the americas after the united states to gain independence but its history since independence has been patheticnever more pathetic than today after 30 years of misrule by first the demonic papa doc francois duvalier and then his feeble luxuryloving son baby doc jeanclaude duvalier the tyranny rested on terror and magic between papa docs pretorian guard of official thugs the notorious tontons macoutes and his voodoo doctors the haitian people already miserably poor undernourished and demoralized were reduced to almost hopeless passivity i want to conclude by saying that arthur schlesinger concluded his article with a call for intervention into haiti peaceful intervention on the side of democracy we should heed the call of arthur schelesinger before it is too late now while the democratic process is going forward while the candidates are campaigning and the vote is to be taken on november 29 1987 we need peaceful intervention

the assumptions of the budget resolution from changes in economic and technical factors over which they have no control unless the congress adopts a subsequent budget resolution for a fiscal year that alters the assumptions about legislative actions committees should be able to expect that measures that conform with the budget resolution will not be subject to points of order for violation of the budget act to do otherwise and base enforcement on constantly changing economic and technical estimates would seriously disrupt the legislative process penalize committees that are unable to complete

i rise in support of the joint resolution i rise today in strong support of the moratorium on any further aid to the contras until the administration accounts for the more than 80 million in government private and foreign moneys sent to the contras for unexplained purposes certainly the public deserves a full accounting before any more taxpayer funds go to the contra forces the problems with our current central america policy however extend beyond allegations of contra corruption and missing appropriated tax dollars in recent months each day has brought disturbing revelations of unitedstates officials involved in what can only be termed illegal acts of folly indeed reflecting on the last 7 years of unitedstates involvement in nicaragua it is barbara tuchmans book entitled the march of folly that comes to mind in it the prize winning historian describes and traces through history the tendency of all governments to make mistakes to pursue those mistakes relentlessly and to disguise those mistakes as sound policy tuchman writes a phenomenon noticable throughout history regardless of place or period is the pursuit by governments of policies contrary to their own interests she discusses a range of disastrous initiatives from the fall of troy to the vietnam war in these cases and others persistence in error is the problem yet to recognize error to alter course is the most repugnant option to government she concludes in the case of unitedstates policy in nicaragua the time has come to take ms tuchmans advice recognize our error and alter our course the proposed moratorium on contra aid is the first essential step in that process our current policy is folly because it advances military solutions to what are in fact essentially political problems our current policy is folly because it associates the united states with former military commanders in somozas national guard and other reactionary forces in the region our current policy is folly because it has wasted more than a billion taxpayer dollars over 4 years on the direct or indirect support of rebel forces which to this day control no territory and have little popular support in nicaragua our current policy is folly because it places us in opposition to our democratic allies in the region including mexico colombia panama venezuela argentina brazil peru and uruguay as well as our european allies none of whom support our central american policy our current policy is folly because it violates every tenet of international law and has forced us to disregard the world court as well as binding treaty commitments which prohibit us from intervening in the internal affairs of other nations our current policy is folly because it so whollylacks american popular support that it has had to be conducted in an illegal covert fashionwhich has only served to feed widespread public cynicism about the integrity of our democratic political processes most ironically our current policy is folly because though it seeks to prevent the spread of communism it actually weakens democratic forces within nicaragua and plays directly into the hands of the soviets and our other adversaries throughout central america the irancontra affair stands as the culmination of our march of folly in central america it represents a complete distortion of the principles of democracy and freedom that have made america great and ought to be the centerstone of effective american foreign policy far from setting an example for those around us we have been caught in the act of twisting our own laws and constitution in the interests of a tragically flawed policy the silver lining of the contragate cloud is that the arrogance and abuses of power that have been exposed may finally bring home the absurdity of this policy and allow us to abandon our march of folly to pursue a new direction perhaps the most recent escapades of ollie and his cohorts will be the last the moratorium before us today offers us that opportunity to start anew let us not squander itl a new approach to central american policy must recognize that american interests can best be protected by an understanding of central american political sensibilities it must also avoid the ideological thinking that has so often produced foreign policies wholly detached from the real worldforeign policies that are inconsistent with both american values and american national interests because we americans know so little of the nations of the third worldthe nations of africa asia and latin americawe tend to respond to ideological labels we think we understand but which often have a very different meaning from that which we ascribe to them if a regime or dissident group declares itself to be anticommunist we assume it is on our side and like pavlovs dog we respond to the stimulus and throw american tax dollars its wayno matter how repressive and undemocratic such a regime or group may be that is the history of american involvement in the philippines in iran in cuba and in nicaragua marcos the shah batista and somoza were all the anticommunist beneficiaries of american largesse notwithstanding the brutality and injustice of their regimes in every instance we have paid dearly for our accommodation to tyranny we have paid through the revolutions instability and antiamericanism that have been the consistent legacy of this ideological myopia make no mistake about it that same myopia is at work in the administrations contra initiative contrary to the repeated claims of the president the contras are anything but a homogeneous ideologically committed democratic resistence and the repeated use of anticommunist slogans and labels cannot transform this reality certainly there are some nicaraguans genuinely committed to democratic values who have felt betrayed by the sandinistas and who are now part of the contra forces but the fact remains that the majority of the key military leaders of the contras come from the despised national guard that was known for widespread brutality under the repressive somoza dictatorship the announcement earlier this week of the resignation from the contra leadership of one of the most democratically inclined of that number arturo cruz confirms the complete unwillingness of the contras to institute thedemocratic reforms that have so often been promised in the past to congress on the eve of contra aid votes the new york times reports that cruz resigned because he found it impossible to carry out the fundamental reorganization that he believes is necessary to turn the nicaraguan rebels into a popular resistance movement he did not see the political will among the rebels to make major changes citing the hegemonistic tendencies that dominate the contras and the clique that perpetuates attitudes of intolerance and exclusion for other viewpoints cruz stated that there has been time to make changes and that time is over the people who are bringing us the contras today are the very same folks who brought us ferdinand marcosboth packaged and sold under the same deceptive label to continue our support for the contras as we did for marcos long after it was clear that his was a corrupt and doomed regime opposed to everything that our country stands for is follypure and simple our commitment to ideology has not only blinded us to the facts of the current situation but has clouded our understanding of history as well few americans for example know that our contra initiative is only the latest of a long series of military interventions in nicaragua in guatemala and elsewhere in the region tragically in each of these cases our intervention produced neither lasting peace nor greater democracy but only served to align us with those seeking to maintain an unjust and repressive status quo we have not learned and have not understood the lessons of our past follies largely because ideological thinking is immune to re"],

reinforced those deep doubts a year ago we debated this issue without even knowing what had happened to a substantial portion of the assistance provided in 1985 today we still do not know a year ago we were asked to embark on a military aid program without knowing the probable duration or even the ultimate purpose of the program today we still do not know a year ago we were asked to assist a contra leadership that was divided by dissension and disagreement today that disarray has reached crisis proportions and the contra leadership is literally coming apart a year ago we were asked to support a military aid program that had virtually no public international backing today that policy still lacks support among the democracies of central america the very nations that have the most at stake in fact those nations are doing their best to put more distance between themselves and both american policy and the contras where have we come in the past year the questions that surrounded our policy in central america a year ago remain unanswered in the few cases in which we have answers those answers are disheartening moreover new and equally serious questions have emerged what has been the impact of the iran arms deal what role has our own government played in funding the contras outside of the authorized assistance program can the contra le dership even endure without its most visible democratic symbol it seems to me that every prudent member of congress would want a much more comprehensive accounting of the funds that the united states has provided or solicited from others before releasing another dime of the taxpayers money if a domestic assistance program had been administered like the contra aid program members of congress would rightly call it a scandal and probably terminate it the revelations of recent weeks are disturbing and the questions need to be answered but recent events are only symptoms of what is wrong with the entire contra aid policy the resignation of arturo cruz from the contra leadership reconfirms both the contradictory attitudes and purposes of the contra leaders and the extreme difficulties of instituting meaningful reforms in the contra organization the allegations of secret transactions to obtain funds for the contras reconfirm the absence of a consensus for this program and the slim likelihood of sustaining this policy over the long term the pending request for another 105 million in contra aid for next year reconfirms both the openended commitment and the increasingly high price of this policy the continuing lack of support from central american nations reconfirms the unilateral nature of the contra aid policy and the growing diplomatic isolation of the united states in the region in short we have a policy that is bankrupt what have we accomplished thus far where are the contra gainseither in territory or in the allegiance of the nicaraguan people after years of addressing this issue we are still searching for a policy that commands the support of the american people and the countries of the region a program that relies mainly on military assistance to the contras to resolve the problems of central america simply cannot gain that support i hope that the administration will back away from its singleminded pursuit of this unsuccessful policy we do have alternatives the proposals put forth by costa rican president oscar arias offer one option that should be pursued the costa rican plan may not prove to be the ultimate solution but several presidents in the region have agreed to the general principles and further negotiations are planned in may the united states should support this effort even if it does not lead directly to success it could produce other openings we cannot afford to ignore any possibilities let us be clear about two points first this is not a debate about whether the contras are the bad guys and the sandinistas are the good guys abuses of human rights in nicaragua are certainly not limited to the contras the sandinista government has engaged in a number of activities that deserve universal condemnation one of our goals should be to improve the condition of the nicaraguan people will military assistance for the contras accomplish that objective the evidence indicates that it will not second i think i speak for virtually all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in saying that i want a bipartisan foreign policy i have looked for ways to support the president since i came to congress but i do not believe that the current policy in central america serves

recovery among those acts was a relief program for homeowners the home owners refinancing act signed june 13 1933 this emergency relief act was the second great step toward a national housing program the refinancing act created a corporation capitalized by 200 million to refinance the mortgages of hardpressed homeowners a few months later in april 1934 an additional 1 billion in capital went into the corporation it did more than refinance mortgages the corporation could advance money to pay back taxes and provide for repairs and maintenance these cash advances could be for as much as 50 percent of the appraised value of the loan the whole thing being secured by the value of the property the home owners loan corporation remained in business for only 4 years but in that time it had made loans covering more than 1 million mortgages and it produced a profit fifty years later with the country in a recession as deep as any seen since 1933 notwithstanding to the contrary what we heard a few minutes ago i offered a bill to provide emergency help to hardpressed homeowmers and we called it that the emergency homeowners assistance act in colorado for instance in the city of pueblo where the steel mill was shutting down the sole source of employment the foreclosure rate on homes was 100 a month at that time i took the floor and asked this house to approve the homeowners emergency assistance act the house did indeed pass it the one and the only what my minority members called a new program that has been approved by the house under the reagan administration that is since 1981 it languished in the senate and it died in the senate a senate that in 6 years never once even had so much as a hearing on housing needs or community development needs of our country the senate proposed to do nothing and my proposal did nothing radically more than essentially what we had seen and i had witnessed during the depression in the homeowners loan corporation in fact did the research work on that bill myself and with the able help of the staff and counsel we reshaped it in terms of modern needs all it would do would be the same thing make loans against home equity to prevent those homes from being foreclosed ironically not too long in fact less than a year and a half after that in my home town of san antonio when i walked the line of about 203 fellow americans destitute homeless waiting to make their entry into the homeless shelter that had been provided them by the city i talked to one young relatively young because i consider anybody under 40 very young homeless father of two who had lost his home in pueblo co and had we enacted that program that i had envisioned he would have been enabled to have been assisted and to have remained under the roof and the shelter of his home instead of having to park his wife and kids with his parents in another state and wander through the south thinking that perhaps in the south he could find employment and come to a city such as san antonio where indeed the need was just as great as the city that he left i have never been able to understand why this simple humane eminently workable ideawas so adamantly opposed by the administration why it was willing to let so many thousands of people needlessly suffer the loss of their homes when hundreds of thousands could have been helped at virtually no real cost or risk to the government why not extend help to people who are suffering economic disaster through no fault of their own as a result of forces they cannot control it made sense in 1933 and it should make sense today a little more than a year after the home owners loan corporation bill was signed the national housing act of 1934 became law this law was truly monumental it brought up the capital of the home owners loan corporation to 3 billion but more than that this was the law establishing the federal housing administration at this point i want to render tribute to a man who passed on just last month on august 9 the great leon keyserling and i want to render testimony that it was his architectural hand his designing hand that devised the basic 1934 and 1937 national housing act and whose friendship and counsel i never dreamed i would be able to enjoy years later after those miserable dim days that i recall vividly because i am a depression kid and i was in school at the time and would enjoy his great wisdom and would have shared his last supper literally because he died 4 days after i had enjoyed an invitation to supper at his home here in washington leon keyserling actually is a man that i hope we can memorialize in a more lasting and meaningful way when the time comes but his real monument has been etched into these great acts of humanitarian legislation for he was the architect and the counsel and lawyer that devised and structured the basic fundamental framework of reference for this noteworthy legislation the fha became the engine of housing and home ownership as a matter of fact the miracle of the world in the 20th century was performed here in america because between 1940 and 1980 we reversed where a minority of american families owned their homes to a percentage increase of the overwhelming majority by 1980 the sad thing is that since 1980 we have had an increase in the emergence of this phenomena of modernday homelessness which is in epidemic proportions and for which this congress has passed emergency legislation just this year and all because there is cause and effect you cannot turn back on the basic commitment to housing and the allocation of national credit for construction of affordable housing affordable to the main mass and stream of our families today the average cost of a new singlefamily dwelling unit in the united states is over 175 000 that means that we have priced out all but 6 percent of americans from the dream of owning a brandnew singlefamily dwelling unit for their loved ones it was the fha through its system of mortgage insurance that made home loans a low risk proposition and made it possible for lenders to extend the longterm fixed rate mortgage that was the cornerstone the inspiration and the motivation of mass home ownership in this country under fha tens of millions of people have obtained home loans it has turned a profit its property standards insured a consistent quality of housing and its operations remain at the heart of home ownership in this country today since the national housing act of 1934 home ownership has become the rule not the exception no longer do twothirds of americans rent though we are in a period of regression and headed back to that twothirds live in their own homes thanks to these programs through fha the affordable mortgage became a reality and with it the affordable home the sensation of 1937 was president roosevelts famous fight to transform the supreme court by increasing the number of justices that is the old supreme court vehemently opposed packing charges the president was accused of trying to pack the supreme court in order to have a patsy supreme court which would give him the opportunity to pack the court with justices he believed would not overturn as the conservative court had his industrial recovery act the court fight made the bork case seem utterly tame it mesmerized the country from february to july but the great court fight was not all that was going on that year on september 1 the capstone national housing act of 1937 became law by 1937 the banking system was stable there was deposit insurance the refinancing programs for homes and farms had stemmed loan losses and the home loan bank system was in place the fha had begun its work what remained was to deal with slum clearance and to try and provide decent housing to the millions who could in no way afford to pay market rents the 1937 housing act created the unitedstates housing authority which was empbwered to make 60year loans to local housing agencies the local agencies had to put up 10 percent of the cost of clearing slums and erecting housing projects the authority had the power to grant operating subsidies so that rents could be geared to the incomes of poor families that basic mechanism remains in place to this very day what an honor to be able to rise at the end of this month to memorialize the congress on the fact that on the first day of this month exactly 50 years ago in this month of september the 1937 basic housing act was approved that in that day and time the congresses and their presidents did in fact have faith and confidence in the average american family in the faith that with just a bit of help it could be tided over in dire circumstances over which it had no control that not only would those loans made then under those conditions be repaid but that they would earn a profit to the treasury of the united states as indeed those programs did within a few years slum clearance could be seen and felt within 4 years the unitedstates housing authority had helped create 511 new housing projects for lowincome families with more than 161 000 units in the 50 years since enactment of the landmark 1937 housing act this government has expanded the assisted housing stock to some 4 million units about half of which are publicly owned today we still have in place in being and in operation the same basic housing tools that were created during the cataclysmic years between mid 1932 and mid1937 those tools were revolutionary in their concept and in their effect before this nation set out on what became a bipartisan commitment to a comprehensive housing policy a full third of our people lived in poor sometimes inhuman conditions today the proportion of people in substandard housing is perhaps 10 percent this reflects a monumental achievement and yet the need should not be that great its 5 percent more than 1980 nor would the need remain so great had not the present administration elected to withdraw from housing as far as it could in 1982 the administration even tried to eliminate mortgage insurance for most people it has managed to virtually stop construction of publicly owned housing units it has managed to prevent enactment of an emergency homeowners assistance program but it has failed to kill housing it has failed to stop enactment of this nations first effective emergency shelter program for homeless people and it has failed to prevent members of its party from joining in this years effort to reassert and begin to revitalize the comprehensive housing program that came into being with the housing act of 1937 the nations commitment to a decent and affordable home for every citizen has been fiercely advocated and honestly administered by a small dedicated extremely proficient corps of public servantsvisionaries and practical administrators innovators and financiers regulators and politicians it has worked it works still and after 50 years the dream is as alive as ever after 50 years we still have not reached the goal of a decent safe and affordable home for every americanbut we have come a long way the nation has been transformed the remaining task can be

us today differences over the standards by which the secretary may decline to take action have been resolved title ii contains several amendments considered by the house authorizing committees and passed by the senate two of these amendments are of particular importance in my state section 207 of this bill is simllar to h r 4834 legislation which i introduced to authorize alaska native villages and certain oklahoma indian tribes to be eligible for waste treatment grants under the clean water act enactment of this section will allow the necessary waste treatment planning to be done in rural alaska for years to come the amendment would correct a technical error made in the last reauthorization of the clean water act in which alaska native villages were inadvertently omitted from authorization for grants under the act previously both alaska villages and former reservations in oklahoma were eligible for treatment as indian tribes passage of this legislation will correct the error and help to meet the waste treatment needs of these remote communities further section 217 of this bill will provide for a clarification of federal escrow laws pertaining to funds received while lands were being transferred to alaska native corporations pursuant to the alaska native claims settlement act the amendment provides that receipt of proceeds from the sale of wildlife resources is included within the resource categories intended to be deposited into the alaska native escrow fund in july the senate added language to the interior departments appropriations bill that was intended to resolve ambiguity over the longstanding pribilof island alaska native escrow account claim conferees on that measure chose to substitute detailed report language resolving that ambiguity despite their efforts the claim remains unresolved as originally enacted on january 2 1976 the alaska native escrow law provided authority for the government to divert to an escrow account its receipts derived from resources of lands that would pass to natives under the alaska native claims settlement act during the protracted period between the ancsa withdrawals in 1971 and conveyance the government had authority to continue its various revenue generating activities on lands that had been withdrawn for native selection the government was not trespassing at that pointit still owned the land which was in the process of being conveyed to the relevant native corporation the government had authority to collect these receipts under such programs as the mineral leasing act the fur seal act and the laws regarding timber sales in the national forests congress determined that keeping the proceeds was unfair to alaska natives since the government had received its part of the ancsa settlement bargain effective december 18 1971 in fact if the government could have kept the proceeds from withdrawn lands prior to conveyance it would have had a considerable economic incentive to further slow the conveyance process so the escrow account statutes were enacted to direct the proceeds to the native corporation that ultimately received the withdrawn lands much of the land withdrawn for native solection and conveyance had been withdrawn previously for mineral entry wildlife protection forests et cetera congress directed the government to retain in federal ownership within ancsa withdrawals only the smallest practicable tracts necessary for its various purposes the native escrow statutes provide that revenues from lands not so retained would be escrowed various federal agencies over the years have opposed this section 3 e limitation on their interests but in a variety of contexts over the years the department and congress have consistently refused to permit the agencies to limit native property rights arising outside the section 3 e boundaries true in native conveyances federal agencies often retained easements or other access rights over nonsection 3 o lands conveyed but that is irrelevant to the operation of the escrow laws which deal with the period prior to conveyances moreover in cases such as the pribilofs timber sales or the kenai gas field resources were taken extracted or severed a wholly different activity than an access right or easement the escrow fund amendment contained in this legislation definitively states that regardless of any residual access or management rights it may have held reserved or retained pursuant to the fur seal act of 1966 as amended prior to or subsequent to conveyance of lands to the two pribilof village corporations the government did not have authority prior to or subsequent to conveyance to take seals from lands conveyed to the pribilof native village corporation pursuant to ancsa without escrowing the proceeds derived from the harvested seals as enunciated in the statement of managers for the fiscal year 1989 interior appropriations bill the proceeds received by the federal government from its sale of pelts taken from native corporation lands shall be the measure of the principal amount placed in escrow and then distributed h r rep no 100862 100th ong 2d sess 80 1988 it is not just trespass damages which are covered by the escrow statutes the escrow statutes supersede any rights held by the government under the fur seal act to wildlife proceeds from harvests on lands conveyed pursuant to the act in this case of course the act refers to the alaska native claims settlement act the amendment statutorily resolves in the affirmative any possible question as to whether wildlife proceeds are included under the escrow statutes at a minimum for the purposes of the escrow statutes wildlife harvested on lands later conveyed to native corporations pursuant to ancsa is quite simply a resource of land whether it spends time in its life cycle in the air water or ground finally the amendment clarifies any possible ambiguity with regard to the time period within which proceeds received are to be escrowed and distributed to the native corporations the escrow statutes in general provide that the appropriate recipients are to be distributed proceeds derived by the government between the date of withdrawaldecember 18 1971 in most casesand the date of conveyance of ancsa lands decause there might be a time lag between the dale a resource was taken and the date the government received the proceeds from the sale thereof an ambiguity may exist the applicable rules of statutory construction and interpretation as set forth in the statement of managers doi escrow account precedent and the plain meaning of the statutes are all consistent proceeds received during the withdrawaltoconveyance period are to be escrowed and distributed the language in the amendment attached to h r 2677 confirms that position and mandates payments of proceeds received in that period therefore some of the escrow fund proceeds properly due to the pribilof village corporations were derived from seals harvested immediately prior to the passage of ancsa on lands later conveyed to the corporations pursuant to the act at the same time proceeds received after conveyance from seals harvested immediately

killed in the lamblance plaza cpllapse in bridgeport ct in april of last year twentyeight construction workers lost their lives when the partially built 13story apartment complex toppled to the ground this catastrophe was the worst human toll from a construction accident in a decade the legislation establishes a trust fund from the record 5 1 million in fines levied by the occupational safety and health administration against the contractors and subcontractors that engaged in sloppy construction and engineering practices and wantonly disregarded worker safety if the government successfully collects the 5 1 million in fines there may be little left to compensate the victims families the purpose of our bill is to ensure that the victims claims come first once the civil suits have been settled the remaining monies in the trust fund if any will be paid to the secretary of labor to be deposited into the treasury the fund will be administered by the unitedstates district court the government must share in the responsibility for the tragedy after listening to extensive testimony at five congressional hearings it is clear osha has failed to properly carry out its mandate to protect workers health and safety in several important areas of responsibility today i would like to share my impressions of osha and the way it has handled events surrounding the lambiance plaza collapse first it is imperative that osha review and change its reporting requirements current osha regulations stipulate that a construction accident must be reported only when a fatality or five or more hospitalizations occur i find it incomprehensible that an accident of the magnitude of lambiance would have gone unreported if fewer than five people were hospitalized or no life was lost oshas investigation into the lambiance collapse revealed a near disaster involving the same liftslab contractor at the metro center construction site in stamford ct 1 year earlier this accident should have served as a warning of impending tragedy but it was never reported because osha had no requirement that it be reported the metro center accident occurred when a shearhead failure caused part of a concrete floor to sag some 15 inches in an accident nearly identical to the lambiance incident not only was the same contractor involved in both accidents but the same faulty building techniques and practices were responsible osha officials expressed astonishment that more devastating damage did not take place at the mero center site it is clear an accident of this severity warranted a thorough investigation even though no lives were lost and only one worker wav injured had osha officials been notified of what happened at metro center they could have taken steps to prevent the tragedy at lambiance second from the testimony i heard from representatives of labor and the construction industry it is obvious that osha is severely understaffed and underfunded in the state of connecticut there are ten osha inspectors however of those 10 only 2 specialize in construction given the inherent hazards in the construction industry i find this statistic unacceptable regrettably osha officials testified before the health and safety subcommittee that they have all the resources they need third besides requiring more resources osha may need to reorganize itself at the very least a separate division should be established within osha solely to monitor and regulate the construction industry given the unique dangers of this industry it may even be advisable to create an ent ely new agency under the department of labor finally the assessment of high financial penalties such as the record 5 1 million in the lambiance plaza disaster cries out for criminal sanctions as well employers who knowingly violate safety codes should be held accountable for their actions for too long individuals within a corporation have been allowed to hide behind their corporate shield the company is fined the major decision makers within the company walk away scotfree it seems so obvious to me that an employer who knowingly disregards safety regulations resulting in the serious injury or death of an employee should be subject to criminal prosecution murder in the workplace cannot be tolerated recently osha referred the lambiance case to the department of justice for criminal prosecution the justice department must now decide whether to prosecute twentyeight workers lost their lives fines were imposed and yet no one has been prosecuted but even if individuals are prosecuted under current law the penalties can only be a maximum of 10 000 and 6 months in jail according to testimony before the employment and housing subcommittee osha has referred only 38 cases since its inception in 1970 for criminal prosecution of those 38 cases the justice department has pursued 14 this record is pathetic it is my understanding no one has spent 1 day in jail for violating federal osha law because of this dismal record states such as new york illinois and california have had the take the initiative in cases where osha has imposed a minimal monetary fine for a serious violation of safety codes state prosecutors have successfully pursued homicide convictions regrettably state prosecutors have recently pursued cases and won criminal convictions only to have them challenged on the grounds that feder al law preempts state law osha should immediately clarify the right of state prosecutors to impose criminal sanctions against employers who knowingly and recklessly disregard worker safety if necessary it should recommend to congress that the law be amended to make absolutely clear that the federal statute does not preempt the states in addition we must have a tougher and more aggressive federal statute the penalties are simply not strong enough it has been more than a year since the lamblance collapse tragically we have seen little movement to change any of the factors that contributed to the accident osha has not reviewed or modified its reporting requirements osha is undermanned and underfunded yet it has not requested additional resources osha has made no effort to establish a separate divislon to oversee construction in spite oi the unique dangers of the industry osha refuses to recommend any legislative or regulatory charges imposing tougher criminal sanctions or addressing the preemption issue twentyeight people lost their lives the victims families must not only live with the loss of their loved ones but also with the reality that their government has not responded to their tragedy the legislation we introduced yesterday will not correct the shortcomings of osha but it will ensure that the victims families

anniversary of the armenian genocide it is my privilege once again to organize a special order so that members of this body can join in this commemoration in the latter half of the 19th century the ottoman turkish government began a policy of persecution against its armenian population the persecution was brutal and ferocious it resulted in the deaths of many armenians in 1894 and 1895 and in 1909 the pattern of persecution and destruction culminated in the great massacre of 1915 through 1923 at least 1 5 million armenian men women and children perished in this holocaust those who survived became homeless refugees whose descendants with their painful memories can be found in many countries today this terrible fact of history has been documented by eyewitnesses and media accounts including those of then united states ambassador to ot man turkey henry a morgenthau the 45th and 66th congresses adopted resolutions deploring the massacres president reagan and seven presidents before him have spoken out against the treatment of the armenians in spite of the ovewhelming evidence and recognition the debate still rages on over whether or not these events of history should be remembered the debate appears most pronounced in this body and during this congress where on august 7 1987 we considered and rejected a procedural motion to vote on house joint resolution 132 a measure to commemorate the armenian genocide we therefore failed to take action to remember the first genocide of the 20th century we submitted to the threats of our valued nato ally turkey and the appeals of our state department we emboldened those who refuse to face history to press even more diligently against all levels of government and all institutions who would commemorate or otherwise remember the treatment of the armenians the turkish government has even gone so far as to advise this body that it will not tolerate the introduction of any resolution on the armenian genocide in the future our government has been advised that the president of the republic of turkey kenan evren will cancel his visit to the united states scheduled for this summer if a resolution on this question is presented to this body for consideration we now have a foreign government telling what we can discuss this should be intolerable our failure to act and resolve this socalled controversy has not to my great satisfaction been repeated elsewhere in our nation within the past year and despite an intense campaign of denial orchestrated by the republic of turkey the unitedstates holocaust memorial council affirmed the inclusion of the armenian genocide in its museum and educational programs the states of california connecticut massachusetts new jersey and new york remembered april 24 1988 armenian martyrs day with commemorative events as well as resolutions passed by their legislative bodies similar successes can be reported on the growing movement to provide holocaust genocide and humanrights curricula in our nations secondary schools in my state of california a model curriculum on these topics was adopted for statewide execution which included the armenian experience this took place over the strenuous objection of turkeys friends who once again attempted to deny that the genocide took place i am also pleased to report that an exemplary educational curriculum entitled facing history and ourselves expanded its armenian genocide component the massachusettsbased facing histories case study approach to tile holocaust and the arnenian genocide underscores the crucial importance of remembering the facing history i am proud of the efforts in california massachusetts and other states where educators who are coinmitted to preventing genocide and human rights are providing an opportunity for our students to learn from the pastan opportunity which our misguided ally turkey would like very much to deny while millions of our citizens were called upon by their state governments to reflect upon the armenian tragedy and while tens of thousands of students were presented with the armenian genocide as a case study we in the congress failed to participate the republic of turkey was able to accomplish with us what they failed to accomplish anywhere else in this great nation this body must address the growing gap between tile trend in our society to remember all instances of genocide in this century and our indecisiveness the time is overdue for this body to do what is right and pass a resolution on the armenian genocide i should like to call attention to the recently approved legislation on the genocide convention on april 25 this body passed such a measure in testimony submitted to the judiciary committee the examples of genocide in this century were frequently invoked including of course the genocide of the armenians i am delighted that this body approved this legislation making genocide a crime under unitedstates law i should also like to share the relevance of the armenian experience to the convention raphael lemkin the man who coined the word genocide and began the movement to make genocide crime under international law coined the word to apply to the armenians he also felt that the republic of turkey had a special responsibility in this regard from the raphael lemkin papers now housed in the new york public library we learned that a bold plan was formulated in my mind this consisted of obtaining the ratification by turkey among the first twenty founding nations this would be an atonement for the genocide of the armenians but how could this be achieved the turks are proud of their republican form of government and of progressive concepts which helped them in replacing the rule of the ottoman empire the genocide convention must be put within tle framework of social and international progress i knew however that in this conversation both sides will have to avoid speaking about one thing although it would be constantly in

postage from these mailers and congress replaces this lost revenue with an annual appropriation the committee has provided approximately 485 million to continue free mailing privileges for the blind and handicapped and to maintain current reduced rates for preferredrate mailers this is 165 million lessi stress less than the appropriation provided for the subsidy in fiscal year 1987 my colleagues should also note that the total appropriation provided by the committee for the postal service for fiscal year 1988 even when revenue foregone is included is still 93 5 million lessi again stress less than last years appropriation and i also want to stress that full funding for the revenue foregong subsidy is provided for in the budget resolution members can support title ii of the bill knowing

newspapers libraries health care medical research churches religious groups and other nonprofit organizations that do so much good for the handicapped the elderly the sick and the needyso very often stepping in to fill the void left by declining or insufficient federal services the overwhelming majority of revenue foregone dollars each year goes to benefit nonprofit organizations the nonprofit mailing community represents vital public interests and is dependent in large measure on revenue foregone and nonprofit mail i believe the nonprofit mailing community is deserving of the little help we can provide through this subsidy and reduced postage rates had the committee not provided the funding under title ii postage for a charitable solicitation would increase 51 percent next year the second general category of revenue foregone beneficiaries is made up of newspapers magazines books and classroom publications here the primary purpose of the subsidy is to promote the dissemination of information throughout the nationa tradition that dates back to the 18th century from the earliest days of the republic our founding fathers assumed the success of our democracy had to be based on an informed peopleand informed at the lowest possible cost hence the special mailing privilege was conceived and born one very good newspaper publisher in a town with a population of about 2 000 in my district told me that reductions in the revenue foregone subsidy over the years has already made his mailing costs double or by about 9 000 in 1986 and that if reduced rates were eliminated entirely his costs would rise by an additional 9 000 at the very least while he said he could possibly survive i know many of our smaller weekly and daily papers could well be pushed into extinction by such a circumstance had the committee not funded revenue foregone rates for incounty newspapers would increase 63 percent can we do without newspapers jefferson said he would rather do without any government than without any newspapers and finally the third category of revenue foregone beneficiaries is comprised of materials carried at no cost for the blind and physically handicapped this policy dates back to 1904 and should not be altered we cannot put a value on the educational benefits and the joy provided by the largeprint braille and talking books and other materials that so many could not afford if they had to pay for postage if the arguments for the revenue foregone subsidy are not convincing enough let me also point out that failure to fund the subsidy at this point would have only resulted in a false budget savings we cannot just eliminate funding for preferredrate mailers and tell the postal service to maintain the current rates for these mailersas was originally proposed by the subcommittee and rejected by the full appropriations committee the postal service would have to absorb the lost revenue in other words the savings in appropriations that would be made by eliminating the revenue foregone subsidy would be offset by an onbudget postal revenue loss we would just be fooling ourselves with some fancy bookkeeping footwork my colleagues the money we spend on

first 60 days of hospitalization if a patient needs more than the initial 1 month of care he is allowed an additional 30 days but must pay 135 in coinsurance therefore for a 90day hospital stay a patient would be paying at the very least 8 640 the time has come to lift from the american family the financial and emotional trauma associated with longterm illness or injury people are deeply concerned that no matter how prudently they save for a rainy day todays high cost of health care could wipe them out add to these deepseated feelings the rapid growth in the older population and you have the recipe for a potent if not catastrophic political issue the conference report before us today remedies the potentially devastating effects of a catastrophic illness by limiting these outofpocket costs no longer will a patient have to fear impoverishment in exchange for adequate health care this bill limits patient outofpocket costs to 1 400 a year for doctor bills june z 1988 there is no doubt that older americans spend considerable sums on necessary prescription drugs each year the agreement reached by the conferees addresses the spiraling costs of prescription drugs furthermore the provisions contain the necessary cost containments which will keep the bill fiscally sound i am supportive of the extended home health and hospice provisions of the conference agreement home care is a necessary extension of a complete acute care and longterm program in 1987 the national association for home care conducted a study on the effects of changes in medicare coverage for home health services ninetytwo percent of the agencies reported a significant increase in the number of clients who were sicker and in need of intensive medical or nursing care as a result of diagnostic related groups sixtyseven percent of all agencies responding have seen a significant increase in the number of claims denied by medicare over the past year by statute we must clearly define and expand home health services covered by the medicare program current medicare hospital care is intended to reduce institutional care costs by reducing the patients length of stay the time has come for congress to enact legislation which will leave no room for varying interpretation the conference agreement is that piece of legislation currently not only is longterm care inadequate it is also ambiguous hcfa has taken full authority to deny or provide home health care without discretion impositions of new reimbursement methods come at a time when the elderly who rely on home health agencies for care can least afford it in my own state of new jersey the number of medicare home care denials has increased by 691 percent between 1983 and 1987 in 1987 at least 6 000 elderly and disabled new jersey citizens were denied needed medicare home care this growing crisis is not limited to new jersey it represents the plight of millions of aging citizens throughout america the new provisions will not only clearly define daily care as 7 days a week it will also extend home health benefits to 38 days and longer if certified by a physician although i would have liked to see this provision extended even beyond 38 days this is an important step in the right direction clearly our goal is to achieve a cost effective and humane health delivery system i want to commend the conferees for accepting the more generous home health provisions of the house passed bill additionally respite care has been incorporated into the final bill in conclusion let me just say to my colleagues who question the costs they could take a lesson from the congressional district i represent by most standards it can be described as relatively affluent my constitutents dont make outlandish demands nor do they expect a lot from government however there is not a place i go that the subject of spiraling longterm health care costs is not raised these atixieties exist in all age groups and will not go away it is growing just as steadily as the older population is growing these additional costs are necessary insurance against financial devestation of extended acute hospital care and as with all insurance policies you hope and pray you will never need it but when you need it the coverage proves to be a prudent investment it brings peace of mind and protects against potentially devestating medical costs finally this bill establishes a commission to study and make recommendations for longterm health care the commission will conduct a rellable bipartisan study of the critical and complex problems of nursing home carecare which is impoverishing a genera tion of americans"], [0.9805437922477722, 0.9805437922477722, 0, "clause 6 of rule xxi states that no general appropriation bill or amendment thereto shall be received or considered if it contains a provision reappropriating unexpended balances of appropriations i section 4 b of the foley substitute reappropriates 16 million in unobligated dod funds to the president to assist the contras through june 30 section 5 a of the substitute reappropriates 4 million a month from the same unobligated dod funds to aid to assist the contras through december 31 1988 if a ceasefire is still in effect section 10 of the substitute transfer to aid 14 6 million in the same unobligated dod funds to aid to provide medical care to children who are victims of the conflict in nicaragua the substitute clearly reappropriates unexpended balances in violation of clause 6 of rule xxi the question remains however is this a general appropriations bill to which the amendment is being offered the precedents indicate that and i quote from 4 hinds precedents section 35663568 an appropriation bill covering several subjects may fairly be considered a general appropriation bill within the privilege conferred by the rule referrlng to what is now clause 4 a of rule 11 which confers on the appropriations committee the privilege to report at any time on general appropriations bills now it is true that the precedents indicate at section 835 of the house rules and manual that a general appropriations bill is not and i quote a joint resolution providing an appropriation for a single government agency and permitting a transfer of a portion of those funds to another agency nor a joint resolution transferring funds already appropriated from one specific agency to another march 6 1980 pp 67167 however in this instance we are not dealing with the mere transfer of funds from one agency to another agency for a single purpose we are dealing with the transfer of funds from the department of defense to both the office of the president and to the agency for international developmenttwo diverse agencies for two distinctive purposes aiding the contras and providing medical relief for noncombatant children while it might be argued that this is for the single purpose of providing assistance and support for peace democracy and reconciliation in central america as the title of the substitute indicates this cannot qualify as a single purpose according to the precedents i cite here procedure in the house 97th congress chapter 25 section 1 2 under the heading general appropriations bills privileged status the precedent reads and i quote the committee on appropriations filed as privileged a joint resolution making supplemental appropriations to two diverse departments for the balance of the fiscal year an examination of the congressional record of the date cited april 22 1975 at pages 1192526 reveals that the resolution in question house joint resolution 407 was in the words of its title a joint resolution making emergency supplemental appropriations for assistance to the republic of south vietnam for the fiscal year ending june 30 1975 and for other purposes specifically the joint resolution appropriated out of any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated 165 million to the department of defense for military assistance to the south vietnamese forces and 165 million to the president for indochina postwar reconstruction assistance in short the earlier precedent is clearly analogous to the present case in which unobligated appropriations are being transferred to two diverse agencies for two distinct forms of assistance in the same country in the former case it was military assistance and reconstruction assistance for vietnam in the present case it is humanitarian assistance for military forces and medical assistance for children in nicaragua had the 1975 joint resolution not been considered a general appropriation bill it could not have been filed as privileged as it was that precedent affirms that a dual purpose bill like this is a general appropriations bill it might be argued that this does not qualify as a general appropriation bill because it also includes legislative and authorizing language but there is no precedent to disqualify this on those grounds our appropriations committee reports numerous legislative provisions in each of its 13 regular appropriations bills so that argument can hardly be used to prove this is not a general appropriations measure however the distinction might be made that had this measure been introduced rather than simply called up as permitted by the rule it would have been referred to several committees as similar measures have been in the past whereas if a regular appropriation bill would be referred exclusively to the appropriations committee under house rules in other words that this is really a hybrid billhalf authorization and half appropriation but such an argument is irrelevant precisely because this has not been introduced and referred the legislative history of clause 6 indicates that it was another protection against unauthorized appropriations because this has not been introduced and referred to the appropriate committee it is all the more important that the clause 6 of rule xxi be available for use to prevent this reappropriation for new purposes without committee scrutiny and keep in mind that clause 6 differs from clause 2 clause 2 of rule xxi applies only to reported appropriations measures clause 6 on the other hand prohibits any general appropriation bill or amendment thereto from being received or considered obviously this anticipates the possibility that a general appropriation bill like this could be received or considered without being reported in conclusion clause 6 deals with one of our most important powers under the constitution the power of the purse we cannot apply a loose interpretation to those purse strings and hope to responsibly manage them i urge that the point of order be sustained 1615"]], "top_unsure":

the original enactment will be found in this bill it is a monumental piece of landmark legislation it covers many different areas and i would like to comment on just two of those areas i think that it is very important that this bill did return in some measure to the requirement in chapter 2 that libraries and librarians be involved in the planning processes and that more of a priority be assigned to books and library resources we pay a great deal of lip service to the idea of libraries and books and information being at the center of the activities of our society but when it comes to resources the allocation of resources we fall down there is a blind spot that runs through the entire society and that blind spot is most devastating in our elementary and secondary schools the other aspect that i think is very important is the recognition in a small way a greater recognition of the original intent of the great society legislation which emphasized participation by parents and participation by the communities in the development of programs related to chapter 1 we do have some language not as strong as i would like it to be which recognizes in greater measure the role of parents in the process again we pay great lipservice a great deal of lipservice to the concept of parents as partners in the educational process but professional educators repeatedly refuse to allocate resources to allow parents to really participate by offering them the kind of training that they need and the kind of opportunities for participation that they need in some small measure we have begun to get back to some of the spirit of the original legislation which called for greater parent participation i wish that it would be possible for me to say to the parents who are in volved in this program across the country that we now have a requirement in that a certain percentage of the budget must be set aside for parentparticipation activities but that is not there there is enough language there i hope for parents to begin to make demands on their local administrators for greater participation and more resources to participate in all it is a remarkable piece of legislation and i support it wholeheartedly"]]}
