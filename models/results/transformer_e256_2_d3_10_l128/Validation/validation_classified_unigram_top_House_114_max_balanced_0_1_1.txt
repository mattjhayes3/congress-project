we deal with the problems particularly on the crime subcommittee at the end of someones detour in life do you know what mr chairman those detours in life that wind up with 75 000 persons in the federal prison system on mandatory minimums has been because people cannot read do not have opportunities and do not have jobs i want to invest in a budget that lifts the boats of all people if you work hard you get a home if you work hard you can send your kids to school if you work hard you can retire that is the budget i want to support not this nosuccess budget that is being proposed by our republican friends i ask my colleagues to support the alternative budget along with the cpc and the cbc budget mr chair i rise in strong opposition to h con res 27 the house republicans budget resolution for fiscal year 2016 because it continues the reckless and irresponsible approach to fiscal policy that the house majority has championed for years with disastrous results mr chair the budgeteers on the majority side have a very poor track record when it comes to economic forecasts and projections for years they have based their entire legislative agenda and strategy on their belief that the affordable care act or obamacare would be a failure the wish was father to the thought but they were wrong because of obamacare more than 16 4 million americans now know the peace of mind that comes from affordable quality health insurance that is there when you need it house republicans oppose increasing the minimum wage claiming that it costs jobs wrong again every increase in the minimum wage has been accompanied by an expanding economy especially during the clinton administration house republicans opposing comprehensive immigration reform claim that it will lead to lower incomes and lost jobs wrong again studies conducted by groups as far apart as the chamber of commerce and the aflcio consistently show that comprehensive immigration reform will grow the gross domestic product by 1 5 trillion over 10 years given this sorry track record of economic forecasting i strongly oppose the republican budget because it favors the wealthy over middle class families and those struggling to enter or remain in the middle class i oppose this republican budget because it asks major sacrifices of seniors who can barely make ends meet and fundamentally alters the social contract by turning medicaid and snap programs into a block grant and medicare into a voucher i cannot and will not support a resolution that attempts to balance the budget on the backs of working families seniors children the poor or mortgages the future by failing to make the investments needed to sustain economic growth and opportunity for all americans mr chair the gop work harder get less budget squeezes hardworking americans by making it 1 harder to buy a home by keeping their paychecks stagnant 2 harder to send your kids to college by cutting student loans and 3 harder to enjoy a secure retirement by privatizing medicare if the house republicans work harder to get less budget were adopted here is a sample of the pain and misery that will be visited on middleclass and working families 1 an end to higher education tax credits 2 an end to needed increases in the child tax credit 3 the loss of access to tax credits for affordable health care for millions of americans and 4 a reduction in tax rates for the wealthy yielding an average tax cut of 200 000 for millionaires financed by a 2 000 tax increase on the typical middle class family mr chair this price is not right budget will make it harder to middle and working class parents to send their kids to college by 1 ending higher education tax credits and 2 cutting student loan programs and pell grants making college less affordable and adding to the already huge levels of student debt the damage caused by the republican budget is not limited to working families and students there are also lumps of coal for seniors who have earned and deserve a secure retirement 1 the medicare guarantee is turned into a voucher program with increased costs for seniors 2 seniors who have worked hard for a financially secure retirement will immediately have to pay new copays for preventive care and much higher costs for prescription drugs the republican budget also disinvests in americas future 1 slashes the part of the budget we use to invest in our childrens education and 2 devastates our investments in scientific research and innovation mr chair the republican budget exacerbates the drag on the economy resulting from a crumbling infrastructure by cutting 187 billion or more than 19 percent from transportation funding over the coming decade and provides no solution to address the current shortfall in the federal transportation fund which means we can expect construction slowdowns beginning this summer mr chair compared to the presidents budget the republican budget would result this fiscal year in 35 000 fewer children in head start and up to 6 000 fewer special education teachers paraprofessionals and other related staff the republican budget also shortchanges americas future by cutting investments in scientific research and innovation in real terms by failing to lift the draconian sequester on domestic priorities as a result under the republican budget there would be 1 300 fewer medical research grants at national institutes h and 950 fewer competitive science research awards at the nsf affecting 11 600 researchers technicians and students finally mr chair the republican budget mistreats the poorest and most vulnerable persons in our country the republican work harder get less budget takes aim at millions of families with children struggling to make ends meet and put food on the table by converting the supplemental nutrition assistance program snap into a block grant beginning in 2021 and cutting funding steeplyby 125 billion 34 percent between 2021 and by 2025 these dramatic cuts could mean in 2021 through 2025 either cutting off assistance to 11 to 12 million eligible people each year or cutting benefits by almost 55 per person per month in contrast the democratic budget works for american families by giving them the tools to buy a home send their kids to college and enjoy a secure retirement mr chair the democratic budget represents a better way we democrats understand that we are all in this together and that our current economic situation calls for a balanced approach between increased revenues and responsible reduction in expenditures our plan will protect and strengthen our recovering economy reduce the deficit in a responsible way while continuing to invest in the things that make our country strong like education health care innovation and clean energy mr chair this republican budget is bad for america but it is disastrous for the people from my home state of texas who sent me here to advocate for their interests let me highlight a few examples 1 if the republican budget resolution were to become the basis of federal fiscal policy 3 435 336 texas seniors would be forced out of traditional medicare and into a voucher program under the republican plan to end medicare as we know it texas seniors will receive a voucher instead of guaranteed benefits under traditional medicare 2 for the 3 435 336 texans aged 4554 the value of their vouchers would be capped at growth levels that are lower than the projected increases in health care costs previous analyses showed that this type of plan would cut future spending by 5 900 per senior forcing them to spend more out of pocket and diminishing their access to quality care 3 additionally private insurance plans will aggressively pursue the healthiest least expensive enrollees thereby allowing medicarecurrently the lifeline for 3 187 332 texas seniorsto wither on the vine 4 if the republican budget resolution were to be adopted by congress 206 304 texas seniors would pay more for prescription drugs next year"], [0.0013300180435180664, 0.9986699819564819, 1, "i thank the gentleman from georgia for yielding me the customary 30 minutes as we begin the second session of the 114th congress there is a long list of important issues that we could be talking about today we could be talking about ways to support job creation to grow the economy to improve gun safety to strengthen national security to pass an immigration reform bill and many other important priorities instead we are talking about h r 3762 the latest attempt by house republicans to defund planned parenthood and to repeal the affordable care act as our economy continues to recover we should be focused on expanding opportunity and helping more americans get ahead instead we are starting the new year by debating a bill that if it ever became law would put the health care of 22 million americans in jeopardy and would further restrict womens access to vital healthcare services this is yet another blatant political move by republicans to appeal to and to appease their rightwing base republican leaders have said it themselves senate republican whip john cornyn called this a political exercise he said i think we all recognize the president isnt likely to sign this bill so its not going to become a law then why on earth are we wasting the american peoples time with this terrible bill this month we have heard that speaker ryan will push to turn the house into a platform for ambitious republican policy ideas the 62nd vote to repeal or to undermine the affordable care act the llth vote to attack womens health really that is the platform for ambitious republican policy ideas i think the american people should sue republicans for malpractice when speaker ryan took the gavel last fall there was so much talk about a new chapter and fresh ideas instead we are starting 2016 with more of the stale and politically motivated bills we have become accustomed to in this republicancontrolled congress we are constantly being told by republicans that they have better ideas and that they have a better approach to health care really where is it i would remind my republican friends that in 2011 you passed a bill that actually tasked you to come up with an alternative to the affordable care act you came up with nothing just last year you passed another bill to come up with an alternative and once again you came up with nothing now here we are again with a bill that repeals the affordable care act and that tasks the republicans to come up with an alternative i am curious where is your alternative maybe it is in your notes is it hidden in some secret room in the capitol maybe donald trump has it perhaps we should alert the capitol police better yet maybe we could call the fbi to locate the republican plan on health care i remind my friends that you are in charge you run this place you can bring whatever you want to this house floor maybe you should bring a bloodhound to the house floor to try to find your alternative healthcare plan governing is something that my friends on the republican side are not very good at they are very good about saying no to everything but they cant say yes to anything the republican plan on health care is essentially a sound bite their prescription is take two tax breaks and call me in the morning not only have the republicans done nothing to expand health care for the american peopleand again they are in chargebut they have actually consistently tried to undermine health access for millions of americans to take health care away from people in this country 1400 if the republicans had it their way and actually repealed the affordable care act millions of young people under the age of 26 would be thrown off their parents health plans being a woman would once again be a preexisting condition and much more of the progress made by the aca would be rolled back contrary to what we often hear from republicans the affordable care act is not killing the economy i know facts get in the way of their arguments but the fact is that america has seen a record 69 straight months of job growth and all signs point to this historic growth continuing in september 2012 when unemployment was at 8 1 percent the republican presidential nominee mitt romney claimed that the unemployment rate would stay at 8 percent if president obama were reelected president well president obama was reelected president and mitt romney was wrong what actually happened the unemployment rate has steadily dropped each year and is now at a 7year low of 5 percent with employers adding about 210 000 jobs a month through last november as more americans get back to work one of the frequent republican claims that we have heard is that businesses would shift to parttime workers to avoid the affordable care acts requirement to provide healthcare coverage to fulltime employees a new study released this week shows that the aca resulted in little change in the number of hours worked including the first 6 months of 2015 when the employer mandate first took effect for larger companies as politico noted this study pokes a major hole in a beloved conservative talking pointthat obamacare will force employers to cut employees hours the truth is that researchers found no major changes in the probability of people working fewer hours in 2013 2014 or 2015 we have also heard republicans claim that the acas expansion of medicaid would decrease employment among lowincome workers but another study released this week showed no major changes in the way lowincome workers fit into the labor market during the first 15 months of medicaid expansion under aca contrary to conservative talking points the new coverage didnt push lowincome adults to switch jobs move from fulltime to parttime work or rush to find new jobs in fact the expansion of medicaid under the affordable care act has made a tremendous difference in increasing access to health care for americas most vulnerable families since october of 2013 more than 12 3 million americans have been able to get coverage thanks to the expansion of medicaid as a result of marketplace coverage and medicaid expansion hospital uncompensated care costs were reduced by an estimated 7 4 billion in 2014 resulting in huge savings for consumers across this country that is the difference between us democrats believe health care is a right and my republican friends believe it is a privilege to make matters worse the bill before us today would also defund planned parenthood which would put millions of lowincome womenand men i would addat risk of losing access to critical health services the fact is that one in five women has relied on a planned parenthood health center for care in her lifetime and planned parenthood serves 2 7 million patients each year additionally planned parenthood clinics often serve as one of the few affordable care options available for many women and men cutting off access to the critical health services planned parenthood provides to some of our most vulnerable citizens is simply wrong it is unconscionable sixtythree percent of voters including 72 percent of independents agree this whole effort to defund planned parenthood fits the republican pattern of targeting poor people and quite frankly it is outrageous while our nations community health centers do incredible work the republican claim that community health centers by themselves could suddenly pick up all the slack if planned parenthood is defunded is just not true and my republican friends know that the idea that our community health centers could overnight suddenly step up and step in and cover millions of new patients is absurd in fact in 21 percent of the counties with a planned parenthood health center planned parenthood is the only safety net family planning provider finally let me just also voice my strong objection to the provision in this rule which extends for another year the unrestricted authority for four house committees to conduct staff depositions at any time on any subject for any reason some committees have barely used this authority in the past year and when they have it has often been abused with the threat of subpoena held over peoples heads the power to compel american citizens to provide testimony under oath should be rarely used and specifically authorized quite frankly i think the american people are tired of the partisan witch hunts that we have grown accustomed to under this republican leadership in this house we are starting the new year not by working in a bipartisan way to do the peoples business unfortunately we are starting the new year debating the same old same old bills that put politics ahead

juniors and seniors about 2 000 students in total almost all of the students i meet are unitedstates citizens the majority are latinos some have immigrant parents and most will soon be eligible to vote all of them have one question for me it starts every q and a at every high school i visit the questions are about donald trump is he going to be our next president is it true that he wants to revoke our citizenship and deport us to the countries our parents came from is it true he wants to round us up mr gutirrez and deport us all it is very sad when the questions a congressman gets from american high school students are about how much they should fear their own government whether their own government is going to break up their families whether their own government is going to treat them not as citizens and as equal partners but as outsiders and pariahs in their own country when they hear that trump is leading in the polls they think that means there is a pretty good chance that he will be the next president when they see him on tv shows like jimmy fallon not to mention cnn and fox news they get the feeling that he is a celebrity that all of us in america admire when they hear that trump is hosting saturday night live not just being a guest but actually hosting even after saying mexican are mostly rapists criminals and drug dealersthey get the impression that calling whole groups of people rapists criminals and drug dealers based on their ethnicity or national origin is basically okay with us in america the real question these chicagoarea high school students have is hey gutierrez what are you going to do to defend us from donald trump what are you going to do to stand up for us this leads to an intense discussion about american politics and i ask the students right back what are you going to do to stand up for yourselves for your community look motivating 17 and 18yearolds to do something is not always easy including motivating them to register to vote when they are old enough and to actually go out and vote but when i ask these young americans whether they plan to get registered and vote every hand goes up in the classroom donald trump is spurring youth voter mobilization like i have never seen before nationally we know that 93 percent of latinos under the age of 18 are citizens of the united states and that every 30 seconds a latino citizen turns 18 that is about a million a year for the next decade or so if they are half as motivated as the young people i am talking to in chicago donald trump could have a tremendous impact on the youth vote in the coming election but lets be honest do we really want to motivate civic participation through fear of deportation racial profiling and families being broken up these are american teenagers growing up to distrust their government trump wants to take us back to the good old days of race relations which apparently means the 1950s when president eisenhower evicted millions of immigrants and unitedstates citizens from the united states dr carson who believes that human history is only about 5 000 years oldthat is what he says we have only been around 5 000 yearssays of mass deportation schemes i think its worth discussing here in the house we have considered measures to deport children more quickly to make groups more distrustful of the police and to delay homeland security funding testifying on one of these bills before the rules committee last year i made the unfortunate but real suggestion that republicans were gravitating toward mass deportation policies which provoked a response from the chairman mr sessions he said gutierrez there is no one in responsible republican leadership that has said we should deport 13 or 11 million people and i find it extremely distasteful that people would come here and suggest things that we have not suggested well now that people are suggesting mass deportation openly and are gaining in the public opinion polls in the republican party i wonder why there is so much silence from the republican members of this body but it is not just young latino voters in chicago that are being motivated by republican attacks when republicans attack planned parenthood and block laws to guarantee equal pay for women that motivates women to register and vote when republicans celebrate people who will not issue marriage licenses to two men or two women a lot of people in the lgbt community get motivated to register and vote when republicans rail against unions and block increases in the minimum wage while of course they earn 174 000 a year and block environmental standards and block sensible gun laws a lot of working class and middle class americans get motivated to register and vote together with those young people i talked about at

and future success of its residents remains unclear the fact i find most disturbing is that it is a completely manmade crisis it grew out of the same kind of stubborn faith in austerity measures that has handicapped our ability to govern for years it grew out of a failure to protect the flint river from environmental damage it grew out of both a failure to invest in flints crumbling infrastructure and in the willful disregard for the people of that city a city in which more than 40 percent of the residents live below the poverty line and in which the majority of families are african american my colleagues and i are here on the floor this evening to urge every member of this body to understand one thing if we fail to acknowledge the issues that led to the flint water crisis we will see similar and equally devastating events in more and more cities across the country we need to recognize that tunnel vision for deficit reduction creates more problems than it solves the emergency manager appointed by governor snyder instituted a plan to run flint like a business in order to bring it back from the brink of death in the process he sought out the least expensive options for basic needs like water in doing so he decided to pull from the corrosive and contaminated flint river without ensuring the treatment protocol necessary to ensure the water was clean we now know that although the flint river is in poor shape a little additional spending could have prevented this crisis instead flint went the bare bones route leaving a generation of residents to suffer the permanent consequences congress has once more been so focused on reducing the deficit that we have lost sight of our responsibility to govern only a few months ago did we finally abandon the absurd policy of sequestration which has hampered the functioning of countless programs over the past several years the benefits of austerity and small government are questionable at best flint has proven that and we would all be wise to remember it unfortunately that is not the only lesson that we can take away from this crisis this congress has made undermining environmental and energy regulations one of its core missions in the first 100 days of the 114th congress it voted on more environmental and energy issues than on any other topic and not a single one was aimed at protecting resources like the flint river from the kind of contamination that allowed its water to corrode lead pipes if reducing the deficit has been the first priority for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle allowing corporations and big businesses to take whatever liberties with our environment they choose has to be a close second under the majority of this house our babies would choke on smog before we limit the amount of pollution a single smokestack can spew out our streams and rivers would poison even the fish swimming in them before we would set restrictions on where these companies can dump their chemical byproducts our forests and farmlands would turn barren before we would question the longterm impact of fracking it took years to turn the flint river into the downright dangerous water source that has caused so many problems but for other rivers lakes or streams there may still be time to repair or prevent the damage that we have done flint should move us to strengthen not weaken our environmental protections there is one more lesson to learn here and it is perhaps the most important the infrastructure in flint like in so many other cities is outdated and no one at the local state or federal level seems willing or capable of making the necessary investments today in our oversight and government reform committee hearing one of the topics of concern was that even if individual homes had replaced their old lead pipes the citys pipes would still have caused a major problem that is a matter of infrastructure at the most basic level in my home state of new jersey we spent more than a decade leading the way in the battle against lead poisoning but with the onset of governor christies administration all these advances have also come to an abrupt halt there there are now 11 cities with levels of lead higher than what has been reported in flint right in my state of new jersey this contamination from lead comes from paint instead of water nonetheless it is a reflection of the reduction and diminution of services and resources to make our environment safe for our communities two of these cities are right in my district still governor christies administration has ignored the problem and thoroughly failed our children by choosing not to fund our states lead abatement fund here at the federal level we can take this even further our failure to invest in transportation and energy infrastructure is building up to a crisis of a different kind a time when our roads our bridges and our power grids begin to fail there are so many lessons we need to learn from flint i have a number of colleagues who are here with me this evening who have raised their voices in support of the people of flint and who i know agree with me that this must be a watershed moment we need to change course to prevent this from happening again and ensure the future of our nation before i turn this over i want to take a moment to add that there are a number of organizations coalitions and other associations that consistently are dedicated to protecting our natural resources they defend the clean water act and they fight for the clean air act i hope to see more of them fighting for flint in the near future i yield to the gentleman from michigan who not only represents the district in which there is flint but he is a resident born and raised in the city

serving with both of you in this body thank you very much for the opportunity to speak this evening also i want to just thank congresswoman robin kelly who is the vice chair on the gun violence task force she also chairs the cbcs health braintrust i thank you for your tireless work to ensure that gun violence is treated as a public health problem which it is i rise this evening with my colleagues in the congressional black caucus to call on congress to do somethingto do somethingabout the epidemic of gun violence that is harming our communities since the start of the yearjust 11 days agonine of my constituents have already become victims of gun violence including an elementary school teacher and an innocent mother pushing her child in a stroller just this weekend alone my community suffered three gun homicides my thoughts are with the victims family at this very terribly difficult time we have to do something enough is enough congress can and must do more to stop this senseless violence whether it is charleston oak creek sandy hook the streets of oakland or wherever too many people have already lost their lives too many families have buried loved ones and too many lives have been changed forever because of catastrophic injuries as a result of gun violence now is the time for action our constituents are demanding action the country is demanding action i have received hundreds of calls and emails from my constituents and i know other members are also hearing from their constituents they are calling for action as well earlier today in my own district oakland city council president lynette gibson mcelehany buried her grandson 17yearold torian hughes who was shot and killed during a robbery just days before christmas this has been a very difficult period for council member mcelehany and her family so in addition to our prayers not only for my council members family but for all of those in our country who have been victims of gun violence we must do something we must do something in all of their memory let me be clear congress can no longer ignore the massive toll that this epidemic is having on our constituents their families and communities last week we joined with our colleagues and millions of americans in applauding president obamas actions to reduce gun violence in our nation thanks to the presidents leadership there will be more background checks better enforcement of existing gun laws improved mental health services and new research on how to end this epidemic of gun violence but more action is needed to stop the more than 30 000 gun deaths that occur in our nation each and every year congress must pass commonsense gun reform like closing the gun show loophole bipartisan measures that are supported by the vast majority of americans and gun owners congress must also fund the expansion of mental health services but this should not be an excuse of course to do nothing on gun safety we have got to provide the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives the resources it needs to enforce our nations gun laws as a member of the appropriations committee i have fought along with my colleagues to get these vital public safety resources in the appropriations bills which keep our communities safe we must also end the extreme data restrictions that restrict law enforcements ability to protect public safety and prevent policymakers from addressing gun violence as a public health issue that is why i introduced last year h r 1449 the tiahrt restrictions repeal act which would repeal the data restrictions on gun sales and background checks these data restrictions are commonly called the tiahrt restrictions they prevent data on gun background checks from being released to the public these provisions currently impede public safety by requiring the national criminal background check system records to be destroyedmind you destroyedwithin 24 hours prohibiting the atf from requiring licensed dealers to conduct annual inventory checks to detect lost or stolen firearms and restricting local and state law enforcement from using trace data to fully investigate corrupt dealers and traffickers this is outrageous we have got to restrict and repeal these tiahrt amendments right away it will help tackle the bad apple gun dealers who provide dangerous weapons to criminals it is estimated that just 5 percent of sellers supply the weapons used in nearly 90 percent of gun crimes the tiahrt restrictions block access to vital data that lawmakers law enforcement and federal agencies need to tackle gun violence in our community of course many of us are proud to support congresswoman kellys bill which would allow the surgeon general to study gun violence as a public health issue and the consumer product safety commission to regulate firearms the time for action is now lets start listening to the american people and insist that congress do something it is really disingenuous to criticize the president for issuing commonsense gun safety measures when we have been trying for years in this bodyfor yearsto get these sensible bills passed the speaker should allow these and many other bills to come to the floor so that congress can act no more excuses we should support congressman thompsons proposal to establish the select committee on gun violence the speaker should do this now so we cant continue to really allow the misinformation to get out about congress we need to do our job we have been trying many of us the congressional black caucus and others especially democrats for many years

by thanking the gentlewoman from ohio congresswoman marcia fudge for her leadership of the congressional black caucus during the 113th congress thanks to her dedication and tireless work this caucus is better positioned to address the diverse challenges of the african american community i also want to thank the new cbc chair the honorable congressman g k butterfield of north carolina i am confident that he will do a great job leading this caucus with steadfast commitment to justice and to building an america that works for everyone let me also thank my counterpart the honorable congresswoman robin kelly for joining me in leading the cbc special orders this year i am truly honored to take on this new role and i look forward to working with her as we help carry out the critical mission of this caucus 50 years ago in the midst of the civil rights movement hundreds of brave men and women gathered in selma alabama to begin a long arduous march to montgomery in support of the fundamental truth that every american regardless of what they look like has the right to vote on march 7 1965 600 men and women set out from selma following the death of 26yearold jimmie lee jackson a deacon from marion alabama who died from gunshot wounds inflicted by a state trooper at a nonviolent demonstration theirs was a peaceful nonviolent march but it was met with fierce brutality it would take the marchers two more attempts to arrive at montgomery but on march 25 after a 12day journey they did arrive since that day our country has made significant strides in achieving equality and justice for all but significant challenges remain unmet tonight we will examine where we have come from where we are and where we would like to go as a society we must be ready to go in 1965 selma became the focal point of voter registration efforts in the south at the time only 2 percent of the citys eligible african american voters had been able to register the impact of selma to the montgomery march was profound as dr king said selma produced the voting rights legislation of 1965 the voting rights act of 1965 banned discriminatory voting requirements that disenfranchised african american voters throughout this country yet today the dream of full equality is still something many african americans can only dream of where we are nearly 6 years after the end of the recession people still struggle to find work and the gap between the rich and poor continues to grow for african americans this situation is severe given the disproportionate effect of unemployment on our communities at the same time there remains widespread poverty a defining challenge of our time this persistent economic inequality threatens to undercut the gains that african american communities have made and it undermines the idea of economic mobility the idea that if you work hard in this country and have ambition you can get ahead the economic crisis is not only facing african american communities where we are in education education is the most important economic investment we can make now and for future generations yet across the country we still have seen cuts to education at all levels and attacks on critical programs like head start and pell grants these attacks undermine the ability of african americans to get aheadthat is why i strongly support president obamas new bold initiative for free access to community collegesso too do efforts to dismantle social safety net programs which our communities depend on those efforts are irresponsible unjust and contrary to who we are as americans the congressional black caucus will make criminal justice reform a centerpiece of our agenda we will work to reduce the epidemic of poverty in this country we will work to create educational opportunities for african american children and we will support efforts to strengthen our 105 historically black colleges and universities the cbc also remains committed to fighting against efforts to dismantle the social safety net we are determined to restore section 5 of the voting rights act and to make sure everyone regardless of what they look like or where they come from has equal access to the polls and we resolve to ensure that increasing diversity in this nation is reflected in american corporations together these policies will bring us closer as a nation where we are empowering the communities of african americans and they will benefit from the full equality and live the american dream there is no doubt that we are in difficult times in this nation injustices are widespread and threaten some of our most fundamental rights but we will find no answers in apathy no comfort in complacency as we always have we will continue the march for progress for freedom

spoke about puerto ricos debt crisis and how there must be a sense of urgency because without action bondholders will be paid but teachers cops and nurses wont i want to continue today and make two points number one lets not let bondholders bleed puerto rico at a discount number two lets work together on what unites us not what divides us because the only way we will make any progress is if the people of puerto rico come together to make a plan and demand that the congress of the united states work with puerto rico on puerto ricos plan without consistent and persistent pressure from puerto rico washington will do nothing as both the administration and the congress are content to let the bondholders on wall street call the tune we all know washington should start with h r 870 the bankruptcy bill it is simply a bill that will allow puerto rico to declare bankruptcy and restructure its debt within the unitedstates legal system this would allow an orderly and fair restructuring of the debt in a court of law it is an important step but will not solve all of puerto ricos problems what puerto rico should do right now is demand to know what wall street vulture capitalists are paying for the bonds we hear a report that the bonds are selling for 15 and 20 cents on the dollar yet the bond owners want a full dollars worth of interest i say puerto rico should pay interest based on the price the billionaires actually paid and that they should disclose this amount just as a congressman does in this congress every time we make an investment then puerto rico can service its debt based on what was paid to buy the debt i came here to protect people not the profits of billionaires on wall street secondly and most importantly for the time being we must set aside politics and get away from the smokescreen of the status issue in puerto rico whether puerto rico should be a state an independent nation or remain a commonwealth cannot be the priority right now before this congress if everyone leaves puerto ricoand they are leaving by 5 000 a monthit will not matter what kind of government is left behind nobody should use the current debt crisis as an opportunity to score political points for their party at a time when the people of puerto rico must be clear precise and unified the status issue divides puerto ricans i read in the new york times the argument of the resident commissioner of the statehood party that the only solution to puerto ricos problems is to make it a state really that is going to solve the debt crisis the power crisis the public employees pension gap crisis the medicare advantage budget crisis we should be working together to figure out how puerto rico is going to pay teachers and honor their pensions how we will make sure health care is delivered to all and bridges do not collapse a statehood bill is not going to provide housing create a job or heal a sick child when members of congress ask me about puerto rico they ask me which is it is it statehood do you want a bankruptcy bill do you want more medicaid we have to prioritize we have to be clear and put aside the status issue please we need to work together i would like to use my remaining minute to restate my call to action in spanish english translation of the statement made in spanish is as follows politics and divisions could destroy the chances of forcing washington to help resolve puerto ricos debt crisis puerto rico must have a common plan that has support across all of the parties and most importantly across the island the governor must find a way to work with the resident commissioner and the resident commissioner cannot view this crisis as a campaign tool for higher office puerto rico will only be helped by this congress if and when there is a consistent and persistent call on congress by puerto ricans to act and puerto ricans need to specify what they expect congress to do the bankruptcy bill is only part of it if we still have the jones act and the same economy and economic prospects as we have now we will not advance the people must tell wall street that puerto rico is not some store to be looted and that the puerto rican people will not sit and starve as wall street counts its profits if wall street is buying bonds at a discount they should be paid at a discount but most importantly we have to work together for the betterment of puerto rico and we cannot let political divisions over statehood divide us i commit to putting aside my own passionate feelings about puerto ricos status and working with other puerto ricans in the congress and other leaders in both parties who will help us but we must first come together begin helping ourselves and have a clear plan la politica y las divisiones podrian destruir las posibilidades de obligar a washington a ayudar a resolver la crisis de la deuda de puerto rico puerto rico debe de tener un plan comdin que cuente con el apoyo de todos los partidos y sobre todo a traves de la isla el gobernador debe encontrar una manera de trabajar con el comisionado residente y el comisionado residente no puede ver esta crisis como una herramienta en sus campanias para un puesto mis alto el congreso s6lo ayudari a puerto rico siempre y cuando haya un llamado constante y persistente de los puertorriquehos exigiendo que el congreso cumpla y los puertorriquehlos tienen que indicar lo que esperan de parte del congreso la legislaci6n de bancarrota es s6lo una parte pero si todavia tenemos la ley jones y la misma economia y perspectivas econ6micas que tenemos ahora no avanzaremos el pueblo debe decirle a wall street que puerto rico no es una tienda para ser pirateada y que el pueblo de puerto rico no esperari a morir de hambre mientras wall street cuenta sus ganancias si wall street esti comprando bonos con descuentos deben ser pagados con descuentos pero sobre todo tenemos que trabajar juntos por el bien de puerto rico y no podemos dejar que las divisiones politicas sobre la estadidad nos dividan me comprometo como siempre lo he hecho a poner a un lado mis propios sentimientos sobre el estatus de puerto rico y a trabajar con otros puertorriquefios en el congreso y otros lideres en los dos partidos que est6n dispuestos a ayudarnos pero primero tenemos que unirnos empezar a ayudarnos a nosotros mismos y tener un plan claro"],

i oppose i oppose it for a number of policy reasons but i thought i would spend my time today talking about what i view is a more fundamental analytical flaw in the budget and that relates to the overall goal of the budget because if you have the wrong goal you often make a series of bad decisions to support that goal so i think it is important that we talk about what the goal of the budget is and what the goal of the budget should be the goal of the republican budget is to have zero deficits within 10 years in my opinion that is the goal because it sounds good we have all heard the line that we should not spend more money than we take in that sounds really good but it ignores to many extents the basic math of budgets it is also an unrealistic goal and it is also an unnecessary goal and as a result of pursuing an unrealistic and unnecessary goal a series of very bad decisions are embedded in the budget which is why i want to talk about the goal it is an unrealistic goal when you look at the condition of the federal budget at this moment in time after several decades of this congress and several administrations ignoring in many ways the fiscal responsibility of this great country and allowing our debt to become such a high percentage of our economy we put ourselves in a position where we have had very significant deficits and the debt levels are such that we have very limited financial flexibility as a country and if interest rates were to go up it would increasingly consume a very large percentage of our budget that is the problem and that is the situation we find ourselves in in addition mr chair we are entering a phase where the demographic trends in the country and the aging on a relative basis of the population are putting tremendous pressure on the resources of the federal government so this is a very very challenging time to take a budget that has had very significant deficits and try to bring them to zero within 10 years that is why it is unrealistic it is also unnecessary because the most important metric in the financial health of the united states of america is our debt as a percentage of our economy if we want to lower our debt as a percentage of our economy what we have to do is have a budget where our deficits expressed as a percentage of our economy are consistently lower than economic growth so we should be targeting deficits of 1 to 2 percent with a view that the minimum baseline economic growth of this country will be 2 to 3 percent and definitionally over time that will take the debt of the country as a percentage of the country down it will give us more financial flexibility in the future and position us so that when interest rates rise which they will it will consume a much smaller percentage of our budget that should be the goal but because we have this unrealistic and unnecessary goal of getting deficits to zero within 10 years my republican colleagues are forced to overcorrect in the budget to achieve that goal there are two fundamental ways to overcorrect in a budget you either raise taxes very high to get revenues to get it to zero or you cut investments very significantly now my republican colleagues dont choose to raise taxes in fact what they choose to do is to cut taxes which makes an already unrealistic goal more unrealistic so the only thing that is left the only thing that is left to bring this budget to zero within 10 years is massive massive reductions in the investments we are making in our future and in our nation which to me is a very odd decision in light of the facts that are in front of us and the facts that are in front of us are very clear we are in a global and very competitive economy and we havent made the investments particularly in things like infrastructure to position this country to compete as successfully as it should in a world that is increasingly interconnected also we have to make investments in our children mr chair we are in a knowledgebased economy and to make sure that our kids are capable of being employed and having a rising standard of living across their lives we have to invest in their future so to achieve this unrealistic goal my republican colleagues make very significant very very significant cuts to these critical investments which you could argue it has never been more important to do that in fact they bring many of these levels down to half of what they have been historicallyagain and importantly expressed as a percentage of our economy because it is irrelevant to talk about absolute numbers the only numbers that should be talked about is the budget in terms of a percentage of our economy that is why i view this budget as so troubling and misguided mr chair i spent my whole career prior to coming to congress running publicly traded companies that i started i used to observe other managers who are running publicly traded companies from time to time make really bad decisions about what to do with their business those bad decisions were often based on a fundamental premise that they would pander to the market and put forth unrealistic expectations they would make bad decisions to achieve those expectations and the story would end badly the acting chair the time of the gentleman has expired"], [0.001614212989807129, 0.9983857870101929, 1, "let me conclude by thanking the

speaking of tonight in the congressional black caucus46 of us along with senator bookerhave a vital role in this place as the pope indicated i would encourage you to keep in mind all those people around us who are trapped in the cycle of poverty they too need to be given hope the fight against poverty and hunger must be fought constantly on many fronts especially in its causes i know that americans today as in the past are working to deal with this problem that is the essence of julian bond who never stopped giving that is the essence of amelia boynton robinson who continued to fight for civil rights up until her death at the age of 104 on august 6 2015 that is the essence of congressman lou stokes a legislative giant the chairman of an appropriations subcommittee a person who went to public housing and places where children were and told america that your children are dying because they are living in substandard housing lead poisoning was killing them which gave me the opportunity as i said before to give a grant to my public housing just this past week on helping with lead poisoning i worked for lou stokes and i am very glad to note that working for him i can say truly a gentleman truly a leader to this congress i beg of you let us look at these icons and celebrate not only their lives but commit to the passion and justice of their lives and as well the words of pope francis that tell us to do unto others as we would like them to do unto us it is my privilege to again thank the members of the congressional black caucus it is with a heavy heart that i rise to speak in praise of louis stokes one of the greatest and most respected members ever to serve in this body who died on tuesday august 18 2015 at his home near cleveland ohio at the age of 90 it is not unusual in these days for commentators and politicians to talk of something called american exceptionalism but what is meant by the term one way to understand the term america is exceptional because it produces and finds persons like louis stokes and affords them the opportunity to utilize their talents to the fullest in the service of their community and their country think about it in what other nation does a little african american boy born in 1925 on the east side of cleveland and raised in the outhwaite homes housing project by a mother who worked as a domestic go on to become a lawyer who argues and wins a landmark criminal justice reform case terry v ohio 392 unitedstates 1 1968 in the united states supreme court become the first african american elected to congress is selected to chair the powerful permanent select committee on intelligence the committee on standards of official conduct the select committee on assassinations and an appropriations subcommittee responsible for more than 90 billion annually in federal outlays yes america is an exceptional nation and louis stokes was an exceptional human being louis stokes was born on february 23 1925 in cleveland ohio to charles and louise cinthy nee stone stokes when he was three years old his father who worked in a laundromat died leaving young louis and his younger brother carl to be raised by their mother who worked as a domestic for affluent families in the wealthy cleveland suburbs louis stokes maternal grandmother played a critical role in his life because she took care of the stokes boys while their mother was at work and instilled in them the idea that work with your hands is the hard way of doing things and encouraged them over and over to learn to use their heads louis stokes took the advice to heart so after attending clevelands central high school and serving in the unitedstates army during world war ii he returned home to attend what is now case western reserve university on the g i bill at night while working during the day for the veterans administration and the department of the treasury after graduating from college in two years where he excelled as a student louis stokes was accepted for admission to cleveland marshall school of law from which he graduated in 1953 three years later his brother carl would also graduate from cleveland marshall school of law and the two of them would go on to form the law firm of stokes stokes specializing in the areas of civil rights and criminal law in 1964 the supreme court decided the landmark case of reynolds v sims 377 unitedstates 533 1964 which established the principle of one person one vote governing the reapportionment of legislative boundaries the following year working on behalf of the local branch of the naacp louis stokes led the legal challenge to the ohio legislatures congressional redistricting which had the effect of diluting african american voting strength in cleveland the challenge was unsuccessful in the federal district court but undeterred louis stokes joined by charles lucas an african american republican successfully appealed the decision to the unitedstates supreme court which in an order handed down in 1967 ruled the redistricting plan unconstitutional and ordered it redrawn resulting in the creation of ohios first majorityblack district the 21st congressional district of ohio ironically louis stokes would defeat his onetime ally charles lucas to win that seat in november 1968 capturing 75 of the vote the closest of his 15 successful elections to the unitedstates house of representatives for the next 30 years from 1969 to 1999 congressman stokes tirelessly fought for his constituents in cleveland and for the best interests of the people of ohio and the united states louis stokes a founding member and chair of the congressional black caucus from 197274 was the epitome of a public servant in his second term in congress he won appointment to the powerful house appropriations committee where he served for 28 years later becoming the second african american cardinal in history when he was selected to chair the va hud and related agencies subcommittee because of the esteem in which he was held by his colleagues and the leadership louis stokes would also later be selected to chair the house permanent select committee on intelligence and the select committee charged with investigating the assassinations of president kennedy and the rev dr martin luther king jr as chairman of the house ethics committee and a person of unquestioned integrity louis stokes oversaw the committees investigation of the corruption scandal known as abscam in 197980 which eventually led to convictions of a senator and six house members louis stokes perhaps is best known for the national attention he attracted in 1987 as a member of the house select committee to investigate covert arms transactions with iran lrancontra the scandal involving the illegal sale of military weapons to the ayatollah khomeinis iran to generate money to fund the illegal contra war in nicarag ua in response to the claim by colonel oliver north that he acted out of patriotism in engineering the illegal weapons sales and diverting the proceeds to fund the contras a stern louis stokes lectured the misguided colonel north on the rule of law the true meaning of patriotism and in the process american exceptionalism i suppose that what has been most disturbing to me about your testimony is the ugly part in fact it has been more than ugly it has been chilling and in fact frightening im not just talking about your part in this but the entire scenario about government officials who plotted and conspired who set up a straw man a fall guy officials who lied misrepresented and deceived officials who planned to superimpose upon our government a layer outside of our government shrouded in secrecy and only accountable to the conspirators colonel as i sit here this morning looking at you in your uniform i cannot help but remember that i wore the uniform of this country in world war ii in a segregated army i wore it as proudly as you do even though our government required black and white soldiers in the same army to live sleep eat and travel separate and apart while fighting and dying for our country but because of the rule of law todays servicemen in america suffer no such indignity my mother a widow raised two boys she had an eighthgrade education she was a domestic worker who scrubbed floors one son became the first black mayor of a major american city the other sits today as chairman of a house intelligence committee only in america col north only in america and while i admire your love for america i hope that you will never forget that others too love america just as much as you do and that others will die for america just as quick as you will louis stokes never wavered in his belief that america could fulfill the promise of its founders or his dedication to the principles of the declaration of independence and the constitution stating im going to keep on denouncing the inequities of this system but im going to work within it to go outside the system would be to deny myselfto deny my own existence ive beaten the system ive proved it can be doneso have a lot of others but the problem is that a black man has to be extra special to win in this system why should you have to be a super black to get someplace thats whats wrong in the society the ordinary black man doesnt have the same chance as the ordinary white man does louis stokes commitment to fairness and equal treatment started long before he was elected to congress as a lawyer for the naacp he brought antidiscrimination lawsuits represented demonstrators arrested in antidiscrimination marches and sitins and took the cases of poor persons charged with crimes one of those criminal cases he took is known to every lawyer in america and appreciated by every person who cherishes the protections guaranteed by the 4th amendment to the unitedstates constitution i am speaking of the famous case of terry v ohio 392 unitedstates 1 1968 won by louis stokes in which the supreme court held that a police officer could stop and frisk an individual only where he could articulate a reasonable basis that the person was or was about to be engaged in criminal activity as a result of terry v ohio a police officer has the right to stop frisk and question an individual he reasonably suspects to be engaged in criminal activity but cannot seize items from that person if the pat down of the suspects outer clothing does not reveal any weapons posing a threat to the officers safety because of louis stokes exceptional advocacy in terry v ohio the right of every individual to secure from unreasonable searches and seizures was preserved while at the same not impeding the ability of law enforcement officers to perform their duties safely every citizen benefits from this ruling and communities that have a history of being harassed by law enforcement protected by the constitution from arbitrary and abusive treatment by law enforcement but the fight for a criminal justice system that respects the rights of all persons is not over that is why i am proud to be the ranking member of the house judiciary subcommittee on crime terrorism homeland security and investigations and a leader in the effort to reform the criminal justice system so that all persons receive fair and equal treatment regardless of their race gender religion or national origin louis stokes fought tirelessly to fulfill the promise of the 14th amendment that no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the united states nor shall any state deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws it is a fight i am proud to continue today louis stokes will be mourned by friends and colleagues on both sides of the aisle who had the privilege to serve alongside him he was a mentor to me and i will always remember his commanding presence and cherish the assistance he provided me and the example he set for new members to follow my thoughts and prayers are with his jay louis beloved wife of 55 years to his children shelly louis angela and lorene his grandchildren and the untold thousands of persons who touched and whose lives were touched by one of clevelands greatest sons i ask the house to observe a moment of silence in memory of louis stokes an exceptional american and the gentleman from ohio who served in this chamber for three decades with honor integrity and distinction"]],

takano does believe that we need to provide real accountability at the department of veterans affairs but as i said at our committee markup when he offered an almost identical amendment this substitute fails to achieve true accountability i am supportive of section 3 of his amendment which would limit administrative leave for all employees to 14 days and i agree with this commonsense policy but i would note that this limitation language is already included in my bill h r 1994 my main concern with the substitute lies within section 2 which would dramatically change the standard and the process set up in my bill of removing va employees the substitute would only give the secretary the authority to remove an employee if they represent a clear and direct threat to public health or safety which is almost an unobtainable if not immeasurable bar to reach this undefined standard would make it almost impossible for the secretary to remove any employee under this new authority thereby ensuring that the current stalemate that exists with the civil service rules would continue unfortunately as i said moments ago maintaining the status quo is not acceptable i would submit that the standard of a clear and direct threat to public health and safety would not apply to those employees involved with many of todays ongoing scandals at the va including the cost overruns of the denver hospital the budget shortfall that we are going to vote to fix later today a 3 billion budget fix the manipulation of data at the philadelphia regional office the allegations of inappropriate use of government purchase cards to the tune of 6 billion the allegations of employees at the los angeles regional office once again inappropriately shredding veterans claim information and the many other egregious actions that continue to come to light at va almost every single day members these are the very type of employees that our constituents and our veterans expect to be held accountable but the standard proposed in this substitute would not give the secretary the authority to provide the accountability we all know that va desperately needs i also have some concerns with the procedures that are laid out in the substitute to actually remove these employees i believe that unlike the procedures that i have laid out in my bill which set definitive timelines to remove someone while maintaining the due process and maintaining appeal rights the procedures laid out in this substitute could allow an employee to be on indefinite suspension for months if not years awaiting a hearing for the secretarys final decision it has been mentioned several times by my colleagues on the other side that passage of h r 1994 would return to a spoils or an atwill employment system nothing could be further from the truth let me compare a spoils or an atwill system to the protections offered in first a spoils system would allow the party in power to hire anyone usually partisan supporters that they want to reward for their political support with a federal job in contrast h r 1994 has no effect on the current hiring process second a spoils or a patronage system makes all employees at will and subject to firing for any or even no reason again that is hardly the case in my bill h r 1994 requires proof in the form of poor performance or misconduct additionally my bill requires the secretary to report the reasons for any such removals to congress within 30 days third in a spoils system a fired employee has no right of appeal in contrast under h r 1994 fired employees still have due process rights including 45 days to appeal their firing to the merit systems protection board fourth in a spoils system there is no such thing as paid administrative leave you are fired gone with no pay under civil service rules a poorperforming employee can be placed on administrative leave for essentially an unlimited time as we have seen with several miscreants identified during our investigations h r 1994 on the other hand would limit the secretarys authority to put someone on paid administrative leave to 14 days at which time the secretary must bring that person back to active duty fifth in a spoils system there are no protections for whistleblowers in an atwill system employees may or may not be covered by whistleblower protection employee discrimination et cetera type laws depending on the type of employer however under h r 1994 employees are protected by both of these types of laws plus the procedures and additional protections created under section 4 of my bill employees cannot be removed without osc approval if an open case exists and employees cannot be removed or demoted if they have an open case under the new process that is laid out in section 4 until the office of accountability review makes a final determination so ultimately not only does this amendment set a standard for removal that is not relevant to a majority of the issues that we see at the department it keeps intact the long and arduous timeline before a final approval is complete this is not fair to veterans to the department or to the employee in question to reemphasize i also have issues with the whistleblower protections that are laid out in this substitute or the lack of protections in this substitute the only mention of whistleblower protections made in this amendment says that a whistleblower may receive backpay if the merit systems protection board ultimately decides they were removed for blowing the whistle not only does this not provide any protections on the front end but it would also strip out all of the whistleblower protections i have included in section 4 of my bill we all know that the secretary has a tall task to restore trust and to rebuild the va we have to give him every tool possible to complete that mission this amendment does not come close to giving him the tool that he needs today so once again i urge members to support change and stand with veterans not the bureaucrats and the special interest groups and the status quo i urge members to oppose the takano substitute i reserve the balance of my

save consumers money we have heard for years that the energy efficiency standards restrict consumer choice but if you have shopped for light bulbs lately you know that simply isnt true modern

average american family will save about 100 every year that comes to 13 billion in savings nationwide every year but this rider threatens those savings and that is why consumer groups have consistently opposed this rider here is the reality the 2007 consensus energy efficiency standards for light bulbs were enacted with bipartisan support and continue to receive overwhelming industry support unitedstates manufacturers are already meeting the efficiency standards the effect of the rider is to allow foreign manufacturers to sell old inefficient light bulbs in the united states that violate the efficiency standards that is unfair to domestic manufacturers who have invested millions of dollars in the united states in those plants to make efficient bulbs here that meet the standards why on earth would we want to pass a rider that favors foreign manufacturers who ignore our laws and penalizes unitedstates manufacturers who are following our laws but it even gets worse the rider now poses an additional threat to unitedstates manufacturing the bipartisan 2007 energy bill requires the department of energy to establish updated light bulb efficiency standards by january 1 of next year it also provided that if final updated standards are not issued by then a more stringent standard of 45 lumens per watt automatically takes effect incandescent light bulbs currently cannot meet this backstop standard this rider blocks doe from issuing the required efficiency standards and ensures that the backstop will kick in ironically it is this rider that could effectively ban the incandescent light bulb the burgess rider directly threatens existing light bulb manufacturing jobs in pennsylvania ohio illinois across our region it would stifle innovation and punish companies that have invested in domestic manufacturing this rider aims to reverse years of technological progress only to kill jobs increase electricity bills for our constituents and worsen pollution

our friend congressman ted yoho from florida and our friend from georgia brother hice we heard great comments from dr gosar and our friend steve king from iowa these are deeply troubling times and the supreme court taking up united states v texas really accentuates that issue sometimes it is nice to just pause and pay tribute to folks for example a beautiful couple here it is a pastor his name is pastor jesse estrada sabillon and his wife maria sabillon they are with their granddaughter in this picture they are a beautiful couple you can feel the love emanating from the picture pastor jesse estrada sabillon was a baptist minister at nuevo amanecer baptist church of houston in the cloverleaf area he was an excellent carpenter he owned a home remodeling business j j sons remodeling his wife maria you can tell she loves her granddaughterwas a retired home caregiver for children with special needs they were a beautiful couple mr sabillon never accepted a salary from the church and instead relied upon his job as a carpenter to feed his family so it appears that pastor sabillon was working and acting in the vein of the apostles peter and paul particularly paul didnt want to be a burden to others so he made tents sewed and did whatever he needed to so that he wasnt a burden to others instead of being a burden to others pastor sabillon and his wife maria were a blessing to texas they were a blessing to the houston area and to so many whom they helped the special needs kids that maria helped with it appears that jesse pastor sabillon was doing what jesus said to do to be a light to others to be salt to the world to administer to others needs or as jesus told peter if you love me you will tend my flock well pastor sabillon did that and apparently did that very well this story april 15 alexis de larosa sosa 21 is a mexican national who entered the united states illegally hcso apparently harris county sheriffs office public information officer ryan sullivan

driving a 2006 chevy pickup truck and was said to be racing with a darkcolored dodge challenger or charger the houston chronicle reported on wednesday the two vehicles were said to be racing along the sam houston tollway feeder road when de larosa sosa is reported to have run a red light striking the 2004 bmw 330 driven by sabillon the couple were both pronounced dead at the scene of the crash de larosa sosa is said to have fled the scene on foot the driver of the dodge fled the scene in his vehicle officials with the harris county sheriffs office quickly notified the family of the pastor who expressed relief at the news talking about the apprehension of the suspect de larosa sosa is currently processing into the harris county jail and has not yet made a court appearance he is expected to be charged in connection with the two homicides and fleeing the scene of the fatal accident we know there are some wonderful people who have come into this country illegally there have been but there is no question that criminals have taken advantage of the situation to cross our border since it has been porous and to inflict crime on people of the united states there should be little doubt about that and then we have this story from the washington free beacon number of children illegally crossing border up 1 200 percent between 2011 and 2014 ironically it just happens to be as people were finding out south of our border and in other parts of the world that if you make it into the united states illegally then you are probably going to stay odds are 97 percent you will stay as border patrolmen have told me drug cartels across our southern border call our border patrol our homeland security the logistics and they laughingly say if they get people illegally into the country then homeland security is the logistics that ships them wherever they want them to go in the country as i have seen a number of times in the middle of the night as people are being processed and like for example the one older lady who was asked how much she paid some would say 6 000 some would say 7 000 5 000 or 8 000 on a number of occasions a border patrolman has challenged them where did you get that kind of money you dont have that kind of money it normally took repeated questioning to elicit an answer well i paid 1 800 from family in this place some people sent 2 000 from the united states and i am going to pay the rest by working it off in the united states they tell them where they want to go amazingly homeland security has shipped people that have come into the country illegally all over the country we have reports about mexican drug distribution in all of our major cities when you know that homeland security is shipping people that still owe the drug cartels money into different cities it is not hard to figure out how they are getting some of their less than happy workers helping them with their drug distribution this article from adam kredo says in this washington free beacon the number of children apprehended on the unitedstates border attempting to immigrate illegally has surged more than 1 200 percent since 2011 and the number of these children crossing the border during 2016 could be another record according to a newly released government report the number of unaccompanied alien children uacs illegally crossing the unitedstates border has increased sharply since 2011 with a surge of more than 1 200 percent just between 2011 and 2014 according to the congressional research service the agency also disclosed that the flow is increasing significantly in the first 5 months of fiscal the illegal immigration of these children hit recordbreaking numbers in 2014 with unitedstates officials apprehending more than 52 000 alien children nearly 20 000 have been apprehended within the first 5 months of 2016 setting the stage for another potentially recordbreaking year this unexpected surge of children strained unitedstates government resources and created a complex crisis of humanitarian implications the report said they increased in the first 5 months of fy 2016 however and experts warn that significant migration flows will continue until policymakers in the countries of origin and the international community address the poor socioeconomic and security conditions driving central americans to leave their homes that is interesting but i would submit that actually they will continue to surge as long as they are led to believe by the administration and the evidence continues to indicate that they will be allowed to stay in america we will send them where they may claim to have relatives or where the drug cartels tell them to request to be sent just in the last few weeks spending some days and nights on our border our southern border it is heartbreaking what you see because there are people that clearly want a better way of life they are leaving the country of origin because their countries do not enforce the rule of law there is graft there is corruption and the rule of law the law is not evenly and fairly supported and enforced across the board therefore the jobs arent there there are more opportunities here in the united states although we have breakdowns we do try to enforce the law more evenly than i would submit anywhere in the world at least until more recently when this administration makes exceptions of millions of people who are assured that they can violate the law with impunity and will be awarded for it people come from countries where there is no equality under the law and they come to this country as soon as they get here for those of us that were out in front of the supreme court today being shouted down by people who are angry many of them shouting in spanishfinebut we were told that people in their positions were all in the shadows now i did see some people lounging around under a few trees but most of them were not in the shadows they were in fact on the steps of the supreme court right there in front yelling and screaming and showing disrespect for the unitedstates national anthem and yelling trying to prevent freedom of speech it is just really interesting seeing posters like jesus was an immigrant well sort of but he never violated the law he never encouraged anyone else to violate the law in fact he urged people to go forth and do wrong no more but that is not the case the great and really tragic irony of what is taking place is people coming to america illegally demanding that the laws not be properly enforced not be fairly enforced sure there have been millions and millions and millions and millions of americans who have come through our system legally but we are the millions that did not come legally and we demand to have the same treatment as if we did come legally if we do that it will not be long before we will be in the same shape as the countries these people fled from because there is not adequate opportunities since there is not adequate room for the billion or so that we have been told may want to come to america around the world it would be far better to encourage their nations to end graft and corruption to treat people fairly across the board here is an article from the center for immigration studies it says the criminal aliens released by ice in these years who had already been convicted of thousands of crimes are responsible for a significant crime spree in american communities including 124 aliens charged with 135 new homicides inexplicably ice is choosing to release some criminal aliens multiple times these are people that not only came into the country illegally but have committed crimes multiple times many of them while they are here at least they have certainly been charged with them a total of 121 criminal aliens who were freed by ice over the 5year period between 2010 and 2014 were subsequently charged with homiciderelated crimes within that time frame three more were charged in 2015 these 121 accused murderers were associated with 250 different communities in the united states with the most clustered in california new york and texas these aliens were charged with a total of 135 homiciderelated crimes after release two of them had homiciderelated convictions even before they were released these aliens had 464 criminal convictions prior to release by ice another three aliens who were released by ice during that time were charged with homicides during the first 10 months of fy 2015 this tally does not include aliens who were released by sanctuary jurisdictions nor those aliens that were released by local law enforcement agencies after ice declined to take them into custody due to obama administration prioritization policies this list includes only those aliens that ice arrested and then released the names of the criminal aliens were redacted by the judiciary committee but the list presumably includes murderers like apolinar altamirano an illegal alien who was arrested by ice in 2013 following his conviction on local charges involving a burglary and abduction but who was released on a 10 000 bond and permitted to remain free and elect to have deportation proceedings that would take years to complete in january 2015 altamirano shot and killed 21yearold grant ronnebeck while he was working at a convenience store where altamirano had come to buy cigarettes ice has previously disclosed that 75 percent of the homicidal criminal aliens were released due to court orders including the socalled zadvydas cases in which the aliens home countries would not take them back the rest were released by ices choice the article also points out in 2014 ice released a total of 30 558 criminal aliens from its custody these aliens had already been convicted of 92 347 crimes before they were released by ice as of july 25 2015 a total of 1 895 aliens have been charged with a crime after being freed by ice in a separate communication ice provided a list of countries that currently are uncooperative in accepting their deported citizens afghanistan algeria burundi cape verde china cuba eritrea gambia ghana guinea india iran iraq ivory coast liberia libya mali mauritania morocco sierra leone somalia south sudan and zimbabwe we have the power to force these countries to either take back their citizens who have come illegally into this country or who are illegally in this countryparticularly if they have committed crimes in this countryor have consequences instead this administration chooses to provide benefits to countries like iran and afghanistan for goodness sake make sure they are running christians and jews out of afghanistan but shouldnt they at least take back their own people i was told by one of the leaders in afghanistanthis is a few years agothat their budget was around 12 billion a year they only provided about 1 5 billion all the rest came from other countries and most of that was from the united states if they wont take their people back then shut the government down they will take their people back this is ridiculous also an important point was made in this article as of july 25 2015 only about 3 percent of the 30 558 criminal aliens freed by ice in 2014 have been removed ice reports that 28 017 still had a pending immigration case as of july 25 2015 but some of them dont show up for their hearings many dont the largest percentage do not they are just given notices to appear recent national gang unitled operations include and this is from a different article from the article ice arrests more than 1 100 in operation targeting gangs it talks about all of the efforts to capture gangs lets see of the 1 133 arrests 915 were gang members and associates 1 001 were charged with criminal offenses and 132 were arrested it is just more and more numbers of drugs firearms currency again about 3 percent apparently is all they are removing of those who are committing crimes in the country jessica vaughan from a year ago had an article from may 28 the nondeported ice still releasing criminal aliens at a rapid pace she documents according to this article the majority of convicted criminal releases occurred because of obama administration policies that require ice officers to let the offenders go in some cases judges will allow aliens to be released after a bond hearing but the conditions are usually set by ice and ice attorneys say that they have been instructed not to vigorously contest an aliens request for release which brings us back to the sabillons my christian brother and my christian sister are gone and we dont enforce our immigration laws as the oath taken by those in this administration require i want to finish up by mentioning again about my being on the border i was so struck texas has utilized and provided massive amounts of money to try to help us defend our border the number one area through which people are coming into the united states moved some years back from arizona to the mcallen corridor into texas i had occasion to be on a dps boat with fantastic dps officers they had fantastic equipment that they were able to utilize to spot people who were clearly getting readybehind bushes and whatnotto cross the rio grande from the mexico side into the unitedstates it appeared clearly that some of them were just people who were going to be brought across and some were carrying things maybe they were drugs we dont really know after we had spotted these folks when we were cruising down the river on the dps boatand there were a couple of border patrol boats that were much smaller and there were other assets that allowed them to focus once we identified where these people were so that the federal border patrol would knowand after we stayed silent for a while we finally got a radio message from the border patrol that asked us to go ahead and return back to the dock way on down the river so that they could try to intercept these folks fine because i know if the department of public safety sees a raft coming across they will stop them they do destroy the raft which as i understand gets the coyote in trouble with the drug lord who sent him with the raft with people who had paid money to get them across so the dps would do that they said why dont you go ahead they are waiting for you to leave the area then we can interdict we can catch them redhanded it turns out that is exactly what they did we spent massive amounts of money and effort in spotting people before they came across the river illegally whether it was bringing drugs whether it was people coming across we knew where they were we spotted them and we directed the border patrol to them i say we it is our department of public safety people in texas we got word that is exactly what they were waiting for they came across after you left the area and now we are inprocessing them into the united states we have the power to secure our border but this administration has no will and that is why unaccompanied children are up 1 200 percent i have seen tiny little girls who couldnt have been more than 3 or 4 just in the last trip down in the days i spent down there girls like them say oh i am unaccompanied i guarantee you they did not cross that river unaccompanied they did not come 1 000 miles unaccompanied across mexico they were accompanied thank god they were not sold into sex trafficking as so many have been when we in the united states as i have been told by african friendssome of whom i have seen in the last monthsay we are the hope of the world and when we dont follow the law when we dont enforce the law when we dont enforce our own laws the world suffers as christians in africa have told me we know where we go when we die but our only hope of having a peaceful life is if america stays strong we havent done that christians are now being persecuted in greater numbers than ever in history jews are being persecuted again as if we are headed toward a new holocaust it is time for american leaders who have taken an oath to the united states constitution and to this country to realize to whom much is given from them much will be required there is going to be a day of judgment on america if we dont rise to the occasion and use what we have been blessed with i yield back the balance of my time"],

foreign aid to many americans it raises their blood pressure members of our communities often are concerned about foreign aid to other countries because they are just not quite sure where that aid is going and what that aid is accomplishing it is important that we as members of the house of representatives legislatively communicate to america how americas money is being spent in foreign countries it is important that we are accountable and that that money that aid is accountable to the taxpayers it may shock you madam speakermaybe it wontbut congress has never passed a law requiring transparency and accountability of foreign aid i will use a different phrase we have never audited our foreign aid to see if it is working and to see what it is doing so people can see whether it is successful or not the american public is uninformed about how much we spend and why we spend that money a recent publish what you fund study rated half of unitedstates agencies in the poor category when it came to transparency of aid transparency is important because it sheds light on where the money is spent it is a lot harder to steal money if everybody knows where the money went and what it was for the american people have a right to know what we are doing with their money there are a lot of success stories but many americans dont know about them so it is important that we post that information and that the agencies that help in foreign aid assistance post that information on the web so we know who is getting the money and what they are doing with that money transparency will help foreign aid it will make it harder for bad actors to steal that aid it will make those who implement our programs work more vigilantly knowing the information will also be posted online it will educate the american public about all the ways our country is helping other people around the world as i said there are a lot of success stories where people are better off because america is helping them transparency by itself however wont save all of foreign aids problems but without transparency those problems will not be solved we also need to evaluate our foreign aid program so we know what works the key portions of this bill are transparency of the aid and evaluation of the aid evaluate that aid to see if it is working and if it is working may continue to do that aid evaluate aidif it is not working then we cut it off and do something else we have all heard about the boondoggles of foreign aid big infrastructure projects are especially prone to waste and mismanagement that is why it is so critically important that as part of this bill being implemented licensed engineers who know how to do these infrastructure projects are more involved with their expert input and operational skills let me give you some examples of where foreign aid has been mismanaged schools are being built by americans overseas but some of those schools never had a student attend them the special inspector for iraq reconstruction found out that at least 8 billion in american taxpayer dollars was lost to fraud waste and abuse 44 million was spent on a residential camp to house international police trainers the camp included an olympicsized swimming pool the problem is swimming pool and all it was never used the 43 million natural gas station in afghanistan was built by the department of defense when it built the same kind of gas station for 500 000 in pakistan let me explain that again american taxpayers built a 43 million natural gas station besides the enormous outrageous cost nobody ever used the gas station in afghanistan so rigorous evaluations of our foreign aid are important because they can tell us whether or not we are really making a lasting impact we have a long way to go and the state department really doesnt have a system in place to keep track of the dollars spent on evaluation of those projects the state department can only tell how much it plans to spend in the future but as soon as it spends that money on evaluations it has no way of tracking where the money went so the state department cant even tell how many evaluations were even done last year on the aid that we are already spending even in its policy the state department is moving in the wrong direction its new evaluation policy lowers the amount of evaluations that must be done usaid has some troubling signs as well usaid spent less money on evaluations in 2014 than it did in 2013 to solve some of these problems with transparency and with accountability of our foreign aid representative connolly and myself have introduced h r 3766 the foreign aid transparency and accountability act this bill requires the president to issue guidelines requiring tough evaluations and on transparency it codifies what is already being done and increases the amount of information required to be posted online including actual expenditures and evaluations so everyone knows what we are doing and whether it is working or not we need to be reporting on more foreign aid in a more understandable way the american people want to know where their aid is going what it is for and if that aid is effective transparency and accountability for our foreign aid this is a commonsense bill and it doesnt cost any money i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.9912616014480591, 0.9912616014480591, 0,

policy devoted to the protection of the liberty of the american people with war only as the last resort and only to preserve that liberty most of the republican presidential candidates have attacked

headquarters project since 2007 this project remains a top priority for the maryland delegation bids as the chairman knows on the three sites under consideration were due in on june 22 two of the

believe that in a fair and open competition maryland has put forward sites and proposals that will ultimately be deemed a better fit for the fbi however as i have discussed with the chairman and the ranking member i remain concerned about the general services administrations recent reduction in the estimated cost of relocating existing federal facilities at the springfield virginia site since the

relocation associated with these sites in addition to that i would ask do the gentlemen agree the chairman and ranking member that such transparency on the part of gsa is needed to ensure that the

friends that turned out to be bad influences made experimental choices his mother was aware of this sudden change and saw the signs of anxiety and depression brendan though got his ged started a job at 18 grateful for work in a city with high unemployment he struggled through his early twenties his mother did everything in her power to help him as a single mom she worked and raised a family of

not properly diagnosed or treated his treatment plan did not work it was not successful as he sunk further into depression prescription drugs led to illegal drug use he selfmedicated his mother barbara did not share her home life with others for her it was an element of confusion and shame which became the norm unfortunately in their community of grand blanc heroin was readily available like many other communities lots of kids from all backgrounds were using and dying from heroin brendan first overdosed when he was 24 he was saved by his grandfather al who helped him get into rehab he was able to get ongoing treatment at sacred heart in flint where he had a great counselor who helped him things were looking up last year barbara was happy all three of her kids were employed for the
