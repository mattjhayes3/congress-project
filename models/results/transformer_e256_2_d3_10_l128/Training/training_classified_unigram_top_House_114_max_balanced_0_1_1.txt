our colleagues and we support each other in times of need i just would like to also congratulate and acknowledge congressman hakeem jeffries the gentleman from new york who is also host of this special order i appreciate the opportunity to discuss an issue that is very personal to me before i begin i just want to say that my heart goes out to the families and friends of the victims of the horrible tragedy in orlando and i can only imagine what they are going through the other thing that is illuminating to me is that as we came here and stood up for a moment of silence after that moment of silence i believe members were given a 1minute opportunity to speak on any topic that they would like to on the floor as is customary and not one person from the other side of the aisle mentioned what happened in orlando so not only was it a moment of silence for the leadership in this house but it appears that it is going to be a moment that remains silent or a topic that remains silent from the other side of the aisle eliminating racialbased health disparities depends on our ability to advance access to affordable health care for all even in the 21st century health disparities are stark especially in the african american communities where life expectancies are lower and infant mortality rates are higher than among whites today despite improvement in overall health in the united states african americans and other minority populations lag behind in numerous health areas including access to quality care timelines of care and health outcomes for years the congressional black caucus has called on republicans to join us and other house democrats in developing a plan to eliminate racial health disparities a plan that addresses the causes of health disparities such as inequities in environmental social and economic conditions in our communities instead we get from them proposals like their socalled a better way poverty proposal a stale repackaging of failed policies presented under the guise of concern about americans trapped in poverty cutting job training programs food assistance and head start will push lowincome americans further into poverty making it even more difficult for them to access the affordable and quality health care needed to secure their wellbeing and the wellbeing of their families we need to instead use the government as a source of good every american deserves to live in a safe and healthy environment yet lowincome and minority communities are much more exposed to high levels of pollution resulting in serious health problems such as asthma heart problems and cancer this is a very real problem across america a very real problem in my district thirteen million people including 3 5 million children are concentrated in the vicinity of transportation facilities and are exposed to unhealthy levels of air pollution my district is home to the port newarkelizabeth marine terminal part of the port of new york and new jersey the third largest port in the country according to the epa 25 percent of children in newark suffer from asthmathree times the state average what we need are additional federal actions to reduce harmful air pollution from ports and congested components of the national freight transportation system the issue is critical to the lowincome and minority community who suffer the disproportionately adverse health effects of these environmental hazards now since i am on the topic of environmental justice i just want to remind everyone that the republicans continue to block any action to help the thousands of children facing lifelong damage from drinking poisoned water in flint including a vote to block the families of flint act emergency supplemental their radical refusal to address this health issue will have tragic consequences for american families and i think it is representative of their overall inadequate approach to health disparities in minority communities the way to eliminate racial health disparities is neither to downplay them nor to cut programs that will assist the most vulnerable it is to address the environmental social and economic conditions that exacerbate those disparities it is to expand access to quality health care that could eliminate or reduce the onset of many of these chronic illnesses and disproportionate health outcomes it is to maintain and strengthen our investments in healthcare access and resources for disadvantaged populations in closing i also want to stress that health education must also be a focus in any efforts to eliminate racialbased health disparities african americans and other communities are disproportionately affected by poor providerpatient communication and health literacy issues consequently they often do not have access to information that enables them to make the appropriate health decisions we have a responsibility to work with our healthcare institutions and community health centers to make it easier for people to find understand and use the information and services as cochair of the congressional mens health caucus i have hosted and participated in a number of outreach events in my district to engage directly with constituents about the importance of making positive health decisions and staying proactive about their health and wellbeing so i encourage everyone watching at home to get the information you need to make smart health decisions to get the security you and your family deserve and to get the health care that we all need"], [0.001340031623840332, 0.9986599683761597,

house of representatives failed to pass a budget by the statutorily mandated date of april 15 this failure is unfortunate for our budget process but perhaps not unfortunate for the american people because no budget is better than the proposed republican budget that would have been brought to the floor our nations budget reflects priorities but the republican budget only highlights the wrong priorities the budget the house republicans wanted to bring to the floor would be even more devastating to students working families and seniors than their previous proposals the republican budget would end the medicare guarantee for seniors by converting medicare into a voucher payment that would not keep pace with medical inflation shifting billions of dollars in medical costs onto our senior citizens the republican budget would repeal the affordable care act and would jeopardize the health insurance for millions of americans even though the budget assumes all of the revenue collected by the affordable care act to pay for the affordable care act all of those taxes remain in the budget the republican budget includes a total of 6 5 trillion in spending cuts largely unspecified if this level of cuts were ever made it would devastate our investments and jobs education research and would essentially eliminate any new transportation projects on top of these devastating cuts to vital programs that support and uplift hardworking american families the republican budget calls for trillions of dollars in tax cuts that would primarily benefit millionaires and billionaires and then they claim the tax cuts would be revenue neutral suggesting that we are to believe that trillions of dollars in new taxes would be imposed to pay for those tax cuts for the wealthy but despite this the republican budget is not a credible plan are we really going to dismantle medicare are we really going to cut hundreds of billions of dollars out of education and job training and transportation are we really going to raise trillions of dollars in new taxes to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy i dont think so but the house leadership couldnt even secure enough votes for this budget proposal because a faction of their conference wanted even deeper unrealistic spending cuts budgeting is about making tough choices and the only choice the republicans seem to have made with the budget proposal is that we can only balance the budget on the backs of students workers seniors the disabled and vulnerable communities across the nation while cutting taxes for the wealthy the congressional black caucus knows that is not the right choice that is why as we have done for the last 30 years we have diligently prepared our own budget alternative to the republican budget which we would have offered as an amendment to the republican budget if they had brought up their proposal the cbc budget chooses to invest in programs that we know will grow our economy and ensure that every american family is able to prosper our budget proposes a comprehensive jobs program totaling 500 billion over 3 years that will accelerate our economic recovery and ensure that it reaches virtually every community in america while also investing in what will guarantee americas longterm economic competitiveness this jobs plan includes funding for direct jobs creation programs school modernization jobs for teachers and first responders immediate investments in our nations crumbling infrastructure assistance for neighborhoods and families still reeling from the housing crisis job training programs and summer jobs our budget calls for significant and sustained investmentsapproximately 300 billion over the next decadeabove the presidents request for programs that have been instrumental in lifting millions of americans out of poverty some of these proposals include restoration of cuts to the supplemental nutrition assistance program expanding access to affordable housing increasing access to quality and affordable education increasing funding for job training and trade adjustment assistance adjusting the earned income tax credit and child tax credit to inflation as well as decreasing the age where you can benefit for the earned income tax credit down to 21 years of age thanks to the leadership of congressman jim clyburn our budget also ensures that federal resources are targeted more efficiently toward eradicating poverty by targeting federal spending toward persistent areas of poverty through the 102030 formula our budget also includes more than 340 billion above the presidents request for education over the next decade this additional money will help make college more affordable by increasing the pell grant fully funding the presidents free community college program reducing interest rates on student loans and financing other proposals to ensure that no student graduates from college saddled with unmanageable debt the cbc budget also provides muchneeded funding for families of flint michigan to help address the shortterm and longterm cognitive and behavioral development of children exposed to high lead levels however the congressional black caucus appreciates unfortunately that flint is not the only community in america impacted by lead exposure this is why our budget includes funds to help not only flint but also other communities across the nation deal with the effects of lead exposure unlike the republican budget the cbc budget clearly shows how we pay for these additional investments our budget sets a new revenue target of 4 trillion over the next 10 years above the current revenue baseline to demonstrate how this is achievable and realistic our budget suggests several specific alternatives totaling 7 trillion that the house and senate committees can choose from to reach that target we ask for 4 trillion in new additional and specifically outline at least 7 trillion to choose from we do this by specifically talking about closing specific corporate loopholes treating capital gains and dividends as regular income a reasonable fee for financial transactions restoring the estate tax to levels paid over a few years ago specific items where you can choose from and in fact if we just cancel the bushera tax cuts we would have almost 4 trillion in new revenue right there at the end of the day our budget realistically reduces the deficit by approximately 3 2 trillion over the next decade compared to the congressional budget offices march 2016 baseline the cbc budget chooses investments in americas children and workers protects our most vulnerable communities and changes the wrong choices offered by the republican majority i hope that we will have an opportunity to debate these issues if the house

and the african american community we reflected on an unfortunate journey through slavery and segregation prejudices and discrimination though we bring black history month to a close the congressional black caucus will continue to fight for justice tonight our special order hour is bridging the divide observations on race and justice in america our attention to the divides in our society however does not end because we entered a new month we must remain focused on how we can bridge the divides in our society and how we can bring our nation closer together the divides are striking and we know them all too well the school to prison pipeline education disparities health disparities the injustices in our justice system it is well established in fact that students of color face harsher punishments in schools than their white peers leading to a higher number of youth of color in detention suspension and yes expelled african american students are arrested far more often than their white classmates black and hispanic students represent more than 70 percent of those involved in schoolrelated arrests or referrals to law enforcement currently african americans make up twofifths and hispanics onefifth of confined youth today disparities are found not only in how we punish behavior in schools but also how we fund education this is true in k12 it is also true in higher education and we know that a college degree is a path to a middle class life as african american students graduate with more debt than their white classmates the cuts to pell grants are threatening african american access to a better education without the pell grant program hundreds of thousands of young african americans would not be able to afford college the disparities in access to health coverage are startling the infant mortality rate among african americans is 2 3 times that of nonhispanic whites and african american infants are four times more likely than nonhispanic white infants to die mostly due to complications related to birth weight we must confront these prejudices and these injustices in our nation headon the congressional black caucus is committed to resolving these challenges the congressional black caucus has fought to ensure funding the pell grant pell grants are contained in each years appropriations bills we have worked hard to make sure that the maternity and newborn care are part of health care plans under the affordable care act over 390 000 african american women in the individual market alone are projected to gain maternity coverage thanksyes

last week the senate judiciary committee voted 128 to approve the confirmation of loretta lynch as the next united states attorney general bringing her confirmation to the full senate for consideration i remember it all too well a couple weeks before that when we were in that hearing room it looked like a sea of red as deltas marched in and lined up one after another wearing our colors crimson and cream deltas lined the outside of the hearing room we did that because prior to entering that room media and some of my colleagues on the other side had tried to make it a bad thing that she organized and was a founder of her college chapter of delta sigma theta sorority what we were able to do was to show them when we work together whether that is democrats and republicans or sorority members or nonsorority members when it is the right thing to do we can make a difference i was so proud last week to sit there on the front row with my other colleagueswith our chairman of the congressional black caucus congressman g k butterfield with the 100th woman sworn into the united states congress congresswoman alma adams to be there with the 21st national president of delta sigma theta sorority congresswoman marcia fudge we sat there next to loretta lynchs father reverend lorenzo lynch of north carolina while the judiciary committee favorably reported the nomination on a vote that was closer than it needed to be ms lynchs nomination is well deserved and historic ms lynch testified before the senate judiciary committee for nearly 8 hours and she responded to nearly 900 written questions which is unprecedented many of the written questions were from senators who had already declared their opposition to her nomination ms lynchs nomination has now been pending far longer than any recent attorney generals nomination which in my opinion is shameful she deserves to be voted our next attorney general if senators have a reason to vote against her nomination they should make their case public yes hiding behind procedural tactics does not help our nation as the senate has an opportunity to unite behind a wellqualified nominee for a critical position congress

because it is unnecessary puts the lives of women at risk interferes with womens constitutionally guaranteed right of privacy and diverts our attention from the real problems facing the american people a more accurate short title for this bill would be the violating the rights of women act of 2015 instead of resuming their annual war on women our colleagues across the aisle should be working with democrats to build upon the middleclass economics championed by the obama administration that have succeeded in ending the economic meltdown it inherited in 2009 and revived the economy to the point where today we have the highest rate of growth and lowest rate of unemployment since the boom years of the clinton administration we could and should instead be voting to raise the minimum wage to 10 10 per hour so that people who work hard and play by the rules do not have raise their families in poverty a far better use of our time would be to provide help to unemployed jobhunters by making access to community college affordable to every person looking to make a new start in life instead of voting to abridge the constitutional rights of women for the umpteenth time we should bring to the floor for a first vote comprehensive immigration reform legislation or legislations repairing the harm to the voting rights act of 1965 by the supreme courts decision in shelby county v holder the one thing we should not be doing is debating irresponsible messaging bills that abridge the rights of women and have absolutely no chance of overriding a presidential veto the version of h r 7 before us now is as bad today as it was when the house republican leadership insisted on bringing it to a vote a year ago the other draconian provisions of that terrible bill are retained in h r 7 which would 1 prohibit federal funds from being used for any health benefits coverage that includes coverage of abortion thus making permanent existing federal policies 2 prohibit the inclusion of abortion in any health care service furnished by a federal or district of columbia health care facility or by any physician or other individual employed by the federal government or the district 3 apply such prohibitions to district of columbia funds 4 prohibit individuals from receiving a refundable federal tax credit or any costsharing reductions for purchasing a qualified health plan that includes coverage for abortions 5 prohibit small employers from receiving the smallemployer health insurance credit provided by the health care law if the health plans or benefits that are purchased provide abortion coverage if h r 7 were enacted millions of families and small businesses with private health insurance plans that offer abortion coverage would be faced with tax increases making the cost of health care insurance even more expensive under the affordable care act insurers are able to offer abortion coverage and receive federal offsets for premiums as long as enrollees pay for the abortion coverage from separate private funds if enacted h r 7 would deny federal subsidies or credits to private health insurance plans that offer abortion coverage even if that coverage is paid for from private funds this would inevitably lead to private health insurance companies dropping abortion coverage leaving millions of women without access to affordable comprehensive health care currently 87 of private insurance health care plans offered through employers cover abortion if h r 7 were to become law consumer options for private health insurance plans would be unnecessarily restricted and the tax burden on these policy holders would increase significantly h r 7 would also deny tax credits to small businesses that offer their employees insurance plans that cover abortion which would have a significant impact on millions of families across the nation who would no longer be able to take advantage of existing tax credits and deductions for the cost of their health care for example small businesses that offer health plans that cover abortions would no longer be eligible for the small business health tax creditpotentially worth 35 50 of the cost of their premiumsthreatening 4 million small businesses selfemployed americans who are able to deduct the cost of their comprehensive health insurance from their taxable income will also be denied similar tax credits and face higher taxes h r 7 would also undermine the district of columbias home rule by restricting its use of funds for abortion care to lowincome women the hyde amendment stipulates that no taxpayer dollars are to be used for abortion care and has narrow exceptions for rape incest and health complications that arise from pregnancy which put the mothers life in danger h r 7 would restrict womens access to reproductive health care even further by narrowing the already stringent requirements set forth in the hyde amendment when the affordable care act was signed into law the president issued an executive order to ensure that federal funds are not used for abortion services this version of h r 7 goes far beyond the safeguards established under the affordable care act and sets a dangerous precedent for the future of womens reproductive health in this country because it includes two new provisions that were added at the nth hour but have never received a hearing or a markup these new provisions would 1 ban abortion coverage in multistate health plans available under the aca and 2 mandate that health plans mislead consumers about abortion coverage by requiring all plans in the healthinsurance exchanges that include abortion coverage to display that fact prominently in all advertising marketing materials or information from the insurer but interestingly does not require the same disclosure from plans that do not cover abortion h r 7 would also force health plans to mislead consumers about the laws treatment of abortion as a concession to antichoice lawmakers the aca requires insurance plans participating in the new health system to segregate monies used for abortion services from all other funds in order to aid in identifying these funds and simplify the process of segregating general premium dollars from those used to cover abortion services the aca requires that health plans estimate the cost of abortion coverage at no less than 1 per enrollee per month h r 7 would require plans covering abortion to misrepresent this practice as an abortion surcharge which is to be disclosed and identified as a portion of the consumers premium by describing abortion coverage in this way h r 7 makes it look as though it is an added extra cost available only at an additional fee when in fact it is not taken together the provisions in h r 7 have the effect and possibly the intent of arbitrarily infringing womens reproductive freedoms and pose a nationwide threat to the health and wellbeing of american women and a direct challenge to the supreme courts ruling in roe v wade one of the most detestable aspects of this bill is that it would curb access to care for women in the most desperate of circumstances women like danielle deaver who was 22 weeks pregnant when her water broke tests showed that danielle had suffered anhydramnios a premature rupture of the membranes before the fetus has achieved viability this condition meant that the fetus likely would be born with a shortening of muscle tissue that results in the inability to move limbs in addition danielles fetus likely would suffer deformities to the face and head and the lungs were unlikely to develop beyond the 22week point there was less than a 10 chance that if born danielles baby would be able to breathe on its own and only a 2 chance the baby would be able to eat on its own h r 7 hurts women like vikki stella a diabetic who discovered months into her pregnancy that the fetus she was carrying suffered from several major anomalies and had no chance of survival because of vildris diabetes her doctor determined that induced labor and caesarian section were both riskier procedures for vildd than an abortion every pregnancy is different no politician knows or has the right to assume he knows what is best for a woman and her family these are decisions that properly must be left to women to make in consultation with their partners doctors and their god h r 7 lacks the necessary exceptions to protect the health and life of the mother h r 7 is an unconstitutional infringement on the right to privacy as interpreted by the supreme court in a long line of cases going back to griswold v connecticut in 1965 and roe v wade decided in 1973 in roe v wade the court held that a state could not prohibit a woman from exercising her right to terminate a pregnancy in order to protect her health prior to viability while many factors go into determining fetal viability the consensus of the medical community is that viability is acknowledged as not occurring prior to 24 weeks gestation supreme court precedents make it clear that neither congress nor a state legislature can declare any one element be it weeks of gestation or fetal weight or any other single factoras the determinant of viability colautti v franklin 439 unitedstates 379 38889 1979 the constitutionally protected right to privacy encompasses the right of women to choose to terminate a pregnancy before viability and even later where continuing to term poses a threat to her health and safety this right of privacy was hard won and must be preserved inviolate the bill before us threatens this hard won right for women and must be defeated i urge all members to join me in opposing the rule and the underlying bill h r 7 should be pulled off of this floor i rise in strong opposition to h r 36 the pain capable unborn child protection act in the last congress i opposed this irresponsible and reckless legislation i opposed the bill which arbitrarily bans a woman from exercising her constitutionally protect right to choose to terminate a pregnancy after 20 weeks last year for the same reasons i do now this purely partisan and divisive legislation 1 unduly burdens a womans right to terminate a pregnancy and thus puts their lives at risk 2 does not contain exceptions for the health of the mother 3 as introduced and considered in the judiciary committee unfairly targeted the district of columbia and 4 infringes upon womens right to privacy which is guaranteed and protected by the unitedstates constitution in 2010 nebraska passed a law banning abortion care after 20 weeks since then 10 more red statesalabama arizona arkansas georgia idaho indiana kansas louisiana north dakota and oklahomahave enacted similar bans none of these laws has an adequate health exception only one provides an exception for cases of rape or incest h r 36 seeks to take the misguided and meanspirited policy of these states and make it the law of the land in so doing the bill poses a nationwide threat to the health and wellbeing of american women and a direct challenge to the supreme courts ruling in roe v wade one of the most detestable aspects of this bill is that it would curb access to care for women in the most desperate of circumstances it is these women who receive the 1 5 percent of abortions that occur after 20 weeks women like danielle deaver who was 22 weeks pregnant when her water broke tests showed that danielle had suffered anhydramnios a premature rupture of the membranes before the fetus has achieved viability this condition meant that the fetus likely would be born with a shortening of muscle tissue that results in the inability to move limbs in addition danielles fetus likely would suffer deformities to the face and head and the lungs were unlikely to develop beyond the 22week point there was less than a 10 chance that if born danielles baby would be able to breathe on its own and only a 2 chance the baby would be able to eat on its own danielle and her husband decided to terminate the pregnancy but could not because of the nebraska ban danielle had no recourse but to endure the pain and suffering that followed eight days later danielle gave birth to a daughter elizabeth who died 15 minutes later h r 36 hurts women like vikki stella a diabetic who discovered months into her pregnancy that the fetus she was carrying suffered from several major anomalies and had no chance of survival because of vikkis diabetes her doctor determined that induced labor and caesarian section were both riskier procedures for vikki than an abortion because vikki was able to terminate the pregnancy she was protected from the immediate and serious medical risks to her health and her ability to have children in the future was preserved every pregnancy is different no politician knows or has the right to assume he knows what is best for a woman and her family these are decisions that properly must be left to women to make in consultation with their partners doctors and their god that is why the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists the nations leading medical experts on womens health strongly opposes 20 week bans citing the threat these laws pose to womens health i also strongly oppose h r 36 because it lacks the necessary exceptions to protect the health and life of the mother in fact the majority republicans rejected an amendment offered by our colleague congressman nadler which would have added a health of the mother exception to the bill this may come as news to some in this body but each year approximately 25 000 women in the united states become pregnant as a result of rape and about a third 30 of these rapes involved women under age 18 last and most important i oppose h r 36 because

determining fetal viability the consensus of the medical community is that viability is acknowledged as not occurring prior to 24 weeks gestation late wednesday night because of how absurd h r 36 wasit was pulled from the floor by prohibiting nearly all abortions beginning at the probable postfertilization age of 20 weeks h r 36 violates this clear and long standing constitutional rule in striking down texass previability abortion prohibitions the supreme court stated in roe v wade with respect to the states important and legitimate interest in potential life the compelling point is at viability this is so because the fetus then presumably has the capability of meaningful life outside the mothers womb state regulation protective of fetal life after viability thus has both logical and biological justification if the state is interested in protecting fetal life after viability it may go as far as to proscribe abortion during that period except when it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother supreme court precedents make it clear that neither congress nor a state legislature can declare any one element be it weeks of gestation or fetal weight or any other single factoras the determinant of viability colautti v franklin 439 unitedstates 379 38889 1979 not can the government restrict a womans autonomy by arbitrarily setting the number of weeks gestation so low as to effectively prohibit access to abortion services as is the case with the bill before us if this bill ever were to become law it would not survive a constitutional challenge even to its

donald payne and congresswoman robin kelly for leading this evenings critical discussion on the state of black health a congressional black caucus assessment during national minority health month it is no surprise that we are here today because certainly we have had many firsthand experiences to know the disparities that exist across all americans but more specifically across african american communities to you mr payne thank you for having the foresight to come tonight and to you congresswoman kelly thank you for taking a leadership position in helping us share with the nation the value and the importance of protecting all lives but giving information to the nation about the state of black health it is imperative that we continue to address health disparities that affect racial minorities and work together on the efforts to advance health equity since july 1971 the congressional black caucus has sponsored national conferences and held brain trusts on black health it is so timely that we have this discussion as we observe national minority health month tonight is a call to action a charge for all of us to unite towards a common goal of improving the health of our communities everyone in america should be able to live a healthy life regardless of the color of their skin the good news is the overall health of an american has improved over the past few decades this is in part due to the increased focus on preventive medicine and dynamic new advances in medical technology however not all americans have benefited equally from healthcare improvements since the enactment of the affordable care act millions of americans now have access to quality affordable coverage according to the american medical association recent studies have shown that despite the steady improvement in overall health of the united states racial and ethnic minorities experience a lower quality of health services and are less likely to receive routine medical procedures and have higher rates of morbidity and mortality than nonminorities disparities in health care exist even when controlling for gender condition age and socioeconomic status for example cardiovascular diseases account for the largest proportion of inequality in life expectancy between african americans and nonhispanic whites according to the american cancer society african american women have a 44 percent higher death rate from breast cancer despite having a mammography screening rate that is nearly the same rate for white women according to the centers for disease control the cdc the infant death rate among african americans is still more than double that of whites tonight you are going to hear my colleagues and i discuss much data and statistics because i am from the great state of ohio and ohio ranks 47th in the nation in infant mortality with black infants dying at twice the rate of white infants according to a 2015 study conducted by the kaiser family foundation in ohio on average 14 5 black infants die per every 1 000 live births while 6 3 white infants die ohio community leaders and the greater columbus infant mortality task force are working hard to lower franklin countys infant mortality rate and the infant mortality rate in all of ohio tonight i salute them for their research for their education and for their consistency to save lives the statistics are staggering and we can and must do more to lower and eliminate them the societal burden of healthcare disparities in america manifest in multiple and major ways for example a 2014 study by the joint center for political and economic studies concluded that the combined costs of health inequalities and premature death in the united states were 1 24 trillion that 1 24 trillion is the cost between 2003 and 2006 that is why on march 23 2010 when president barack obama signed the affordable care act it was a monumental step that has helped us address the overwhelming statistics and health disparities within our community i proudly supported the affordable care act because lives matter all lives matter black lives matter now we have comprehensive healthcare reform that improves access to affordable health coverage and guarantees that the most vulnerable in our communities have access to care by improving access to quality health care for all americans the affordable care act helps reduce health disparities how does the affordable care act do this this law invests in prevention and wellness gives individuals more control over their care and expands initiatives to increase racial and ethnic diversity in healthcare professions by strengthening cultural competency training for all healthcare providers and improving communications between providers and patients the affordable care act represents the most significant federal effort to reduce disparities in this countrys history congressman payne and congresswoman kelly again i salute you i am going to repeat that because it is so important for us to let the nation know that the affordable care act represents the most significant federal effort to reduce disparities in this countrys history the affordable care act also increases funding for community health centers which serve an estimated one in three lowincome people and one in four lowincome minority residents there are over 43 community health centers in ohio including many in my district columbus neighborhood health centers heart of ohio family health centers and lower lights christian health centers these community health centers provide outstanding primary care dental behavioral health and pharmacy services in our most underserved areas in 2013 community health centers provided care to over 550 000 ohioans and recorded over 2 million patient visits we have come a long way but there is still much more for us to do all people should have the opportunity to reach their fullest potential for health we must continue to move forward to combat health disparities build healthier communities and create a stronger country in order to have a successful nation i believe we must have a healthy nation let me leave you with something a national

giveaway to big oil and could lead to an increase in gas prices big oil gives big money to campaigns and sadly big oil is getting a very big return on its investment with this bill this provision could intensify climate change have devastating environmental impacts and does nothing to save consumers money on energy costs i will be asking my colleagues to defeat the previous question if the previous question is defeated i will offer an amendment to strike this outrageous provision my colleagues will have to decide whether the good outweighs the bad before casting their vote on the omnibus bill compromise is never easy but in a divided government it is essential if we are to move forward one of my biggest critiques of this republicancontrolled congress has been the total disregard for americans who strugglethose stuck in poverty time and time again in this chamber poor people have been demonized and disparaged while those who are well off and well connected get one tax break after another after another i am pleased that in the tax extenders package there are provisions to protect millions of struggling americans from a tax increase and boost family incomes by permanently extending essential improvements to the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit for lowincome working families as well as the american opportunity tax credit to help low and middleincome families pay for college all of these improvements to these tax credits were originally passed as part of the 2009 recovery act and each has played a critical role in fueling americas economic recovery after the financial crisis making these improvements permanent would be among the biggest steps congress can take to reduce poverty and without action these credits would expire at the end of 2017 every year these improvements are expected to lift about 16 million people including about 8 million children out of poverty or closer to rising above the poverty line simply put making these improvements to the eitc and the ctc permanent will keep more children out of poverty than any other federal program the real world impact cannot be overstated for example a single mother with two children who works full time at the federal minimum wage of 7 25 an hour and makes 14 500 a year would lose her entire 1 725 child tax credit without congressional action for a family on a fixed income this would be a terrible setback additionally making the american opportunity tax credit permanent would ensure this program continues to help millions of low and middleincome families pay for college every year in addition to the millions of families these provisions would help this legislation before us takes important steps to bolster investments in education job training advanced manufacturing infrastructure and research while also strengthening national security i am especially pleased that this deal includes a provision that would make permanent tax parity for commuters who take mass transitsomething that has long been a major priority of mine for far too long the tax code has allowed employers to offer their workers more in pretax parking benefits than in mass transit benefits parity between parking and mass transit benefits was first established in the recovery act and has been extended on a shortterm basis since then the bill before us would establish permanent parity for mass transit commuters it is an attractive fringe benefit that employers can offer their workers it offers significant savings to employees who rely on mass transit it is especially important to my constituents in central and western massachusetts who take the train every day into downtown boston by averting a government shutdown and passing this deal we will be able to bring certainty to small businesses as well as companies investing in the united states while extending important incentives that support hiring and investing in lowincome communities following the historic international climate agreement reached in paris this past weekend i am also pleased that this deal would extend tax incentives for investments in wind and solar energy helping to drive significant reductions in carbon pollution and other dangerous air pollutants and provide certainty for investments in clean energy investments like these would not be possible without the recent budget deal which reversed about 90 percent of the cuts that sequestration would have made to nondefense discretionary programs in fiscal year 2016 with parity between defense and nondefense spending while there are many positive provisions in this deal one major concern is that the house republican tax extender bill would provide hundreds of billions of dollars in special interest tax breaks that are permanent and unpaid for such massive giveaways to special interests like big oil are a step in the wrong direction as our economy continues to recover we have a responsibility to the american people to pass legislation that helps to grow the paychecks of hardworking families and make the investments that will build the bright future that our children deserve i am especially troubled by the fact that the tax extenders bill continues the misguided double standard of financing tax cuts with budget deficits while insisting on offsets for any increases in domestic spending quite frankly this is dishonest coming from my republican colleagues who so often claim to be focused on reducing the deficit so many american families are working hard to get back on their feet and give their children opportunities that they deserve continuing this double standard of holding back on investments that we could be making now to help even more of our fellow citizens is inexcusable extending hundreds of billions in tax breaks to the most powerful interests when our country needs much stronger investment in jobs and economic growth for all is a troubling and sober reminder that we must do more to put hardworking families first quite frankly i think it highlights the difference between the two parties democrats have long championed the importance of investing in our infrastructure investing in our people and investing in our economy the omnibus spending bill and the tax extenders package before us today is not perfect members on both sides of the aisle are going to have to decide for themselves whether the good outweighs the bad clearly there are some good things and there are some bad things hopefully in the future we will return to regular order and do our

house i strongly oppose h r 185 the socalled regulatory accountability act under the guise of attempting to improve the regulatory process h r 185 will in truth undermine that process it invites increased industry intervention and imposes more than 6060new analytical requirements that could add years to the regulatory process they make no bones about it in this bill as a result h r 185 would seriously hamper the ability of government agencies to safeguard public health and safety as well as environmental protections workplace safety and consumer financial protections that is what we are debating at this moment my greatest concern is that h r 185 will undermine the public health safety and wellbeing of americans the ways in which it does it are almost too numerous to list here but i will mention a few first h r 185 would override critical laws that prohibit agencies from considering costs when public health and safety are at stake imagine we would pass a law that would override critical laws that prohibit agencies from considering costs when public health and safety are at stake including the clean air act the clean water act and the occupational safety and health act this means that agency officials will now be required to balance the costs of an air pollution standard with the costs of anticipated deaths and illnesses that will result in the absence of such regulations at a hearing on an earlier version of this bill in the 112th congress one witnessour witnesstestified that if this measure were in effect in the 1970s the government almost certainly would not have required the removal of most lead from gasoline until perhaps decades later this explains why numerous respected agencies consumer organizations public interest groups labor movements and environmental organizations all strongly oppose this dangerous legislation for example the coalition for sensible safeguardsconsisting of more than 70 national public interest labor consumer and environmental organizationssay the bill will grind to a halt the rulemaking process at the core of implementing the nations public health workplace safety and environmental standards another organization very much respected the natural resources defense council adds that the practical impact of the measure before us now h r 185 would be to make it difficult if not impossible to put in place any new safeguards for the public no matter what the issue now i am not sure if the authors of this measure understand the deep criticism and reservation that the scientific and academic community have about the practical impact of this measure another the consumer federation of america states that h r 185 would handcuff all federal agencies in their efforts to protect consumers and that it would override important bipartisan laws that have been in effect for years as well as more recentlyenacted laws to protect consumers from unfair and deceptive financial services unsafe food and unsafe consumer products do we understand what it is we are dealing with here this day further the aflcio warns that the bills procedural and analytical requirements add years to the regulatory processadds years to the regulatory processdelaying the development of major workplace safety rules and will cost workers their lives as more than 80 highlyrespected administrative law academics and practitioners observe the bills many illdefined new procedural and analytical requirements will engender 20 or 30 years of litigation before its requirements are clearly understood what do we have in mind what is trying to be accomplished here my next concern is that this legislation would give wellfunded business interests the opportunity to exert even greater influence over the rulemaking process and agencies we already know that the ability of corporate and business interests to influence agency rulemaking far exceeds that by groups representing the public in other words the groups representing the public already have less influence to influence agency rulemaking and we are here proposing in broad daylight to make it even worse much worse but rather than leveling the playing field this measure will further tip the balance in favor of business interests by giving them multiple opportunities to intervene in the rulemaking process including through less differential judicial review finally this measure is based on the faulty premise that regulations result in economically stifling costs kill jobs and promote uncertainty while supporters of h r 185 will undoubtedly cite a study claiming the cost of regulation exceed 1 8 trillion the congressional research service center for progressive reform and the economic policy institute all found that a prior iteration of this study was based on incomplete and irrelevant data in fact the majoritys own witnesses at a hearing on nearly identical legislation clearly debunked this argument mr christopher demuth who appeared on behalf of the conservative think tank american enterprise institute testified that the employment effects of regulation are indeterminant the other central argument put forth by proponents of this legislationthat regulatory uncertainty hurts businesseshas similarly been debunked bruce bartlett a senior policy analyst in the reagan and george h w bush administrations observes regulatory uncertainty is a canard invented by republicans that allows them to use current economic problems to pursue an agenda supported by the business community year in and year out in other words it is a simple case of political opportunism not a serious effort to deal with high unemployment that is from a bush administrator who was a senior policy analyst in the reagan administration bruce bartlett not surprisingly the administration issued a strong veto threat just yesterday stating that the bill would impose unprecedented and unnecessary procedural requirements on agencies that will prevent them from efficiently performing their statutory responsibilities rather than heeding these serious concerns the supporters of h r 185 simply want to push forward without any hearings markups or deliberative process in this congress with a bill that has absolutely no political viability i urge i plead with my colleagues to oppose this very dangerous legislation and mr chair i reserve the

couldnt be more important tonight than to have an excellent leader guiding us in this discussion because in my opinion the flint water crisis is one of the most stunning failures of the philosophy that you ought to run a government entity like a business that i have ever seen tonight the flint water crisis that is in front of us is not a tsunami it is not a tornado and it is not a flood it is decisions by people who have inflicted massive harm and damage on children and the community at large when we say children the damage to the children is absolutely incontrovertible but what about our seniors what about our people in the prime of their lives who cannot use the water in the city that they expect to use it in i submit to you that this problem is the responsibility of governor snyder who believes in running government like a business the former leader of gateway computers promised outcomes and deliverables during his campaign but he wasnt selling computers you are supposed to be giving public services to the people it is very different apparently the deliverables that he wanted to deliver delivered awful horrible outcomes for the people of flint before the flint crisis mr snyder spent 1 8 billion in tax cuts for corporations leaving very little for small struggling cities like flint of course it is all based on the philosophy that if you dont regulate rich people and big companies and you give them all the tax breaks they ever want then they are going to invest it all in the plant and equipment and wages and make it better off what a stunning failure it is a lie an untruth and a demonstrably false claim to save money the governor has been appointing political cronies as financial managers to mostly black mostly poor municipalities around the state when i say that folks in flint are mostly black i want to say this they are not all black there is a shared harm on white communities and latino communities as well i dont want people across america to think well i am not black so it is not really my problem no it is your problem if you are living in flint and drinking water no matter what your skin color or ethnic background is in flint the emergency manager suggested switching the citys drinking water supply to the flint river to save the city about 5 million thank you it will cost billions to correct the damage that this perverted philosophy of money before people has resulted in the conservative mantra says that cutting spending and shrinking government is the way to go well he sure did that and now we have this crisis on our doorstep the government and businesses do not have the same bottom line they should not have the same bottom line and we should treat businesses like businesses and public services and government like that they should not confuse one for the other we have a crisis of democracy in flint under the guise of fiscal responsibilitywhich we all know only applies to lowincome people and never the welltodo and the wellheeledthey are never asked to be fiscally responsible for example in florida the poor have to be fiscally responsible they even have to be drug tested to get welfare we give farm subsidies awaythat is welfare tooand nobody is asked to do anything it is ridiculous it is a double standard under the guise of fiscal responsibility governor snyder used the states emergency manager law to remove local power and appoint his own personal emergency managers to run the city of flint and numerous other committees in michigan including my own hometown where i was born and raised in detroit michigan i am a proud representative of minneapolis minnesota and its suburbs today but i was born in detroit i can nevernor would i want todisconnect my connection to this crisis this is my crisis this is the state where i was born and where my two older brothers and my parents and nieces and nephews live right now my brother reverend brian ellison of church of the new covenant baptist was born in flint of the 25 times that emergency financial managers have been appointed in michigan since 1990 rick snyder has appointed 15 of them in doing so he has denied these communities their right to representative democracy this kind of idea that when your town is in trouble democracy and the voice of the people cannot be part of the solution is offensive to anybody who cares about democracy instead it turns over control to an outside dictator who reports only to the governor not anyone in the community i want to talk about flint by the numbers just for a moment 8 657 is the number of children under the age of 16 exposed to lead poisoningit may be more now 5 million is the amount of money that flints emergency manager was trying to save by switching the water supply to the flint river 1 5 billion is estimated as what it would cost to now replace flints corroded water pipes 100 is the amount of money per day it would have cost to treat flints water with an anticorrosive agent 10 is the number of flint residents who have died from a legionnaires outbreak in flint that experts suspect could be linked to waterborne illnesses zero is the number of corroded pipes removed from flint since the governor decided to appoint this emergency manager now as i close i just want to say that there is another group of people who i just want to bring to light today and that is a group of people in our society who live among us who clean hotel rooms work on farms and who really work superhard these are people who may not have documentation to live in the united states one of the stories that we have yet to really put a lot of light on is the fact that undocumented people are being according to reports turned away from services you need an id to get the water there are cases where undocumented people have not been able to get the services that they need i just want to say that flints undocumented migrants hesitated to request help during the water crisis on this floor and in other legislatures around this country conservative legislators are talking about the aliens and all this kind of stuff as if these people are from another planet but my god you deny them water come on the fact of the matter is that this is a humanitarian crisis it deserves the full attention of our government the progressive caucus will offer an entry in our budget addressing this crisis and coming at it with the money yes we think the health and safety of the children and the people of flint are more important than somebodys tax cut we do believe that to be true and we are going to be standing firm for that we also urge all of our members in this body to say wait a minute anytime public policy says the only thing that matters is cutting taxes and we dont really care about public services you are going to get a crisis like this now that we have seen what this abhorrent philosophy will bring i think we can all say we need to slow down and ask ourselves the question isnt it

gun 34 000 that is someones child someones brother someones loved one someones wife someones husband someones partner and it is absolutely shameful now we heard yesterday on the steps of the capitol a terrifying story from a woman whose 10yearold daughter was murdered by someone with a gun someone who couldnt legally buy a gun because he couldnt pass a background check he was a felon but he got around that law because he went online he found the same gun that you could buy in a gun store online but without the requirement to pass a background check he bought that gun he shot that brave woman and he murdered her daughter we can take a step today to do something about that we can bring up the background check bill it is bipartisan prosecond amendment it has 186 coauthors in this house we can bring it up for a vote and we can pass it that will provide the first line of defense against people who shouldnt be able to buy guns from buying guns who are these people criminals domestic abusers terrorists those who are dangerously mentally ill they should not be able to get their hands on a gun now can we stop it in every instance no but we know that background checks work we know that we can make a real difference every day every day in the united states of america 170 felons are stopped from buying guns because of the background check program every day in the united states of america 50 domestic abusers are stopped from buying a gun because of the background check system it works we know it works why wont we bring that bill up for a vote that woman stood on the steps of the capitol yesterday that was a courageous stand she took she lost her daughter she watched her daughter be murdered right in front of her eyes she herself was shot but she is out advocating for sensible prosecond amendment reasonable gun laws that will protect people that is brave what is brave about avoiding a vote on this bill a bipartisan bill a bill that supports the second amendment a

anything regarding responsible second amendment gun laws that will protect the people that we represent we are not asking for a lot we are asking for a vote we know that background checks work your side knows it and our side know it one of the previous speakers on the underlying bill today said it is time to put politics aside and look at the policy what in the world is going on with background checks the policy is solid they work one hundred and seventy felons a day are stopped from getting a gun because of background checks fifty domestic abusers a day are stopped from getting a gun because of background checks it sounds like pretty solid policy to me it must be the politics on the other side that are getting in the way and the american people do not want that to continue ninety percent of the people who we represent are with us they say that criminals terrorists domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill should not be able to get guns and that the men and women who

in allowing us to give a message to our colleagues we hope maybe the american people will hear us but we accept that this body is the body to which and to whom we speak so i am thankful for that i want to pay tribute overall to the congressional black caucus because we are actually here speaking of health disparities because it was the caucus that triggered this debate through the years that we have been trying to get universal access to health care and was the moving force in the 2009 2008 and 2010 passage ultimately of the affordable care act where the work that we did joining congresswoman donna christianchristiansen at that time and frank pallone on the congressional health caucus but on the cbc we had the health disparities task to ensure that the language in the affordable care act addressed the issue of health disparities there was a large section on that that built on some of the work that some of us had already done creating the office of minority health that i had worked on in years past so it was the lightning bolt of the caucus and then working with the congressional asian pacific american caucus and then the congressional hispanic caucus that we raised the issue that no one was talking about i remember debating on the floor of the house on the issues of dealing with senior citizen african american men and how they access health care how do women access health care and how do women impacted by diabetes access health care these are some of the diseases that have a proclivity to the african american population we were finding out that we even had an issue where medical professionals didnt know how to ask the questions how do you address someone who needs to be diagnosed for prostate cancer or may be diagnosed for prostate cancer and is an african american male a senior citizen my father ultimately died from cancer that metastasized from the prostate to the lungs and the brain so we knew we had a serious issue so today i want to mention four points but i am going to focus on the last one obesitya question of access to health care and physical fitness many times we live in areas where there is no access to a pool or a tennis court mental healthif you lived your life in a segregated america if you were called boy and girl it is a different mental health situation than maybe others may have faced if you live in a situation of poverty of a single household maybethis is not across the boardthese issues will be impacted if you lived around gun violence if you saw your 15yearold friend being shot dead in the street there is a question of mental health that we need access to that care for us to be able to reach out or maybe counselors to be able to provide for children hiv aids is something that we have lived through i remember going to funerals of friends in the 1980s and into the 1990s particularly with hiv aids so we have worked in the congressional black caucus to massively talk about testing let me get to this point that i want to dwell just for a moment on and that is gun violence i was here on the floor earlier with my head held down and my heart heavy as my district today had a memorial they had one yesterday we will have one tomorrow and have one on wednesday i mourn with congresswoman corinne brown of florida we are offering legislation dealing with the assault weapons and to complement legislation already passed or already in place but it is important to note that this is a health issue because the centers for disease control can assess and study every health issue that faces america today but they are legislatively by law prohibited by my friends on other side of the aisle by republicans disallowed every year to give them permission to study gun violence gun violence is killing our children and killing our families in orlando it killed latinos who happened to be the attendees at the pulse club the lgbtq community was the dominant community and a hateful terroristic act using ar15s and glock guns killed them the incident was the deadliest mass shooting the next deadliest incidents in recent history were april 16 2007 virginia tech 32 killed 17 injured december 14 2012 sandy hook 26 killed 1 injured october 16 1991 killeen texas 23 killed 27 injured according to everytown index of mass shootings where four or more people are shot and killed the incident was the ninth mass shooting in the united states in 2016 and the 150th mass shooting in united states since january 1 2009 the mass shooting with guns impacts both the mental health the sanctity and the minority community it is shameful that we are not allowed to engage in the kind of research that a harvard professor talked about and that is the assessing of violence and the assessing of violence with guns the materials i have before me make it very clear that most of these violent acts are done with gunsdone with guns san bernardino chattanooga charleston garland oak creek and fort hood were all done with guns so i stand here today to challenge this issue of health disparities to say that the heavy brunt of killings singular killings are impacted by poverty lack of access to health care the proliferation of guns in our inner city communities and the failure of the united states congress to put real gun safety legislation closing the loophole the jim clyburn rule that says that if you dont get the review and approval by atf you do not get the gun you have to wait until you get the approval from atf which may be trying to determine whether this person with multiple problems mental health or background issues doesnt need to get a gun and then ultimately go kill their spouse their children their neighbors their family members or strangers so it is my belief today that this health disparities debate is crucial and we should come away from here recognizing that obesity the issues of mental health and hiv aids can be with great investment researched for cures or cancer that proliferates in our community triple negative breast cancer legislation that i have put forward and have gotten passed about that impact but it is the gun violence that we are doing absolutely nothing about the disparities and the impact on minority communities is atrocious i want to close simply by saying the word or the acronym lgbtq community i want to say it over and over again because i think it is shameful that in our debate in our recognition of the tragedy of orlando that we dont acknowledge the horrific hate crime and the hatefulness against that community as i stand here that community is diverse and there are african americans who are lgbtq so i would ask that as we move forward this week we will be reminded of this hatefulness and we will have a cure we will be reminded of this violence and we will have a cure that cure first of all will be to restrain the use of assault weapons and these weapons of wartype bullets that men and women in the united states military say have no business on the streets of america i believe congresswoman that health disparities are an important wall and division to overcome i thank the gentlewoman for having this special order to ensure that we will confront these issues and try to save lives racial disparities refer to the variation in rates of disease occurrence and disabilities between socioeconomic and or geographically defined population groups i want to focus on four areas of racial disparities in health that impact african americans that we can do something about 1 obesity 2 mental health 3 hiv aids and 4 gun violence african americans based on 2015 census data comprise 13 2 percent of the unitedstates population or about 42 million people socioeconomic status in turn is linked to mental health people who are impoverished homeless incarcerated or have substance abuse problems are at higher risk for poor mental health as the founder and chair of the congressional childrens caucus i am especially concerned about the childhood obesity epidemic among africanamerican youth more than 40 percent of african american teenagers are overweight and nearly 25 percent are obese the percentage of children aged 611 years in the united states who were obese increased from 7 percent in 1980 to nearly 18 percent in 2012 african american youth are consuming less nutritious foods such as fruits and vegetables and are not getting enough physical exercise this combination has led to an epidemic of obesity which directly contributes to numerous deadly or lifethreatening diseases or conditions including the following hypertension dyslipidemia high cholesterol or high triglyceride levels type 2 diabetes coronary heart disease stroke gallbladder disease osteoarthritis asthma bronchitis sleep apnea and other respiratory problems cancer breast colon and endometrial when ethnicity and income are considered the picture is even more troubling african american youngsters from lowincome families have a higher risk for obesity than those from higherincome families efforts such as the lets move campaign by the first lady are pivotal to ensuring that communities are able to provide healthy snacks and food and encourage healthier decisions since the mid1970s the prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased sharply for both adults and children nonhispanic blacks have the highest ageadjusted rates of obesity at 47 8 percent according to the cdc 37 6 percent of men and 56 9 percent of women twenty years and over are obese every year more than 40 million americans struggle with mental illness african american men are as likely as anyone else to have mental illness but they are less likely to get help racism continues to have an impact on the mental health of african americans negative stereotypes and attitudes of rejection have decreased but continue to occur with measurable adverse consequences historical and contemporary instances of negative treatment have led to a mistrust of authorities many of whom are not seen as having the best interests of african americans in mind according to the department of health and human services office of minority health adult blacks are 20 percent more likely to report serious psychological distress than adult whites adult blacks living below poverty are two to three times more likely to report serious psychological distress than those living above poverty adult blacks are more likely to have feelings of sadness hopelessness and worthlessness than are adult whites how african americans view mental health over generations is a major barrier to accessing mental health services and treatment in 1996 mha commissioned a national survey on clinical depression the survey explored the barriers preventing americans seeking treatment and gauged overall knowledge of and attitudes toward depression this survey revealed that 63 percent of african americans believe that depression is a personal weakness this is significantly higher than the overall survey average of 54 percent only 31 percent of african americans believed that depression was a health problem african americans were more likely to believe that depression was normal than the overall survey average 56 percent believed that depression was a normal part of aging 45 percent believed it was normal for a mother to feel depressed for at least two weeks after giving birth 40 percent believed it was normal for a husband or wife to feel depressed for more than a year after the death of a spouse many of these problems persist to this day as doctor william lawson of howard university and mhas district of columbia affiliate pointed out in an npr interview in 2012 many africanamericans have a lot of negative feelings about or not even aware of mental health services the mental health culture race and ethnicity supplement to the 1999 unitedstates surgeon generals report on mental health states the following africanamerican physicians are five times more likely than white physicians to treat africanamerican patients africanamerican patients who see africanamerican physicians rate their physicians styles of interaction as more participatory african americans seeking help for a mental health problem would have trouble finding african american mental health professionals in 1998 only 2 percent of psychiatrists 2 percent of psychologists and 4 percent of social workers said they were african americans the public mental health safety net of hospitals community health centers and local health departments are vital to many

persons with mental illness in prisons and jails jails in 44 of the 50 states and the district of columbia a prison or jail in that state holds more individuals with serious mental illness than the largest remaining state psychiatric hospital the report said african americans today are overrepresented in our jails and prisons people of color account for 60 percent of the prison population the stanford law school three strikes projects report stated that over the past 15 years the number of mentally ill people in prison in california has almost doubled in california 45 percent of state prison inmates have been treated for severe mental illness within the past year african americans also account for 14 percent of regular drug users but for 37 percent of drug arrests illicit drug use

refer patients with signs of mental illness for proper treatment or if referred patients do not seek out treatment disparities in access to care and treatment for mental illnesses have also persisted over time as noted by the office of minority health only 8 7 percent of adult blacks versus 16 percent of adult whites received treatment for mental health concerns in 20072008 only 6 2 percent of adult blacks versus 13 9 percent of adult whites received medications for mental health concerns during 2008 while 68 7 percent of adult whites with a major depressive episode in 2009 received

hiv aids texas has the 10th highest number of hiv diagnoses in 2013 and ranks 18th for deaths from hiv currently 14 percent of the people living with hiv are undiagnosed and only 30 percent of the people with hiv are virally suppressed which means that 70 percent of the people who are ill are not on medication that can help limit their ability to infect others hiv is an unnecessarily disproportionate burden on the african american and latino community there is a wall of misinformation about the illness and an uncomfortable silence regarding the need to speak about the illness not only to the young but also the older persons when treatments were first developed in the 1990s they had lots of side effects that made patients very ill few talk about the advances in hiv treatment that now involve taking 2 small pills a day with the result leaving patients feeling healthy and able to engage in lifes normal activities the virus count for those who take their medication is so low that it often does not register in tests this does not mean that people are cured but it does mean that there is no reason not to get tested so that you know if you are in need of treatment anyone can become infectedso it is up to all of us to educate our families neighbors coworkers and friends about getting tested there are some insurance company practices that have a detrimental impact on the ability of people with hiv to enroll in qualified health insurance plans in states like texas that are not fully participating in the affordable care acts medicaid expansion this is especially problematic for hiv patients who are poor some states allow insurance carriers to post misleading or intentionally vague formularies on market place websites or excluding essential hiv medications from drug formularies and impressing high cost sharing out of pocket medication cost each month should be capped"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.996351957321167, 0.996351957321167, 0, "that they had worked

from 22 million americans at the same time we have heard all sorts of misinformation and distortions on this floor about planned parenthood which is an organization that provides women and their families with health care that provides cancer screenings and that provides family planning on national television when asked whether there was any evidence that planned parenthood had broken any law even republican chairman chaffetz of the committee on oversight and government reform who investigated planned parenthood said no im not suggesting that they broke the law in fact that was the finding of other committees here yet our republican colleagues have now set up a witch hunt special committee to go after planned parenthood ironically they claim to be doing an investigation but here on the floor they have obviously already reached a conclusion and have decided to defund an organization that helps provide health care to american women and families so rolled into one bill you have something that would deny access to health care to 22 million americans and at the same time deny important health services to millions of american women and their families when our republican colleagues pose this question and say that the president is going to be faced with a tough choice i can assure them it is not a tough choice for the president because it is not a tough choice when it comes to whether or not we take affordable health care away from 22 million americans that should be an easy choice for all of us we are not going to do it it also shouldnt be a tough choice as to whether or not we defund planned parenthood and the services they provide to american women and families that is not going to be a tough choice for the president the republican leader was absolutely right when he talked about the consequences of the 2016 elections because we are fortunate that today we have a president who will not sign that bill but who will instead veto that bill our colleagues are absolutely right if you had a different president including as far as i know all of them on the republican side they would be signing this bill so this is an important statement of what our republican colleagues think is the top priority on the first day of 2016 which is to get rid of affordable health care for 22 million americans lets talk about that with the american public because i
