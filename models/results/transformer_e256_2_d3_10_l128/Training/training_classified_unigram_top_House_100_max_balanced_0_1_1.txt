this house defeated the administrations request for military aid to the contres that day today the choice before us is more difficult we must decide whether to support a modified humanitarian aid package to aid the victims of war or set a strategy that will result in approving the administrations military aid package the choice today is military aid or humanitarian aid by the nature of that choice it forces approval of an aid package that hopefully begins to heal the terrible wounds of war and moves our government a small step forward toward facilitating peace in central america the key to finding a peaceful solution to the conflicts in central america has and will be adherence to the guatemala peace process led by costa rican president oscar arias the basis of our policy in that region must be to work with and respect the other nations of central america to obtain a diplomatic solution through the peace effort underway they requested that we stop military aid we showed respect for the peace process and people of central america when we defeated a request for military assistance 1 month ago and the house must continue in that path for peace by defeating any and all military aid requests so that the peace process can continue toward a permanent ceasefire and a return to regional stability the time has come to undo the destruction of life fostered over the past 7 years to the tune of 1 billion now is the time for the american people to regain control of our options in nicaragua now is the time to pressure the administration to hold bilateral and multilateral talks with nicaragua and now is the time to turn our resources in the region from supplying weapons of war to building instruments of peace the bitter choice is that in order to prevent the passage of military assistance to the contras we must provide some modified humanitarian aid to victims of the war in nicaragua and the contras we nrc have a congressional majority and majority of americans working fervently toward peace we have a strong coalition in the house committed to rejecting lethal and nonlethal military aid we must retain that coalition the democratic aid package is not perfect qnd it does not take the preferred step which would be an end to all forms of aid to the contras however this package does make some important strides toward encouraging compliance with the central american peace plan as well as a necessary step toward an orderly and humane withdrawal of united states military aid to the contras for the first time since 1979 a truly humanitarian aid package will be sent to the people of nicaragua president arias is on record stating that this package is not inconsistent with the spirit and letter to the peace accord this package sets an essential precedent by designating half of the 30 million for the children victims of war over 10 000 orphans and thousands of youthful casualties have been caused from land mines attacks on civilian villages and targeting of health clinics in nicaragua this 14 6 million childrens survival assistance will be distributed by the agency for international development to private voluntary organizations like the red cross and the united nations children fund already in operation within nicaragua and along the honduran and costa rican borders to noncombatant children under the age of 15 the aid will be distributed by giving highest priority to those children on both sides of the war with the greatest need for assistance by making available prosthetic devices and rehabilitation provide medicine and immunization for more than 100 000 children assist burn victims and provide relief to all nicaraguan children physically injured or displaced by the nicaraguan conflict no funds will go to or through the government of nicaragua this humanitarian aid package will also include 1 4 million in assistance to the miskito indians through the international red cross so long as there is a cessation of hostilities and progress toward a negotiated ceasefire continues the miskito indians and the government of nicaragua reached a ceasefire agreement earlier this year the democratic package also includes an immediate end to all lethal aid to the contras including weapons and ammunition the leadership of congress and the gao will monitor the shipment of food blankets and medical supplies to the contras which will be accomplished by dod private contractors to assure no lethal aid is quietly included deliveries will be inspected onsite by officials of the gao while oversight of the operation lies with the intelligence committees of congress if a ceasefire is in place before the end of june 1988 then unitedstates humanitarian assistance automatically continues through international agencies in accordance with a ceasefire agree ment ii no ceasefire is in place by the end of june unitedstates assistance comes to a halt the one clear fact is that this war despite the efforts of the administration is winding down the humanitarian aid package is not designed to encourage continued warfare but to assist those who have fought in the transition to peace the contras are not nor will they ever be the solution to the conflict in central america that policy has failed for 7 years and never again will the america people tolerate millions of taxpayer dollars to go unaccounted for and countless spending violations to occur in carrying out this administrations thoughtless policy toward central america the humanitarian aid package that i will support today prevents misuse of the public trust and money it also prevents the escalation of the war in nicaragua this alternative ensures a commitment by our government to economic development social justice and true humanitarian aid to the children of nicaragua the primary effort for peace in central america must continue to rest with people of that region not the united states a negotiated ceasefire can only be accomplished by factions currently involved in the conflict continuing to meet and work out their differences american negotiators did not bring about the peace accord the five central american presidents accomplished the agreement not imposed on them from the outside and it is up to those leaders to bring about a lasting ceasefire and cessation of the conflict although our vote today will not finally end the war it can help end the administrations united states military option in nicaragua it will strengthen the congressional coalition aimed at supporting peace and ending military aid it will strengthen president arias and the peace plan by keeping diplomatic solutions alive let todays vote reflect another chapter in the effort to explore every avenue for peace while moving toward diplomacy human rights and multilateral solutions in central america"], [0.0014066100120544434, 0.9985933899879456, 1, "in may 1986 apartments and cars of activthere is evidence to suspect that yet another ists have also been targeted part of our constitutionfirst amendment the breakins first came to my attention freedomsis being subverted in this adminis early in 1985 at the time the house judicitrations attempt to aid the contras in nicara ary committees subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights which i chair had gun been concerned about the admission by fbi since 1984 there have been more than 50 director william h webster that his agents breakins at churches residences and offices had interviewed approximately 100 ameriof opponents of administration policy in cen cans who had traveled to nicaragua this tral america all of the cases have one ele revelation was troubling because many of ment in common the intruders were more in those interviewed were understandably in terested in the organizations files and data timidated to have an fbi agent question them about their travel their humanitarian than anything of value work or their organizing efforts such acthe fbi has avoided efforts to discover tivities are protected under the first who is responsible for the breakins recent amendment the subcommittee made it fbi and justice department activitiesinter clear to webster that we wanted the fbi to viewing unitedstates travelers on their return from stay out of politics the breakinswhich numbered less than two dozen in 1985were an even more troubling form of harassment however i believed at the time and i still believe that all of these breakins could not be the work of the fbi while i still have concerns with the way the fbi operates a nationwide campaign of breakins is not among them burglaries as widespread and frequent as these would never get approved from the top and few agents in the field would risk their careers by undertaking such actions on their own there are two more likely sources for these breakins if they are indeed linked from the outset i have felt that the breakins may be the work of agents of one or more central american governments or of factions representing the ruling classes in those countries we know that in the past violent governments have sent their agents to the us to harass and intimidate their opponents here the shah of iran and marcos of the philippines both had active intelligence operations in this country which spied on and harassed americans and foreign nationals alike the rightwing government of chile was involved in the car bombing in washington that killed orlando letelier is history repeating itself are foreign agents now carrying out breakins against sanctuary churches and opponents of the administrations militaristic policy in central america another possibility is that the breakins are the work of rightwing groups who support the contras and us policy in central america we know there was a private network established to raise money for the contras we also know that some members of the network were active in promoting the administrations views it is possible that they were interested as well in frustrating the efforts of groups opposing those views and sought to collect information about them unfortunately we may never know the answers to these questions i have urged the fbi to investigate the breakins but webster has declined citing advice from the department of justice which has concluded that there is no federal jurisdiction under continued pressure from the subcommittee the fbi has conducted a preliminary inquiry into breakins at two locations robert whites office and the old cambridge baptist church but by all indications these are cursory investigations and are unlikely to resolve the matter the fbi has categorically denied that it is behind the breakins while i agree that the fbi itself is probably not directly responsible for these breadins related matters involving the bureau and other federal law enforcement agencies give us concern first while adamantly denying involvement in these breakins the fbi continues to insist that it has the authority to carry out breakins and admits that it has done so in other cases in an executive order issued in 1981 president reagan delegated to the fbi the authority to carry out unconsented physical searches of the homes autos and offices of persons suspected of being agents of foreign powers under this authority the fbi claims the power to surreptitiously break into someones house without a warrant if the attorney general determines on his own that the target is an agent of a foreign power unfortunately the definition of agent of foreign power may be broad enough to cover americans criticizing administration foreign policy i strongly be lieve that such breakins are unconstitutional but the issue has never been resolved equally troubling and possibly relevant here is the fact that the fbi guidelines on intelligence gathering which are supposed to limit the circumstances in which agents may carry out breakins expressly do not apply to the receipt by the fbi of any information property or materials furnished by individuals acting on their own initiative this seems to mean that the fbi will accept from private parties the fruits of breakins that fbi agents cannot carry out themselves again the fbl has denied that it has obtained any evidence from breakins at sanctuary churches or offices of administration opponents but my subcommittee would like to know what type of informa tion the fbi does receive from private parties and whether any of it relates to reagan administration opponents a third matter of grave concern is the tale told by frank varelli of dallas tx the fbi admits that varelli was a paid informant for the bureau and that he infiltrated the committeen solidarity with thepeople of el salvador cispes for four and a half years from 198l to 1985 cispes was the subject of an intensive fbi investigation and varelli was a main source of information in that case in a dramatic appearance before our subcommittee in february varelll testified that fbi agents he worked with in dallas told him that they had broken intobethany house a religious comr munity where cispes dallas office was located the fbi has denied that fbl agents carried out such breakins it has promised to respond to the subcommittee in fullto varellis allegations but to date has not done so claiming that its investigation into the allegations is continuing finally several of the targets of breakins are themselves the subjects of fbi files documents obtained under the freedom of information act show that both the north american congress on latin america burglarized may 21 or 22 1986 and the new institute of central america burglarized at least four times since 1984 are the subjects of fbi investigations recently fbi agents sought to question nearly a dozen volunteers for tecnica which provides technical aid to nicaragua through american volunteers these cases on top of the cispes investigation suggest that the fbi is again investigating groups opposed to present us foreign policy and we have the shocking case of operation sojourner the immigration and naturalization service investigation in the southwest where for the first time in our history undercover informants went into churches wearing concealed microphones and recorded meetings and services the fbi has repeatedly denied that it is investigating the sanctuary movement but the use of undercover informants in churches by another component of the justice department has fueled the fears of many that this administration recognizes no limits inits efforts against its opponents the breakins remain an unsolved mystery the issues involved go far beyond the breakins themselves they include the balance between national security and civil liberties the role of dissent in a free society and the extent to which there has been a privitization of intelligence gathering they call into question whether and to what extent the fbi still collects intelligence on domestic critics of administration policy on april 8 the interfaith peace coalition housed in the holy redeemer lutheran church in my hometown of san jose ca was broken into the burglars were more aggressive than in earlier cases a phone was ripped out files were turned upside down a television set was smashed as fbi director webster prepares to become head of the cia as congressional committees trace the money

international economic policy reform act of 1987 i believe that the enactment of this legislation is essential to the revitalization of american industry and the economic wellbeing of many of this countrys working men and women the trade deficit in this country has dramatically increased since the reagan administration took office rising from 40 billion in 1981 to over 170 billion in 1986 the administration has demonstrated that it is unable to respond satisfactorily to our evergrowing trade problem leaving congress no option but to step in with a legislative remedy h r 3 is such a remedy and is an appropriate and long overdue answer to our astounding trade deficit of special importance to my home state of west virginia are the provisions in the bill which deal with trade adjustment assistance worker benefits and other worker retraining and assistance programs the rate of unemployment in west virginia remains one of the highest in the nation and the state has the additional dubious distinction of having the highest rate of job loss due to plant closings in the country h r 3 modifies the trade adjustment assistance program in a manner which will be very beneficial to west virginia the bill specifies that all workers certified for assistance under taa would be entitled to up to 4 000 in training and remedial education benefits if the cost of the services provided is less than 4 000 the remainder could be used to pay relocation expenses presenilty workers receiving taa assisance apply for specific training and education programs and the amount of services provided to individual workers varies depending on the programs and their availability by creating an entitlement program the bill would ensure that all workers will receive an adequate level of service the bill creates a new option of supplemental wage payments under taa for workers who take a new job that pays less than their previous job specifically workers would be entitled to receive a supplemental wages 50 percent of their taa unemployment allowances subject to the limit that their new wages and supplement combined could not exceed 80 percent of their previous wage the typical supplement would be about 2 per hour and could continue for up to 1 year under the bill workers eligible for taa would be permitted to choose between undergoing retraining or taking a lesser paying job this option is especially important to older workers who may not wish to undergo retraining and begin a new career new badly needed funding sources for taa are established in h r 3 language in the bill specifies that any tariff revenues collected as a result of import relief or unfair trade actions are to be deposited in a special adjustment industry trust fund within the treasury to be used to help support taa or any other federal program that might be established for communities in which a substantial number of workers or firms are certified for ta expenditures from the trust fund would still be subject to annual appropriations title v of the bill establishes a new program of great importance to west virginia entitled worker readjustment which would provide comprehensive services to dislocated workers who have lost their jobs due to plant closings layoffs or other major disruptions this includes but is not limited to workers directly affected by increased imports h r 3 authorizes a total of 980 million for the new worker readjustment program for fiscal year 1988 the bill directs each state to establish a tripartite council to oversee the operation of the new program the councils would be composed of equal numbers of representatives from labor management and public and nonprofit organizations in addition the bill requires each state to designate a rapid response team or office within the state government which can respond immediately to major plant closings these teams would assist workers with reemployment employee buyouts enrollment in training progams and early retirement planning and would provide other social services under the bill 30 percent of the funds for the adjustment program would be allocated to basic readjustment servicesservices to meet the immediate needs of workers following a plant closing these services include job placement assistance counseling and job clerks up to 15 percent of funds for basic services could be used for supplemental income and supportive services for displaced workers no more than 15 percent of the funds could be used for administrative costs onehalf of the funds under the new adjustment program would be used for retraining and longterm adjustment assistance to displaced workers including classroom training literacy workshop onthejob training and remedial education the bill specifies that to the maximum extent possible workers should be given training certificates or vouchers so that they can select and arrange their own retraining up to 30 percent of this category of funds could be used for supplementary income and supportive services for displaced workers who otherwise could not afford to enter such retraining funds would be distributed among the states based on a weighted formula which takes into account each states unemployment rate its unemployment rate relative to other states and its longterm unemployment rate as a state with chronically high unemployment rates west virginia would receive a fair share of these funds finally the remaining 20 percent of the adjustment funds would be allocated at the discretion of the secretary of labor for special projects of national or regional concern these projects could include industrywide activities technical assistance responses to mass layoffs or demonstration projects to reiterate while h r 3 is a highly complex piece of legislation which deals with many aspects of this countrys trade policy i am especially supportive of the worker retraining provisions in the bill these provisions will go a long way toward

providing further aid to the contras until the reports of both of the select committees investigating the irancontra affair have been filed with the house and senate on january 7 1987 by an overwhelming vote of 416 to 2 the house adopted house resolution 12 creating the select committee to investigate covert arms transactions with iran the previous day by another overwelmingly bipartisan vote of 88 to 4 the senate adopted senate resolution 23 creating the select committee on secret military assistance to iran and the nicaraguan opposition these committees were charged with important responsibilities although their chief function is to investigate those responsible for illegally selling arms to iran and providing unauthorized covert aid to the contras the committees were also specifically requested to review the international policy objectives of the united states and to make recommendations on legislative actions necessary or proper to reduce the harm to unitedstates policy that has been caused by the irancontra affair the resolution which i am introducing today simply postpones any consideration in the house of further aid to the contras until we have the benefit of the views of those committees as to the impact of the irancontra affair on unitedstates policy objectives and on what should be done to mitigate the harm done by that affair the resolution does not prohibit further aid to the contras or indeed prejudge the findings of those committees in any way it simply asks that we wait for the final verdict before entrusting further dollars and the public trust to those same officials and policies holding off a vote on contra aid until the reports of the select committees are filed would not impose a great delay the president is not expected to file his request for further aid to the contras before august or september the house select committee is scheduled to file its report by october 30 1987 the senate select committee which is currently scheduled to file its report by august 1 1987 will probably extend its deadline to the house date if the resolution which i am introducing today is adopted the house vote would be delayed only briefly i know that there will be some who will say there is no connection between the irancontra scandal and future policy but that is not true from what we know so far it is clear that some senior administration officials who are still centrally involved in promulgating and justifying our policy toward central america apparently lied to congress or tolerated lies by other officials in order to safeguard their policy objectives we must know whether they lied to congress before we can judge the validity of their calls for further aid to the contras we must know whether these are indeed individuals who would say anything to congress without regard for the truth to get more aid to the contras we must have that information before we vote on another aid request the other basis for this proposal is that we need to regain some control of the process under which we consider contraaid proposals assuming the expedited procedures for consideration of contra aid are retained we will have to make a decision on contra aid under a timetable determined by the administration and one which presumably will be favorable to the administation the formal request for aid may be timed to require a vote before the irancontra reports are filed or to coincide with a summit meeting or some other major event we cannot control completely the impact of outside events on our votes but we can and should control the impact of events inside congress on our votes the single most significant event inside congress with a direct bearing on a vote on aid to the contras is the completion of the work of the select committees i think it is clear too that the american people see a connection between the completion of the hearings and a vote on contra aid the american people are entitled to a full accounting of the policies and actions surrounding contra aid before not after a vote on any request for more taxpayer dollars to support the same policies there is little reason to hold such extensive hearings if congress and the nation cannot consider the lessons learned from this scandal in developing future policy the purpose of the irancontra hearings has been not only to expose wrongdoing but to come to a better understanding of those who engaged in these unlawful activities and of the processes which allowed these activities to occur we should have the opportunity to reflect on that information before we decide how we will vote on further aid to the contras the following is the text of the resolution h res 208 resolution to provide that it shall not be in order in

which the second and third installments of contra aid will be made available in order to give the house and senate select committees time to complete their investigations of the iranian arms scandal this is not the first time i have stood on this floor to talk about legality and fiscal accountability in the contra aid program last march i stood here because we did not know where 27 million in contra aid had gone we were reading stories in the newspaper every day about money that may have been lost or diverted to honduras or used to buy weapons instead of food and medicine at that time i introduced a resolution of inquiry to get to the bottom of the matter as a result of my resolution and the investigations which followed we learned that onehalf of the 27 million appropriation is missing we may never know where that money went we may never know whether money the congress appropriated for humanitarian aid was used to buy weapons and ammunition lastfall i stood here again when we were debating whether we should give another 100 million to the contras but i did not think we should spend another dime for the contras until weknew where the previous appropiation had gone so i introduced an amendment to prohibit any aid for the contras until we knew where the 27 million had gone my amendment lost and the house sent the unfortunate message that legality and fiscal accountability did not matter in the contra aid program one month later we learned that the united states had secretly sold weapons to iran and then diverted the profits from those arms sales to the contras and we found out that these diversions were made at a time when congress had specifically prohibited aid to the contras i had written to attorney general meese just 1 day before these disclosures were made to request the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate the arms shipments to iran and united states involvement with the contras at that time my concerns were based on news reports linking the administration to the hasenfus affair and on continuing evidence that the united states had been providing aid to the contras the very next day we learned how deeply involved the united states may actually have been with the contras according to attorney general meese between 10 million and 30 million in profits from these sales had been diverted to bank accounts held by the contras these diver sions had been made at a time when the boland amendment specifically prohibited aid to the contras in any form so i am standing here again and the questions are the same how much money was given to the contras where did the money come from was it done in violation of the law what was the money used for these are important questions and they demand answers but before we even have a chance to learn the answers the house may again face the issue of providing aid to the contras under the provisions of the aid law congress passed last year the 100 million appropriation for the contras was split into three installments a first installment of 40 million a second installment of 20 million and a final 40 million installment the first in stallment was released immediately but the second and third were delayed under the aid law the second installment is now available anytime the president wants to make use of it the third installment which is subject to a congressional resolution of disapproval is available after february 15less than 1 month from now the administration has not announced its intention to make use of the second installment and the third is not available until the middle of next month that means that 60 million in contra aid is waiting to be spent next month if the president decides he wants to apply the last installment of contra aid congress may pass a resolution of disapproval and try to prevent him from applying the aid but i do not think that we will have any clearer picture of the diversion issue in 3 weeks than we have right now we need more time and the american people need more time to learn the facts for this reason i am introducing legislation to push back the date on which the third installment becomes available from february 15 to november 15 the house investigating committee is expected to issue its final report on october 30 which would give the house 2 weeks to consider the results of that investigation before considering the release of funds for the contras in addition my legislation would place the second installment in escrow until november 15 as well my legislation allows for the changeover in fiscal years so that the money would still be earmarked for aid to the contras but it would not become available until we know more about the diversion issue after november 15 the president could report to congress on his intention to apply the remaining 60 million in appropriated funds for aid to the contras congress could still as under the original aid law pass a resolution of disapproval but instead of voting to disapprove of the third installment only the congress could vote to disapprove of the second installment as well let me make clear that my legislation would not alter the purpose of the original aid law if after november 15 the president wanted to use the 60 million for the contras and if there were no evidence at that time that a diversion might have taken place then the aid could be applied just as under the original aid law congress would however reserve the right to disapprove of the release of funds the main goal of my legislation is to give us more time to make what will be a very important decision all my legislation does is give 2 the reference in that section to on the congress and the american people the and after february 15 1987 shall be time they need to know the facts before deemed to read after november 15 1987 facing this issue once again and 3 section 206 c of the act shall be i voted against the 100 mil deemed to read as follows lion aid appropriation but it was the will of c funds transferred under subsection the unitedstates congress that the aid be approved i a shall remain available until may 31 do not question that

record of cia covert actions against governments duly elected governments i might add in the americas is a very sad history indeed guatemala in 1954 duly elected government overthrown chile 1973 duly elected government leftist though it might have been overthrown nicaragua 1981 to 1988 the cia has a long and a sordid history of undermining governments that we do not like speaker wright has strongly condemned these actions over the years because he believes the american people support the promotion of democracies to free elections and not through covert actions hundreds of thousands of american servicemen fought for their country in world war ii korea and vietnam not to come back to this country and have the cia try to overthrow duly elected governments the speaker is right he is right and he is to be commended for speaking out so strongly and forcefully against cia activity in nicaragua but the speaker today and yesterday has been attacked for stating the obvious and commenting on what has been in the public record for years you know you do not have to be a rocket scientist to figure out the cia with the backing of bush and reagan have been trying to overthrow the government of nicaragua for the past 7 years it is not me saying it it is not jim wright saying it barry goldwater has said it barry goldwater has berated when he was chairman of the intelligence committee the activities of bill casey for mining harbors in nicaragua and i want to get on to that in just a second not once has president reagan or george bush or anyone in the administration to my knowledge denied that the cia has been up to no good in nicaragua that is because they know it is true and the american people know it as well the american people do not support the cia overthrowing foreign governments they do not support the contras and they certainly do not support the undermining of our constitution that is why despite ronald reagan and george bushs best efforts they have been on tv beaucoup times they have been in this chamber talking before the american people and the congress on more contra aid more than any other single issue that the president has addressed the american people on they have been unable to convince the american people of the righteousness of their policies in fact every single poll with the exception of about 2 weeks during the irancontra hearings has indicated by margins of almost 2 to 1 that the american people look at this policy as a dismal failure if george bush and the republicans think they can turn the issue of nicaragua around and the republican leadership i might add by attacking the speaker for condemning the cia they are gravely mistaken the american people agree with jim wright on this issue and not george bush the speakers comments in regard to the cias attempt to destabilize the nicaragua government are as i indicated earlier part of the public record he has cited nothing more than what is already on the public record the testimony the world court or the iran contra committee and from sources within the administration itself in december 1981 president reagan issued a finding authorizing covert actions against nicaragua and put the cia in charge the actions of the cia have been a source of controversy and part of a long and a very sad record documenting the reaganbush administration to overthrow that government and part of the cias original covert plan was to destabilize the nicaraguan government internally testimony to this effect was given to the world court in 1985 by david mcmichael a former cia official as recently as the 7th of august this year a upi report revealed a 10 to 12 million political account earmarked for nicaraguas internal opposition and how was this information known the cia and state department officials told reporters this is where the leaks are that is where the leak has got to be plugged if there are leaks coming right out of the administration right out of the white house right out of langley how can the reaganbush administration attack the speaker for comment ing on what the american people read every day in their morning newspapers the cia has mined nicaraguas harbors distributed an assassination manual and set up a secret airstrip in costa rica to resupply the contras in at least two instances the mining of harbors and the contra resupply effort congressional bans prohibiting such activities were ignored and the truth was hidden from congress and the american people as my friend the gentleman from new york has indicated and let me if i might for a second cite what has been on the public record about the cia efforts to overthrow the nicaraguan government on april 6 1984 congress learned that the cia had mined the nicaraguan harbors the revelations infuriated republican conservative senator barry goldwater then chairman of the intelligence committee who upbraided cia director casey for not informing congress the mining of the harbor violated the boland amendment that had been adopted that had been adopted in the fiscal year 1984 as a continuing resolution and it stated that no funds available through the cia or the dod or any other agency or entity of the united states involved in intelligence activities may be obligated or expended for the purpose of supporting directly or indirectly military or paramilitary operations in nicaragua by any nation group organization movement or individual second in september 1984 the public also learned about the assassination manual written by the cia for the contras which advised the selective use of violence to neutralize and everyone knows what neutralize means carefully selected and planned targets such as court judges police and state security officials third when the congress cut off funds for the contras the irancontra affair was perpetrated and a secret supply operation was set up to fund the contras the cia knew about and some of its agencies participated in this effort in fact cia agent joseph hernandez now faces a fivecount indictment by the irancontra special prosecutor lawrence walsh for organizing and directing a resupply airlift that dropped weapons to the contras while he was station chief in the only living democracy in central america while he was station chief in costa rica from july 1985 to december 1986 he is also accused of making false statements to conceal his role in testimony before the tower commission another point col enrilque bermudez one of the most senior officers to have served somoza was anointed by the cia in 1981 to be the contras military director he is now a member of the contra political directorate bermudez has served as the administrative link to the cia throughout his full tenure this is cited in the washington post in july 1988 as recently as may 1988 the cia intervened directly in a contra meeting the contras were meeting to try to get their act together like they do about every 3 months because half of the people leave because they cannot seem to put their act together and it is important to review that cruz robelo chamorro all of these democrats that those members on that side of the aisle were hailing and bringing before us year after year after year they left they got disgusted they are gone as recently as a month ago the cia intervened directly in a contra political directorate meeting on behalf of bermudez who faced opposition from the contras internally the cia agent got on the phone and delivered a 20minute harangue through a remote telephone hookup calling the director who proposed removing bermudez who was by the way mr chamorro who was at one time one of the editors of la prensa the paper those members all hold up with such high standards and which in some instances they are indeed correct for doing but the cia through this phone hookup talking about the removal of bermudez called mr chamorro stupid and an imbecile under an oath in testimony before the world court on september 16 1985 former cia official david mcmichael revealed the outlines of the cia plan to destabilize the nicaraguan government internally a better script for what has happened with the nicaraguans in the last few months could not have been written according to mcmichael who had participated in discussion of the plan that they were to promote crossborder attacks then they would get arrestive opposition and then they would provoke action against united states diplomatic personnel exactly what happend just a few months ago according to a july 7 1988 upi report several million dollars have poured into the coffers of the internal nicaraguan opposition groups in the last year from private conservative groups and cia accounts according to united states officials and participants in the effort according to the article the cia has spent from 10 to 12 million in political accounts earmarked for nicaraguas internal opposition the report was attributed to the cia and state department officials the officials said they had encouraged internal opposition members to take and test the limits of pluralism"], [0.0016170740127563477, 0.9983829259872437, 1, "it is a

holiday commemorating martin luther kings birth as our nation observes the memory of dr king i am reassured to know that his mission is alive in the hearts and minds of a new generation the list of adjectives weve all heard used to describe martin luther king and his accomplishments is too long to recite and inevitably stops short of capturing the courageous achievements of this very extraordinary american a leader of uncommon courage and vision martin luther king dedicated his life to the ideal of justice and equality for all americans he lived with an unqualified devotion to those principles which inspired our founding fathers and in so doing he helped reshape the fabric of our democracy forevermore as we reflect on the life and times of martin luther king we are moved by how much history has passed we look back on how far weve come and we look forward to how far we have yet to travel poverty and racism are thriving in america since i came to washington in 1968 ive seen the number of homeless people growing on the streets of our capital in recent weeks ive followed the reports of racial violence in howard beach long island the citadel in south carolina and forsyth county ga and i was not surprised to read the national urban leagues bleak report the state of black america black americans already know the sad reality most poor and black americans do not have access to quality health care and do not have adequate educational training social and economic disparity is growing and economic opportunities for poor americans are narrowing the cycle of poverty and powerlessness persists in our society justice and equal opportunity for the wealthy and powerful is a far cry from justice and equal opportunity for the poor and powerless we are a long long way from martin luther kings dream of a better america and what is perhaps most troubling of all is the newfound tolerance our nations elected leaders have shown for the double standard of justice which is jeopardizing the future of american democracy the failure of elected leaders at every level of government to be fully committed to the general wellbeing of all our citizenry is the single greatest obstacle on the path to sustained progress and prosperity as long as congress is uncaring about the increasing number of americans who are uneducated unemployed undernourished and suffering from all the rages of poverty as long as equal justice waivers outside the grasp of a growing number of poor americans we are faltering on the throes of decay today we are a vulnerable nation with an uncertain future for there are no bombs or war machines which can protect a nation crumbling from within but i am encouraged because so many americans including each member of this body have had some opportunity to contemplate the life and times of martin luther king dr kings story is the great american story pursuing his dream martin luther kings mission was to seek a higher truth and his life was about overcoming the odds it was a tragic day in our history when martin luther king was so violently snatched away from us long before he finished his work on this earth but when martin luther king left us he left us his legacy history will record these days as a troubled time when peace eluded our every grasp when justice played prejudice and poverty flourished today we are blessed to have the memory ol dr martin luther king to cherish and to inspire us in these dark days of uncertainty martin luther king inspired our nation to reach a little higher to rise above the curse of poverty and the evils of racism and to create a more perfect democracy where all citizens share equally in the destiny of our great nation if we in this body love our country as much as dr king and our founding fathers and i have every reason to believe we do we must seize this opportunity to rededicate ourselves to the unfinished agenda in the spirit of dr martin luther king we must recommit ourselves to the human agenda we must address the poor and the powerless if we are to create a more perfect union and secure the future of the united states of america"],

friendship i will miss our conversations on the floor of the many moving words said of sala in recent days i think that these words spoken at her memorial service in san francisco by frank kielinger gave the greatest sense of who sala and phil burton were frank kieliger worked with and for the burtons for many years i would like to insert his remarks in the record yesterday as we stood in this rotunda and watched the people of san francisco pay tribute to sala there was a moment of overpowering grief and loss and i said to my son this is the last time we will see sala later as we walked in the dark through the plaza outside this teenager said to me dad your wrong look around you well isee sala every time we see these people only she would notice we had just passed one of the confused and homeless night people and we were in sight of the tents of those seeking help for aids victims by demonstrating at the old federal building in a single sentence he had captured sala he had told me her story elie wiesel in his work souls on fire tells us of the role of story and memory in our lives he writes my father an enlightened spirit believed in man my grandfather a fervant hasid believed in god the one taught me to speak and the other to sing both loved stories and when i tell mine i hear their voices whispering from beyond the silenced storm they are what links the survivor to their memory we are here today to refresh our memories and to renew our commitments to all that sala burton represents in her life we come to share our stories of her i leave to others the task of commenting on her political prowess and her skills as a legislator the sala i knew and loved was larger then the sum of these parts 1 have asked myself over and over what made her so special and how can that specialness be expressed in brief remarks i have searched my thirty year recollection of her and what i find is a woman so secure in the knowledge of her own humanity so secure in knowledge of her own dignity and worth as a person that she would spend her life defending the dignity and worth of others sala was a woman who could talk to me when i was a young man about the worlds indifference to the approaching holocaust and of her own personal experiences of eastern european antisemitism and of fleeing poland she could do so without hate but with a fierce determination that the story be told for sala this bitter lesson of the past must be alive in our memory so that this most heinous crime against humanity can never happen again she told me the story sala was a woman who lived rather than preached the values of her jewish heritage in her struggle for peace in the world for an end to the arms race for a world freed from the threat of nuclear annihilation in her opposition to the immoral practice of hiring mercenaries by funding the contras in nicaragua there can be heard the echoes of the prophet isaiah they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks and nations shall make war no more in salas ceaseless quest for a just and more humane society a society which recognizes its obligations to the poor the aged the infirmed the homeless and all who are dispossessed in this land she made tangible the words of micah you have been told 0 man what is good and what is required of you to live justly to show mercy and to walk humbly with your god for sala accidents of race color creed national origin ancestry gender or sexual orientation could never be excuses for denying the inherent dignity of the human person and her life is summed up in the struggle to make that ideal a reality it was sala who introduced me to the reality of racial discrimination and racism and who educated me and formed my conscience on these issues as she involved me in the struggle for fair employment practices and fair housing in our state so many years ago it was sala who introduced me to the concept that the magnificent document we call the constitution of the united states protects all or it protects none it was sala who opened my eyes to the dangers of mccarthyslm and to its remnants in our society as we stood in union square and listened to phil then in the assembly call for the abolition of the house committee on un american activities some of us can still remember the picture of the hoses being turned on demonstrators and the water cascading down these very stain as dedicated civil libertarians were dragged down them for protesting the presence of that comnittee in our city and sala would feel deep anger at the sight of this injustice for sala was a woman whose conscience was so finely honed whose perceptions of social justice and human rights were so clear that she was truly a woman well ahead of her time she was a pioneer ever pressing forward ever encouraging the more fainthearted of us to follow where phil would move mountains by the shear volume of his knowledge and the weight of his arguments sala would touch the heart would prick the conscience would call us to be what we can and should be concerned and caring human beings when phil might seem preoccupied or distant in his singlemindedness sala was always the embodiment of care and concern they were a unique team their lives were both public and private and it is in the private moments that their great love and respect for one another was most evident and as i say these words i can envision phil even now reaching over and grasping her hand in a gesture which in life spoke volumes they are once again together they are once again an invincible team i have spoken of the sala i know with a very special affection it was she after all who suggested to phil many years ago that he hire me on a six month trial that six months stretched into twenty five rewarding years in which i learned from them that the purpose of public life is service that power is always exercised in behalf of the powerless and that those who possess the platform for public debate have the obligation to eloquently and forcefully express the aspiration of those in our society who are voiceless that is my story of sala burton the sala i will remember every time i see the faces of the people she saw and whose dignity she defended it is my prayer that the god of abraham our god who blessed her and kept her in life who made his continence to shine

minutes we offer this budget because with the passage of the grammrudmanhollings the politics of budget negotiating entered a new era progressives and moderates forged coalitions focusing on the development of strategies to realign national priorities and merge domestic and international agendas the congressional black caucus continues to challenge the fiscal priorities and programmatic policies of the reagan administration as part of the fiscal year 1988 budget debate members of the cbc for the sixth consecutive year have come together to fill the void in developing a responsible fiscal policy which conforms to deficit reduction goals urban and rural interests have been addressed resolutions of diverse constituent needs and issues unique to specific geographic regions were structured into this document the culmination of these discussions was the creation of the cbc fiscal year 1988 alternative budget the basic premise of the alternative is the formation of a fiscal policy that will assure a decent quality of life for all americans it calls for leadership and a sound monetary policy which would put americans to work in meeting our enormous challenges in education health housing transportation reindustrialization agriculture public works research and development let me touch upon the major economic assumptions of our budget and then various of my colleagues will highlight salient features of the budget the congressional budget office and the reagan administration have advanced optimistic forecasts of economic growth through fiscal year 1990 nonetheless many proponents of the fiscal year 1988 alternative budget have expressed concern that the potential for a recession in the outyears has not been factored into these assumptions because however baseline figures reflect the economic forecasts presented by the cbo the fiscal year 1988 alternative is calculated against those projections as noted first real gnp growth averages approximately 3 1 percent a year between 1986 and 1991 normal gnp growth averages in the 7 2 percent after adjustment for inflation second inflation as measured by the gnp deflator averages 4 2 percent a year third the 3month treasury bill rate declines from 6 4 percent in 1986 to 5 4 percent in 1991 or from 3 1 percent for 1 3 percent after adjustment for inflation fourth aggregate forecasts project the world price of oil will remain close to 15 per barrel through the end of 1988 the exchange rateas measured by the federal reserve board indexwill continue to decline reaching by the end of 1988 a level approximately 10 percent below its level at the end of 1986 and food prices will increase to 4 percent throughout the forecast period fifth unemployment rate exceptionsthe cbc alternative budget rejects cbo projections for a slow decline in the unemployment rate to a 6percent level by 1991 it adopts instead a hawkinshumphrey target in compliance with the full employment and balanced growth act of 1978 of a level of 4 percent unemployment in the civilian labor force through fiscal year 1990 the congressional budget office reports that lost revenues and increased outlays from unemployment yield an unemployment deficit of 40 billion of every 1 percent of unemployment by meeting the alternative budget hawkinshumphrey target of 4 percent additional revenues and outlay reductions for the projected 3 years would yield 40 billion in the first year 80 billion in the second year and 120 billion for fiscal year 1990figures from the economic budget outlook fiscal years 19871991 a report to the senate and house committees on the budget part l table 116 page the growth forecast by cbo for the next 2 years falls within the range of 2 to 3 5 percent forecasts however are subject to an unusual number of variables notably the effects on the economy of the restrictive shift in fiscal policy mandated by the balanced budget act the economic impact of the tax reform act passed at the end

comptroller general issued this ruling in its september 26 1984 report no 991086 to accompany the department of defense appropriations bill the committee on appropriations had the following to say about the ruling tlhe comptroller general ruled on june 22 1984 that the jcs joint chiefs of staff exercises in central america clearly went beyond what funds these funds are being appropriated for for example the comptroller general found that funds appropriated for operation and maintenance of our armed forces were used for military construction projects security assistance activities and civic action and humanitarian assistance the committee believes such diversion of funding from properly appropriated purposes is unwarranted and directs that the department of defense take such steps as necessary to prevent recurrence of such improprieties in the future in a january 30 1986 update of his 1984 opinion the comptroller general confirmed his original findings he went on to say that reports the department of defense had begun submitting to the congress in response to congressional directives on military training exercise construction in honduras are 0 0 based on questionable application of military construction accounting principles particularly those used to define the scope of individual construction projects in other words dod was still breaking the law limiting the

will extend the congressional award program for 1 year until november 15 1989 subject to certain requirements if these requirements are met the congressional award program will be extended for an additional year until september 30 1990 the congressional award program was created in 1979 by the late congressman jim howard and senator wallop it is the only award given by congress in recognition of youth leadership in the areas of public service personal development and physical fitness the award has given new direction and meaning to the lives of the young americans who have received it it is a program that has had the support of many members of congress and local community leaders the program is administered by the congressional award board which has the authority to use the congressional seal but the programs activities are not directed by congress while the program has achieved substantial success at the local level the national board which administers the program nationwide has not the board is composed of 22 wellintentioned and hard working members who are committed to the program but unfortunately they have not been able to achieve an acceptable level of success nationally since 1979 only 48 local congressional award councils have been established and in a survey conducted by the subcommittee on select education only 28 percent of congressional officers who responded participated in the program and 71 percent had never heard of the congressional award program when the program was established the congress intended that it be funded and operated through private sources however while local and state councils have been extremely successful in raising funds to operate the program at the local level the national board has not in 1987 the board had to request federal funds because their fundraising efforts had not yielded enough money to run the program congress appropriated 189 000 in unauthorized dollars to the congressional award board in order for the administration of the program to continue due to this financial crisis the gao examined the financial position of the congressional award program and testified before the subcommittee on select education on june 28 1988 the gao found the foundation has suffered losses from operations in 3 of the past 4 years its revenue from contributions decreased from 907 225 in 1984 to 204 379 in 1987 as of december 31 1987 the foundation had a net deficit of 322 995 the foundation has not raised any funds during the first 4 months of 1988 the foundation is operating solely on an appropriation of 189 000 these facts raise substantial doubt concerning the entitys ability to continue as a going concern since that testimony 300 000 of the outstanding debt has been forgiven and the board is attempting to retire the remaining 22 995 however due to the financial instability of the national board the subcommittee on select education believed that the board must meet certain mandates in order for the program to continue in trying to continue this program for the benefit of our nations young people many alternatives were discussed including the possibility of an outside organization administering the program on the national level however representatives of the board local congressional award councils and the congressional award alumni association opposed this approach thus the subcommittee agreed to allow the congressional award board continue to administer this program with no federal funds and under certain conditions those conditions are included in this legislation they are first submission of quarterly reports to the committees of jurisdiction during 1989 which describe in detail all fundraising activities conducted by the board a description of the fiscal position of the board as of the date of each report including available cash outstanding debts and prospective operating expenses the number and location of congressional award councils established since the previous report in states or congressional districts where no such councils previously existed and any evidence of contact between the board or the congressional award association with congressional offices second certification by the executive director of the board no later than september 30 1989 to the congressional leadership that the board is meeting its operating expenses has no outstanding debts and has complied with the requirements included in the quarterly reports the gao will verify that the information in the quarterly reports and the certification is accurate if the reports are submitted by the dates required and the certification is given the authorization for the program will continue for another year and may only be revoked or changed by subsequent legislative action if the board fails to issue a quarterly report by the date specified or makes no certification to the leadership that they have met these requirements the board will cease to exist 30 days after the date upon which the report or certification oas to have been submitted third the board must meet certain standards to fulfill its mandate during 1989 and

subcommittees june 28 hearing was the lack of participation by representatives from local congressional award councils and the congressional award alumni in decisions made by the board at the national level i believe a consensus of purpose of the program has been lacking between the local congressional award councils and the national board h r 5315 will require the house and senate leadership to appoint two representatives from local congressional award councils and two representatives from the congressional award alumni association to be members of the board within 120 days after enactment of this legislation this will ensure that the local congressional award councils and alumni of the program who understand it the best contribute their knowledge about the program to the national board so that this program can grow and reach young americans all over this country wishing to succeed in public service in addition the size of the board will be reduced from 33 to 24 members and h r 5315 changes the statutory requirement for a quorum so that the board can convene meetings and conduct business it is our intent that the board hold periodic meetings notifying the congress of when such meetings take place these are no unreasonable requirements for the congress to expect from the board these amendments to the congressional award act will strengthen the board and allow the program to expand and include as many young people in as many congressional districts as possible all of us want to recognize our young people for achievements in public service and volunterisr and this program

composed of three equally important parts humanitarian aid military aid and willingness to negotiate the military part gets the headlines but it is only one part of an equation for peace and stability in central america take away one of those approaches and the other two are useless and that is what this debate is all about it is not about military aid as such it is about how best to fit effective military aid into a more complex approach toward lasting peace and justice in that region humanitarian aid gets by far the biggest proportion of funding for the presidents program in central america you would never know that to judge by his critics but it is true our willingness to negotiate has existed from the very beginning ambassador stones mission is only another proof of that and so we are confronted with a question of the effective uses of american power american diplomacy and american humanitarian aid we need all three aid to the socalled contras is not the essential question we could cut off that aid in a minute if the nicaraguans would stop exporting arms it is sometimes said the sandinistas are exporting revolution actually they have betrayed the revolution in nicaragua they have betrayed it to an alien ideology with its heart in moscow and its fist in cuba what the united states wants is to stop arms shipments from outside and within the area the nicaraguans started this destabilization they can end the controversy instantly by simply stopping the export of arms once they do we have no reason to continue our own military aid but until they do any unilateral reversal of unitedstates policy will simply encourage the sandinistas all the united states is asking for is reciprocity surely that is not too much to ask there is nothing we would like to do more than be able to get out of this controversy but there has to be a mutual verifiable cessation of arms shipments throughout the entire region a cutoff of aid to the contras without reciprocity on the part of the sandinistas and cubans is not a solutionit is another and greater addition to the problem so we come down to the crucial question what is the right kind and right amount of american military aid to be used on one hand we have the administrations plan to fund the contras until the sandinistas stop exporting arms this is called covert aid right now it is about as covert as an elephant standing on a football field everybody knows it is there and calling it covert does not hide it but whatever you call it it exists the president is convinced it works and so am i has it been successful opponents say arms shipments have not been halted in a shortterm limited sense this might be true but we do know that the nicaraguan government is getting the message so is castro so let us look at this policy from a longrange point of view it will stop arms shipments if it brings about a change in attitude of the part of the sandinistas and it is doing that even the washington post admits it has done that has the administration hurt itself by putting forth various rationales for aid to the contras yes it has but we should not hold a chance for stability hostage to poor communications on the part of the administration so we come down to the final question how are you going to get the sandinistas to stop shipments of arms and thereby stop the destabilization of an entire region the answer is by putting effective pressure on them to stop how best do you put effective pressure on avowed marxistleninist revolutionaries certainly not by spouting nicesounding rhetoric about the need to negotiate while avoiding any policy that can bring the sandinistas to the bargaining table the choice is not between a risky policy and a safe policy in central america it is between longrange ineffectiveness which will come if we embrace the nonsolution of h r 2760 and a longrange effectiveness which is the presidents policy each policy carries a risk for my part i choose to be effective if we are going to have a risk either way take away one part of the presidents threepart program of humanitarian aid effective military aid and willingness to negotiate and you cripple the chances for peace and stability in central america ecrs821 today we can listen to our fears or to our commonsense fear and hysteria are no substitute for rational analysis and i believe that if we calmly and

bringing this issue before the body i certainly hate as a freshman to disagree with the learned and certainly acclaimed gentleman from the other side of the aisle the gentleman from utah who was talking about that this is not the time what we have done in this piece of legislation is to put tremendous costs out there on the backs of somebody and the somebody happens to be the ratepayer the same somebody in the state of illinois from which i come that happens to have paid for utility plants back in the 1960s that were supposed to cost 500 million and today cost 5 billion they are picking up that cost i hate to disagree with the other gentleman who stood up in opposition to this bill but it just so happens that i wrote the public utility act or rewrote the public utility act in the state of illinois during my tenure in the general assembly i can tell you that if we remain silent on this issue the commerce commissions will notpick that issue up i think it behooves us as members of this congress addressing this very very important issue that we do bring this issue before and allow commerce commissions to our various states to at least visit that issue to make a decision whether they will pick up that cost and share it between ratepayers or utility companies or if the utility companies in fact can pay all of it or if they cannot pay all of it then it should go to the ratepayer but it should be a decision that is made by that utility company this language in this bill and it is excellently drawn actually allows a decision to be made it does not mandate but it tells the utility commerce commissions in each and every state that they have the right to come and visit this issue that they are not foreclosed from visiting this issue and discussing it i think the language that the gentlewoman from illinois put in this issue and in this bill is excellent because it says if these utility companies who for years have on the backs of the ratepayers been taking dollars millions and millions of dollars to build these plants and not giving anything back all of a sudden they are in a cash rich situation the gentlewoman brought out the fact that they are diversifying they have so much money they cannot pass those dollars on to their stockholders they need to take those dollars and if they can share the cost and the burden of paying the insurance costs on this issue then that is where that decision should be made but the utility commerce commissions in those states should not be foreclosed from making that decision that is all that the gentlewoman from illinois is asking to be done in this amendment it is an excellent amendment it has a great deal of forethought i support it very very strongly again i say as the person who wrote the public utility act for the state of illinois that told those commissions how to draw utility rates we cannot afford to be silent on this issue we must make a statement in this act that it is the intention of the congress that they should have a right and they should have the ability to visit this issue and make their decisions i rise in support of the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from illinois as a fellow member of congress from illinois a state with 12 nuclear power facilitiesmore than any other statei have seen the financial hardship placed on ratepayers as the result of the direct passthrough of utility insurance premiums illinois is particularly hard hit in that we are the largest contributor to the insurance pool for nuclear facilities which was established under priceanderson this amendment simply establishes that individual state utility commissions do indeed have the discretion to balance rate increases resulting from insurance premiums between both the ratepayer and the utility in the past we have seen the direct passthrough of these costs with little attention paid to the ability of the utility to assume a greater portion of these costs priceanderson when it was first established in 1957 was a regulatory document but also a vehicle with which to provide incentives to private industries and utilities to venture into the development of nuclear energy it has succeeded in large part because it served to protect these industries from financial dangers associated with the development of this new energy source but i have a question who is protecting the consumer of this new product the ratepayer seems to have been left out of the economic equation we have a responsibility to not only protect the safety of our citizens but to protect their pocketbooks as well this amendment is not an effort to steal profits from our electric utilities but rather an effort to clarify the intent of priceanderson with regard to how our states regulate the passthrough of premium payments under this act this amendment would only apply to utilities that show increases in net income of 10 percent or more for the 2 years proceeding the payment of the premium thus insuring that the utilities are not asked to assume costs which they are simply unable to pay i think it is further important to note that the language of this amendment is really quite simple it does nothing more than clarify that the states and their regulatory authorities have the rightand yes the responsibilityto do more than rubberstamp the passthrough of these insurance premiums to customers however and this is important it does not require specific action but leaves such actions to the discretion of the state regulatory body i know how my constituents feel about rate increaseshelpless the rules are made the costs decided and then the ratepayer is told to pay for something that he or she has had little or no opportunity to influence its time to give the consumer a little muscle in dealing with everincreasing utility costs and i believe that this amendment will provide our state regulatory agencies with a clear message as to the intent of congress in this regard"]], "top_unsure": [[4.947185516357422e-06, 0.5000049471855164, 0, "i am trying to work ourselves through a maze here if the 24 staff people that were in the proposal for the committee on

working conditions for our military personnel as my good friend the gentleman from california stated the committee had to make some very deep cuts in this years military construction authorization to meet the numbers if i may let me recap some other numbers for you that will show an indication of where we are going in this area in 1985 the military construction authorization was cut by 14 percentin 1986 it was cut by 11 percentand in 1987 16 percent the cuts that had to be made this year are 11 percent if the original committee position prevails or 18 percent if the aspin substitute prevails there are two very important points that i would like to make at this time one the cuts that had to be made in the past years were not made because the requested projects were in our opinion not needed nor were they cut because the services were trying to goldplate their existing empires all of the projects submitted as far as i am concerned are for badly needed replacement facilities or facilities for new missions and equipment the replacement facilities for example are for getting our troops out of world war ii wood facilities where they live and work during the past several years the defense department has established new missions and purchased a considerable amount of new equipment which is now being delivered regardless of any members policy position on defense strategy or new weapons systems once we the congress have decided to improve our defense capabilities and add new and improved weapons we can not forget about the people who must then be trained in and operate that mission and equipment second let me point out that as the military construction budget has been cut each year the department of defense continues to request approximately the same level of authorization from the defense departments viewpoint one might askas this account is cut each year why not reduce it and not take the chance on lost authorization the facts are that the department of defense recognizing the critical needs of the services places a high priority on military construction the cuts that have been made over the past 4 years were made to get to a number a budget number at the rate we are going we will quickly be right back where we were during the ford and carter years during the past few years we have been fighting a battle of damage control rather than repair and
