epidemic and the devastating toll it is taking on small business the subcommittee invited leading experts from the academic business and bankruptcy worlds to testify to find out why so many businesses are failing and what it means for our economy the hearings were held against the backdrop of the gravest crisis faced by american business since the great depression this is what we see capital investment by companies is off sharply data resources inc forecasts that business investment will be off 8 percent this year over last year despite the massive tax incentives to invest enacted last year aftertax profits of corporations in the first quarter of 1982 were almost onethird lower than a year earlier the sharpest drop in the postwar period the new york times reported earlier this week that corporate profits have reached the lowest levels in perhaps 5 years many companies are saddled with heavy shortterm debt the ratio of shortterm debt to total debt is at a new high business balance sheets and corporate liquidity are more fragile than at any other time in postwar history since the first quarter of 1981 industrial output has dropped more than 7 percent our nations factories ran at a dismal 69 8 percent of capacity in june of this year 15 percentage points below the rate at which capital goods makers start getting orders for equipment to add capacity small business proprietorship income is expected to be nearly 15 percent lower this year than in 1980 according to data resources inc and businesses are failing at a rate not seen since the great depression todays figures as reported by dun bradstreet the business information concern are truly alarming the failure rate today is almost 90 per 10 000 listed companies just short of the failure rate of 100 per 10 000 companies recorded in the great depression year of 1933 put another way 11 businesses are failing right now for every hour of the business day business failures have only become a serious problem since 1981 looking back over the postwar period we find that business failures ranged between 1946 and 1980 from a low of 5 per 10 000 listed companies in 1946 to a high of 64 per 10 000 in 1961 the business failure rate average for those 35 years was 40 3 per 10 000 listed companies beginning in 1981 however business failures began to shoot up in 1980 l11742 companies or 42 per 10 000 companies failed in 1981 the figures jumped to 16 800 or 62 per 10 000 companies for 1982 the prediction is 25 000 or 88 per 10 000 listed companies the average for 1981 and the first half of 1982 is 75 per 10 000 companies an 86 percent increase over the 194680 average in the past 2 years the business failure rate has jumped 110 percent the second largest 2year jump since 1920 the only time it was higher was in the 2 years immediately after world war ii when business failures returned from the depressed war level to normal todays figures are indeed grim we should remember that the dun bradstreet figures cover only failures which involve losses to creditcs the number of business failures today is really much higher since thousands of businessmen simply decide to close their businesses because they see only an unprofitable future these business closings which are really failures reflect a lack of confidence in the business environment and are not reflected in dun bradstreets statistics as president reagans recently released report on the state of small business tells us the dun bradstreet figures are a valuable indicator of business distress the hearings looked at this distress not only in numerical terms but in human terms what we are seeing today is a great human tragedy we must not forget that business failures mean lost jobs ruined lives and dashed dreams they mean lost pensions lost life savings and lost tax revenues they also take a human toll in the lost selfesteem felt by those directly affected they mean an end to the american dream of opportunity and owning ones own business that has been such a powerful art of this nations dynamism last march when it was becoming clear that 1982 would see a record number of business failures i wrote to 2 dozen unitedstates bankruptcy judges and trustees to find out why this was happening i wanted to hear directly from them because they are seeing every day what is happening why it is happening and what needs to be done to end this terrible spiral of failure i received 19 replies from throughout the nation which i included in the hearing record this is the picture that emerged from the letter business are failing in all sections of the country and in every economic sector large and small businesses and young and old businesses are failing business are failing in record numbers and the failure rate continues to rise the business failures experienced today are much worse than those experienced during the last severe recession of 19741975 business are failing today because of high interest rates and the deep recession the revised federal bankruptcy code is not a cause of the increased number of business bankruptcy filings let me read a few of the responses unitedstates bankruptcy judge peter m elliott of los angeles wrote i would say that the major cause of small business failures is high interest rates unitedstates trustee william p westphal sr of minneapolis wrote the two primary causes for the increase in bankruptcies generally as well as for small business in particular are the extremely high interest rates and the length of the current recession unitedstates trustee scott h bush of dallas wrote the tentacles of the current recession reach to all communities at all locations even the glorious sunbelt has not been insulated the current recession is much more severe than the 19741975 recession unitedstates bankruptcy judge charles b mccormick of chicago wrote the increase in small business bankruptcy filings must i feel be blamed on the common elements of high interest tight money inflation the loss of jobs due to plant closings and the farming out of work to foreign countries and the other ills that greet one in the media every day unitedstates bankruptcy judge william l norton jr of atlanta wrote i do not see incompetency or mismanagement or dishonest actions in individuals or businessmen which some credit grantors or others ascribe to debtors in the bankruptcy court as being the cause of prevalence in bankruptcies i see the overwhelming number of individual and business debtors in this court who sincerely and honestly want to pay their debts and have been and are attempting to pay such debts i see many businesses and persons in my court who i feel there but for the grace of god go i as the letters i received show high interest rates and the prolonged and deep recession are placing an extraordinarily heavy burden on all businesses and small budinesses in particular this is the same message we heard from our academic witness at the hearing according to edward i altman a professor of finance at new york university and a leading expert on predicting business failures the devastating effects of reduced profits and high interest rates that have remained around 20 percent or more for several years are continuing to reduce the ranks of our smaller firm population because of high interest rates pro fessor altman continued businesses today pay more than 40 cents of each dollar of cash flow for interest charges up from 20 cents of 4 years ago no wonder so many marginal firms are succumbing to the economic reality of bankruptcy he said this is unfair small business relies almost exclusively on banks for financing they cannot shop around or bargain for the best interest rates as can large corporations many small businesses are paying at least prime rate or above prime for their loans that means close to 20 percent interest what makes these rates even more crushing is that the real interest rate is at least 10 percent the highest in recent memory the impact can be seen everywhere joseph w duncan the chief statistician for dun bradstreet presented to the subcommittee his firms latest business failure figures they showed continuing and sharp increases throughout the nation and in all industries the sun belt and mountain states are as hard hit as the farm states midwest and midatlantic region the failures touch not only the weak manufacturing wholesale retail and construction sectors but also the previously strong service industries what does the future hold only more grim numbers and more tragedy the subcommittee was tdid unless the economy improves and interest rates decline significantly i am afraid that the already staggering number of business failures will swell to levels comparable to the early 1930s the normally cautious professor altman predicted in 1932 the nadir of the great depression 31 822 businesses failed for a catastrophic failure rate of 154 per 10 000 listed companies the risk he added is that increased business failures will lead banks to tighten credit further and thus accelerate the business failure spiral if banks ration credit to only the most creditworthy firms professor altman said the marginal firm will stand little chance of surviving it is also probably true that the marginal firm is oftentimes also a small firm todays problem goes beyond high interest rates the problem stems from the mix of economic and fiscal policies currently being followed that have driven our nations economy into the worse recession since world war ii and created the severest liquidity crisis for business since the great depression as professor altman warned the real risk is not whether the economy will turn around and stage a recovery but how long the recovery will last if the turnaround is relatively short like the one we experienced in late 1980 then thousands of firms particularly smaller ones will not have sufficient time to get back on a positive cash flow basis the consequences are obvious and ominous we will see a ripple effect throughout the economy as failing large companies topple small firms doing business with them thousands of people will lose their jobs this is happening right now unitedstates trustee james eichstaedt of los angeles told the subcommittee that the bankruptcy last april of the wickes cos the large retail chain has cost several thousands jobs and seriously squeezed the small firms that did business with wickes with so many large unitedstates companies in such desperate financial straits we can count on it happening again and again and again if new economic and fiscal policies are not adopted that will bring interest rates down to affordable and stable levels and encourage the economy to grow e"], [0.0032783150672912598, 0.9967216849327087, 1, "we seem to have entered on a new era in politics it is a politics ruled by instincts and passions which have not been dominant here for many years a politics of greed and grab a politics of silent complicity in the destruction of a generations social and economic progress the administration expects to receive authorization to demolish the modest protections of health education nutrition housing and legal and economic rights which our poorer citizens currently enjoy in return for grand promises and empty pretensions cuts will come hurts will be felt inequalities will worsen hardwvon rights and opportunities will be lost it will be left for a future congress to make repairs i hope that that future congress will show greater sensitivity for the havenots of america than we are showing today so i rise to ask that a stand be made not on behalf of charity or compassion or justice but only in the name of reason for there is compelling economic reason to choose the budget resolution that has been presented by our budget committee in preference to the substitute endorsed by the administration the administration has presented an economic program which in earlier and wiser times would have been regarded as the workproduct of cranks its dismal features include monetary and fiscal policies that are totally inconsistent a tax policy which places a mystical faith in the superior social instincts of the rich and a touching desire to purchase weaponry without paying for it in each of these respects the budget co amittees resolution is to be preferred over the grammlatta substitute moreover the estimates of spending and revenues in the budget committees resolution are based on honest analysis using known and tested techniques and soundif not perfecteconomic theory the economic analysis underlying the administrations program is a gossamer web of guesstimates suppositions table napkin calculations and wishful thinking it will scatter before the winds of the earliest economic tempest it is by now widely conceded that the administrations economic projections are extremely optimistic according to the congressional budget offices march 31 1981 study real growth of gnp will be 1 7 percentage points lower in 1982 than the administration expects inflation will be 1 2 percentage points higher and a full half million more of our citizens will be out of work in every subsequent year as well the cbo has presented a vote of no confidence in the soothsaying of the new administration it is not hard to see why the administrations program will fail first there is the great inconsistency between the administrations fiscal and its monetary policies the administration has proposed a highly expan sionary fiscal policy at the same time the administration expects the federal reserve to apply a more inflexibly restrictive monetary policy than we have ever seen it will not work a staff study of the joint economic committee incorporating both the fiscal and monetary assumptions of the administration explains why a tight money policy our computer analysis shows would arrest real growth and in combination with such a loose fiscal policy as the administration proposes will keep interest rates at current destructive levels accelerating inflation while clobbering investment and housing the result a budget deficit well over 100 billion in second the tax program of the administration will not produce the supply side consequences which the administration predicts the administration counts on a surge of new work effort savings and investment by the affluent enough to overwhelm the demandincreasing effects of its tax giveaway program it presents no evidence whatsoever in support of this expectation for the understandable reason that no evidence exists in fact the continuation of extremely tight monetary policy and extremely loose fiscal policy will simply drive inflation to unacceptable levels third the administration proposes to repeat on a grand scale the cataclysmic error of gunsandbutter economics that was first made by a democratic administration 15 years ago they propose a military buildup twice that of the vietnam war and they propose to finance it not with a tax increase but with the largest tax reduction of our times meanwhile the price of military equipment is rising at twice the civilian rate of inflation does the administration really believe that the laws of economics have reversed themselves so completely in so short a time we have come a long way since the brave days of october 1978 when we enacted the humphreyhawkins full employment and balanced growth act with that act we committed ourselves to the rapid attainment of full employment and price stability we established procedures to monitor progress toward the achievement of our goals including a requirement that a specific timetable be set and adhered to and now we have just as quickly abandoned our commitments and scuttled our procedures under the old administration this sabotage was carried out in broad daylight by a frank admission that the administrations policies could not and would not achieve the statutory objectives now under the new administration we have a different tactic with the same result the administration while it ignores the acts procedures has promised an economic performance that will bring us remarkably close to eventual attainment of the acts objectives unfortunately the promises are built on air and so the reagan administration has brought about the final corruption of the humphreyhawkins process and the final disillusionment of those whose faith can still be touched by the promises of a popular president and therefore to you who will be tempted to vote for the grammlatta substitute let me ask are you prepared to accept with the president full responsibility for the consequences what will you tell your voters a year and a half from now when we are faced with the murderous inflation the cruel unemployment the monstrous deficits the skyhigh interest rates and the slump of housing trade and investment which this program threatens to bring will you say that you honestly thought the budget deficit did not matter that you sincerely believed that we could have guns and butter both that the rich in whom you now so trustingly place your faith have let you down i do not now talk about charity or compassion or generosity for the poor the aged the unemployed and the infirm i only remind you that those

colleagues that it is not only possible for our country to rise to greatness it is necessary to do so lyndon johnson never believed in a diminishing future he believed in growth in dynamism in progress he never believed that this country must live by some sort of economic fatalism he believed that we could control our own destiny he never believed that this nation could or should abide the waste of unemployment the scourge of poverty the numbing blight of ignorance nor the casual inhumanity of injustice lyndon johnson had a vision for his country he believed we could conquer our problems that we could alleviate poverty and indeed his programs did open whole new worlds of opportunity through the vision and unparalleled political skills he commanded president johnson brought decent medical care to the old and the poor he demanded that we no longer tolerate hunger among the people of this the greatest food producing nation in the world he established vast new programs to improve the nations schools to insure that every child got a sound education and to make available a university education to all who could benefit from it he insisted that the poor even the longterm unemployed could be placed into useful jobs through all these and many other efforts he was responsible for a vast reduction in the incidence of poverty in our country where there was no hope he opened hope and where there was hope he insisted that there be genuine opportunity compare that to the experience of today under our present leadership we have not progress but retreat there are millions of newly unemployed there are millions of newly poor no longer do we seek to insure that the poor are decently housed and fed far from it our leadership demands that the hungry should go more hungry our leadership is not one with a vision of what our country could be but one that sees a diminishing futurea world with shrinking hopes not one of growing possibilities lyndon johnson was excoriated as a free spender but the leadership of today the current administration will incur deficits that are 60 times as great as any that johnson would even dream of he was called a radical ex perimenter but he never abandoned the basic principle of sticking with programs that were practical that were proven whose results could be measured compare that to the pie in the sky claims that we heard for supplyside economics nonsense that we are paying dearly for today the present administration likes to say that there is no need to produce new housing for the poor or for anybody else because the marketplace will take care of everything but lyndon johnson knew that this was not so and could not be so if there are millions of people who cannot even get into the marketplace the market serves only people who bnve the means it does not serve those who have no means johnson would have wanted to know how many were without housing what could be done to get them into housing and how to get it done compare that to the breezy callousness of todays antihousing administration there is no way for me or for anyone else to describe the whole complex dazzling being who was lyndon johnson it might be said that he never believed that there was a problem that could not be licked whatever it was he would argue threaten worry demand plead work and pester anyone and anything in his considerable reach until he was satisfied that the matter had been disposed of it might be civil rights it might be interest rates which today are treated as given from godly writbut which he knew were made and broken by men just like him it might be education or any one of a thousand things whatever it was he believed the problem could be solved and he intended to do it compare that to the casual callousness of today when human needs and human miseries are ignored and when not only is no positive action taken every effort is taken to destroy what little help people have available he would never understand would be terribly grieved to see the sorry spectacle that we have today in which misery is compounded in which inequity is heaped upon unfairness in which shameless dishonor is dismissed as practical politics he would be horrified by policies that are nothing more than warmed over 19th century darwinism nothing less than callous disregard of even so basic a thing as providing for economic growthfar from it policies that destroy even that possibility lyndon johnson reached farther than he could grasp but he drove this country to its greatest heights his programs were the most comprehensive humane and effective domestic efforts ever attempted they were also the most effective there is no way to describe the kind of new dreams that were not only made possible but that were achieved thanks to president johnsons efforts he could not understand and would not tolerate a government that was indifferent it is a mercy that he never lived to see the inlifference the outright emptiness that characterizes the present occupant of the white house a man who was a doer could never understand one whose sole mission seems to be to undo do nothing do deliberate and

several yearsunitedstates policy toward central america i do so in a special order because i believe it is important for members of this body from time to time to step away from the pressures of daily debate and reflect more broadly on the issues before us no issue requires that kind of sober reflection more urgently than this crisis in our foreign policy i rise as a critic of current unitedstates policy while proclaiming a commitment to peace and democracy the administration continues to pursue a policy that by its very nature is incapable of securing either of these goals for the administrations policy is essentially a military policy based on a narrow ideological conception of the regions problems and prospects it is a policy that refuses to acknowledge the mistakes of the past and fs thus left without a realistic vision of the future while calling for demilitarization and an end to aggression in central america the administration continues to place arms at the disposal of some of the most ruthless forces in the region the united states has provided hundreds of milions of dollars in military aid to el salvador to a government which even ourown ambassador acknowledges continues flagrant violations of its own citizens human rights todays ap will provide a graphic and all too familiar example la plorida el salvador masita ruiz says the killers came at midnight firing machine guns and swinging machetes as she and her children lay quivering in their clay hovel the gang dragged seven screaming peas ants from neighboring huts stabbed them in the chest and face and hacked them to death in an orgy of blood before departing ms ruiz and about 12 other witnesses told an ap reporter i heard the screams and the shots she said the next day they found their bodies all cut up the heavily armed gang had stormed into the 600acre cooperative farm in la flo ta where ms ruiz and about 300 other peasants lived the date was nov 20 nobody knows who did it and why but the atrocity bore the markings of rightwing paramilitary gangs which terrorize civilians to keep them from associating with leftist rebels after the murders work stopped at la florida in the foothills of santa ana province 52 miles northwest of san salvador frightened villagers began to flee ms ruiz said she gathered her 10 children and went to live with relatives 12 miles away in santa ana city where she was interviewed the victims between 29 and 59 years old appeared to have been felled by a machete whack on the nape of the neck the la florida villagers said the killers slit the throats of three victims repeatedly stabbed them sliced off the nose of another victim and sexually mutilated him stunned negihbors buried the bodies a few days latter in makeshift graves by the road side where the victims died caked pools of blood marked the killing ground an officer at the santa ana army garrison denied the army was involved in the killing police authorities said they had no information and refused to elaborate unitedstates military aid to honduras has multiplied in the last year and threatens to destabilize a country where newly formed democratic institutions are struggling to maintain autonomy from the traditionally overpowering military costa rica a democratic nation that has long foresworn the desire for a large standing army has been pressured by the united states to strengthen its arsenal now president reagan raises the specter of military aid to guatemala a country whose brutal military regimes have earned it the condemnation of the world the folly of this policy can be illustrated by examining some of the events of the past year evidence has been accumulating fot nearly a year showing that the united states is involved in an escalating covert campaign a secret war aimed at nicaragua earlier this year the washington post reported that president reagan authorized 19 million for the cia to advise train and arm paramilitary forces along the honduran nicaraguan border at a minimum and without going beyond what the administration has cnceded the purpose of this operation was to stop the flow of arms across that border and to engage in hit and run raids to sabotage to harrass the nicaraguan government there is reason to fear that the operation has gone far beyond that it has brought the united states into a working arrangement with former members of president somozas national guard who are committed to the violent overthrow of the nicaraguan government this is a sordid alliance with people who promise a massacre in nicaragua and who boast that when they return to power there will be bodies from the border to managua the uprooted the wounded and the dead in nicaragua bear painful witness to the thrust of this campaign scores of nicaraguans have been killed and others have fled the region as guerrilla bands sweep down on isolated villages although still abetted by the united states the actions of these paramilltary forces have gained momentum beyond unitedstates control let us be clear unitedstates support for covert activities against nicaragua endangers not just the security of nicaragua but of the united states it poses issues with respect to the united states actual interest in central america and with respect to the process of forming unitedstates foreign policy to oppose unitedstates support for these covert activities is not to proclaim that the nicaraguan government is without problems and there clearly is a need for that government to encourage economic and political pluralism it is merely to proclaim that unitedstates policy in the region should not be formed through the implications of covert activities these activities commit us to a specific foreign policy that has never been openly defended and supported and whose outcome cannot be guided by our own democractic institutions a few days ago congress voiced vigorous dissent from this policy by voting unanimously to prohibit funding to any paramilitary group for the purpose of overthrowing the government of nicaragua i would like to ex press my admiration to mr harkin and others for thel leadership on this issue and to mr boland chairman of the select committee on intelligence for his clear expressions of concern and his dedication to the vigorous oversight of the consequences both in tended and unintended of unitedstates covert operations this policy is not just an isolated case rather it displays in microcosm the fundamental flaws of unitedstates policy throughout the region the united states may have started with a limited goalto end the alleged flow of cubansupplied arms across the honduran nicaraguan border but to do this required an alliance with groups like the somoscitas who have an agenda of their own we have thus become accomplices to acts of aggression against nicaragua and allies of groups committed to unmitigated cruelties this pattern has been repeated again and again as in the guise of fighting a communist threat the united states stakes its prestige on repressive military regimes whose actions we cannot endorse control or even mnbderate instead of heeding the lessons of past and present errors in unitedstates policy the administration seems determined to repeat them this is nowhere more evident than in president reagans recent embrace of guatemalas gen rios montt if the administration resumes military aid to guatemala it will not on1 be flaunting an explicit agreemenc to obtain congressional approval beforehand it will be ignoring the overwhelming evidence concerning the atrocities committed by the guatemalan government in guatemalas countryside rios montt has adopted a sophisticated and ruthless counterinsurgency campaign including a scorchedearth policy that destroys the base of rural livelihood and forces the peasants to flee the country or to camps under military control amnesty international estimates that 2 600 civilians have died in massacres since rios montt came to power americas watch has charged that by adopting a policy of total war and by abandoning the rule of law the rios montt government has become responsible for the consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights in guatemala on the mere promise that rios montt will announce electoral laws president reagan extols the guatemalan leaders commitment to democracy yet since july 1 guatemala has been under an officially declared state of seige which prohibits political and union activity requires private gatherings to be approved by the defense minister allows military authorities to detain anyone suspected of disturbing public order permits home searches without a warrant places severe restrictions on the press and creates special military tribunals to try those accused of violating the state of siege neither the promise of elections nor elections themselves will guarantee peace or even democracy to guatemala guatemala has had elections before for 30 years these have been controlled by the military and ridden with fraud in the past decade political opponents of the left and center have been mercilessly eliminated to talk of including a broad spectrum of participants in the electoral process is to ignore guatemalas past and present conditions have we forgotten that last march rios montt came to power by deposing a military leader chosen through just such an electoral process have we forgotten that only a year ago the state department assured us these elections would be a democratic solution for guatemala if the united states provides military aid to rios montt now it will only feed the climate of violence and intimidation which poisons the prospects for democracy in guatemala again the guatemalan case is not an isolated one but has broader implications that go to the heart of our understanding of democracy democracy cannot be reduced to a simple formula or to the simple ritual of elections it must rise from the hearts minds and experience of the people themselves it cannot be imposed by fiat from above we in the united states must never fall to recall that our own route to democracy was not without struggle or bloodshed and that the building of our own democratic institutions was not accomplished in a year or even a decade while expressing satisfaction with a mere skeleton of democratic procedures the administration has wasted opportunities for a genuine political solution to the conflicts of the region and has discarded chances to play a role in a concrete peace process last spring when mexican president lopez portillo offered to serve as an intermediary among the conflicting factions throughout the region the reagan administration let the offer die after a few meetings between our secretary of state and the ivexican foreign minister this fall when the presidents of mexico and venezuela made a unique joint appeal to president reagan and the heads of state of honduras and nicaragua the united states showed only rhetorical interest instead the administration quickly used a meeting of central american governments which did not include nicaragua mexico or venezuelato endorse its own conditions for dialog and declared this to be the only future forum for considering peace proposals i have long believed that regional cooperation provides the key to resolving the problems of central america countries such as mexico and venezuela are far better equipped than the united states to understand the particularities of each country and to bring together the forces necessary to secure a lasting peace the events of the last year have underscored this clearly and the administration has yet to provide a convincing rationale for ignoring and undercutting these promising peace initiatives recently there have been some auspicious signs from the administration much was gained from the presidents trip to latin americahis new respect for the individuality of each nation and his emphasis on the overriding importance of economic development i hope these themes will guide unitedstates policy in the future like many of my colleagues i have the deepest respect for george shultz whose habits of careful decisionmaking and consensus planning promise great change in our attitudes to central america secretary shultz needs and deserves time time to slowly move unitedstates policy from the ideological rut plowed by secretary haig time to implement changes of policy in a way that does not produce abrupt and unsettling tilts instead of secure progress nonetheless the administration continues to display a peculiarly onesided ability to see and support progress while mere promises of future elections make the guatemalan regime a friend of democracy fully implemented land reform programs in nicaragua evidently mean nothing while meagerly substantiated accusations of human rights abuses in nicaragua make the sandinistas the regions leading proponent of genocide the continued documented massacres in guatemala are chalked up apparently to reasons of state let us be honest and straightforward few regimes in central america are without their problems the ability of the united states to perceive subtle distinctions and support shades of progress is the key to a mature for eign policy but these subtleties must be carefully defined carefully supported and applied uniformerly or unitedstates policy becomes blind support for any regime cloaked in anticommunism the united states must be able to see and support progress on the left as well as the right and it has to be said on the left perhaps more than the right there is no overlooking the history of the region and given that history there is no mature foreign policy that does not recognize and address the revolutionary potential of the region the mexicans are want to say that each central american country must fact its own revolution and while i might dissent from their determinism their point is valid the history of colonialism repression and poverty in region that will find expression in radical politics democracy is the key to the regions future but the assertion of that ideal has to be wedded to a real program for helping each country on its road to democracy the united states has to find a way to remain close to and to influence countries as they move through rapid programs of social progress this

arthritis as well as nationally prominent physician researchers out of this hearing grew my determination that increased attention and a sharper focus on arthritis and other musculoskeletal disorders were absolutely imperative the impact of these diseasesin human social and economic termsis too profound and too serious to be on a back burner any longer the tangible expression of a national commitment to accelerate the attack on this collection of diseases which debilitate at least onesixth of our population would be the creation of a national institute on arthritis and musculoskeletal

of arthritis pain arthritis and related diseases affect more than 37 million people in the united states arthritis limits the mobility of more people than any other disease sixteen million have osteoarthritis but arthritis is not exclusively a disease afflicting the elderly 250 000 children suffer from juvenile arthritis yet funding for research attacking the causes and indentifying treatments and cures of this epidemic disease has been pitifully small the national institutes of health expend only 1 74 per arthritis sufferer this level of effort contrasts sharply with the economic cost of arthritis current estimates indicate that arthritis now costs the nation as much as 25 billion every year a study in one state found that fully half of all workers compensation claims are arthritis related the cost of workers compensation to insurance carriersand thus to employersresulting from arthritis and other musculoskeletal conditions is over 200 million in california alone musculoskeletal conditions rank first among all disease groups in cost attributable to lost earnings and services from nonfatal illness and they rank second only to circulatory diseases in total economic cost the level of lost earnings and medical expenses resulting from musculoskeletal disorders now exceeds 30 billion annually such conditions account for 20 percent of medicare hospitalization costs in excess of 1 billion each year more than 100 different diseases of the joints and related structures have been indentified as rheumatic diseases other diseases and conditions which are not by definition rheumatic but which affect bones are addressed by researchers under the rubric of musculoskeletal disorders these vary widely in nature and effect their severity ranges from discomfort to severe pain and disability some are life threatening osteoarthritis a disease characterized by progessive joint degeneration affects millions of older americans osteoporosis loss of bone mass occurs in varying degrees in most elderly women nearly 90 percent of women 75 years of age and older have xray evidence of the disease since musculoskeletal conditions are most common in elderly persons and since the aging population is expected to increase substantially over the next several decades the frequency of occurrence and the impact of such conditions will likewise increase unless efforts are focused on means of reducing the incidence of these pervasive health problems millions of our citizens are victims of rheumatoid arthritis a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by fatigue immobility and deformity the disease runs an erratic and frustrating course with periods of both exacerbation and remission it is often chronic and progressive and its cause is not yet known the general public normally views arthritis as a condition affecting older persons but some 250 000 children suffer from one or more forms of this painful and debilitating disease it may affect a variety of organsheart lungs and eyesas well as joints lupus is a serious potentially fatal disease which attacks many tissue and organ systems including joints skin kidneys and heart other forms of rheumatic disease and musculoskeletal disorders include lyme arthritis which is transmitted by ticks scleroderma a serious treatmentresistant disease characterized by hardening of the skin inherited connective tissue diseases such as osteogenesis imperfecta and marfans syndrome rheumatic fever gout and pseudogout the national institute of arthritis diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases the nih research institute which houses the arthritis and musetiloskeletal research programs is a patchwork body that is expected to address a constellation of unrelated research needs from digestive diseases to hematology to dermatology there is no rhyme or reason to the conglomeration of these programs and arthritis and musculoskeletal researcht has suffered as a result the potential economic benefit to the nation and the widespread alleviation of pain and suffering that would result from an increased focus on research in arthritis and musculoskeletal disorders is enormous even a tenfold increase in these efforts could be repaid many times over through lower job absenteeism reduction in the need for attendant care home health care institutionalization medical expenses and reduced workers compensation payments among others the tendency of some arthritis sufferers to turn to quack remedies would be drastically reduced if we were able to imh 8 127 prove treatments cure forms of rlieumatic disease and prevent such diseases people with arthritis often become frustrated to the point of desperation seeking to lessen the pain of their disease nearly 1 billion a year is expended by arthritics on unproven remedies consider the potential for discovery that even a tenth of that amount could mean to millions of americans even with the meager research dollars that currently are expended research investigators have brought us a variety of exciting developments that have increased exponentially the level of our scientific knowledge about many of the 100 forms of arthritis over the past decade genetic markers have been found for several rheumatic diseases including the discovery of h1lab327 in ankylosing spondylitis a spinal arthritis that primarily strikes young men hladrw4 in rheumatoid arthritis which affects all ages and sexes but is most common in women hladrw2 and hladrw3 in systemic lupus erythematosus sle or lupus which often attacks young black women along with whites of childbearing age and hladrw5 in a form of childhood arthritis which affcts the eyes it is now possible to identify populations with a high risk of contracting these rheumatic diseases as a consequence researchers are striving to identify infectious agents or other environmental factors which trigger disease in those people who are susceptible to it but little epidemiological research has been conducted to aid in this search because funds simply are notr available for the same reasonlack of moneyprecious little research has been undertaken to unlock the mysteries of juvenile arthritis similarly there has been a paucity of attention given to osteoarthritis many resca~ch scientists believe they are very close to identifying the causes of various forms of arthritis with accelerated effort prevention improved treatments and cures now are in the realm of the possible some of the areas under active exploration include abnormalities of the bodys immune system and the role of particular viruses and collagens the interrelationship between sex hormone activity and immunologic and genetic factors tissue and bone transplantations lymphapheresis or blood purification and many others in the field of orthopedic and other musculoskelctal research studies of biochemical hormonal and nutritional factors in bone metabolism and mineralization may bring effective treatment and prevention of osteoporosis advances in recent years have made widespread the application of surgical joint implantations currently some 120 000 hip replacements and 40 000 knee joint replacements are performed annually although highly successful in the short term the prognosis for longterm or permanent success of these procedures is not assured researchers are giving attention to corrosion of replacement materials load failures infections and allergic reactions it is imperative that a vigorous attack be launched against rheumatic diseases and other musculoskeletal disorders in my view the instrument for this attack should be the creation of a national institute on arthritis and musculoskeletal diseases my bill would create such an institute within the national institutes of health it is patterned on the statutory authority of other nih research institutes it is based upon and f ollows an evolutionary thread of existing law beginning with the national arthritis act a 1975 measure which established a national commission on arthritis that commission was charged with the development of a long range arthritis plan with specific recommendations for the use and organization of national resources to combat arthritis the commission put together a document that is at once massive in size and comprehensive in scope a plan that reflects the thinking of thp best researchers physicians and other professionals in the field of rheumatology as well as persons with arthritis and parents of children who have arthritis unfortunately neither the national arthritis act nor the plan the law mandated has come close to being implemented because of this and because the need is so great a sharp new focus on arthritis research is imperative that is the reason for this bill which adds to title iv of the public health service act a new part j and establishes a nqtional institute on arthritis and musculoskeletal diseases the institute is directed to undertake research and demonstrations relating to the cause prevention and treatment of arthritis and musculoskeletal diseases to promote coordination of research programs in the public and private sector to make grants for research to establish an information clearinghouse and to conduct research training the director of the new institute is charged with developing a plan for a national program to expand intensify and coordinate activities of the institute and to carry out the plan the national program is exnected to encompass research in epidemiology etiology and prevention of arthritis and musculoskeletal diseases development trial and evaluation of drugs and devices refinement development ard evaluation of implants and prosthetic devices and set up monitoring of the causes of athletic in juries and seek ways to prevent such injuries sportsrelated disorders also are a focus of the new institute the billauthorizes support for new and existing multipurpose arthritis and niusculoskeletal disease research centers and provides a specific funding authorization it also establishes an interagency coordinating committee chaired by the director of the institute the mission of which is to improve coordination of all research and service programs relating to arthritis and musculoskeletal diseases i am absolutely convinced that the creation of a national institute on arthritis and musculoskeletal diseases will result in major advances in the prevention treatment and cure of the most widespread of diseases afflicting americans the current level of funding or only a modest increase for research on rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases along with the increased visibility a separate institute would provide offer the potential for great human and economic benefitto the nation finally it is appropriate and fitting to pay tribute in connection with the development of this legislation to a legendary patroness of the health sciences mary lasker who believes strongly in the need to strengthen the national attack on arthritis as in so many areas of our mutual concern over the years her deep commitment and enthusiasm in this matter have bolstered my own i welcome cosponsors of this legislation and urge my colleagues to add their support to this important proposal henry waxman who so ably chairs the subcommittee on health and the environment which has jurisdiction over the national institutes of health has expressed interest in reexamining the adequacy of funding and visibility of research in the area of arthritis it is anticipated that the bill

ab the f alb is a thirdclass plane with a firstclass price tag study after study and report after report shows we are not getting our moneys worth the f alb is siphoning precious dollars away from vital defense systems the money we are wasting on the f alb could be put to much better use the amendment which i am offering is long overdue my amendment would prohibit the use of any authorized funds for the procurement research development testing and evaluation of the f alb it does not delete any funds the money targeted for the p alb would be available for other aircraft programs which meet our real defense needs this amendment addresses a pentagon pipedream of a souped up super technological fighter which is hidden in a hazy world of misplaced priorities and misplaced loyalties to a plane rather than to the defense of these united states these loyalties moreover are to a plane that does not stand the test of its original promise orprojections in 1975 congress approved a lowcost lowperformance alternative for the navy and marine corps this was the f alb today we have a high cost lowperformance edsel hidden in a smokescreen thrown up by dod but even through the smokescreen we can see one thing risingthe exorbitant costs for the f alb it is not as if there arc no alternatives to the p a18 one part of the defense smokescreen consists of stonewalling by the department one year ago congress heard the plaintive voice of dod proclaim that there were no alternatives to fulfill the four roles envisioned for the f alb since then the marine corps has eagerly embraced the av8b the light attack role while the navy has gladly accepted a policy of f14 squadrons for all its big deck aircraft carriers there are two roles remaining for the f ala the navy light attack and the marine corps fighter but once again dod is wailing that there are no alternatives available in the best traditions of stonewalling the navy has even gone so far as to deny that it has conducted studies of f alb alternatives however i have in hand three studies conducted by the navy on alternatives to the p ala studies which indicate that the alternatives are not only feasible but preferable let me quote from these socalled nonexistent navy studies on the light attack mission one study states the f18 represents major degradation in our attack capability as compared to present aircraft with f18s designed payload 4 rockeycs a7 radius of action is twice as far with four times the f18s design load the a6 radius of action is twice as far many targets that might be critical could not be reached with fis for targets that the fi8 could reach its smaller payload would require more attack aircraft exposure to enemy defenses although the fpis is faster in a fighter configuration than either a6 or a7 it is not supersonic nor significantly faster when carrying weapons and if adequate fuel is provided to allow the fl8 to leave the target at supersonic speeds after weapon delivery the f18s usable weapon payload is even further degraded this same report addresses the marine fighter mission and says the remaining prospective f18 mission is the marine corps fighter mission since the p14 is probably more capable than is necessary for the classic marine corps air defense mission the f18 appears an adequate replacement for marine f4s however the tradeoff is between providing the f14 and greater fighter capability versus providing a less capable av8b3 fighter variant that would offer support logistic advantages plus the tactical advantages of an allvstoi marine corps fighter and lightattack force the navy would still like to claim that the f alb is essential to the future effectiveness of the navy and marine corps but their own analysis reveals that the analyses of alternative aircraft procurement strategies recently forwarded by cnm chief of naval material to cno chief of naval operations show that the navy can more fully satisfy its aircraft requirements and more rapidly build up toward 15 air wings if the f18 is cancelled 11 4448 co and a7s or a6s used for the navy attack aircraft the effectiveness analysis shows that it would also result in a more effective force it is difficult to make a case on cost or effectiveness grounds for continuance of the p18 program in further unqualified support of the f ala the f alb program manager admitted at a recent press conference that the f14 was a better fighter than the f ala and that the a6 was a better attack plane the prime rationale for the f alb is not the aircrafts necessity rather the department of defense supports the f ala because of its supposed affordability i submit to my colleagues that nearly anything is affordable at 40 billion our military personnel could have calvin klein designer uniforms at that price but i doubt if it would enhance our defense capabilities are we to allow the navy and the department of defense to continue their spendthrift ways on the f ala and bankrupt other more essential naval programs the problems with this plane are many it has a limited radius half that of the a7 the acceleration threshold had to be reduced to meet the planes true capabilities it has not yet completed the mandated two lifetime fatigue test nor have the alloys added to the engine as a result of a crash been tested however these problems significant in any other plane pale in comparison to the continued cost escalation of the f a18 this aircraft was originally purchased because it was supposed to give us the quantity of aircraft the navy needs it was supposed to be a low cost daylightonly aircraft the f a18 got its first taste of megabucks with the addition of radar missiles in 1974 since then the addiction of the navy to goldplating has taken hold of the f ala aircraft however the navy is now showing selfrestraint recent costcutting measures for the f ala include the substitution of aluminum for silver in the detonating cords to explode the canopy i am glad but surprised that only aluminum will suffice with a near 40 billion price tag i would have thought that the cords should have been made of gold to match the plane with spending of this sort is it any wonder that the program has grown in cost so that despite an increase in the quantity of the dod purchase the unit cost has doubled in 5 years the navy claims that the cost growth is strictly due to inflation however this claim simply does not stand the test of careful analysis recently most members received information comparing program costs of the f ala to those of its contemporary the f16 this information demonstrated that the f a18s costs have increased nearly three times as much as the f18s the f alb and the fl6 had contract awards 4 months apart in 1975"],

this legislation to the floor there is no question that without his able advice and counsel we would not be here today and the george washington half would be but a dream we are all aware of george washington and of the many things that he did to shape our republic in its early days however we tend to view him more as a marble statue to be honored than for what he was a very human person who did his best in trying circumstances and created a republic that is still the hope for freedom of much of the world today it is my hope that the issuance of a commemorative coin for his 250th birthday will cause people to think about his life as that of a man who lived rather than just as a historical subject h r 3484 provides for the striking of a special silver dollar by the mint to honor this important anniversary the coins when issued next year will have a composition of 90 percent silver and 10 percent copper identical to the silver coins struck in this country before 1965 they will be available for 2 years 1982 and 1983 and will be legal tender for half a dollar although they will be sold for more than that h r 3484 provides that a maximum of 10 million of these coins will be struck with the actual number issued being limited to those ordered during 1982 the number 10 million is admittedly arbitrary but was chosen as the number most likely to approximate the actual demand for the coin at its maximum demand for the eisenhower silver dollar ran at close to 7 million and while i believe that the washington half will attract more interest i believe that 10 million is a fair estimate in addition i felt that the mint should have some way to plan its production and that a ceiling would probably heighten the interest in the coin and encourage early orders my legislation provides that the price will cover all costs associated with the coin plus a profit of up to 20 percent the sales will be handled according to regulations issued by the secretary of the treasury and all profits will go into the treasury general fund briefly there are three reasons why h r 3484 should be approved first a commemorative half dollar is a fitting way to honor the 250th birthday of george washington second there is a market for the coin and it will provide an american alternative for the millions of collectors and investors who invest in silver coins yearly and are now limited to foreign coins as sqch it will help our balance of trade to some extent third the sales of these coins will provide a profit to the treasury that will help to reduce the deficit in fiscal year 1982 of these three reasons the first the desire to commemorate george washington on his 250th birthday is the most important in honor of this anniversary a silver coin is particularly appropriate as washington took a special interest in the establishment of our nations first mint and was responsible for our first silver coinage personally the establishment of a mint was one of washingtons main priorities when he became president in 1789 but circumstances delayed it for over 2 years in a speech to congress on september 25 1791 he again urged the establishment of a mint to remove the scarcity of small change a scarcity which is so peculiarly distressing to the poorer classes the congress responded to this plea and not only established a mint but also provided for a national coinage system washington took a personal interest in the establishment of this coinage system and intervened when the senate bill provided for the pieture of the current president on the coins instead he successfully urged that a representation of liberty be placed on the coins the next year 1792 he used 100 of his personal silver plate for the minting of the first unitedstates coins silver 5cent pieces according to old mint documents he had not forgotten his concern about the need of the poor for coins and the coins were promptly released into circulation as shown by the heavy wear that most of them exhibit today the coin that you are considering today will not be the first time that congress has decided that a coin is an appropriate way to commemorate an anniversary of george washingtons birth fifty years ago for the 200th anniversary in 1932 a special commemorative quarter was issued supposedly for 1 year only however it proved to be so popular that it remains in circulation today the second reason for passing this legislation is that not only is there a market for the coin domestically but it will also be the first and only american entry in the worldwide silver commemorative coin market although silver coins have not been struck for circulation in recent years many nations sell them at a premium to collectors and investors and make a profit on them one excellent example is the royal canadian mint which this year will offer a commemorative silver dollar honoring the construction of a transcontinental railroad across canada this coin is part of a regular series that canada issues yearly for sale to collectors with a new design each year the coin will be offered to americans in two finishes for either 18 or 14 depending on which is chosen their efforts to attract large numbers of american buyers are shown by the many ads for the coins that have appeared in major american papers including the new york times and the wall street journal the canadians are not the only ones taking advantage of the market the april 29 issue of coin world a major hobby paper lists new silver issues aimed at collectors and investors from austria egypt gibraltar israel poland sudan switzerland and venezuela in addition it displays a prominent ad from the soviet bank for foreign trade offering that nations silver and gold medals for sale silver coins are issued internationally for a variety of reasons the silver institute states in its april newsletter that many nations issued coins for the international year of the child in 1980 and that up to 24 nations will issue them this year to commemorate the international year of the disabled person modern silver coins are sold in the millions each year many of them to american collectors and investors the profits from their sale then goes abroad to the issuing government and helps their balance of trade while at the same time hurting ours american competition would not drive the others out of the market but it would have a wide appeal with the millions of american collectors and investors in addition it would attract some foreign business and would give all the option of buying an american coin nor is the tradition of commemorative coins foreign to this country beginning in 1892 this country issued commemorative silver halfs on 48 separate occasions gold commemoratives on 6 occasions and silver dollars and quarters once each in addition there was a 40percent silver set of coins commemorating the bicentennial the profits that this coin will provide to the treasury are the third reason to support h r 3133 as written the bill directs the treasury to price the coin so that all costs associated with the production and sale of the coin are covered along with a profit to the government of up to 20 percent of the total the exact percentage was left to the treasury so that the coin could be priced at the nearest quarter dollar or so as i mentioned earlier the profits will go to the general fund of the treasury and will help to reduce the deficit for fiscal year 1982 i cannot closely estimate how large these profits will be but if silver stays at about 11 an ounce it could equal up to 15 million if the entire issue is sold while the details of the sale are left to the secretary i would hope that the coin will be promoted through the media and through other outlets such as the mint mailing list in addition if possible i would like to see volume discounts similar to those offered at one time on bicentennial sets given to financial institutions and others to encourage them to offer the coin to their customers at the original issue price if these steps or similar ones are taken i believe that the entire issue would be sold out in conclusion i believe that this coin will provide a fitting memorial to our first president while at the same time offering an american alternative to those who choose to buy silver coins this is no susan b anthony dollar but rather a profitable venture into a proven market utilizing the mints almost 200 years of expertise ameri can coins are traditionally known for their technical excellence and enjoy a wide popularity in the world now an american silver half dollar will meet the same acceptance this will be a popular coin and will be accepted by the american people as a collectors item that honors a great american h r 3434 has the support of the administration and was unanimously approved by the banking committee i would ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill"], [0.003465414047241211, 0.9965345859527588, 1, "today i am offering

chairman in recent months the reagan administration has again displayed the shortsightedness of its central american policy in so doing it has alienated the united states not only from the people of central america but from the values that are our own national heritage instead of building on the themes of selfdetermination social justice and respect for human rights the administration has defined our relationship to the region as an eastwest struggle ignoring the northsouth question of economic development and clouding our commitmen~t to individual freedom it has articulated a policy in largely negative terms emphasizing the ideologies we object to rather than the principles we stand for nowhere has this been more apparent than in the administrations faildecember 9 1981 ure to focus attention on the problems underlying the crisis in guatemala the administration seems blind to the atrocities committed by a brutally repressive regime earlier this year amnesty international reported that nearly 5 000 guatemalans have been seized without warrant and killed since gen lucas garcia became president in 1978 thousands more have disappeared or been tortured entire villages have been destroyed by the army and air force in the name of pacification scores of journalists teachers students and trade union leaders have been killed or exiled the catholic church has been a special target of attack as the military seeks to remove those who could bear international witness to its reign of terror according to amnesty international and the organization of american states the selection of victims and the development of forces are not carried out by illegal paramilitary troops as the government claims but by the government itself in choosing to define unrest in this area as part of an eastwest conflict the administration has ignored both this internal persecution and abject economic conditions an illiteracy rate estimated to be 55 percent an infant mortality rate among the highest in the western hemisphere high levels of unemployment an average income of 900 a year and a gross distortion of land and resource ownership the emphasis on ideology which has prevented american policymakers from perceiving the harsh political and economic conditions of guatemala have left them incapable of perceiving the united states longterm interest in the country the violence the fear the poverty of the rural fareas have spawned an indigenous opposition to the government and are even driving the traditionally passive indians to guerrilla resistance movements meanwhile the reagan administration is preoccupied with the possibility of cuban or soviet support for the insurgents the state department does not ask why these indigenous movements develop or why they may be inclined to accept foreign guidance instead it seeks an accommodation with the guatemalan government in order to maintain stability at the expense of human rights and justice even as the country is tottering on the edge of civil war recently the reagan administration has hung its hopes for a political solution in guatemala as in el salvador on the elections scheduled for march 1982 yet the history of guatemala the extent of political repression and the longstanding reluctance of the majority of the population to participate in a political process they do not trust indicate that these elections will be a mere facadeof democracy for 30 years guatemalan elections have been controlled by the military and ridden with fraud there has been only one civilian president since 1954 in the past decade political opponents of the left and center have been ruthlessly eliminated during the rampaign for the 1980 municipal elections six leaders of leftofcenter parties were assassinated in the last year 76 christian democratic party leaders have been murdered that party has threatened to boycott the election if repression by rightwing death squads is not ended and if legal reforms guaranteeing the vote are not implemented in the face of continuing political violence and limited political competition the people of guatemala are unlikely to break their chronic pattern of absenteeism in order to vote in elections where the leading candidate gen anibal guevara is the handpicked choice of the military the administrations efforts to buttyi ss the status quo in guatemala have brought it to the point of contemplating a renewal of military aid although request for guatemalan military assistance was not made in this budget the administration seems to be pursuing a more subtle strategy earli er this year the administration agreed to the sale of 3 2 million worth of trucks and jeeps to the guaternalan government after moving these items from a list of police and military equipment barred from being sold to nations that violated human rights there is also talk of the possible sale of 1 7 million in helicopter spare parts to the guatemalan government such actions do not constitute a constructive policy of quiet diplomacy that will give the united states leverage on the human rights issue they will only succeed in providing the means to trample the human rights dignity and aspirations of the guatemalan people let me conclude by urging this body to search for a broader vision of policy for central america one based upon the principles that we have so fervently guarded for 200 years john kennedy intimated that people struggling against repression looked to the united states as a model when he said whenever a local patriot emerges in asia the middle east africa or latin america to give form and focus to the forces of ferment he most often quotes the great watch words we once proclaimed to the world the watchwords of personal and national liberty of the natural equality of all souls of the difgnity of labor of economic development broadly shared it is time that we reclaim our own watchwords and make them once again the hallmark of our foreign policy"]],

groups usually there is little action to benefit the nation or its economy but rather a lot of pandering that in the long run proves to be harmful to our future this was the case recently on a vote regarding a concurrent resolution expressing the sense of congress that funding appropriated for title v of the older americans act the senior community service employment project should be maintained in future years at the level necessary to insure that its current jobs and other services be maintained or expanded on the surface this resolution sounded magnanimous and full of compassion for our fine elderly citizens as could have been expected it passed by an overwhelming margin in the house i voted against it for several reasons first i do not dispute the intrinsic worth of a senior community service program i am well aware that our older citizens have much to offer their communities and nation and that too often they are shunted aside by the now generation my concern centers around which segment of government should finance such a program with a budget deficit of more than 100 billion this year it should be obvious that the federal government does not have the money i have absolutely no objection to programs of this nature and local and state governments and perhaps private enterprise might wish to consider maintaining and expanding this program state and local governments generally have to operate within balanced budgets lack the massive moneyabsorbing bureaucracy of the federal government and allow local people to have more control over their own programs second it is pure hypocrisy for congress to decry massive budget deficits and overspending by the federal government and to sponsor balanced budget amendmentswhile at the same time playing to the grandstand with proposals that add to the federal deficit third it is wildly inaccurate to claim that federal progrpms pay for themselves and do not end up costing the taxpayers if overspending by the federal government paid for itself as is claimed for virtually every domestic program contained within the budget we would not have 100 billion deficits or trillion dollar national debts today fourth such resolutions are in themselves meaningless because congress will either appropriate the funds or it will not therefore one must assume that the purpose of such proposals is simply another liberal ploy to encourage partisan and philosophical demagoguery prior to the november general elections liberalsand many conservatives are quite aware that they will be painted as ogres haters of the elderly and uncompassionate individuals if they vote against such grand sounding proposals fifth spending on the federal level for this and similar programs actually worsens the lot of those it is designed ostensibly to help federal overspending robs the elderly and forces their backs against the wall by creating inflation inflation destroys the purchasing power of the elderly more than any other group because so many are dependent on fixed incomes so while the seen hand of federal largesse may have the public relations image of helping the elderly the unseen hand of federal deficits debt and inflation soon destroys any positive effects that earlier help may have had sixth such resolutions actually make prostitutes of many politicians becaue they in effect sell their votes for the programs in return for the votes of specific groups on election day in other words the unspoken agreement is that the various lobbing groups will urge their member to vote for congressman x because he voted for the program pushed by that lobbying group the problem is that the money of current taxpayersand future taxpayers considering the national debtis being used to buy the votes finally this process and the lack of courage on the part of many politicians are the reasons why our nation is in such an awful economic mess today we must realize the federal government cannot give something to anyone or any group that it has not first taken away from someone else this is especially true where deficit spending is concerned because it obligates money from future taxpayers with our national defenses desperately in need of rapid rebuildingit has been postponed for more than a decade due to committments for social spendingand our economy in dire straits the amerian people deserve more than

saying you have led the way now well proceed many of us would like to claim bold leadership in addressing the issue of cutting government spending we cannot we are following the orders of our constituents who preceded us on this issue we now have the responsibility to carry out those orders congress own committee funding is a good place to start i support the 10percent reduction it is a significant cut yet it would not ii 1091 cripple any necessary committee action we know that some committees and subcommittees should be cut even more others should be cut less or not at all as wielders of the ax we must make discriminate chops statistics documenting the growth of government spending are so numerous as to strain our capacity for retention some point to the growth of congressional staff as a prime example of the ballooning bureaucracy well it is true congressional staff growth and the increase in committee funding levels over the past 10 years is well documented by figures the figures however only address the symptoms the disease itself remains we need to be wary of the quick cure and if we are to be responsive to the budgetcutting demands of our constituents we must look beyond the figures documenting congressional stnff growth to the reasons for this growth there is where the doctoring is really needed one reason for the growth of committee staffs can be traced to the burgeoning bureaucracy in the executive branch executive branch personnel and funding levels have increased enormously over the past two decades new programs have been instituted with corresponding new staffs task forces have been established to study specific problems old programs have been expanded and staffs increased to handle the work load it is quite understandable that congressional committee staffs have increased commensurately just to monitor and conduct oversight investigations of increased executive branch activity we must also cut back the executive bureaucracy president reagan has promised to reduce the size of the federal work force to reduce the size and number of federal programs i believe that he is committed to this kind of a spending cut in the federal bureaucracy when this happens it should be easier for us to also reduce the sizes and budgets of our special committee staffs responsible for doing the work generated by some of these executive agencies another important reason for the growth of committee staffs can be traced to the legislative reorganization act of 1970 this act partitioned the committee staffs into majority and minority parties and gave each an unwritten but implicit mandate to develop partisan positions let us look at the hard statistics on this point from 1960 to 1970 the funding levels for investigative committee staff increased by 320 percent this figure is certainly large enough in and of itself but from 1970 to 1980 investigative committee staff funding increased by 526 percent this is a sizable increase in the rate of committee staff growth and it happened immediately after the legislative reorganization act went into effect this act partitioned the committee staffs into majority and minority parties and gave each an unwritten but implicit mandate to develop partisan positions let us look at the hard statistics on this point from 1960 to 1970 the funding levels for investigative committee staff increased by 328 percent this figure is certainly large enough in and of itself but from 1970 to 1980 investigative committee staff funding increased by 526 percent this is a sizable increase in the rate of committee staff growth and it happened immediately after the legislative reorganization act went into effect there will be an attempt here today by the minority to cut committee funding even more than the substantial 10percent cut proposed by the distinguished majority leader anything more than the 10percent cut would be a severe blow to the efficiency of the house committee system the purpose for such a cut is more than simply to spend less money we know that the senate now controlled by the minority has not seen fit to cut its own committee funding to this extent we know that the senate and the white house while being budget conscious in spending levels for their own staffs are still leaving themselves sufficient funds to carry out their mandated duties efficiently at the same time though there are those who would demand that the house sustain a burden of budget cutting greater than its share to the possible detriment of its efficiency and its ability to do its job i can only assume that this effort is a partisan one designed more to hamper the effectiveness of a house still with a democratic majority than to be responsive and responsible to the budgetcutting demands of the american public our president has told us that the issue of reducing federal spending at all levels is nonpartisan our constituents tell us the issue is nonpartisan commonsense tells us the issue is nonpartisan yet the structure of our committee system created by the reorganization act of 1970 makes it partisan as do some of the efforts on the floor of this house today"], [0.9740873575210571, 0.02591264247894287, 1, "i would like to talk about the budget and where we are and what we agree on and what we do not agree on i think it is pretty clear if you listen to the people who have spoken here today and i predict it will be true for those who speak here tomorrow and during the debate on the amendments that we all agree that something has got to be done about the deficit something has got to be done to reduce the amount of national income being absorbed by government something has go to be done to reduce interest rates by reducing the amount of money that the federal government borrows but i also assert that when you get beyond that basic agreement fundamental differences that divide this house and divide this country become very clear in the major budget substitutes that will be voted on next week there are clear differences as to how we achieve those goals i would like very briefly to take the budget which was reported by the house budget committee and compare it to the bipartisan recovery budget which will be offered by the gentleman from ohio on behalf of the republicans and the conservative democrats who seek to control the deficit by controling spending i would like also to compare based on tentative data the budget that will be offered by the gentleman from ohio on behalf of himself and conservative democrats to the socalled coalition budget which will be offered by the gentleman from wisconsin i think when you look at these comparisons you will see very clearly what the choices are before the house if you take the data contained in the vehicle reported by the house budget committee you can break the basic policy changes into five different areas what we do about nondefense discretionary what we do about targeted entitlements what we do about other spending reductions what we do about defense and what we do about taxes we are going to hear a lot of discussion in this budget debate about economic assumptions as we did in the last but what is relevant is not what we assume about the world but what we do about the realitics that we face i think in looking at what we do in these five functional categories you will clearly see the difference in the area of nondefense discretionary the bipartisan recovery budget cuts nondefense discretionary spending 72 percent more than the jones house budget committee vehicle over the period 1983 to 1985 in the area of targeted entitlements the only section other than revenues that will be reconciled that committees will be forced to make changes in under the reconciliation process the bipartisan recovery budget cuts targeted entitlements 139 percent more than the jones house budget committee budget over the 3year period in the area of other spending reductions the bipartisan recovery budget reduces other spending 489 percent more than the house budget committee in the area of defense the jones house budget committee budget cuts defense 69 percent more than the bipartisan recovery budget in the area of taxes the jones house budget committee budget raises taxes by 55 percent more than the bipartisan recovery budget and in the end achieves the same bottom line basically these differences are repeated when you compare the aspin coalition budget and the bipartisan recovery budget that will be offered here if we look at nondefense discretionary and other spending reductions the bipartisan recovery budget cuts nondefense discretionary spending 62 percent more than the aspin coalition budget over the 3 years that the budget is in force in targeted entitlements the bipartisan recovery budget cuts targeted entitlements 119 percent more than the aspin coalition substitute in defense excluding pay the aspin coalition budget cuts defense 83 percent more than the bipartisan recovery budget in the area of taxes the aspin coalition budget raises taxes by 42 percent more than the bipartisan recovery budget over 3 years o 1640 my point in making these comparisons is this the house next week is going to have to choose between two real options one option is embodied in the budget presented by the house budget committee and slightly modified in the coalition aspin substitute that option says let us raise taxes and slash defense so that we can continue spending as usual in washington the real alternative is the bipartisan recovery budget which says let us focus our attention on spend ing so that we can meet our legitimate defense needs and so that we can let the american people keep more of what they earn those are the options that we must choose between do we want to raise taxes and slash de fense to continue spending or do we want to control spending so that we can meet our legitimate defense needs and let the american people keep more money in their pockets to provide positive incentive for people to work save and invest those who have talked about how much trouble the economy is in would have ns deal with those economic problems be raising taxes and by increasing spendng i believe that those are the policies that brought us to this sorry state and i do not believe that going back to the policies of the 1960s and 1970s will solve our problems i think it is important that we pass a budget that gains control of spending and gains control of the deficit that puts strong downward pressure on interest rates but i think the focus has got to be on the problem and the problem is spending taxes were doubled over the last 6 years and yet the deficit grew every year our problem is not inadequate taxes our problem is excessive spending in the bipartisan recovery budget we have an opportunity to do something about that excessive spending so i hope that we will have a good debate in which everyone will look at the issues what do we do about domestic nondefense spending what do we do about meeting the legitimate defense needs of our nation how much burden do we place on the shoulders of the working men and women in america in those three areas the differences among these budgets will be very clear i would like to make one additional point and that is that we have heard and we will hear a lot of talk about equity are cuts fair do we treat entitlement and discretionary programs fairly in terms of choosing where to make reductions but i would submit to my colleagues that there is another issue of fairness and that issue has to do with taxes how much burden are we going to put on those who are pulling the wagon as well as the burden that we are going to put on those who are riding in the wagon and in the ultimate fairness test by controlling the growth of taxes and focusing revenue increases on reducing the deficit rather than increasing taxes to go on spending i believe the ultimate fairness issue is going to be settled on the side of the bipartisan recovery budget may 2l 1982 so i look forward to the debate and i believe when the american people look at the three choices when our colleagues look at these three areas of difference in defense in nondefense domestic spending and in taxes i believe the bipartisan recovery budget is going to be adopted"],

have ever voted this way i have voted continually and very publicly for occasional and fair pay raises since i have been in the congress but i am going to support my chairman at this time for this particular delay until we can get a better look at the situation and the economics in this country however i cannot let the opportunity pass without some observations my good majority leader who made i think a very telling point in his talk when he did state that no one came to this congress to get rich and i totally agree with this nor do i think anybody comes to this congress to go broke and yet that is what is happening to a tremendous number of members in this congress today who also have children in college and who maintain their residences my friend the gentleman from indiana spoke here a few minutes ago in some confused way of stating that we should be getting 58 000 instead of 60 000 on an indexing system i find it absolutely impossible to really believe that he is serious in thinking that the congress is not entitled to a minimal pay raise i believe that we must face the issue the way we have to face the issue is the way i said before and that is addressing it to the next congress only voting it this year in 1981 and not in 1982 when again the members will begin to feel the pressures so i think that may be a solution which i will support i also think it is important to recognize that in this administration today we are talking about cutting aid to students cutting basic programs that this congress has been committed to all of which will make it even more difficult for members of congress and others in the federal government who have been able to participate at least in these programs which will now be eliminated from participation if the reagan administration

change a variety of things change the key point to me is this we are in what is admittedly an unpredictable area because i do not think any member of this house expected 4 years ago when the bill was passed to go to 80 percent no one figuredthe gentleman from illinois argued it but he was in the minoritythe expert opinion was oh no it would not go out of control there was a miscalculation that was

this resolution was not unanimously agreed to in the education and labor committee and several members of our committee signed report language expressing opposition to the resolution i oppose this resolution for two reasons the first reason is that the resolution calls for a new layer of bureaucracy at the state level to study a problem that we all know exists it is common knowledge that good teachers are leaving the field of teaching for more lucrative jobs in the private sector that there is a shortage of math and science teachers that teachers as a whole score lower on standardized tests than many other professional groups that there is a lack of inservice training to keep teachers up to date on changes in their academic fields and that there is a lack of incentives to keep good teachers in the classroom in responseto these problems many states have already moved to reduce teacher dropout rates to improve and increase the number of inservice training programs and to revamp the teacher training process in teacher colleges to provide personnel better prepared to deal with the actual classroom experience as of march this year 23 states including illinois delaware texas maryland missouri new jersey and virginia have reevaluated their teacher training and certification requirements in an effort to improve the quality of teachers sent to the classroom it seems to me that the requiremients of house joint resolution 429 are superfluous and will result in an unnecessary expense of time effort and money by the states the second reason i oppose house joint resolution 429 is that it presupposes that the federal government has or should have an active role in teacher education the resolution calls for any reports or recommendations made by the state commissions to be forwarded to the president and the congress for study while teacher preparation training and certification is of course of interest to everyonecongress includedit has always been the responsibility of the state and local units of government i do not believe that the federal government should begin meddling in this area of educational policy and i see this resolution as the first step toward federal involvement in teacher education"], [0.0002003014087677002, 0.4997996985912323, 0, "i misspoke a motion to recede rather than a motion to instruct"], [0.00023674964904785156,

violation of the constitution it may be you cannot go into this program i urge my colleagues to vote no on this measure we cannot let this go through it will have the impact that the chairman said of
