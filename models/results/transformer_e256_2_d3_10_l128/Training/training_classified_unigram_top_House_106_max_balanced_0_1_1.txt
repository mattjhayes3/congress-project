last several years have asked a very basic fundamental question that is is it right is it fair that under our tax code a married working couple where both a husband and wife are in the workforce that they pay higher taxes just because they are married is it right that 25 million married working couples 50 million taxpayers pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married we call that 1 400 the marriage tax penalty it affects married couples who because they have two incomes they are forced to file jointly they are pushed into a higher tax bracket and they pay higher taxes it is a marriage tax penalty and it is wrong let me introduce to the house some constituents of mine michelle and shad hallihan two public school teachers from a community of manhattan just south of joliet illinois shad is a teacher at joliet high school michelle at manhattan junior high their combined income is about 62 000 they are middleclass teachers they are homeowners of course since they were married they have since had a child little ben remember their family someone new in their lives and they are so proud of little ben here who is growing very quickly their marriage tax penalty is about 1 000 a year that they pay just because they are married i think it is a fair question is it right is it fair that shad and michelle hallihan two public school teachers who work very hard every day have a new little boy in their lives have to pay higher taxes send money to washington just because they are married i am proud to say this conference report before it eliminates the marriage tax penalty that good people hardworking middleclass people like shad and michelle hallihan pay every year because they are married under our conference report we help those who itemize their taxes as well as those who do not now my friends on the other side of the aisle say that if one is middle class and one itemizes ones taxes usually because one is a homeowner or one gives money to ones institutions of faith or church or synagogue or charity one is rich and one does not deserve marriage tax relief well republicans and fortunately 48 democrats believe we should help the middleclass homeowners who give money to charity they are not rich they work hard shad and michelle hallihan make 62 000 a year they itemize their taxes now we help those who do not itemize their taxes in this conference by doubling the standard deduction that is used by those who do not itemize their taxes we double that for joint filers to twice that as singles for those who are itemizers like michelle and shad hallihan and little ben who are homeowners so they are forced to itemize we widen the 15 percent bracket that is the basic tax bracket that affects everybody we widen that so joint filers married couples like shad and michelle with two incomes can earn twice as much as a single filer and be in the same tax bracket the same 15 percent tax bracket what i think is most exciting about this bill not only do we help middleclass families who are homeowners and give money to church and charity who itemize those taxes as well as those who do not is that it is effective this year when we pass this legislation and put it on the presidents desk today the president will have an opportunity if he signs it into law to help married couples 25 million married working couples this year because i would point out that doubling the standard deduction which helps those who do not itemize and widening the 15 percent tax bracket which helps those who do itemize such as homeowners and those that give money to church and charity that they will receive marriage tax relief this year because this legislation is effective january 1 of 2000 think about that when my friends on the other side of the aisle and bill clinton and al gore raised taxes in 1993 they made their tax increase retroactive which meant they went back in the tax year and took ones money well this year we have an opportunity to give marriage tax relief this year which means we go back to january 1 of this year if one is married one of 25 million married working couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty one is going to see marriage tax relief this year in tax year 2000 that is a great opportunity if one believes in fairness in the tax code as we do it is time to make the tax code more fair and more simple we want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty now my friends on the other side of the aisle have been making lots of excuses they really do not want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty because they would much rather spend shad and michelles money they believe it is better spent here in washington than shad and michelle hallihan can spend it back in joliet illinois think about it the average marriage tax penalty for good hardworking middleclass married couples like shad and michelle hallihan 1 400 1 400 is 1 years tuition at joliet community college our local community college it is 3 months of day care for little ben at a local child care center in joliet illinois it is a washer and dryer for their home it is 3 000 diapers for little ben the marriage tax penalty of 1 400 is really money for real people let us do the right thing let us pass this rule let us pass this legislation let us wipe out the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working couples"], [0.0017136615933850408, 0.0017136615933850408, 0, "over the last several years many of us have been asking a question that we hear time and time again back home i have the privilege of representing the south side of chicago and the south suburbs communities like joliet and lancing and morris and rural communities like tonica and elsewhere and they often ask me a pretty basic question that question is as we talk about taxes they say why why do married working couples a husband and wife who are both in the workforce why do they pay higher taxes when they get married they ask is it right is it fair that under our tax code married working couples pay higher taxes on average 25 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes than identical couples who choose not to get married but live together outside of marriage that is not right the folks back home tell me that it is time that those of us here in washington should do something about it that we should work to eliminate what has been called the marriage tax penalty 1 400 the average marriage tax penalty is a lot of money back home in illinois 1 400 is one years tuition for a nursing student at joliet junior college our local community college it is three months of day care for a working mom and dad with children it is almost 4 000 diapers for a family with a newborn child it is real money for real people and there are of course some here in washington who say they would much rather spend that money here in washington than bring about tax fairness by eliminating the marriage tax penalty well i am proud to say this house is doing something about the marriage tax penalty last year we passed and sent legislation to the president which would have wiped out the marriage tax penalty for over 25 million couples and unfortunately president clinton and vice president gore vetoed that bill they had a lot of excuses they wanted to spend that money but this year there is no excuse we have valentines day approaching and what better gift to give 25 million married working couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty than to pass legislation wiping out the marriage tax penalty this thursday we will be considering in the house legislation approved by the committee on ways and means h r 6 the marriage tax elimination act which i am proud to say now has 236 cosponsors including almost 30 democrats who have joined with us in our effort to eliminate the marriage tax penalty we help real people let me introduce a couple here this couple here shad and michelle hallihan of joliet illinois two public school teachers in joliet illinois they happen to make about 60 000 in combined income from their two teaching salaries and shad and michelle suffer almost the average marriage tax penalty well under the legislation that the house is going to be considering this week shad and michelle will benefit because two public school teachers who chose to get married who now suffer the marriage tax penalty will essentially have their marriage tax penalty wiped out michelle told me the other day she says congressman tell your friends in the congress particularly those who believe it is not a good idea to eliminate the marriage tax penalty what wiping out the marriage tax penalty would mean for them they say 1 000 which is essentially the marriage tax penalty would buy 3 000 diapers for their newborn baby that is money that is currently going to washington that they could use to take care of their child frankly if we want to be fair it is their money we should eliminate the marriage tax penalty this thursday h r 6 the marriage tax elimination act will help couples like shad and michele hallihan we do it in several ways we double the standard deduction onehalf of married couples do not itemize their taxes they use the standard deduction so we double it for joint filers the marriage penalty is created when a married couple of course get married they file their taxes jointly their combined income usually pushes them into a higher tax bracket that is what pushes shad and michelle into the 28 percent bracket what we want to do of course is for the nonitemizers which is about half of the married couples who suffer the marriage penalty to double the standard deduction for joint filers to make it twice that of singles for those who itemize who are the other half of married couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty those who itemize are homeowners the average middleclass family itemizes their taxes because they own a home we want to help them and provide marriage tax relief as well so we widen the 15 percent bracket the basic tax bracket that every one of us pays we are all in the 15 percent bracket regardless of our income for the lowest bottom bracket of our income by widening the bracket so that joint filers married couples can earn twice as much as a single filer and be in that same bracket we help those who itemize we also help the working poor there is a marriage penalty for the earned income credit and we provide tax relief for them this thursday let us have an overwhelming bipartisan majority let us work together let us eliminate the marriage tax penalty there are no excuses we want to be fair eliminate the marriage tax penalty"], [0.0017500519752502441, 0.9982499480247498, 1, "this evening i would like to take to the well again and talk about health care issues because i do believe that when we talk about health care issues that this is really the unfinished agenda that this republican congress has not addressed of course there is still time we are still here we are here over the weekend are probably going to be here a good part of next week there was an effort yesterday when the tax bill was brought up by the republican leader ship to suggest that somehow some of the health care issues were being addressed in some minor way what i wanted to begin tonight was talk about how that bill really does not accomplish anything significant to help the average american with the health care problems that they face and with the hospitals and the nursing homes and the home health agencies that are trying to provide quality health care then after that i would like to get into the three major issues that most of my constituents and most americans talk to members of congress about and that is trying to reform hmos trying to provide a prescription drug benefit for seniors and trying to deal with the 42 million americans who now have no health insurance let me start with this tax bill that was voted on and that the republican leadership brought up because they suggested i think inaccurately that what they were trying to accomplish was to deal with some of the problems that occurred with the balanced budget act which was passed a few years ago which cut back significantly on the money that was going to hospitals to home health care agencies to nursing homes and to hmos and that the reimbursement rate from the federal government from medicare medicaid and some of the other federal programs that provide funding to these facilities or to these programs that provide health care services needed to be readdressed that there was too little of a reimbursement rate under medicare and medicaid and that more money needed to go back to these programs or facilities if they were going to provide a quality health care the problem though was that in making these adjustments in this tax bill the republican leadership essentially gave most of the money to hmos in a fashion that i find totally objectionable because the hmos were not only getting huge amounts of money back from the federal government but were really not caused to do anything for the average american in order to receive those funds i said today in a press conference that we had outside on the lawn of the capitol with some of my democratic colleagues that the reason this was happening the reason why the tax bill was so favorable to the hmos is because basically the republican leadership has bought into the hmos and the special interests that are associated with the hmos and supports them because of the special interest funding that is made available what we see the hmos doing is that the hmos are leading the battle against the medicare prescription drug benefit and leading the battle against hmo reform the democrats and some republicans have tried to pass a bill called the patients bill of rights we know it as the norwooddingell bill it is bipartisan but it is opposed by the republican leadership the norwooddingell bill would make significant reforms to address the abuses of the hmos but the hmos are fighting that tooth and nail as well as the prescription drug benefit so i think that basically what happened here is the republican leadership sides with the hmos because they are basically against the medicare prescription drug benefit and against the patients bill of rights we also see that the hmos are spending a lot of money funding negative ads against those individuals democrats and against some republicans who support the patients bill of rights who support hmo reform who support having a prescription drug benefit under medicare so this is the sort of unholy alliance here that manifested itself yesterday with this tax bill to give more money back to the hmos now let me talk a little bit about this bill because i just want to show how unfair it was and how little it would accomplish in terms of addressing the health care needs that americans face today first of all and just to give my colleagues some figureg about the amount of money that was going to the hmos the republican plan this tax bill increases payments to medicare hmos by over 10 billion over 5 years and over 30 billion over 10 years despite the fact that only 16 percent of medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in hmos right now we know that what the hmos have been doing is they have been dropping senior citizens left and right as of july 1 i think there are over 700 000 seniors across the country that have been dropped by hmos to provide their medicare benefits over the last few years so a lot of these hmos got into the medicare program and then they dropped the seniors yet over onethird of the allocation in this tax bill over onethird of the allocation for health care that goes back to health care providers goes to hmos only 16 percent of medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in hmos my colleagues get some idea there of the inequity here now in addition to that we know that a lot of these hmos have dropped out of medicare so one might say to oneself well if they are making an argument they need more money to stay in medicare then why when we give them this windfall these billions of dollars this 30 percent of this overall budget then why do we not require that they come back into medicare and provide certain benefits well that makes sense but that is not what the republican leadership did there was no guarantee that these hmo plans will not drop out of communities or medicare altogether when it is no longer in their interest to remain as many of them have there is no guarantee that they will put new money towards maintaining benefits rather than shoring up their bottom line so we could have said okay we will give hmos all this money in the tax bill but they have to sign a contract saying they are going to stay in medicare for 2 years or 3 years or even 1 year we could have said okay we will give them this money but they have to make sure that they provide at least a level of benefits and prescription drugs for these 16 percent of seniors that are on medicare that they are providing now but we do not have that in the bill nothing like that just give them the money and that is fine they can continue to drop out of the program if they want to it is blatantly unfair it is just basically pandering to special interests now let me go beyond that to the next issue why is it that so much of this money is going to hmos again when so few seniors are in hmos that are in medicare we know that we have greater needs in a lot of other areas the hospitals do not get that much hospitals many have closed i had one in my district in south amboy that closed within the last year or so nursing homes many nursing homes are bankrupt i visited with some i went to a nursing home last week one of the days and talked to some of the residents i found out from the operators that there are i do not know what the percentage is but a significant percentage of the nursing homes in the state of new jersey are now bankrupt and some of them are closing home health care agencies very little money under this tax bill these are the providers remember the hmo is an insurance company they are getting this money now from this windfall from this republcan tax bill and they are going to go out and they are going to pay the hospitals or they are going to pay the nursing homes or they are going to pay the providers of health care services they are not providing the services but yet we shortchange the providers we do not give the money to the hospitals some of which are closing we do not give the money to the nursing homes some of which are closing we do not give the money to the home health care providers who are directly providing services it makes no sense it makes no sense at all unless one looks at it from the point of view that the hmos are special interests that are doing the republican leadership a favor and that are railing against hmo reform and a medicare prescription drug benefit now let me go to the last thing then i am going to get off the issue of this tax bill but i do think it is important and that is that the republican leadership said well one of the things we are going to do in this tax bill is we are going to try to address the problems of the uninsured by giving what we call an aboveline deduction for health insurance a tax deduction okay well we know that there are 42 million or so americans now that do not have health insurance now these are working people because if one is really poor and one is not working one is eligible for medicaid and the federal government pays for ones health insurance but if one is in a lowincome bracket but one is working or even middleincome bracket it depends and one is working a lot of times ones employer will not provide one with health insurance because maybe i is costing him too much or whatever the reason and one has to go and try to buy ones health insurance on the private market or maybe the employer has some kind of a plan but it is very expensive whatever the reasons these 42 million people are pretty much working people that do not have health insurance on the job or cannot afford to buy it in the private market so what the democrats have been saying what vice president gore and president clinton have been saying let us gradually try to address some of the groups that make up this uninsured we know the largest group is the children we know the second largest group is near elderly people between 55 and 65 that are not eligible for medicare yet these are some of the groups what the democrats have been doing and we actually did get the support of the republicans eventually we had to drag them along on this but we eventually did get the support of the republicans to pass a kids health initiative a couple years ago that gradually has been getting to the point where we think about half of the children that are uninsured will have some sort of insurance with money paid for by the federal government well what vice president gore has been saying is that he wants to increase the income eligibility so that right now if one is say 200 percent of poverty and one is eligible for this kids care program we will raise it to 250 percent of poverty or 300 percent of poverty and try to get more of these lower middle class people who are working and their kids into this chip or kids care program well we found of course that the republican leadership does not want to do that that would have been the logical thing to do in this tax bill would be to expand eligibility for the kid care program or another thing that we could have done and this is another thing that vicepresident gore has proposed and the democrats here in the house is to enroll the parents of those kids in the health insurance program because we know that those parents if they cannot get health insurance for the kids other than through the federal government they are not able to get it for themselves in this tax bill we could have put a provision there for the near elderly what the democrats have been saying is they would like to see the people between 55 and 65 be able to buy into medicare at their own expense they would buy into medicare but no the republican leadership does not want to do any of those things this is what they said they said we are going to give you an aboveline tax deduction i am not going to get into all the details of that but basically that has two problems first of all very few of the people who are now without health insurance who are sort of lower middle class category very few of them will be able to take advantage of this deduction and go out and buy health insurance first of all because most of them do not have incomes where that deduction is significant enough to be able to use it to buy a health insurance policy which in the private market may be 3 000 to 4 000 a year secondly what we find with this aboveline deduction is that it creates a disincentive for employers to provide health insurance as a consequence a lot more employers may decide not to provide health insurance and instead actually increase the ranks of the uninsured the only people that really are able to take advantage of this are people that already have health insurance that are making a decent income and can take advantage of the deduction but if one is trying to increase the number of insured people and take the uninsured off the rolls this accomplishes virtually nothing it just helps people who are in a higher income bracket and who already have health insurance again it sounds so critical the republican leadership brought up this bill yesterday or the day beforewhen they brought it out here and they said we are going to try to do all these things we want to address some of the health care concerns of the american public with this bill but whether it is the question of the uninsured it is ineffective whether it is the question of addressing the prescription drug prices it is ineffective because it does not provide any guarantees one is going to get prescription drugs under any kind of hmo plan certainly it does not even address the effort to reform the hmos with the patients bill of rights that the democrats have been talking about so i just want to say once again we see the republican leadership aligned with the special interests the drug companies the hmos the health insurance companies not doing anything that is going to help the average american now i wanted to talk a little bit because i think it is important i mentioned before earlier that there are three major health care issues that are not being addressed by this congress we only have a few more days every one of these issues could have been addressed and could have come to the floor the democrats have been pushing for them for these issues and for legislation to address these concerns to come to the floor it appears in the dying days of this congress that these issues are simply not going to be addressed they should be it is not fair it does not address the concerns of the average american now the first one i want to talk about is the patients bill of rights hmo reform we know from our own constituents i can certainly say for my constituents that one of the biggest problems people face is if they are in an hmo oftentimes they are denied access to the care that they need that their physician says that they need now that may be the individual who goes to the hospital and finds that the doctor says to them that they need to stay a couple extra days in the hospital after recuperating from a particular operation or it may be the individual who has the need for a particular operation and the hmo says they are not going to pay for it they are not going to cover it there are so many situations there are situations where people their hmo plans say that they cannot go to the local hospital they have to go to a hospital 50 miles away they may be in a situation where they want to go to the local emergency room and they have to go to the one 50 miles away otherwise it is not covered these are the kinds of abuses that we see not every day but on a fairly regular basis a lot of people come to my office and complain about these things now what the democrats said is well we want to address these abuses generally the plan that the democrats put forth with some republicans the patients bill of rights the norwooddingell bill has two major ways of correcting the abuses in sort of an overall sense one is that it provides that if a decision has to be made about what kind of care one is going to get that that decision rather than being made by the insurance company is made by the physician and the patient the definition if you will of what ismedically necessary the hospital stay the particular operation of what is medically necessary is made by the physician and the patient and not by the insurance company the second thing it does in a broad sense is the patients bill of rights says that if one is denied care because the insurance company says one cannot have that operation for example then one has to have an ability to redress that grievance the patients bill of rights does it in essentially two ways one it siys that one can go to a board outside the jurisdiction or outside of the umbrella of the hmo an independent review board that will look at the case and decide whether the hmo made the wrong decision in denying one that care absent that or sort of an appeal from the review board is that one can go to court and one can bring suit these are really very simple things basically what happened here is that the democratic leadership the vice president the president got together and we were able to get some republicans on the other side initiated by republicans that were physicians the gentleman from georgia the gentleman from iowa and some others to join us and put together the patients bill of rights the norwooddingell bill the republican leadership opposed it the republican leadership did not want to bring it to the floor we went out and got a discharge petition which is a way of coming up to the well here october 27 2000 and getting almost a majority of the members to sign a petition saying we want it brought to the floor the republican leadership eventually brought it to the floor it passed with almost every democrat and maybe a third of the republicans it went over to the senate where it was killed by the senators who will not even let it come out of conference between the two houses but again this is an important piece of legislation just as important as a prescription drug benefit under medicare just as important as trying to address the problems of the uninsured and we find that the republican leadership in this house of representatives simply will not let any of these good measures move forward they have stopped them and they are still stopping them in the waning hours of this congress i see i have been joined this evening by two of my colleagues who have been out front on all of these issues over the last 2 years and even bey ond that and i am very pleased to see them here i will first yield to my colleague from texas who has done so many things but i think probably the best example i saw was the period of time in his district where he spoke to the different senior groups and had them bring in their prescription drugs and tell him about the problems that they faced with prescription drugs and actually brought the pill bottles down here and suggested the rest of us do the same and we very dramatically showed along with the gentleman from texas about what kind of problems the average senior faces in texas and in all of our districts so i yield to the gentleman from texas at this point"], [0.001758575439453125, 0.9982414245605469, 1, "i rise to speak in

will lose 369 million for education under this bill just as we invest in the future of space programs we need to make sure that we invest in our future because children are our future we need

percent of the presidents proposal it will throw children out into our streets instead of having them safely in schools they will be placed as a burden on our churches to care for our young people

programs for our children it will cut 68 million from programs for education technology centers yet the president just recently said that we are going to provide additional money in science and technology especially it affects a lot of our institutions across the united states and we need to make sure that our children advance and are meeting the future in that area school safety the republican plan will result in unsafe schools onethird of our schools need extensive repairs or replacement of buildings republicans rejected 1 3 billion for urgent safety and health repairs at 5 000

pay for rent and food and dying because they cannot pay for their needed prescription drugs the democrats have a plan that has no deductible a plan that will allow a minimum premium of 25 and cover 2

should do provide a guaranteed drug prescription plan for americas seniors as the democrats plan provides i rise to respond to this newest attempt by the majority to mislead this nations seniors into the belief that they are truly concemed about prescription drug coverage what the majority is proposing today fails as a legitimate response to the democrats longstanding position that americas seniors need a comprehensive drug benefit today the elderly constitute 13 percent of the population yet account for more than onethird of the nations annual drug expenditures since 1968 the percentage of seniors expenditures on prescription drugs has risen from 64 annually to 848 annually which amounts to 4 1 percent of their incomes additionally despite the fact that 65 percent of the 39 million beneficiaries have some private or public coverage many still do not have adequate supplemental coverage for drug costs to address this gap in medical coverage for our nations elderly president clinton proposed a medicare reform plan but at that time the republicans felt that addressing this issue was not politically expedient yet in light of the hotly debated presidential and congressional races it appears that the republicans have suddenly gotten religion this latest revelation by the majority is not even that in fact this bill is merely a revelation that the polls indicate it is politically necessary for republicans to at least address the issue of prescription drug benefits even if their bill is void of any real relief for this nations seniors senior and consumer advocates groups alike oppose the majoritys prescription drug bill because it is fundamentally at odds with any meaningful prescription drug bill groups like the national council of senior citizens the national committee to preserve social security and medicare and families usa the national senior citizens law center and the american association of people with disabilities oppose the majoritys plan we must pay attention to this nations seniors when they tell us that the majoritys rx 2000 act risks the health and well being of not only seniors but also people with disabilities it is particularly enlightening when the head of the health insurance association of america even admits that the republicans concept of a socalled drugonly private insurance simply would not work in practice the seniors living in the 18th congressional district of texas located in the city of houston want real relief from the high price of prescription drugs they have always told me that you have to watch what someone does not what they say in order to know what kind of person you are dealing with let me tell you what you are dealing with under the republican plan because to hear it from their mouths one would believe that all this nations seniors and the disabled would be provided with the prescription drug coverage they need however that is not the case the democratic prescription drug plan is secure because it is part of the medicare system however the republican scheme relies on private insurance the democratic plan provides comprehensive coverage through the medicare program while the republican scheme hopes the private insurers will provide these benefits can we really trust such a scheme that is based on the profit of big insurance companies that are in the business to make money without regard to affordability or reliability the biggest issue in the debate on a medicare drug plan is how much will seniors be required to pay out of pocket in order to receive this benefit under the democratic plan there is no deductible while the republicans want our nations elderly to pay 250 a year if the household were two elderly people than they would be expected to pay 500 a year in medical prescriptions before they earn their benefit to prescription medicines under the democratic plan medicare will pay half the costs of medicines up to 2000 and by the year 2009 medicare will pay half of all prescription expenses for seniors up to 5000 the republicans will only pay half the cost of medicines up to 2100 increasing at the rate of inflation in drug prices under the democratic plan you can see that the real meaning of catastrophic is understood to be a great often sudden calamity which ordinary people could not possibly plan to overcome without assistance for this reason the democratic plan has a catastrophic benefit limit of 4 000 after which medicare pays all costs unfortunately the republicans have a total life time limit of 6 000 i am disappointed that the needs of seniors is not at the top of the houses legislative agenda for consideration of a bill that should have addressed the life and death issue of affordable prescription medication especially for our nations elderly poor therefore i ask that my colleagues on both sides of the isle use reason and right mindedness to find the best road to a real prescription for what is ailing our nations medicare system which every american knows is affordable prescription medication for our nations seniors our nations elderly have given to this nation the opportunity to successfully compete in todays everchanging worid which has lead to great economic prosperity for all of us now that our economy and our nations people are in a position to reap benefits that are far in a excess of our current needs we should not hesitate to provide those benefits which are needed by our nations disabled and senior citizens this is a small investment for our nation so that our society can benefit from a healthier senior population which happens to be a vital and growing sector of our nations economy it is a fact that the baby boomer generation who will be retiring over the next decade will be the wealthiest group of seniors in our nations history for this reason their long health and active participation as consumers in our nations economy makes great economic sense i urge my colleagues to oppose this critically flawed semblance of a prescription drug plan offered by the majority and support meaningful prescription drug plans to improve the health of our nations elderiy"],

communities like joliet and a lot of suburban towns as well as cornfields and grain elevators the folks back home have a pretty clear message even in such a diverse district they want us to meet our challenges and work together and come up with solutions that is why they are so proud of what this congress has accomplished in the last 4 years with balancing the budget for the first time in 28 years cutting taxes for the middle class for the first time in 16 years reforming welfare for the first time in a generation and taming the tax collector by reforming the irs for the first time ever those are real accomplishments and folks say well thats pretty good but thats history what are we going to do next well this congress and this republican house have several very very important goals we want to strengthen and make our schools not only better but safer we want to strengthen social security by locking away 100 percent social security revenues for social security we want to pay down the national debt and of course we want to continue working to lower taxes for the middle class and for working families this year as we work to lower taxes and to lower the tax burden for middleclass families i believe that the approach we should take is to adclress the unfairness in the tax code because when i listen to the folks back home whether in the union hall or the vfw a local chamber of commerce or at a coffee shop in my hometown down on liberty street people say that not only are their taxes too high they complain about the complexity and the unfairness of the tax code i believe this series of questions really illustrates a key area of unfairness that we should make a priority in this congress this year in getting the job done on eliminating this most unfair area of our tax code that is why i want to explain why enactment of the marriage tax elimination act is so important with the question of fairness do americans really feel that it is fair that under our tax code married working couples pay more in taxes just because they are married do americans feel that it is right that 21 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more under our tax code just because they are married 1 400 more than an identical couple with identical incomes who live together outside of marriage clearly i think the american people agree that the marriage tax penalty is wrong and we need to set it right the marriage tax is not only unfair it is wrong it is wrong that under our tax code you are punished for getting married as i noted earlier it affects 21 million married working couples on average 1 400 in higher taxes just because they are married let me give an example here of a couple in the south suburbs of chicago you have a case where a machinist and of course this particular machinist works at caterpillar in joliet he makes the heavy machinery that we use to mine and dig things and build things he makes 30 500 if he is single after the standard deductions and exemptions he is in the 15 percent tax bracket but under our tax code because two working people who choose to get married their incomes are combined and in fact you file your taxes jointly you are pushed into a higher tax bracket this example of this south suburban couple this machinist who meets and marries a schoolteacher in the joliet public schools with an identical income of 30 500 because under our tax code they combine their incomes and their combined income is 61 000 pushes them into the 28 percent tax bracket and because this machinist and this schoolteacher in joliet illinois in the south suburbs of chicago chose to get married they pay more in taxes that is just wrong of course i would like to point out that for this schoolteacher and this machinist in joliet 1 400 is real money 1 400 is one years tuition at joliet junior college our local community college and it is 3 months of day care at a local day care center we need to eliminate that marriage tax penalty it is wrong that under our tax code this machinist and schoolteacher end up paying higher taxes when they get married had they chose not to get married and just lived together their taxes would have been 1 400 less that is just wrong under the marriage tax elimination act we eliminate this marriage tax penalty for this machinist and this schoolteacher in fact we do it by doubling the standard deduction we also double the brackets so that joint filers can earn twice as much as a single filer and remain in each bracket had the marriage tax elimination act been law today this machinist and schoolteacher would have seen the marriage tax penalty eliminated what is the bottom line in just a couple of weeks this house of representatives will be working to pass the tax provisions for this years balanced budget the 3rd balanced budget in 30 years thanks to a republican congress i believe as we work to provide tax relief as part of this balanced budget our first priority should be making the tax code fairer for this schoolteacher and this machinist by working to eliminate the marriage tax penalty i am pretty proud of what we have accomplished in 1996 we created as part of the contract with america the 500 per child tax credit benefiting 3 million illinois children this year let us help married working couples let us help illinois families by

deficits this bill is irresponsible because it relies upon uncertain projections it is irresponsible because it relies upon unrealistic assumptions it is irresponsible because it would cut taxes dramatically before congress has taken the necessary steps to address the longterm solvency of social security and medicarenot to mention the other challenges facing this country challenges like providing education for our children prescription drug benefits for our seniors and affordable health insurance for all americans and it is irresponsible because it targets its tax relief to the wealthiest households in the country the ones who have benefited most from the economic growth of the last 20 yearsrather than to the hardworking families who have borne the burden of modernizing and streamlining our economy over the last two decades this bill would be paid for with a trilliondollar surplus that doesnt yet exist at this point it is just a budget projection anyone who has watched the federal government struggle to gets its deficits under control over the last 18 years knows that budget projections are notoriously inaccurate and that slight changes in some of the assumptions can change the results significantly the trillion dollarsurplus we are expecting might never materialize if the economy suffers some kind of setback furthermore an 800 billion dollar tax cut might even be the cause of such a setback a tax cut now when unemployment and inflation are both at record lows could overheat the economy bring back inflation and trigger economic stagnation or even recession afternatively it is conceivable that a huge tax cut could conceivably end the current period of economic growth simply by destroying public confidence in the federal governments willingness to exercise fiscal restraint in addition the trillion dollar surplus is based on the assumption that discretionary spending will stay below the existing budget caps until 2002 and then rise only with inflation there is no trillion dollar surplus if discretionary spending is raised above the levels set by the current caps but many of our colleagues both republicans and democrats have indicated that they believe that the current discretionary spending caps are unacceptably low and should be raised enough to allow adequate levels of spending on federal activities like law enforcement medical research and education i share their concerns and i firmly believe that discretionary spending should be increased to address such pressing domestic needs moreover in considering the tax bill before us today it is important to remember that even if the economic assumptions are correct and congress chooses to limit discretionary spending sharply in order to pay for these tax cuts the projected onbudget surpluses are only expected to last for 15 years after 2015 social security medicare and medicaid costs are expected to produce massive budget deficits as the baby boom generation retiresdeficts in the hundreds of billions of dollars each year we cannot responsibly make large tax cuts today without first preparing for the massive financial challenge that awaits us in a few years such fiscal irresponsibility reflects a dramatic aboutface from the progress we have made on the budget in recent years i strongly believe that we must pursue fiscal policies that are conservative and cautious that means that tax cuts should wait until after weve fixed social security and medicareand until the federal government has actually produced the surpluses necessary to pay for them in addition i believe that tax cuts should be balanced against other pressing national needs4ike lifting children out of poverty making prescription drugs affordable for our seniors providing highquality education to our children and guaranteeing affordable health insurance to all americans and if we are going to cut taxes i believe that we should cut the taxes of the workingand middleclass households who need and deserve tax relief the most instead of cutting taxes disproportionately for the wealthy as h r 2488 does that is why i support the democratic alternative tax cut proposal which provides significant but not profligate tax relief conditions that tax relief upon action to make social security and medicare solvent and targets its tax relief to hardworking middleclass american families who are struggling to make ends meet rather than those fortunate few who already have it pretty good like the bill introduced by chairman archer the democratic alternative raises the standard deduction for married couples filing jointly to eliminate the marriage penalty for many middieclass familiesbut it also reduces the marriage penalty on many workingclass couples by fixing the earned income tax credit the democratic alternative also increases the size of the existing family credit by 250 for each child less than 5 years old and it uses tax credits to leverage private investment in poor communities in improving the environment and in school construction and modernization the democratic bill provides tax relief to small and familyowned businesses by increasing the existing section 179 expending provision and by accelerating the expansion of the estate tax exclusion and the democratic tax cut simplifies multiemployer pension programs that cover millions of working amdricans the republican tax plan by contrast disproportionately benefits the wealthiest americans it would phase out the estate tax which currently only affects the richest 2 percent it would lower taxes on capital gains income most of which goes to the most affluent americans and even the centerpiece of the republican tax cut the 10 percent across the board rate reduction would disproportionately benefit the rich the most important difference between the democratic republication bills however is the fact that the tax cuts in the democratic alternative are contingent upon action on social security and medicare the majority of the tax cuts in the bill would not take effect until after the solvency of the social security and medicare programs is ensured the tax cuts that would be enacted immediatelythe sections of the bill making certain existing tax provisions permanent would be offset with the revenueraising provisions identified in chairman archers bill i believe that the more modest size and the contingency provisions of the democratic alternative tax cut bill make it a much more responsible tax relief bill than h r 2488 finally the democratic tax cut alternative targets tax relief to the workingand middleclass families who are struggling to make ends meet those are the people who deserve tax relief the most the democratic bill unlike the republican bill would eliminate the marriage penalty for lowincome families the democratic alternative unlike the republican bill would provide targeted assistance to working families for education health care longterm care and child care and the democratic bill would provide estate tax relief to family farms and small businesses without like the republican bill exempting the superrich from all estate taxes in short while the democratic tax cut alternative would not cut taxes as much as the republican bill it would cut taxes for many working families more than would the republican bill consequently on the grounds of fiscal restraint responsibility and fairness i urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting this unwise legislation and supporting the democratic alternative"],

oppose estatetax relief for familyowned ranches and farms or other small businesses in fact i definitely think we should act to make it easier for their owners to pass them on to future generations this is important for the whole country or course but it is particularly important for coloradans who want to help keep ranch lands in open undeveloped condition by reducing the pressure to sell them to pay estate taxes but there is a better way to do it than by enacting this republican bill that is why i voted for the democratic alternative when the house originally considered this bill that democratic alternative bill would have provided real effective relief without the excesses of the republican bill it would have raised the estate taxs special exclusion to 4 million for a couple owning a farm or small business so under that alternative a married couple owning a family farm or ranch or a small business worth up to 4 million could pass it on intact with no estate tax whatsoever also the democratic alternative actually would have provided more immediate relief to small business and farm owners unlike the republican billwhich is phased in over 10 yearsthe democratic alternative would have taken effect immediately that means a couple passing on their farm or small business in the near future would avoid more tax under the democratic plan than under the republican bill they would not have to hope to live long enough to see the benefits in addition by increasing the general exclusion from 675 000 to 1 1 million next year the democratic alternative would have allowed parents to pass on millionaire status to their children without a penny of estate tax burden and the democratic alternative also would have lowered estate tax rates by 20 across the board so the democratic alternativewhich i voted for which deserved adoption and which would not have been vetoedwould have provided important relief from the estate tax and would have done so in a real effective and prompt way furthermore the democratic alternative would have provided this relief in a fiscally responsible way that would not jeopardize our ability to do what is needed to maintain and strengthen social security and medicare provide a prescription drug benefit for seniors and pay down the public debt by contrast it is precisely the fiscal overkill of the republican bill that made me most reluctant to vote for it and that leads me to vote to sustain the presidents veto as the rocky mountain news put it in a september 3rd editorial the republican tax cut is a gamble that the present economic boom isnt going to slow and is fiscally irre mr lantos i will vote today sponsible to uphold the presidents veto of the estate once fully phased in the republican bill tax elimination

called for a significant relion over 5 years and 104 5 billion over 10 duction in the rate of taxation of estates and years but that is far from the whole story be a 50 percent increase in the small business cause of the way the bill is phased in its true exclusion the rangel proposal was a cost is cleverly hidden and does not show up thoughtful and reasonable effort to deal with until after the 10year budget window the legitimate concerns of small businesses that means the full effects of the repub and family farms but it did not have the problican bill will come just at the time when we lems of the legislation which was being urged will have to face budget pressures because by the republican majority my own baby boom generation is starting to when the rangel substitute was defeated

fighting the right fight on trade issues unfair trade issues for at least this whole decade the gentleman from michigan stood in this hall with me and several others but he was here night after night during the debate on the north american free trade agreement h2742 coi in opposition to it and what he predicted and what he projected absolutely unfortunately has come true in relations with that country and our trading partners that way the gentleman from michigan has a perfect understanding of what is happening with globalization as we walk the halls in this job and go back and forth between committee hearings and meetings in our office and the house floor we have seen more ceos of americas largest corporations walking the halls than atany time of the year every time we vote on china trade relations there are more corporate jets at national airport more ceos walking the halls of this congress when one of them stops and talks to us they invariably say that engagement with china will mean more democracy with china that as we go to china as we trade and engage with them more as we sell them more and buy more from them that democracy will be able to flourish in china they have been telling us that for 10 years when our trade deficit with china in 1989 was 100 million million with an m and today that trade deficit with china with this engagement that we have undertaken with the chinese our trade deficit now is 70 billion with a b 70 billion but they continue to tell us over and over let us do more of this with china more engagement more trade and things in china will get better they tell us that there are 1 2 billion potential consumers in china what they do not tell us is their interest is that china has 1 2 billion potential workers for those american corporations and other western companies that invest in china and sell products back to the united states the real question on globalization and democratization perceived democratization predicted democratization of developing countries like china the real issue boils down to this that as we have engaged more with developing countries as investors have gone into developing countries western investment has shifted from those developing countries that are democracies to those developing countries that are authoritarian governments we see fewer investment dollars going to india a democracy the worlds largest democracy and more investment dollars going to china we see fewer investment dollars relatively going to taiwan and south korea democracies and more investment dollars going to countries like indonesia authoritarian governments in the postwar decade the share of developing country exports to the united states for democratic nations fell from 53 percent to 34 period in other words corporations want to do business with countries with docile work forces with countries where people earn below poverty wages in countries where people are not allowed to organize and bargain collectively in countries that pay 25 cents an hour they have been moving away from democracies into authoritarian countries in manufacturing goods developing democracies share of exports fell 21 percentage points from 56 percent to 35 percent again corporations western investors are choosing to move away from democracies in their investments developing democracies and going to developing authoritarian countries because unitedstates investors like the idea of a docile work force like the idea of workers that cannot talk back like the idea of workers with low wages like the idea of investing in countries where the government is not free where workers simply do what they are told in example after example we can see investment moving from those democracies to countries like china china has certainly been the largest one where that has happened again these ceos that roam the halls of congress these days and tell us that if we engage with china it will mean more democracy in china these same ceos will have us believe that their interest in china their going to china will cause this blossoming of democracy this blooming of democracy in china but look who the major players in communist china today are those people who are the major decisionmakers in the direction that chinese society goes the communist party of china the peoples liberation army in china which controls many of the businesses that export to the united states and western investors which of those three entities the communist party the peoples liberation army or large western companies multinational companies which of those three groups want to empower workers which of those three groups want to pay higher wages which of those three groups want more democracy in china which of those three groups want to change markedly chinese society i submit that none of these three groups want to see change in these societies that is why western investment finds its way into countries like china rather than a country like india if american business investors in china and around the world really want a democracy they would not be going to china they would not be taking development dollars out of democratic countries and putting them in authoritarian states that is why the argument they make that engagement with china will mean a more democratic world and a more prosperous and democratic china is absolutely bogus we as a nation we as a nation have no business rewarding investors that go to countries like china instead of countries like india we have no business taking sides in that sense by rewarding those countries and those investors whose values run very different from ours run counter to ours in this country in this congress we believe in democracy we believe in free markets we believe in people being able to move from one job to another we believe in people being organized and bargaining collectively we believe in the kind of democratic values that made this country great our passing pntr is going to mean more of the same in china more repression more oppression from the government a government that resists democracy because they have the power to we will be making

the house over the last several years and that is a pretty basic fundamental question that is is it right is it fair that under our tax code married working couples pay more in taxes than an identical couple in an identical situation living together outside of marriage it is just wrong that under our tax code 28 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married is it right that under our tax code that couples are punished that they are penalized when they choose to participate in societys most basic institution that is the fact today i represent a diverse district on the south side of chicago in the south suburbs in cook and will counties in joliet and the bedroom and farm communities they all ask the same question they wonder why for 30 years now washington has punished marriage and no one has gone back to fix it i am pleased that under the leadership of the speaker of the house the gentleman from illinois this house has made it a top priority to eliminate and wipe out the marriage tax penalty suffered by 28 million married working couples the speaker has said that the elimination of the marriage tax penalty will be fast out of the box and on a fast track through the senate and to the president wiping out the marriage tax penalty and stopping the tax code from punishing marriage the marriage tax penalty really results from our very complicated tax code and unfortunately because we have a progressive tax code if couples get married they getpunished that is just wrong here is how the marriage tax penalty works here is how it ends up say there is a machinist and a school teacher in joliet illinois a machinist who works at caterpillar at the local plant the machinist makes that heavy equipment the big bulldozers and cranes and earthmoving equipment he makes 31 500 a year if he is single he pays taxes in the 15 percent tax bracket now if he meets a tenured public school teacher in the joliet public school system with an identical income as long as she is single she pays in the 15 percent tax bracket but if this school teacher and machinist choose to get married when they are married they file jointly and add together their income what happens then is their combined income is 63 000 and that pushes them into the 28 percent tax bracket and they are punished with an almost 1 400 marriage tax penalty if they chose to stay single and live together outside of marriage they would avoid that marriage tax penalty in this case because this machinist and school teacher chose to live in holy matrimony societys most basic institution they are punished under our tax code i find most americans whether they live in the city or the suburbs or the country think it is just wrong and they want congress and the president to do something about it that is why i am so pleased because i have a another couple from joliet illinois two public school teachers shad and michelle hallihan they came and told me they suffered a marriage tax penalty of 1 000 they just had a baby michelle told me congressman tell your colleagues in the congress that 1 000 average in marriage tax penalty is 3 000 diapers of course they point out that 1 400 the average marriage tax penalty is one years tuition in the local community college well house republicans are going to do something about this we are going to work to eliminate the marriage tax penalty and the speaker has put it on a fast track this wednesday tomorrow the house committee on ways and means will have committee action on legislation that will essentially wipe out the marriage tax penalty for a majority of those who suffer it we double the standard deduction for joint filers to twice that of singles which will not only help 3 million couples who will no longer have to itemize 9h91 printed on recycled paper their taxes but will essentially wipe out their marriage tax penalty for those who do not itemize of course many homeowners itemize in order to help homeowners and those who itemize from suffering the marriage tax penalty we widen the 15 percent bracket so that joint filers can earn twice as much as single filers and still pay in the 15 percent bracket and for lowincome families who benefit from the earned income tax credit we also provide marriage tax relief for poor families and lowincome families who suffer from the marriage tax penalty it is good commonsense legislation and deserves overwhelming bipartisan support there is no excuse to vote against legislation wiping out the marriage tax penalty the speaker of the house has also indicated that by valentines day that we are going to pass this through to help couples like shad and michelle hallihan who suffer the marriage tax penalty and what better valentines day gift to give 28 million married working couples than legislation which will eliminate the marriage tax penalty think in these terms 1 400 is a drop in the bucket here in washington it is chump change for the washington bureaucrats and the big spenders here in washington but back home in illinois a 1 400 marriage tax penalty is one years tuition at a local community college 3 months of day care for shad and michelle for their child it is several months worth of car payments it is most of the contribution to an ira for michelle it is real money for real people house republicans are making it a priority we invite the democrats to join with us let us make it a bipartisan effort to eliminate the marriage tax penalty what better valentines day gift to give 28 million married working couples i urge my colleagues to pass the legislation with bipartisan support and send it to the senate and send it on the president i rise today to highlight what is arguably the most unfair provision in the unitedstates tax code the marriage tax penalty i want to thank you for your long term interest in bringing parity to the tax burden imposed on working married couples compared to a couple living together outside of marriage this month president clinton gave his state of the union address outlining many of the things he will spend the budget surplus on house republicans want to preserve 100 of the social security surplus for social security and medicare and use the nonsocial security surplus for paying down the debt and to bring fairness to the taxcode a surplus provided by the bipartisan budget agreement which cut waste put americas fiscal house in order and held washingtons feet to the fire to balance the budget while president clinton parades a long list of new spending totaling 72 billion in new programswe believe that a top priority after saving social security and paying down thenational debt should be returning the budget surplus to americas families as additional middleclass tax relief this congress has given more tax relief to the middle class and working poor than any congress of the last half century i think the issue of the marriage penalty can best be framed by asking these questions do americans feel its fair that our tax code imposes a higher tax penalty on marriage do americans feel its fair that the average married working couple pays almost 1 400 more in taxes than a couple with almost idential income living together outside of marriage is it right that our tax code provides an incentive to get divorced in fact today the only form one can file to avoid the marriage tax penalty is paperwork for divorce and that is just wrong since 1969 our tax laws have punished married couples when both spouses work for no other reason than the decision to be joined in holy matrimony more than 21 million couples a year are penalized they pay more in taxes than they would if they were single not only is the marriage penalty unfair its wrong that our tax code punishes societys most basic institution the marriage tax penalty exacts a disproportionate toll on working women and lower income couples with children in many cases it is a working womens issue let me give you an example of how the marriage tax penalty unfairly affects middle class married working couples forexample a machinist at a caterpillar manufacturing plant in my home

an entrepreneur and he understands firsthand the needs of the hightech industry although there is still no objective credible study that documents the shortage of american hightech workers the ins said recently that the demand for highly skilled foreign workers is running at least 50 000 ahead of last year such a demand can indicate an actual shortage of american workers a spot shortage a preference for cheap labor or replacement workers or something else but because of the importance of the hightech industry to our economy i think we should give the industry the benefit of the doubt but giving hightech companies the benefit of the doubt is not without risk unless we safeguard american workers we need to recognize the opposition of the american people to an hlb visa increase two major polls demonstrate that the vast majority of americans do not want to see the number of hightech visas increased so much and worry that it will hurt american workers a peter hart poll conducted in march found that 73 percent of americans do not want to see immigration law changed to allow the entry of more foreign hightech workers only 20 percent wanted more foreign workers a harris poll released in september 1998 found that 82 percent of americans do not want to see the hlb quota increased the poll found that 77 percent of americans believe that an increase in hlb visas reduces employment opportunities for american workers and 86 percent of americans believe that unitedstates companies should train unitedstates workers to perform jobs in technical fields even if it is faster and less expensive to fill the jobs with foreign workers to satisfy the concerns of the american people we need to protect american workers from being undercut by foreign workers in the hlb program s 2045 contains no significant provisions to protect these american workers it does not require most companies to make a goodfaith effort to recruit unitedstates workers before hiring foreign workers it allows all but a small handful of firms to lay off american workers and replace the american workers with foreign workers why would anyone oppose these common sense safeguards what amazes me is that in all the discussions i have had with representatives of hightech companies not a single one has expressed any concern about the impact of this legislation on american workers how could anyone oppose a safeguard that says american workers could not be fired and replaced by a foreign worker how could anyone not agree to advertise for american workers before hiring from abroad how could anyone oppose paying foreign workers what the average beginning salary is for american college graduates unless they want to undercut american wages the committee on the judiciary passed a bill h r 4227 that contains an additional crucial safeguard for american workers the committee on the judiciary passed a bill that set a floor on wages for these workers 40 000 per year this wage is a good starting point for any hightech professional it is a salary that american students fresh out of college are making this crucial safeguard would prevent unitedstates companies from hiring foreign workers to undercut the wages of american workers strong antifraud measures are also necessary to address known abuses an article in last thursdays san francisco chronicle says it all federal authorities have started nationwide investigations into the hiring of foreign hightech workers including charges of visa fraud and allegations that the practice is riddled with abuse the chronicle quotes bill yates of the ins as stating but are we catching most of the fraud the truthful answer is that we are not if it is the intention of the employee or the employer to defraud the government you may not be able to ferret it out a justreleased government accounting office report states there is not sufficient assurance that ins reviews are adequate for detecting program noncompliance or abuse the program is vulnerable to abuse both by employers who do not have bona fide jobs to fill or do not meet required labor conditions and by potential workers who present false credentials the goals of preventing abuse of the program and providing efficient services to employers and workers are not being achieved evidence suggests that program noncompliance or abuse by employers may be more prevalent than under other laws any hlb bill should contain effective antifraud measures as are contained in the committee on the judiciarypassed h r 4227 s 2045 contains no such antifraud measures in return for giving hightech companies hundreds of thousands of more foreign workers all we ask on behalf of american workers is some minimal basic common sense safeguards to ensure that businesses do not want to hire cheap foreign workers at the expense of american workers while this bill has taken significant steps to alleviate the presumed shortage with more training for american workers such provisions will not yield benefits for many years supplying future workers is a different issue altogether from shielding todays american workers from the consequences of admitting so many workers from other countries congress should not turn its back on american workers again i appreciate and recognize the work done by the gentleman from california and by the gentleman from utah and congratulate them"],

washington from november 30 until the purpose of this meeting is to prepare an agenda for a new round of multilateral trade negotiations aimed at expanding and liberalizing world trade in the wake of the uruguay round of negotiations which ended in 1994 as chairman of the congressional steel caucus i recently convened two days of briefings by unitedstates steel industry executives and the president of the steelworkers of america in addition to discussing the continued threat of lowpriced imports the industry and steelworker representatives also provided the caucus with advice on what should and should not be included ii the agenda which is being drafted in seattle there is general support for this new round of negotiations because liberalized trade has a great potential benefit for the unitedstates economy as long as that liberalized trade is fair and i emphasize the word fair is rulesbased and is market economy based the caucus heard that any future negotiations under the auspices of the world trade organization must in no way weaken unitedstates trade laws particularly our antidumping and countervailing duty laws these laws provide essential remedies against unfair foreign imports i am pleased that we have been repeatedly assured by ambassador barshefsky secretary daley and other administration officials that antidumping and countervailing duty statutes will not be reopened in seattle or in any new round of negotiations to follow but we have also heard repeatedly from several of our trading partners that they will seek to reopen discussions on these laws my particular concern arises from an addendum to the wto general council chairman mchurnos draft ministeril declaration for the seattle meeting which he drafted on his own responsibility the proposals in this addendum would seriously weaken the unitedstates antidumping and countervailing duty laws as they stand today although this addendum is not official it indicates that there will be substantial pressure on the unitedstates delegation to include discussions of changes to the antidumping and countervailing duty laws in the new round of negotiations the proposed changes would allow the dumping of goods into the united states and would allow goods to be subsidized by foreign governments these changes in turn would jeopardize united states jobs i will mention just a few of the 24 changes that have been proposed in the mchumo addendum one once an antidumping investigation under unitedstates law is concluded no new petition involving the same product could be initiated for at least a year this means dumping of that product could resume and continue for a year before any remedy could be pursued two if a penalty duty lower than the calculated margin of dumping were thought to be sufficient to reduce the injury then that lower duty would be mandatory even if dumping continues three countervailing duties would be imposed not in the full amount but only in the amount by which the subsidy exceeds the applicable de minimis level four developing countries would suddenly be exempted altogether from the present prohibition on export subsidies and import substitution subsidies these proposed changes sound technical but they would have a dramatic impact on unitedstates jobs in the manufacturing sector and in other important sensitive sectors these changes would mean job losses for many americans and therefore these changes must be resisted i support the viscloskyney resolution stating that the antidumping and antisubsidies code of the wto should not be reopened in seattle i will be part of a delegation travelling to seattle in november as part of the speakers advisory group on the wto ministerial a strong vote in the house and participation by members in the delegation to seattle will be essential in backing up and i say that supporting the administrations position that the unitedstates antidumping and countervailing duty laws should not be weakenea in any way during the upcoming multilateral trade negotiations"], [0.9931569695472717, 0.9931569695472717, 0, "i am very pleased to be on the floor this evening in support of my bill h r 4503 the historically womens public colleges or universities historic building restoration and preservation act i want to commend the gentleman from utah chairman hansen for his commitment to women and minorities education and thank him for his work to see that this important authorization reaches the floor i also thank the gentleman from alaska chairman young for his similar commitment and work i would also like to address some of the concerns raised by the gentleman from american samoa our friend on the other side and talk about why this is so important as we go into the 21st century that we look to the institutions who educated and trained the october 3 2000 cc women beginning in my home state of mississippi in 1884 if we look at the subset of the universities that we picked out why should they receive priority they are the oldest public womens colleges in the country we may talk about the 78 other womens colleges but these are the oldest of the womens colleges in the country they happen to reside in my region but if we are looking at his toric preservation it seems to me that we look at the oldest first and that should receive the priority if we are looking at continuing their mission into the 21st century mississippi university for women has a great legacy not only going back into the late 1800s the 1900s but today in 2000 they received unitedstates news and world reports ranking of the best in the south as a liberal arts college they are educating not only women today and minorities but also male students if we are to continue the rich history and the legacy of what they have done over their history over their time and to continue the mission into the 21st century then the buildings that house their students where the teachers train the students of tomorrow we must preserve those buildings that house the places where we are now providing the education for women and minorities across the south i introduced h r 4503 to advance what i think is the most important priority for funding in this congress and that is education the bipartisan cosponsorship and support for this effort affirms the principle that if we are to continue to progress as a society if we are to continue to lead the world in science medicine law and many other fields we must educate all americans the historically womens public institutions which are the subject of this bill were founded in the united states between 1836 and 190g this was a time when women particularly poor women were unable to attain a higher education in public schools the opportunity simply did not exist in recognition of this injustice and unfair circumstance for women there was introduced into the united states senate a resolution in the late 1800s which sought the establishment and endowment of schools of science and technics for the education of females in appropriate branches of science and the useful arts upon a plan similar in its principles to that upon which agricultural and mechanical colleges have been aided by the united states this need expressed in this resolution introduced over 100 years ago continues today as i mentioned earlier in my home state of mississippi the state legislature worked and established the mississippi industrial institute and college of girls to provide for women particularly those without the means a public education which would empower them to lift themselves out of their circumstance over 100 years later i know that the w and the other colleges prioritized in this bill continue to be crucial educational institutions for women minorities and all students with buildings in some of these colleges and universities well over 150 years old still in use their disrepair now endangers their ability to continue their critical role in educating women and minorities due to advanced age of these buildings the upkeep costs are more than most budgets can allow since most of these universities were built in the early 1900s most of todays basic needs are not provided for in their facilities this congress can and should reaffirm its commitment to the education of women the underprivileged and minorities education cannot take place without adequate facilities we must therefore contribute to the rehabilitation of these facilities funding for restoration of these historic buildings much as we did for the historically black colleges across our region is and should be a sound investment i want to thank again the gentleman from utah the subcommittee chairman and all those who have cosponsored this legislation it is the place where my mother received her education and where many of the women who were trained and educated in my home state who then became leaders and teachers and those who have raised the next

percent of college athletes and virtually no athletic scholarships went to women because of title ix more than 100 000 women now participate in intercollegiate college sports the purpose of title ix is to provide the same opportunities for women in education as men while we celebrate the great strides that women have made in competitive athletics we should also recognize that title ix has made an impact and opened doors in other areas of education the unitedstates womens national soccer team our 1999 womens world cup champions they certainly made it clear that women can make a tremendous contribution to sports these dedicated determined and accomplished young women make me proud to be associated with the cause of getting more girls and women involved with sports and fitness title ix and the unitedstates womens national soccer team have changed the playing field for girls and women in athletics but since title ix was passed in 1972 there has been a world of change in our expectations of what women can achieve women like mia hamm and michelle akers on the soccer field and colonel eileen collins who is commander of the shuttle flight columbia they have shown the skeptics that women can successfully participate in every walk of american life they are all longdistance runners in the challenge and the struggle to raise the status of women in our society when i was growing up most people thought that girls were not as interested in sports as boys consequently girls were discouraged from participating in sports activities now research by the womens sports foundation shows that on the contrary boys and girls between the ages of 6 and 9 are equally interested in sports participation by the age of 14 however girls drop out of sports participation at a rate six times greater than boys something must have happened now after the unitedstates womens soccer team has won the 1999 womens world cup young girls have aspirational and inspiration role models that will no doubt increase their participation in sports they are growing up and appreciating the sports skills of women and they see images of themselves excelling in sports young women who participate in sports are more likely to finish school less likely to have an unwanted pregnancy the availability of athletic scholarships has enabled more women to pursue a college education and has opened opportunities for women at dozens of colleges let me just point out the health benefits of regular and rigorous physical exercise are extensive studies show that women who participate in sports actually lower their risk of breast cancer and are 92 percent less likely to be involved with drugs there are also psychological benefits young women who play sports have a higher level of selfesteem a lower incidence of depression and a more positive body image i am sure that all over america young girls are achieving success on the athletic field and thinking about growing up to be soccer or basketball stars others are applying themselves to their studies and they are dreaming about becoming scientists or engineers or even members of congress these young women can feel safe and secure in

this amendment and strike the rider the language needs to be stricken because its effect to put it very bluntly would be perverse this language would put land in newly created national monuments in a state of limbo the lands would remain national monuments but the design the planning and management necessary to fully protect the lands and to make them accessible could not be accomplished who could possibly gain from keeping lands in this sort of halfwayhouse condition nobody not those who want to preserve the environmental value of the lands the prohibition in this rider would block the planning and management needed to protect the environmental and cultural values that prompted the monumental designation not those who want recreational access to the lands the prohibition in this rider would prevent the development of programs or centers to enable the public to take greater advantage of the lands not even those who have mineral or other economic interests in these lands the prohibition in this rider would prevent the development of rules and policies that would determine how to handle their claims so why would anyone propose a rider that cannot help anyone concerned about national monuments and a rider that would cause this entire bill to be vetoed to boot the reason is that the proponents of this rider want to signal their opposition to the 1906 antiquities act itself and with the particular monument designations that have been made this year but they have plenty of other ways to do that directly the congress could amend the antiquities act the congress could override any particular monument designation the congress could reject any particular management plan for a mofiument congress has all the direct authority it needs to have a full debate about lands policy but they do not want to do that because congress has repeatedly shown its unwillingness to significantly alter with monument authority or designation so instead we have a rider to try to do it in an indirect and inartful way through the appropriations process which could not be done through direct congressional action namely derail efforts to protect federal lands through the use of the antiquities act that is a misuse of the appropriations process and it is especially misguided in this case because the direct impact of the language is so counterproductive so i urge my colleagues not to turn the discussions on this rider into a debate over the legitimacy of the antiquities act or the wisdom of any particular monument designation if congress wants to weigh in on these matters it can and should do so directly in any event the rider leaves the act and all recent proclamations entirely intact this debate should be about the specific language in the rider which will leave the

strong support of the substitute bill h r 2436 would make it a federal crime to knowingly damage a fertilized egg during an assault against a pregnant mother i now i absolutely agree that it is a tragedy for a woman to lose a pregnancy during a crime and i strongly support the approach that many states have taken to toughen penalties for an assault against a pregnant woman and that is in fact the approach that my colleague is taking in her substitute however h r 2436 would do nothing to protect the woman further but instead would create for the first time a legal definition that a fertilized egg is entitled to protection under the law as a person this bill is indeed breathtaking in its scope while the examples used are drawn from criminal assaults of women in advanced stages of pregnancy its real concern reaches to the impact of the violence on the embryo roe v wade makes a distinction between the embryo in the first trimester and the post viability embryo and that is the distinction that state laws honor this bill makes no such distinction because it deals with the fertilized eggs at all stages of development and therefore it opens the opportunity that if a woman is assaulted in sort of a routine assault and battery case and 3 weeks later has a miscarriage that miscarriage can up the assault and battery charges to murder though she did not know she was pregnant at the time and neither did the assaultant so this bill goes way beyond what it appears to do and while i certainly think that a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy who is assaulted and the fetus killed that assaultant deserves a punishment that is far more severe than if he had not been attacking a pregnant woman i think this bill goes way beyond that by dealing with a fertilized egg and opening up the kinds of possibilities i cite and the next step which is not contained in this bill but it is the only logical next step is to disregard the intent of the assaultant why if it is a criminal assault should it be seen as a crime when it is simply the destruction of the fetus it should not be seen as a crime that is why those of us who support a womans right to abortion are deeply concerned about this legislation it does clearly in its language exclude abortion but the only difference between an abortion and a criminal attack is the criminality of the attacker and the criminal intent but the effect on the fetus is the same and all my colleagues focus on in this bill is the fetal effect and they define fetus as fertilized egg even before the woman knows she is pregnant so i

million less than the year 2000 as i have stated and less than the presidents request these levels are recommended because of limited budget resources and particularly because of the state of the
