than three decades cesar chavez symbolized the voice for political awareness among latinos he carried the cry for farm workers rights to the fields of california and echoed the call for la causa the struggle to raise political consciousness and deliver justice to all latinos with every breath cesar chavez brought passion to his quest for justice but his triumphs sharpened the bittersweet taste of organizing and unionizing the migrant workers a step forward in the march was often matched by a step backward success often mixed with suffering it was in 1962 that cesar chavez took out his life savings and first organized the national farm workers association in the san joaquin valleys agricultural town of delano by september of the same year the nfwa held its first formal meeting in fresno with 287 participants who came to listen to the powerful ideas of the farm workers rights movement lead by the inspiration of cesar chavez along the thousands of miles traveled through the california farm land chavez brought the message of farm workers unity and unionization during the late 1960s and early 1970s the ufws membership reached its peak with over 70 000 members in 1975 chavez delivered his most important legacy to the farm workers rights movement successfully campaigning for the landmark agricultural labor relations act which permitted farm workers to organize and bargain collectively for the first time the grape pickers struggle took center stage in what chavez called la huelgaa series of strikes a call for adequate living conditions and higher wages and a stop to the exploitation and injustice suffered by latinos chavez is also responsible for one of the first and largest consumer boycotts persuading millions of consumers to voluntarily abstain from buying california grapes the boycott gave consumers an active role in opposing the injustices against farm workers across the country throughout his life cesar chavez brought to the public eye the existence of mexicanamericans as a growing and vibrant population more than just the political movement chavez created a moral spiritual and cultural world for mexicanamericans to explore with each and every march chavez continued to challenge all mexicanamericans to engage in an active search for their own cultural identity by the 1970s the term chicanismo the identification of latinos of mexican decent as a symbiosis of hispanic indigenous and american culturesfirst appeared in the lingo of the time chicano art brought nourishment to the spirit of farm workers and to urban life cesar chavez was the inspiration for the teatro campesino which made its debut at the picket lines among the farm workers it was luis valdez agustin lira and others that colored with music and drama with the fight chavez would come to epitomize chavez gave writers painters and other artists the strength and inspiration to express the chicano and latino struggle for equality he gave latinos a voice a spirit and a dream the means to speak a common language through the words of the working poor cesar chavez spoke in a language that was as dear to puerto ricans as it was to mexicanamericans i recall my late father who had walked the picket line on behalf of the sheet metal workers in the bronx it was my father who often expressed to me and my brother that the one power the working poor have is the right to strike it was with these ideas that cesar chavez became part of the puerto rican struggle in the east coast chavez encountered many impediments throughout his struggle but fought his opponent only through words and nonviolent philosophy in 1969 chavez said if the strike means the blood of one grower or one growers son or one worker or one workers son then it isnt worth it in 1968 chavez began a 25day fast chavez explained his actions by saying it was an act of penance recalling workers to the nonviolent roots of their movement even though his fasting lead to physical deterioration it powerfully communicated the hunger for dignity of the farm worker to every one present today and for the thousands of farm workers in the united states it is difficult to express through words the sorrow felt throughout this nation like martin luther king jr who organized africanamericans in the south to stand up against injustice and discrimination cesar chavez stood up against injustice and discrimination cesar chavez stood up against oppression and exploitation in the agricultural fields of california but chavezs greatest accomplishment was to unite the latinos in this country who are children of the earth share the common land to sow and with one united voice await the season when justice may be reaped for the betterment of all as a humble voice among latinos i take great pride in honoring the memory of cesar chavez in memory of you cesar we pledge to keep your voice alive and with your words i make the call viva la huelga viva la causa viva la union thank you cesar you will

civil rights movement i came of age during the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s it was an era in which i found my own courage to try and make a difference in this society i was inspired by individuals such as chavez i drew strength from his examples of leadership i am convinced that the lessons of the 1960s are still relevant today i am a product of that era i think that many of the difficult experiences that chavez and others went through should be discussed to remind people of the long struggle that was necessary to strengthen freedom and democracy in the postworldwar era i felt a great deal of kinship with cesar chavaz he like me started from very modest circumstances you see i come from a small southeast alabama town called troy in the 1940s and 1950s the signs of discrimination and segregation were everywhere i saw those signs that said white men colored men white women colored women white waiting colored waiting chavez experienced great hardships as a child growing up in migrant worker communities he suffered the harsh sting of discrimination and racism because his family traveled from one community to another in search of work chavez was not able to finish high school life was hard for the migrant farmworking families of the west it was especially hard for the mexican families who were subject to great discrimination despite the struggles of his youth chavez emerged as one of the most disciplined labor and civil rights leaders of his generation the grape boycott of 1965 that was led by chavez proved to be one of the finest hours of the migrant farmworker crusade it won the support of the nation and brought chavez into a highly visible position of leadership in the struggle for civil rights in the hispanic community chavez will be remembered for his courage and his determination to bring dignity to the lives of workers his legacy will speak to future generations of americans i believe he should be regarded as one of the

interior appropriations bill and ask that my colleagues support the bils adoption as presented by the conferees as a member of the interior subcommittee i want to convey that i am greatly pleased with the final bill that is being presented i espedally want to express my appreciation to our very distinguished chairmen mr yates and his staff and to our very able ranling minority member mr regula for the fine work and leadership they have provided in developing this important legislation given that the interior appropriatlons subcommittee has the principle responsibility for funding natural resource programs for the nation it is not surprising that many aspects of this bill are controversial as is witnessed by the debates over such programs and policies as the national biological survey and grazing fee increases much of the controversy surrounding natural resource programs has to do with the reality that we are a nation in transition in addressing how we manage the relationship between human beings and their environment in regard to my region of the country the pacific northwest i am pleased to se thali the fiscal year 1994 interior appropriations bill makes a tremendous investment in seeing that our region takes a prospective approach to managing the changes it faces in forest management i agree with the presidenrs view that when change is inevitable irmust be managed to our advantage in order to help address the inpacts of a greatly reduced umber supply in the northwest due to court injunctions and endangered species ustings and in accordance with the presidents request this bill includes an additional 15 million in economic assistance targeted to washington oregon and northern caiomia to be distributed as 10 million for community assistance and 5 million for old growth diver slcaion these monies are important to helping effectively address the current transition additionally i am pleased that the conference report includes significant monies to begin a comprehensive multiyear watershed restoration program in the northwest that will allow for the significant rehabilitation of salmon habitat while creating family wage jobs in the region specifically the bill includes 26 million to allow for watershed assessment acvities through the forest service 20 million for watershed restoration through the forest service and 7 million for watershed restoration in the interior department through the ecosystem restoration fund it is becoming increasingly evident that protection for salmon stocks is the new area of critical focus in the northwest and where a great deal of work needs to be oone in the reglon the rivers of the northwestern states and northern california serve as habitat for the most magnificent runs of wild salmon stocks in the word a major benefit to initiating a comprehensive reglonwide watershed restoration program is to allow the northwest to get ahead of the curve in species protection the implementation of a watershed restoration program will aide in the prevention of lstings because the focus win be on avoiding further degradation to existing healthy habitat and where feasible will allow for slope stabilization and the rehabilitation of streambeds in addition to the dear ecological benefits of habitat restoration and ensuring the viability of salmon populations i am pleased that the initation of a comprehensive watershed restoretion strategy will create numerous family wage jobs in the region and in rural timberdependent communities where they we needed most watershed restoration work in the northwest region will serve as an inportant building block towards comprehensive ecosystems management i am pleased to see the bipartisan leadership being shown by the interior approodatons conferees on this issue again i urge my colleagues to support passage of this conference report i want to congratulate chairman yates and ranking member ralih regula for their outstanding work on this bill and i too want to commend the staff of the subcommittee on the interior i have had the pleasure of serving on the subcommittee for 17 years and the staff does an outstanding job and i have great respect for their effort and contribution in this process i want to take a few minutes here today just to say how much i appreciate the work that has been done in this bill to help the people of the pacific northwest as we struggle with our endangered species problems that relate to the northern spotted owl and the marbled murrelet and many of our endangered or threatened salmon species president clinton we all recall earlier this spring convened a conference in portland or to try and bring together all of the factions in the northwest to deal with this problem he came up with a solution which was not endorsed by everyone but as part of that solution he put together a package of programs to try and help the people of washington oregon and northern california deal with the consequences of the listing of the northern spotted owl i can tell the members of this house that in the olympic forest in the state of washington for example we used to harvest about 300 million board feet of oldgrowth timber every single year and we were told by the forest service that this could go on forever well that simply was not true today we are harvesting 15 million board feet off the olympic national forest because we are preserving all of the rest of it for primarily the northern spotted owl and it has had a dramatic effect on the workers and the communities in that area but in this bill we have i think the beginning of a new effort on an issue that i have been championing with the help of the committee members and that is the issue of watershed restoration the gentleman from minnesota held some very good hearings on this issue earlier this year the committee on merchant marine and fisheries has held hearings the distinguished chairman of the committee on natural resources the gentleman from california has been interested in this issue in this bill we have 53 million to start a program for washington oregon and northern california to protect our watersheds and to restore the habitat that has been damaged i am pleased with this initial effort however i want to make sure that these funds are spent inan interagency cooperative way so that we can actually put people back to work restoring the habitat and hopefully restoring the salmon runs and the steelhead runs that are so important to the culture lifestyle and economy of the northwest we are certainly hopeful that the presidents plan will lead to the lifting of the injunctions that have stopped timber harvesting on federal lands in washington oregon and in northern california and i will say this though i disagreed with the presidents option 9 plan i nevertheless think that it offers us the best chance of being able to go into court and get these injunctions lifted i hope that will occur later this year or earlynext year but we have serious problems there are other provisions in this bill that ensure funding for oldgrowth diversification initiatives so that we can take some of these mills that were tooled up to cut old growth and have them now cut the smaller second growth trees and to do things using other techniques in forestry but we could not have gotten this started without the cooperation of not only the authorizing committees but also the appropriations committee and with the help of the members of this subcommittee in the other body so i just want to report to the house that i think we are off to a good start however we are going to need more help"], [0.008952677249908447, 0.9910473227500916, 1, "this debate represents a proud moment for the house of representatives tonight the american family is coming together to make a very difficult and a very hard decision as with the debate on the persian gulf war a few years ago we have tonight a divided country on a very difficult issue and now like then we have been listening to the american people we have been debating the facts of this agreement we have been wrestling with our consciences and tonight we stand in the shoes of the american people we have largely accepted that each others motives are good i submit that everyone who disagrees with me tonight shares my desire for a better america i submit to that we simply disagree tonight on how best to get there it has been especially difficult for many of us on this side who are in disagreement tonight with our president he worked hard in my view to fix an agreement that he was handed by president bush i worked hard with him to try to get it right and at the end of the day unhappily i came to the conclusion that it was not right but i respect his conclusion that it was and i respect the fight that he has put up for his position in may of 1991 in the fast track debate on this floor on nafta i said this if you think the right kind of treaty can be strong enough to create new american jobs and tough enough to protect the american environment the mexican environment american workers and mexican workers if you think trade can mean more jobs and better wages then i urge you to let this negotiation go forward i said vote yes all we are saying is give trade a chance we gave this treaty and this negotiation every chance but my unhappy conclusion tonight is that this agreement that is before us is deficient and flawed in short it is not a sufficient force for progress first it does not leave us with confidence that mexican worker wages will go up with productivity all of you know the facts you know that mexicos command economy has artificially kept wages down you know that the average mexican worker makes 68 percent tonight of what he or she made in 1980 you know that in 1980 the mexican worker made 22 percent of the average american workers wage but tonight he only earns 15 percent of the average american workers wage you say well what difference does it make people say are you saying we cannot trade with countries that have a lower standard of living that is not what i am saying but what i am saying is that we cannot and we must not expose our workers and our corporations to unfair competition to a wage system where the government sets the wages and artificially holds them down we must not do that at the end of the negotiations i asked our negotiators to ask the mexican negotiators to put the entire mexican labor law into the enforcement process and on the last day they agreed to child labor and safety but they would not agree they adamantly refused to put in the industrial relations part the right to organize the right to assemble the right to collectively bargain and the right to strike we must not approve a treaty that does not put all of the labor law into the enforcement process members may say well why is that so important why do we care so much about that let me tell them why i do if this agreement is to work for us for mexico for canada mexican worker wages must come up the reason they must come up is that if they do there wihl no longer be such an inducement for our corporations to go there to get the benefits of labor members say well they can now i agree with that but further with that if we let it go on there will be continued downward pressure on our workers wages and on our negotiations and finally and most importantly the promise of nafta the potential of nafta is that we will have a market in which to sell our products henry ford had it right if we do not pay the workers a decent wage they cannot buy the cars that they are making we have got to get mexican wages to go up this agreement tells mexico that change is not necessary it ratifies a system that is in place but when we negotiated this agreement our business people rightly went to our negotiators and said we must have protection of our investment we must have protection of our intellectual property and they were right to ask for that but when we went and said we must also have protection for the rights of their workers and ours there was not an answer of assent we must not approve a treaty that only protects the rights of business but does not protect the rights of workers the second major defect is to do with money all of us know the problems that have been created at the border and many of them are our fault we set up a maquiladora program 30 years ago and millions of workers were drawn to that border to work never was the right infrastructure put in place to support all of those people the sewer systems the water systems and the road systems that should have been there have never been there i submit to my colleagues tonight that this treaty is insufficient on providing the monies that will be needed over 20 and 30 years to put those very needed things in place i do not want to go to that border 5 and 10 years from now and find conditions are worse and not better and when will we finally stop lying to ourselves and creating myths and illusions if we want to build this we have to pay for it this treaty does not pay for it it does not make it happen and one moment i said 2 years ago let us have a crosborder transaction fee why did i say that not because it is popular but because the money has got to come from somewhere and i believe it should come from the people who are most benefiting from the trade between the countries let us have a fee that pays for the things that we believe are important to do now let me say that many say that we are at a fork in the road the proponents say that we will go down the right road or the wrong road i agree that we are at a fork in the road but i think the right road is to follow the kind of agreement that leads to the new world of commerce and trade that we are in the issue is no longer whether to trade it is how to trade it is what are the rules of engagement the old issue between protectionism and free trade is over it is history the argument over the rules of fair trade and how to get our workers and businesses on a level playing field is the debate of the present and the future our goal must be over time to achieve compatibility compatibility between all countries that are trading just as we have compatibility between all of the states of the united states this debate started before the cold ware ended and before the wall fell in berlin and in most of the cold war period our standard of living was rising and we were locked in a battle with communism we did not care too much about trade treaties we never had a debate on this floor that i can remember about a trade treaty like this because we just assumed economic growth and we always put trade treaties to be subservient to defense or foreign policy it just was not that important my colleagues this nafta tonight is the last of the old world trade tresties americans now realize that our standard of living has been declining for over 15 years they realize that our most important national goal must be a rising standard of living proponents of this nafta represent the past represent the status quo and fear of real change and they must understand that this countrys greatness was not built on cheap labor i ask members tonight to remember for whom they stand tonight on whose behalf do we ask for this fairness over many days in the last 3 years i have stood in villages in mexico and i have had mexican workers come up to me and say will you mr congressman insist on a nafta that fights for fair wages for our hard productive work mr congressman will you insist on a nafta that really provides money for sewer systems and water systems and roads so that we can raise our families in dignity and security and safety and i have met countless united states workers who have said mr congressman will you insist on a nafta that gets me on a level playing field and that will have real funding for training programs if perchance i lose my job i have not met one person who shrinks from the competition of fair trade our workers are not afraid mexican workers are not afraid but i have met lots of people who have very high expectations of us they expect us to be a force for genuine progress they expect us to be a force for a nafta that will increase wages in all three countries this nafta does not meet those expectations we can and we must do better as you vote tonight as you put your card into the machine put yourself in the shoes of the people that you represent think of them think of their dreams think of their families think of anita mingus who worked for zenith in springfield missouri who along with her coworkers froze their wages over 8 years so they could keep their jobs who in 1989 they out their wages by 8 percent so that she was making 7 an hour to keep their jobs who then saw their plant go from 4 000 jobs to 1 000 jobs to 100 jobs tonight as they do the work to finally close the plant that has gone to mexico think of anita mingus who believes her coworker husband died of a heart attack because of the stress of losing his job i talked to her on the phone this evening she said she is going to school to be a printer she is supporting herself and her 13yearold son with a parttime minimum wage job she said she is not afraid and she is not bitter she knows we have got to compete and she is optimistic about her future but she said i am a survivor mr gephard the lord always takes care of me and then she said but tonight mr gephariut i am counting on you when you vote tonight think of anita mingus and the millions like her who count on us and only have us to count on she believes we can renegotiate this agreement and she believes we can get a better agreement say no to this naf ta say yes to anita

columbia the capital city and at the other end it has astonishing numbers of poor people as well one in every six district of columbia households that filed an income tax return in 1992 received the earned income tax credit as of that time i am not going to talk about the earned income tax credit recipients you hear most about the families we have finally begun to get movement on families i am going to talk about the most forgotten working poor in this country and those are childless working poor people time and again we have enhanced the earned income tax credit and each time we gravitate appropriately enough toward poor families and the effect this has had on poor single people trying to maintain an attachment to the work force is truly astonishing since 1980 the proportion of income paid in federal taxes by the poorest onefifth of nonelderly households without children has risen a stunning 38 percent how many of us have seen our taxes go up 38 percent during that period how are we to keep young people attached to the work force when the competition is there from the underground not to mention the criminal economy which will make their lives much easier in that respect and guarantee that they will not pay any taxes at all we have got to stop taxing these people into poverty and put a human face on these working poor people who do not happen to have a child and who have paid dearly for not having a child through their income taxes if the gasoline tax is raised and the childless worker credit is dropped this trend will worsen still more therefore i wish to point to these silent working people who nobody speaks for because they do not have the classic tenderhearted trapping the child to make people notice them i and where do they go well they are dispersed in my black communities i must tell you when they get into the wage economy and find that they are paying in federal income taxes the same as people with far higher incomes many of them give up we must use this opportunity to give them the chance they deserve and if something must be thrown over the side let us not throw over the side once again childless working poor people finally let me say a word about the leland act which also may be cut deeply these figures in the black community should be noted more than half of all working poor africanamerican families with children would receive the earned income tax credit that is more than half of the working poor africanamerican families while 41 percent of all africanamerican children live in families that receive food stamps for part of the year there has to be a shocking increase in hunger in this country and who bears the brunt of it our children when i was a young woman in the civil rights movement i remember that the country moved very far toward eliminating hunger for children and for americans and we have slid back i hate to see us slide back when we made very significant progress as we did with hunger and the leland act gives us an opportunity to move forward once again including either the childless worker credit or meaningful food stamp increases through the leland act but not both will still cause 50 percent of poor households to be taxed further into poverty thus i ask the inclusion of both the childless worker credit and the leland act so that we can make progress first with those who are doing the most they can to help themselves but have received almost no reward for it childless working poor people and secondly innocent children who deserve at the very least enough to eat i want to thank the

today in support of free trade with mexico i also rise as an opponent to this north american freetrade agreement there is no disputing that with the right agreement expanded trade with our neighbors can be good for all three nations and we as member of congress must be committed to making this happen we need a freetrade agreement that will reduce the trend of job losses and declining wages in this country there is great danger however that the nafta we are debating today will only accentuate that trend for this reason i am voting against this nafta with the confidence that as long as we remain committed to free trade we can negotiate a better agreement the reason that jobs and wages are threatened by this agreement lies in the repressive and undemocratic treatment of workers by the mexican govemment treatment that does not allow workers to bargain for fair salaries without addressing this problem a freetrade agreement with mexico would force american workers into unfair competition against workers who have artificially low wages the party of president carlos salinas has controlled all levels of mexican government for over 60 years and has historically deprived workers of their right to organize when the working people of mexico try to bargain for fair wage levis they are harassed beaten jailed and sometimes tortured and killed for their efforts because of these repressive policies workers in mexico do not earn the wages they deserve this may sound like a human rights problem which has nothing to do with free trade but it lsan economic issue as well because mexican workers do not have the right to organize the average manufacturing wage in mexico is about 2 per hour in the united states on the other hand the average wage is almost 14 although there will always be a wage disparity between two counties entering into a freetrade agreement this disparity is artificially large and it will force american workers and their families into unfair competition when countries enter into a freetrade agreement there is a tendency for the wage levels in those countries to move down to the lowest common denominator if workers in the high wage country do not take a pay cut they face the danger of losing their jobs altogether to the cheaper labor of the low wage country this happened with the united statescanada freetrade agreement which has resulted in canadas loss of 300 000 manufacturing jobs since 1989 the wage disparity between canada and the united states is nothing compared to the gap between our country and mexico i cannot ask working families of the united states to enter into this unfair competition i cannot ask them to make a choice between losing their jobs or taking a massive pay cut free trade is desirable but because of the way mexican workers are treated this agreement is unfair proponents of this nafta hold to the theory that passage of the agreement will change mexicos undemocratic practices why then is it only a theory why is it not in writing the side agreements negotiated this summer say nothing about the mexican workers right to organize and we cannot gamble away the livelihood of hard working americans and their families by betting on a theory a similar theory is used to dismiss mexicos historic failure to enforce environmental regulations proponents tell us that if this nafta is passed we will see a profound improvement in mexicos treatment of its environment but there is no disputing that mexicos lax environmental regulations have provided temptation for some united states businesses to relocate to mexico where they can profit cheaply leaving americans without work instead of signing an agreement with mexico and then o hoping in good faith that change occurs nafta should contain a binding agreement prior to approval after all it took the european common market 10 years to allow greece and portugal to enter precisely to ensure that their labor and environmental practices would not hurt the agreement they did this for a reason and we should leam from it another argument we hear from proponents of this nafta is that if congress falls to approve the agreement trade relations between our country and mexico will be damaged beyond repair and there will be no chance to negotiate another nafta to answer this i would like to remind my colleagues that the mexican government approached us with the proposal of a freetrade agreement in the first place and mexico still has much to gain by renegotiating if this nafta is defeated good ideas do not die free trade with mexico is a good idea and i am confident that we can get it dght a freetrade agreement with mexico will cause some american workers to be displaced but this nafta would force workers in the united states into unfair competition with the artificially low wages in mexico causing displacement that is unnecessary i have introduced a bill the displaced worker retraining act of 1993 which would provide a comprehensive retraining program for workers who are laid off because of federal policy decslons such as nafta i introduced this bill because the programs we now have are ineffeclive in getting displaced workers back into the labor force i can assure you that if our present worker retraining programs were not so flawedif a comprehensive worker retraining program were already in placemany of us who are concerned about the impact this nafta will have on the working people of this country would be more willing to support it but right now there is no such program where are the programs to help these workers train for a new job where are the funds to help hardhit communities get back on their feet if we insist on this nafta where is the safety net to help the families who are losers in the nafta equation right now there are no answers to these questions another reason to take a step back renegotiate and fix the problems associated with this particular freetrade agreement the debate on nafta has been emotionally charged and has centered around personalites i certainly do not agree with many of the arguments that some nafta opponents have made nor do i align myself with them in making my decision to vote against this trade agreement i have made every effort to sift through the rhetoric to answer the question is this nafta good for the majority of the american people or is it worth our while to fix the flaws in this agreement and make a better one i believe that a defeat of this nafta will not send our country into a downward economic spiral and it is worth the wait to fix the problems associated with this agreement so although i cannot support this nafta because i do not believe t will benefit the majority of the american people i strongly urge my colleagues not to recede into isolationism or protectionism as members of congress t is our job to ensure that this does not happen i urge my colleagues to make the commitment now to improve americas economic future by actively supporting a freetrade agreement with mexico which accounts for the interests of workers and the environmentan agreement that will truly benefit everyone in the united states of america"]],

large urban areas will serve no one particularly well whether you are from new york or punxsutawney pa when congress does finally vote on health care ieform legislation we must adopt a plan that provides flexibility for states and localities to meet their own special regional health care needs in particular congress must not forget that 27 percent of americans live in rural areas which have distinct health policy problems to resolve aside from the obvious geographic barriers to medical care such as rough terrain bad weather conditions and long distances between medical facilities rural communities must overcome certain demographic characteristics that make health care delivery a unique challenge rural populations tend to be older and poorer so there are higher concentrations of medicare medicaid and uninsured patients as a result rural hospitals and providers rely primarily on federal funds in the form of medicare reimbursement for survival as it is rural hospitals must contend with low occupancy rates and operate on shoestring budgets so the past decade of cuts and freezes in medicare reimbursement have put many rural hospitals in dangerous financial situations cutting the primary source of revenue for rural hospitals has forced many to close their doors altogether in addition to the financial problems of their local hospitals many rural areas suffer from an acute shortage of health care professionals primary care doctors physicians assistants nurses allied health professionals and other medical personnel are in short supply and most rural communities have a difficult time luring professionals from training sites in urban and suburban areas where they can make more money the maldistribution of health care professionals and the insolvency of our rural hospitals pose serious threats to the availability of medical care for rural americans regardless of whether they can afford it or not before we even try to control costs and increase access for the uninsured we must first revitalize the health care infrastructure in our medically underserved rural areas our efforts to reform the health care system will be pointless if rural citizens do not have a doctor to consult or a hospital to visit that is whywith the help of my health care advisory committee doctors nurses and other constituents concerned about health carei have drafted two bills to help solve the real health care problems confronting rural america the first bill i am introducing today is the rural health professional shortage act to improve the supply and distribution of medical professionals in rural areas the quality of rural health care is suffering because many young doctors nurses and other medical professionals elect not to practice in rural areas due to existing disincentives and drawbacks to practicing there while some decisions can be attributed to lifestyle preferences there are a number of other factors that influence where they choose to live and work for instance many young professionals are discouraged from practicing in rural areas because of lower earnings potential and lower medicare reimbursements for rural providers because rural professionals are often isolated from colleagues they cannot rely on them for consultation and second opinions they must work long hours many of which are on call often with little professional support most health care practitioners prefer working with the latest stateoftheart technology which many rural hospitals cannot afford also medical professionals tend to practice in areas close to where they were trained and most academic medical institutions and teaching hospitals are located in urban or suburban locales the rural health professional shortage act eliminates many of these financial and professional disincentives it provides urban and rural physicians equal medicare reimbursements for equal work by eliminating the urbanrural payment differential and it financially rewards those rural providers who have higher caseloads of medicare medicaid and uninsured patients my bill also encourages rural communities to grow their own health care professionals and targets scarce resources to individuals with rural backgrounds since they are most likely to return to and stay in rural areas finally the bill provides rural communities and their local hospitals the resources and technical assistance necessary to attract and retain medical professionals in their areas my second bill the rural hospital survival act recognizes the pivotal role hospitals play in the rural health care delivery system as the primary sources of medical care in rural areas and integral parts of local economies and it will help to keep many of our struggling critical access hospitals open according to the american hospital association 389 rural hospitals closed between 1980 and 1992 for those of us living in rural areas closure of a local hospital 6an significantly reduce our access to decent health care and cost the local economy valuable highskilled highwage jobs with fewer beds fewer admissions lower occupancy rates and higher perpatient perday expenses than metropolitan hospitals many small rural hospitals struggle to keep their doors open the office of technology assessment estimates that nearly onethird of all rural hospitals are operating in the red as i already mentioned rural hospitals rely primarily on medicare and medicaid payments and cuts in reimbursement rates have significantly increased the volume of uncompensated care provided by rural hospitals requiring them to provide more care with fewer dollars in addition to reimbursements that dont keep pace with health care costs rural hospitals must contend with an unfair medicare payment system that reimburses them less than urban hospitals the heart of the rural hospital survival act makes important adjustments to the medicare payment system including a complete elimination of payment differentials between urban and rural hospitals the bill establishes a new telemedicine grant program to promote the development of advanced data video and voice networks among hospitals and providers in rural regions it also renews two grant programs which have successfully helped hospitals and communities throughout the country improve health care delivery for rural residents antitrust exemptions would be provided to encourage cooperation and joint ventures among rural hospitals facilities would be able to share equipment services and health care personnel without fear of being sued and finally my bill would establish a commission to study the effects of state and federal regulations mandates and paperwork on small rural hospitals and the quality of care they provide rural americans have a great deal at stake in the health care debate not only will health care reformaffect the cost quality and accessibility of their medical care it will also impact the economic futures of their communities while working hard to promote job creation and economic development in my largely rural district over the years ive learned that the economic vitality of a rural community is closely tied to the quality and availability of medical care in the area local economic booms and busts closely correspond with the financial standing of the local hospital and the strength of a rural hospital can often serve as an accurate barometer of the state of the local economy as a local economy declines and unemployment rises the increasing burden of uncompensated care the local hospital provides fiscally strains the facility and affects the quality of care it provides often small rural hospitals cannot endure prolonged local recessions and when a hospital is forced to close it can devastate an already struggling local economy one reason is that hospitals are usually one of the largest employers in rural communities when a rural hospital closes the local area can lose dozens sometimes hundreds of well paying jobs also communities who have lost a hospital may have a difficult time attracting businesses and residents to their areas many companies are reluctant to relocate to a region that does not have a hospital or decent health care for a rural community to have a decent shot at attracting industry and creating jobs its local hospital must be in sound financial condition and its health care delivery system capable of providing quality medical care by strengthening the ailing health care delivery systems in our small rural communities my two bills will not only improve the health of our rural residents but also the health of our rural economies i urge my colleagues to recognize and address the unique health care problems affecting rural america by joining me as a cosponsor of these two vital bills"], [0.987305760383606, 0.987305760383606, 0, "madam chairman i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time madam chairman over the past few months i have extensively reviewed all of the arguments for and against the north american freetrade agreement i have talked at length with and listened to my constituents to three past presidents to president clinton and to many past and present cabinet officers to both our business community leaders and to our workers and i have listened attentively to our floor debate since the debate on this issue first began over a year ago i have openmindedly waited to hear and to understand any compelling arguments as to why this agreement truly benefits our nation our economy and our nations workers but the more i have heard the less i am convinced that this nafta is good for our nation with its high price tag nafta will cost our taxpayers billions of dollars it will throw our labor markets into turmoil and will cost thousands of american workers their jobs the joint congressional economic committee reported that nafta will cause a potential gross job dislocation of 500 000 or moreand downward pressure on unitedstates wages as well naftas environmental provisions are unwieldy unworkable and have been virtually closed to public participation it will place the health and safety standards of our states at risk because we will simply be unable to effectively enforce them equally important this agreement is not linked to any guarantee that mexican wages will rise as productivity increases in mexico nafta will force american workers to compete with mexican workers who make as little as 6 per day in some mexican export industries productivity is 80 to 90 percent of that in similar united states industries but wages are only 10 to 15 percent of united states wages naftas worker retraining program is not worth the name it proposes to spend the same limited amount of money to retrain hundreds of thousands of workers throughout the entire country as was spent to retrain the workers of only one automotive plant in new york moreover we must consider the threat of increased narcotics traffic crossing the mexican border without question the flow of illicit drugs into this country will increase as our borders are opened as transportation system are streamlined and as border inspections are reduced under nafta this administration was able to find a 17 million customs duties break for the honda motor corp as part of this bill but it could not find any new funding to deal with narcotics traffic that is sure to increase just as it erupted in europe when the european community opened its borders liberalizing trade is an important goal and we should support mexico in its economic reform efforts but in doing so this agreement must not neglect our nations interests and our interests are not well served by an administration which tries to buy a trade agreement at the expense of the taxpayer and the consumer with a number of sweetheart deals that amount to protectionism by any other name it is a sorry spectacle when the administration is willing to put us on the road to protectionism in the name of free trade yet this is precisely what is occurring when special protection is promised to our vegetable citrus sugarcane and beet growers the congressional budget office should be required to provide us with the cost to the treasury and to the consumer of these and any other special interest deals designed to win approval for this agreement it is my understanding that this legislation is trying to lower trade barriers at the same time it is laying the cornerstone of several new centers facilities banks and even bridges voters cynicism about washington only worsens as the mexican government and united states corporations pour millions of dollars into the lobbying campaign for this agreement a study conducted last may by the center for public integrity found that mexico was spending at least 30 million to sell this agreement to the united states congress since then millions more dollars have been pumped into this effort according to the center mexico has mounted the most expensive elaborate campaign ever conducted in the united states by a foreign government the mexican government has also helped to finance a private investment fund set up to buy american companies and move their work to mexico amerimex has tried to target some united states manufacturing firms by promising to replace our 10 an hour workers with 1 50 an hour mexican workers if nafta is adopted many american companies are going to have a hard time paying decent wages not to mention complying with environmental and safety standards in a poll conducted last year some 40 percent of 455 executives surveyed indicated they were likely to move some manufacturing to mexico after nafta is passed unlike the situation prevailing in the united states and in canada a governmentdominated alliance of business labor and farm organizations in mexico has broken the traditional tie between a workers wages and his productivity with the result that wages are artificially set and are thereby vrevented from responding to market forces nafta and the labor side agreement do not address this important problem nafta proponents argue that mexican wages have been rising over the past 2 years but these wages are still at about the same level as that prevailing in 1980 at present the average hourly wage in the united states is 16 17 per hour versus 2 35 an hour in mexico president salinas has promised to address this wage and productivity disparity but there are no guarantees that there will be a follow through on his commitment or that any successor mexican administration will choose to honor it in regard to the critical question of job creation there are no commitments about the agreements effects on our labor market only many confusing and contradictory studies the administration bases its claim that nafta will create some 200 000 jobs over the next 2 years based on the shortterm projections of the institute for international economics over a longterm scenario however this same institute projects a net job loss the economic strategy institute estimates that nafta will stimulate foreign investment in mexico especially in its exportoriented industries and that by the year 2002 as many as 220 000 jobs could move south a recent study by the joint economic committee concluded that the trade agreement could produce significant disruptions in the unitedstates labor market and the gross dislocation of 500 000 workers citing the 1993 trade statistics for mexico from the department of commerce the jec study concluded that our trade surplus and the related increase in united states employmentis fast disappearing together with the fact that mexico is likely to devalue its currency in the near futurewith or without a trade agreementthe administration claim of 200 000 new nafta jobs over the next 2 years appears to be completely unrealistic a study completed last month on the impact of the united statescanadian freetrade pact on canadas labor market concluded that the net employment effect has so far been slightly negative the migration of canadian jobs southward to the lower wage and less regulated workplace in our country should be a red flag for the implementation of nafta especially in light of the much greater difference in wages and working conditions prevailing between the united states and its neighbor to the south while many american workers will find their wages being held down or reduced by the agreement the american taxpayer will be asked to contribute billions of dollars for the agreement as well according to the joint economic committee report issued last week the total cost of nafta comes to 20 1 billion over the next 10 years this includes 8 8 billion in lost revenues resulting from tariff reductions 3 9 billion in proposed worker retraining which may be required and income support and 7 4 billion for the cost of the environmental cleanup and infrastructure development other estimates for naftas costs range from 13 billion to 54 billion depending on the estimates for the repair of large scale environmental problems along our border and for the comprehensive retraining and other support for labor force our society could be impacted with other costs as well many experts believe that the increased commercial border traffic resulting from nafta will lead to an increase in the flow of illicit drugs into the united states a september 1993 gao report on drug control efforts along the border indicated that the sheer volume of traffic makes effective interdiction an extremely difficult task about 8 million shipping containers enter the country in a single year and thousands of vehicles cross the bordef from mexico every day the drug problem lies in detecting which of these conveyances are transporting illegal drugs without impeding commerce according to the report an increased flow of commercial traffic under the proposed north american freetrade agreement can only be expected to exacerbate the problem one of the leading experts on the flow of illicit drugs into this country former unitedstates customs commissioner william von raab who served under president reagan has warned that nafta is likely to promote a quantum increase in drug availability here such an increase has taken place in europe when the border barriers were removed while the administration points to increased cooperative efforts of drug enforcement officials on both sides of the border there are no guarantees that mexico will continue its efforts if nafta is approved in advocating this agreement the administration also points to increased mexican cooperation in meeting the environmental pollution problems throughout that country and along the united statesmexican border the key environmental issue in regard to nafta however is the ability of the environmental side agreement to enable individuals or environmental organization to seek redress for any clear pattern of environmental abuses on this count the environmental side agreement is seriously deficient it fails to give these organizations or individuals access to the complaint and adjudication process the process itself is overly long and tortuous the agreement establishes a commission whose main function is the discussion and study of environment problems they are going to try to talk and study the problem to death and when more than talk is required its complicated and lengthy procedures requiring up to 470 days to completewill result in fines only after a countrys repeated failure to enforce its laws the ineffectiveness of the commission was described by top mexican trade negotiator jaime serra puche to the mexican congress on august 19 1993 in his remarks he noted the limited scope of the commissions powers and the timeconsuming process needed to reach enforcement recommendations he concluded that the long timeframe of the process makes itvery improbable that the fines or sanctions could ever be levied by any one of the governments against another in conclusion i believe that this agreement is deficient on too many counts accordingly i call on my

will be dealt with at the first appropriate opportunity the provision in question is section 13 of h r 3460 as reported by the public works and transportation committee this provision made a technical correction to section 131 s of the highway beautification act as added by the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act of 1991 that prohibits new billboards on scenic byways the purpose of the istea provision was to protect truly scenic areas all discussion of that provision related to scenic values and the understanding of the members during consideration of that provision was that it related solely to roads in scenic areas the federal highway administration interpreted that provision to override other provisions of the highway beautification act that permit the erection of billboards in commercial and industrial areas under the fhwa interpretation the new istea provision applies to commercial and industrial areas that may be designated as part of a scenic byway for the purposes of connecting scenic areas a state that has a scenic byway program will in most cases want to designate continuous scenic byway routes that is a scenic route that traverses mostly rural areas may pass through towns and cities the advantages of continuous scenic byways are numerous particularly conceming mapping and nolice to motorists what the fhwa interpretation means is that if a state designates a segment of road that runs through a commercial and industrial area as part of a scenic byway for the purpose of connectivity that segment of road would be subject to the new billboard prohibition no matter how urban or blighted that commercial or industrial area might be and even if the state does not want to change its billboard regulation in commercial and industrial areas the public works and transportation committee believes that the fhwa interpretation of section 131 s is not the best reading of the section the last sentence of section 131 s reads as follows control of any sign display or device on such a highway shall be in accordance with this section this section includes subsection d the commercial and industrial exemption the congress intended by this sentence that the scenic byway provisions would be subject to all the other provisions of the highway beautification act in addition if congress had intended to override other longstanding provisions of the act it would have explicitly done so a basic feature of the beautification act is to permit states to allow billboards to remain in industrial and commercial areas congress would not have relied on inference to make such a drastic change in the law indeed the conferees on istea never discussed the possibility of overtuming the commercial and industrial exemption the anomaly of the fhwa interpretation is that it preempts states in an area where they have never been preempted under the highway beautification act under the act a state may ban new billboards anywhere n the state including commercial and industrial zones the state may also choose to continue the federal commercial and industrial exemption the fhwa interpretation tells the state that if it designates a continuous scenic byway it may not as a matter of federal lawcontinue the commercial and industrial exemption even in the most blighted areas"], [0.983253538608551, 0.983253538608551, 0, "let me just

of semiautomatic assault weapons that fire rapidly with ease these weapons have no sporting use they are suitable for combat recently we received support for the banning of assault weapons by former presidents ford carter and reagan and this support reflects their experience in leading the american people it is also indicative of the bipartisan support which exists for getting these murderous weapons off the streets we just recently passed the crime bill the assault weapons ban together with the crime bill represents the kind of comprehensive approach needed to address the problems of crime and violence in our society i would also like to stress again the fact that our colleagues should bear in mind that this is not a partisan issue we remember that with the support of former president reagan president bush imposed a ban on the importing of assault weapons well following that ban imported assault weapons traced to crime declined by 45 percent whereas the domestic assault weapons traced to crime remained the same barry goldwater has affirmed that assault weapons have no place in anybodys arsenal jack kemp endorsed the ban last year and gov william weld has endorsed legislation to ban assault weapons and highcapacity magazines in my state of maryland the state police have endorsed this ban i am pleased that the governor of maryland has supported the ban and the state legislature just recently passed very similar legislation yes each side of this debate has its statistics bolstering its point of view but how could anyone honestly think that the banning of assault weapons will not save lives and reduce violence after all although semiautomatic assault weapons are less than 1 percent of this nations privately owned guns they accounted for 8 4 percent of all violence traced to crime from 1988 to 1991 and also i do believe that this legislation makes fair reasonable accommodations to the interests of hunters and sportsmen it specifically exempts 670 hunting and recreational rifles and shotguns it bans only 19 assault weapons which are the weapons of choice for gangs drug dealers and organized crime it is time to act to get these rifles off the streets and protect our families our children and our communities ask the parents of a child killed in a driveby shooting the children of a police officer gunned down with an ak47 or a young man permanently paralyzed because he went to the grocery store when gang members swept through his neighborhood how they would vote on assault weapons we know the answer they would vote yes i urge my

increase americas muscle in our hemisphere creating the largest freeade zone in the world over 370 million people openlng new markets to unitedstates products this will allow us to maintain our position as the worlds economic superpower the vote on nafta is truly an historic one this vote is essentially a yardstick by which we will measure our fears against the future the rest of the world is watchingour confidence and faith in economic progress will be judged by the outcome of this vote passage or defeat of nafta will determine the pace of american competitiveness this vote will dedde during this economically transitional time whether we choose to move forward to meet the new challenges of the 21st centuryto lead the world or resist inevitable change and relegate american to a secondrate economic power critics of nafta have had two things going for them virtual information overload and an american public whose mood is economically introspective at the moment these two elements have given the antinafta forces the leverage to market some baseless arguments ultimately opponents of nafta rely on trans parent arguments that play upon peoples chief fearjob los since the debate about nafta began heating up several months ago the public has been bombarded with reams of conflicting statistics about the effect nafta will have on our economy the issue has been clouded by wild predictions of lobs fleeing across the border on one hand while the other side claims hundreds of thousands of jobs will instantly be created both clains are exaggerated however because of the current sluggishness of the unitedstates economy in general and callfomlas economy in particular the argument of job loss has been potent two things about the job loss argument there is nothing to stop united states companies from relocating to mexico without nafta 1 will not stand here and deny the obvious there are companies who have chosen to take jobs across the border to mexico ironically these jobs were lost primarily because we do not have a freetrade agreement with mexico because of the current tariff structure imposed by the mexican government it is extremely difficult for united states businesses to compete there unless they physically move their production to mexico and hire mexican workers under nafta united states businesses will not have to pay these kinds of tariffs and will not have to move their companies to mexico in order to compete in the market second dire predictions about the giant sucking sound of jobs being lost as united states companies flee to mexico are ridiculous when you consider the facts nafta opponents bass their joblo argument on the assumption that low wages are the sole determinant of economic success this contention is not supported by the body of economic eadence or by decisions most businesesa and employers have made and will continue to make in the future if cheap labor was the sole determinant of economic success the dominican republic would be an economic powerhouse it is not no matter how cheap labor is the bottom line to business is that the work force must have a level of education equal to or greater than the task at hand united states workers are neady five times more productive than their mexican counterparts this combired with americas superior infrastructure is more than enough to offset the lure of cheap
