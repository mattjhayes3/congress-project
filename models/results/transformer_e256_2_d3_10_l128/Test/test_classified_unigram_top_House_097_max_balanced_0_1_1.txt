offers this nation the promise of strong economic recovery rather than the continued pain of unemployment high interest rates and runaway deficts this alternative is necessitated by the fact that this current administration continues to make excuses for its bankrupt economic policies which are bankrupting our nation we are told to just wait intil our economic recovery program takes effect we have been waiting now for 8 months with these results interest rates are the highest in history 16 million americans are either out of work working parttime or so discouraged that they no longer even look for work the housing industry is in the worst condition since world war ii business failures and farm foreclosures are running at the highest levels since the great depression this litany could go on and on but suffice it to say that if the congress had enacted last year the congressional black caucus economic recovery plan instead of president reagans we would not be suffering the economic contractions that are now wreaking havoc with our nation there is no joy however in pointing out that the congressional black caucus last year predicted the misery and human suffering that would occur as a result of the adoption of the reagan economic program the reagan record hs all too clearly shown that the congressional black caucus was right the congressional black caucus is right again this year we have once again met the presidents challenge to put up or shut up we put up once again a fair and sound budget proposal which will rescue our nation from devastating and debilitating deficits unemployment and economic stagnation the fauntroy alternative controls federal spending not by pushing millions more americans into poverty not by a continued assault on the nations young disadvantaged and poor but by an assault on wasteful military spending extravagant tax breaks to wealthy citizens and irresponsible tax subsidies for profitable corporations the fauntroy substitute rejects the reagan economic shell game which redistributes income from the poor and middle class to the rich more than any other alternative the cbc alternative embodies creative and comprehensive tax reformstopping the raid on the federal treasury through tax breaks for those who least need them rather the cbc alternative restructures the presidents tax cut to principally benefit those earning less than 50 000 per year moreover our alternative provides real tax relief to the poor and middle class by increasing the standard deduction and earned income tax credit the fauntroy substitute proves that fiscal responsibility can be achieved while maintaining compassion and concern for the american people by implementing tax reform and by reducing military expenditures the cbc budget would reduce the projected fiscal year 1983 deficit to 97 billion by 1985 a surplus of 4 2 billion would result let me emphasize once again that fiscal responsibility need not come at the expense of the poor and disadvantaged in our society the republican party platform for 1980 said the measure of a countrys compassion is how it treats the least fortunate yet we now know that this republican administration has systematically dismantled every program which was created to serve our least fortunate under the cbc budget the american tradition of compassion and concern for the needy and destitute would be restored to address the totally unacceptable rate of unemployment among our people the cbc alternative includes 6 billion for a desperately needed jobs program to train and put people who want to work back to work additionally the cbc budget restores funding for important education programs such as title 1 and student financial aid in order to maintain an investment in our human capital and in our future by educating our young people other vital national needs in housing social services and transportation which the reagan budget fails miserably to address are best met under the cbc alternative budget in short there is a way to move this nation toward the goal of reduced inflation without throwing millions of americans out of work there is a way to reduce the federal deficit without taking school lunches away from hungry children and snatching costofliving adjustments from the elderly there is a way to lower interest rates and to restore confidence in our economy without slamming the door on thousands of small businessmen and farmers the way is the fauntroy substitute i have a special concern in the area of health care and waut to discuss with my colleagues the cbc alternative budget proposals in this regard the fauntroy subutitute recommends that 85 5 billion be spent on health care programs in fiscal year 1p83 in order to provide the resources necessary to treat and prevent disease care for sick workers mothers children and the elderly this amount is a full 7 5 billion more than the reagan budget and 5 5 oillion more than the budget committee alternative as cochairman of the congressional black caucus health brain trust i enjoy the benefit of the special expertise of hundreds of experienced health care professionals throughout the country these health care professionals are appalled and rightly so about the ruthless impact of last years budget cuts on the ability of poor and disadvantaged americans to obtain high quality medical care it is all too obvious that the great progress that we have made in the last decade in expanding the availability and affordability of health care from inner city communities to isolated rural towns is swiftly being undermined last year 1 billion was slashed from the medicaid program forcing states to cut benefits and limit eligibility for the poor and working poor as a result over 1 million people lost med icaid coverage virtually all of the losers were women and children in lowincome families thousands of families with incomes at or below the poverty line when faced with overwhelming medical care costs have had to quit their meager paying jobs and go on welfare in order to keep or obtain vital medicaid coverage we believe that it is unconscionable to impose this type of pain and hardship on the poorest and most disadvantaged segment of the population the cbc budget therefore restores those cuts in medicaid imposed last year and maintains a basic level of medicald coverage for the millions of women children and lowincome famtlies who depend upon the government for basic health care similarly the fauntroy substitute restores cuts imposed last year in medicare and rejects any cuts for fiscal year 1983 more than 90 percent of medicare enrollees are senior citizens who have the greatest health care needs in this nation senior citizens have the highest percentage of heart attacks and the greatest number of strokes they are the individuals who for the most part have the greatest incidence of cancer and suffer the greatest incidence of crippling and debilitating disease moreover in addition to being the most sick the elderly suffer the double disadvantage of being sick and poor one out of six senior citizens is poor one out of every two black elderly is poor or marginally poor the cbc finds untenable any proposals which penalize our senior citizens and ask them to use their already limited resources to pay more for medical care the cbc also rejects as foolish and shortsighted any freeze in spendling on such vital health programs as maternal and child health alcohol drug abuse and mental health rervices health manpower and biomedical research additional spending in these areas now only serves to save money in the long run no where is the cost effectiveness of a strengthened federal investment in health care more evident than in the area of biomedical research the economic losses from illness and diseases which we still are unable to prevent and cure run into the billions of dollars last year i had the pleasure of hearing testimony from 10 nobel laureates who spoke about the fact that our nation is becoming scientifically and technologically illiterate they spoke about the need for more funding for biomedical research in order to maintain a leadership position in advancing new knowledge about medical care in order to continue progress in understanding the causes of disease and illness the cbc budget provides additional fundiqg to maintain a strong federal investment in biomedical research let us remember that the debate about health programs and out the larger federal budget is otri simply a debate about numbers and dollars and cents it is about human beingschildren parents elderly it is about their successes and failures it is about their hopes and dreams the cbc budget is an alernative which will allow all america te to enjoy human dignity and a high qusiity of life i urge my colleagues to support the fauntroy substitute"], [0.0035657882690429688, 0.996434211730957, 1, "first of all i would like to commend congressman wyche fowler for providing the time for this much needed discussion of a very critical issue the slaying of over 20 children in atlanta ga is clearly indicative of the sickness which is eroding the fibers of our society violence is becoming more and more a way of life throughout our nation the atlanta slayings and related attacks against children are very cogent symbols that we are moving further away from the highest regard for human life it frightens me deeply to acknowledge the significant psychological damage which is growing among all children due to the recent incidences while the victims of these murders have all been black it is no secret that such acts of violence do not discriminate the fundamental question we must face now is that any child may be forced to live in fear during every phase of a days activity surely the increased number of weaponcarrying schoolchildren momentary periods of panic if a parent is late picking up a schoolchild and decrease in academic achievement are not peculiar to the findings of several atlanta psychiatrists psychologists and mental health officials the feelings of distrust fear and apprehension wih spread among all of our nations children as they begin ti dread functioning in everyday environments this is a sad outlook for our future another fundamental question which is magnifici in the minds of those who fear for human safety is the continuing focus away from human needs we are forced now to question if whether or not the evils of poverty deprivation and unemployment may be so deep rooted in our society that respect for human life becomes secondary to mere survival we are also forced to question the validity of continuous violence as romanticized and glamourized on our television and movie screens the situations in georgia florida maryland and throughout most regions in this country leave us frustrated and angry they leave us to question the basic responsiveness of authorities who must become more adamant in the protection of human lives however they must not lead us to take the law into our own hands the widespread acts of violence must also remind us that the protection and preservation of human lives are crossjurisdictional when as many as 21 lives are lost it cannot be pegged as a state or local government matter both the president and the congress realized this and i laud the dispersal of federal funds to atlanta and the efforts to appropriate 1 5 and 1 8 million for use by this city we have to examine closely the cli mate that motivates and encourages psychotic violence the violence of racism the aforementioned influence of television and movies and the violence of war and militarismall of these inevitably get reflected in individual behavior to a greater or lesser degree he psychotic killers who murder our children in atlanta or any where else are victims of this climate and have apparently been affected to a greater degree we cannot excuse this behavior however we can and must deal squarely with the environment which fosters such actions several sociologists tell us that most of the slain atlanta children come from public housing neighborhoods which are more vulnerable and conducive to human mistreatment abduction and even death such conditions and incidences are not limited to this region of the country right here in washington d c children from lowincome housing projects are becoming more and more susceptible to conditions of drug abuse and molestation here the elimination of unemployment underemployment and poverty must precede the eradication of such criminal acts it is not easy to warn the blacks of atlanta to stay away from theories that the acts of violence against 21 black children are conspiratorial in nature or racially motivated the pattern of systematic murders rapes additional overt and covert actions against black citizens in the south and throughout this country is still just too prevalent however we must assist in the efforts of mayor maynard jackson the numerous task forces and concerned cftizens in addressing the problem in a rational way again until we eliminate the fundamental societal ills we cannot be shocked at deviant behavioral patterns of violence irresponsibility and total disregard for human lives there is little help in calling on citizens to care about each other when increasing inequities among neighborhoods schools living standards and opportunities have become a way of life those of us who are in a position to have impact on public policy must stand firm against further inequities and burdens on our children elderly and lowincome citizens we must promote the kind of solidarity which has been displayed as citizens across the nation have rallied behind the victimized atlanta families most importantly we must not be afraid to oppose and openly attack racism chronic unemployment poverty injustice and other societal ills which cloud any efforts to provide equal opportunities

more serious questioning of another watergate witness george demonstrated his great talent for thinking on his feet and quickly getting to the point at that time president nixons counsel protested that the impeachment hearings were damaging to the presidency george replied that only the president can damage the office of the president what we are doing is protecting the office of the president

deliberately constructed to~help the rich i hope we will not continue down a deadend street of believing in what president reagan calls the magic of the marketplace empirical evidence of six recessions in the postwar period resulting from similar tight monetary and regressive fiscal policies now being pursued documents the fallacy of feeding the fat and starving the lean economics for those who care to think objectively and to heed commonsense i am inserting into the record the report of the national advisory council on economic opportunity a governmental agency which the congress created warning us that the blunderuss budget cuts in social program will lead not to price stability and a sounder economy but more crime poverty welfare dependency and general social and economic chaos the councils statement follows the national advisory council on economic opportunity today sharply criticized the reagan administrations proposed cutbacks in federal incometransfer and antipoverty programs saying that the effect of these cuts will be to cause massive suffering as well as to undermine the work ethic and family life among the poor the administrations proposed cutbacks of these crucial federal programs warned the council in releasing its final report will severely deepen the crisis of poverty in the future and could drive whole segments of our society toward hopelessness and despair instead the report calls for passage of the economic opportunity act and continuation of the legal services corporation two programs that are essential to the wellbeing of the more than 29 million americans still living in poverty in a separate statement arthur 1 blaustein chairman of the council said by separating economic theory from social policy and pursuing the former at the expense of the latter the administration has adopted a strategy of brinksmanship that could lead to social chaos there is a price to be paid for the reduction of human and social services the price is that these cuibicks will not reduce crime they will increase it they will not reduce the use of drugs they will increase it they will not reduce alcoholism they will increase it they will not reduce physical and mental illness they will increase it they will not promote better family life they will destabilize it they will not increase respect for the law they will weaken it at present there exists an air of suspended disbelief over the radical changes that have occurred in the past two months that is because the layoffs the shutdowns the cutbacks and the reduced paychecks have not yet reached ground level but the day of reckoning will come shortly october 1 1981 will be remembered as a day of infamy for it will mark the worst massacre of social and human service programs in american history the report the american promise equal justice and economic opportunity addresses itself specifically to the issues of unemployment inflation women in poverty the implementation of human and social service programs citizen participation and volunteerism and the myths of poverty the 15member council established by congress in 1967 and appointed by the president is responsible for making an annual report to the president and congress on programs and policies aimed at helping the poor it is slated for abolition by this administration attacking what it termed persistent myths about poverty in the united states the council presented evidence that disputed what it termed the mistaken view of some economists that the reduction in the proverty population had been a result of growth ini the private economy the council maintained that for some time such growth has ceased to trickle down to the poor in the farm of more jobs better income and a more rewarding and productive role in society and the council reaffirmed its belief that only those comprehensive and national economic revitalization efforts targeted specifically toward dissadvantaged communities and the jobless would effectively combat poverty in the 1980s a strategy that the administration is abandoning in addition to releasing the report the council issued the following statement seventeen years ago this nation made an historic commitment to reduce if not eliminate poverty in america the economic opportunity act was conceived with moral conviction and dedicated to the proposition that all americans even the 36 million poor were entitled to both opportunity and equal access to the law the act itself called for a national effort to attack the causes of poverty and related social problems which were national in character and scope all the testimony given to the council over the past several years has shown that these federal programs do work that they do help people get out of poverty and that the delivery systems are providing the necessary basic human and social services thus after fifteen years of progress in our nations effort to relieve poverty when in fact the number of poor had by 1980 been reduced by 11 million and millions more have been kept above the poverty line this council is deeply concerned that the process will be reversed by recent policy decisions by the administration that will serve not only to increase the number of poor but to make their burden more severe the three aspects of the administrations economic recovery program that gravely concern the council are 1 the massive acrosstheboard cuts in social and human service programs 2 the abolition of delivery systems provided for in the economnic opportunity act and the legal services corporation act 3 the transfer of federal authority and program responsibility to the states through block grant programs in evaluating the impact of these changes on the poor we believe that each of these decisions taken alone would be painful but taken together they will be absolutely devastating this council under four presidents two republicansand two demo crats has consistently taken the position that the federal government must maintain active responsibility for pursuing the goals of the economic opportunity act this has never beena partisan issue and it should not be one now the council vigorously reaffirms its earlier recommendations that the economic opportunity act and the legal services corporation act should be reauthorized the council is well aware that the economic difficulties facing our nation are complex and often seem overwhelming but these difficulties cannot be used as an excuse for reneging on our social and moral commitments as a nation we are deeply troubled by the notion that national issues ones that require national policy and programs and that are a part of our national purpose should suddenly devolve to the states the issue is not federal versus 9tate responsibility rather it is the dimunition or avoidance of any national standards of responsibility and accountability to deflect suspend or fragment responsibility and accountability suggests that we are either renouncing or failing to assert our moral purpose as a nation worse than that the administration seems to be denying that this moral purpose exists the effect of the block grant proposal as opposed to the economic opportunity act and the legal services corporation act is to destroy existing support systems that are effective that have a proven capacity to deliver services and that utilize local planning and implementation capabilities they are being replaced by a new system that has a poor track record and is restrictively financed more bureaucratic less accountable ans more subject to intense political pressures the last point is extremely important in that effective and efficient use of limited federal funds is in danger of being thwarted by conflicting political interests in each state after reviewing the recent budget process it appears that there has been a massive transfer from basic human and social services to our military budget the council seriously questions whether it is in the national interest to relegate a substantial number and social service programs to the junkpile while we increase the stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction in an arms race where overkill has long been achieved moreover these changes are occuring without any serious national debate when advocates of balanced national priorities are dismissed by the president as representatives of special interests and critics of the administrations policy are referred to as demagogues in criticizing the administrations sharp cutbacks in social programs the councils statement emphasized the negative impact of these cutbacks on work and family life from an administration that places high priority on the importance of faily life and the work ethic it said this budget will be selfdefeating the council cited the following analyses drawn from its own research and other recent studies in support of its statement that these policies will actually encourage dependency instead of work family breakdown instead of family stability the council cited an estimate by the congressional budget office that proposed cuts in public service employment under the comprehensive employment and training act ceta would result in a net loss of between 210 000 and 330 000 jobs in fiscal years 1981 and 1982 causing a sharp rise in expenditures for welfare and unemployment insurance the loss of these jobs the council pointed out would be compounded by cuts in support services which range from child care to mass transit creating a spiral effect that will deal a devastating blow to the realistic job prospects of hundreds of tihousandsof disadvantaged workers the council cited an estimate by the wharton economic forecasting associates that about threequarters of a million jobs would be lost through cuts in ceta alone and an additional million as a result of the administrations program reductions as a whole the council singled out proposed cuts in the aid to families with dependent children afd c program as an example of how the reality of the administrations budget departs from its rhetoric citing independent studies by the congressional budget office and the university of chicagos center for the study of welfare policy the council noted that the bulk of cuts in afdc are concentrated on families who are presently working but do not now earn enough to maintain an adequate living the council pointed out that welfare recipients who work will have their incomes cut by an average of more than 20 percent versus a 4 percent reduction for those who do not work and in some states the administrations proposed changes will eliminate the difference between what an afdc family can receive if no one works and the income it can receive with a fulltime worker noting that this sharply penalizes the working poor the council commented that tile administration apparently feels that only the rich need incentives to work the council said that families with young childrenespecially minority families and families headed by womenwould be among the worst victims of thle hardships imposed by the administrations cuts citing an analysis by the congressional budgct office the council pointed out that of those families that are expected to lose a substantial portion of their spendable income from reductions in public service jobs af dc food stamps and the school lunch program over twothirds are headed by women and almost two out of five are nonwhite referring to thle university of chicago study the council noted that a singleparent faily with two children could lose up to 30 percent of its disposable income from reductions in afdc food stamps and child nutrition programs alone in rejecting the administrations contention that renewed economic growth will eventually trickle down to the poor to offset these losses the council declared that it flies in the face of everything we know about poverty today tile council cited new evidence in this years report affirming that growth in the private economy has had a declining role in reducing poverty and that virtually all of the reduction in poverty since the mid1960s has come about through the expansion of social insurance and incometransfer programs of the kind now under attack by the administration though poverty increased most dramatically in the hardhit declining cities of the northeast and midwest the report says poverty rates also remained disturbingly stable even in those cities characterized by strongoccasionally phenomenalgrowth in jobs and income in short economic growth has had little impact in decreasing poverty rates in recent years even in the boom cities of the southwest the stubborn persistence of poverty in the face of economic growth the council pointed out in its statement results in part from the changing nature of thle poverty population what tile report terms the new poor are increasingly a population of those whom the private economy has passed by even in good times thle council noted these peoplethe aged the disabled disadvantaged youth women heading families with small childrenare rarely hired by the private sector in 1978 a year of economic recovery thle unemployment rate among disadvantaged minority youth was 41 percent among afdc recipients one of the groups most harshly affected by the administrations cuts nearly 70 percent are clilldren more than twothiirdls of them 11 years old or younger among the adults thle overwhelming majority nre women heading fainiliesabout 80 percent of whom are either required as fulltime homemakers disabled or already in training at work or seeking work because few of these people can be absorbed into the private economy without special assistance and support said the council the massive suffering these program cuts will bring cannot be balanced by any credible longrange benefits from the administrations programeven under the hi 6769 most optimistic economic assumptions instead the council declared any economic renewal resulting from the administrations policies would take place at the expense of stable rewarding family lives and genuine work opportunities for the poor and their children mr lllaustein chairman of the council added that we are watching a great tragedy unfurl before us the steady drumbeat of rhetoric emanating from administration officials and shrewdly orchestrated by the white house is intended to create and has heretofore succeeded in creating a counterreality and new myths with respect to social policy for example by continuously referring to economic opportunity and equal justice programs as welfare programs the administration has misled the american public these programs are in fact designed to achieve the opposite to create jobs and economic opportunities and to encourage people who are dependent upon welfare to become productive citizens and taxpayers by seeking to eliminate these programs and substituting its own policies the administration will deny upware mobility to millions on welfare and will force many of the working poor into welfare dependency by shifting program authority from the federal government to the states through block grants the administration has created a bureaucratic nightmare that will result in government by provisional catastrophe by transferring huge amounts of funds from human and social services to defense the administration is not dampening inflation it is fueling it in order to gain support for its economic package the administration has conjured up the specter of an economic dunkirk what it is perpetuating is a social pearl harbor which will have a devastating impact on the poor who are defenseless as well as wiping out the modest gains made in the past fifteen years by women the elderly minorities and the youngthe most vulnerable segments of our society"], [0.003921091556549072, 0.9960789084434509, 1, "i think it is time to put the social security issue into perspective as a result of the reagan administrations scare tactics the public is confused and worried about the future of a program that has provided income security to americans for nearly half a century during his campaign for the presidency mr reagan promised that he would preserve the social security system as a safety net we now see that this was just so much more campaign rhetoric already mr reagan and his chief budget slasher david stockman have succeeded in eliminating the 122 minimum benefit this will hurt nearly 3 million americans at the bottom of the economic ladder now the administration is attempting to panic the congress into making benefits to most americans who have come to believe in the integrity of the system and to rely on it for security the president has proposed cutting 88 billion in early retirement disability and other benefits by 1986 attempting to frighten the american people into believing that the social security system will go broke unless he has his way this is a blatant example of overkill the measures proposed by the white house to protect the social security system it is clear that the president is interested in protecting something other than social security the tax bill that tie stampeded congress into accepting is guaranteed to produce huge budget deficits so he can keep his campaign promise to balance the budget by 1984 there is no question that the gigantic tax cut for the rich will reduce revenues and will require budget cuts beyond anything so far proposed reducing social security benefits is just another way to achieve these cuts some measures must be taken to insure social securitys immediate future but they need not be nearly as drastic as the white house proposes social security supports three separate programseach financed by a separate trust fund they are financed by a payroll tax on earningscurrently 6 65 percent for employees and 6 65 percent for employers up to a maximum of 29 775 a year first there is the old age and survivors insurance program that pays benefits to retired workers and their dependents and survivors next there is the disability insurance program that pays benefits to disabled workers and their dependents finally there is the health insurance program which is part a of the medicare program which pays for doctors bills is finance4 by monthly premiums paid by those enrolled in the program and from general tax revenues because i have encountered considerable confusion regarding some other programs i would like to set the record straight the supplemental security income program which provides a basic level of income for the aged blind and disabled is run by the social security aministration but is not part of the social security program it is paid for by general revenue tax funds and not from any of the social security trust funds a person does not have to work under social security to be eligible for ssi benefits this used to be called the old age assistance program when it was run by the states until a few years ago funds for the aid to the families with dependent children program afdc also come from general tax funds and are in no way related to social security it has surprised me to discover that many people think the programs are somehow related neither is the civil service retirement system related to social security this retirement system is funded by contributions from federal employees who are not covered by social security and matching funds from the employing agencies the social security program does have some problems that must be solved but solutions do not require the kind of severe remedies that the president has proposed in the past few years we have had historically high rates of inflation accompanied by high unemployment moreover wage rates have fallen behind price increases as a result social security has been paying out more and not collecting as much as had been anticipated it is expected that the economic picture will improve and that the social security outlook will brighten as well for the next 30 or 40 years until longrange problems begin to take hold it is apparent to me that this administration wants to mislead the public on the social security issue to achieve its own ends all through the tax debate mr reagan used the most optimistic economic assumptions to argue his case in his social security proposals he uses the very worst economic assumptions he cant have it both ways depending on which he wants to advance i dont want to mislead the people into thinking that there are no problems with the social security program the longrun problems are very serious they result from the fact that the population is aging at a time when the birthrate is declining social security is a payasyougo program where active workers pay the benefits of retired workers it is predicated on an everexpanding work force and today that work force is not growing what the reagan administration wants to do is solve the problems of the next century in the next few years none of us knows what is going to happen in the 21st century as in our private lives most of the things we worry about so much never happen none of us knows what the economic conditions will be like 30 or 40 years from now perhaps we will develop new energy sources that will expand our productive capacity beyond our wildest imagination we would not recklessly leap into solving predicted longrange problems when to do so will cause injury to millions of people right away the president wants to cut billions in benefits out of the program in the near future by discouraging early retirement 55 percent of full benefits rather than 80 percent allowed now at age 62 restricting eligibility for disability insurance limiting benefits to survivors and by taking other steps beyond what is needed it is not necessary to hurt millions of americans now when there is a good chance that such extreme measures will not be needed at allespecially if mr reagans assumptions for economic recovery should prove right in the meantime using the social security system to achieve shortterm economic ends such as a balanced budget is playing recklessly with the future of millions of americans there are a lot of things we can do we can amend the law to permit one fund to borrow from another we can allow the troubled old age and survivor insurance fund to borrow from the healthy medicare fund we can consider financing a portion of social security from general tax revenue funds there is an opportunity as well for creating standby loan authority from general funds whatever changes we decide to make should be thought through very carefully and should take effect sometime in the future we cannot simply say to americans who have spent all their working lives paying into a system that we are going to change the rules and they are going to have to make other arrangements do you say to a man or a woman 55 years old that they are going to have to start some kind of private fund for their retirement how much time do they have to build that fund many people made assumptions about retirement income based on social security they took out private insurance annuities and set up separate savings accounts or made other investments they figured out how much they would need based on how much they could expect from social security it would be heartless and unrealistic now to tell them they will have to find a way to increase their savings in the working years they have left working beyond 62 is fine for those people who want to and are able but recent studies by the social security administrat ion show that only 15 to 20 percent of those who opt out before 65 do so voluntarily most who retire before age 65 do so because of failing health or because they can no longer handle the job pressure in many cases the 62yearold worker who has labored 40 years in the steel mills or the auto plants is worn out if he works until he is 65 he may well be dead maybe that is what the administration is counting on there is something else to consider social security is a compact between the young and the old it was designed for a changing society where it is no longer possible for younger people to assume the responsibility of caring for their aged relatives because of changes in working and living conditions mr reagan wants us to return to the old world even though it is no longer possible if we fail to meet the income and medical needs of the older citizens we inevitably are going to shift this cost to the young who cannot afford it we would also create major problems in private pension funds that are tied to social security workers would demand higher employer contributions to make up the difference putting added pressure on price developments we simply cannot afford to destroy the confidence of a program that is so much a part of our society because we are worried about what might happen 30 or 40 years from nowor because mr reagan has gotten himself into an embarrassing revenue situation as the result of an illconceived tax bill"], [0.004021167755126953, 0.995978832244873, 1, "i want to thank the gentleman from new york for taking this special order to talk about the impact of the federal budget and the budget cuts on children in this country president reagan was right when he spoke the other night and said that millions of americans harbor the simple wish for a safe and financially secure future for their children but in fact the president is deceiving the american people into thinking that his policies will achieve such ends the administration would have us dismantle programs and policies for children and families that took 30 years to develop but on the basis of what evidence would he have us dismantle those programs the administration argued that dismantling these programs will save money but all our evfdence from the wic program for lowincome pregnant women and their infants all the evidence from the fledgling foster care reform program all of the evidence from the 17yearold title i program for educationally disadvantaged children shows just the opposite without these programs of prevention the longterm costs to the american taxpayer would have been far greater the administration argues on the basis of a few anecdotal cases that dramatic funding cuts for these programs will eliminate waste fraud and abuse if the administrations real concern is with the waste fraud and abuse why is there no administration effort to go after waste fraud and abuse in the defense budget just this week it was reported that paul thayer who is chairman of ltv a major ddfense contractor told the president that i have been in the defense contracting for over 30 years and i can tell you that 40 percent of the cost of planes i sell is attributable to redtape bureaucracy and duplicative expenditures forty percent is there a person in this congress who has been hearing lately of 40 percent of social program expenditures that are a result of redtape bureaucracy and duplicative expenditures i do not believe so that has never been alleged in this congress and yet those are the programs that have received the heaviest cuts while the heaviest increases have gone to the pentagon in fadt there has been a careful refinement of those social programs by the congress over the past years which has eliminated untargeted use of funds and abuses by program operators even in the falsely discredited food stamp program which we tend to forget has been the single most important force in eradicating hunger and malnutrition in this country even in this program usdas own figures show that fully 95 percent of the food stamp recipients are in fact eligible recipients the administration also argues that the drastic cuts in social programs are the oni hope for balancing the budget but this is patently false as the omb director stockman so convincingly revealed last year in his interview with the atlantic monthly president reagan is not willing to renege on his commitment to the wealthy individuals and corporations even by closing the huge tax loopholes or by eliminating special interest favors but the president and his advisers apparently have no qualms about breaking decades of commitments to our most valuable and vulnerable americans children and lowincome families it is time to set the record straight the programs this congress created over the past several decades are working they are saving money they are helping children to become productive citizens we did not develop these programs in the first place simply because the congress had nothing to do one day each of these programs was developed in response to some clearly identified need on the basis of extensive investigations and hearings by the congress and as a result of testimony from state and local officials who asked for our guidance and our assistance we made the commitment to those states localities and school districts as well as to the children and the parents they serve they depend on that commitnient on the basis of what evidence would we now throw away 30 years of work in these longstanding programs on the basis of what evidence would we now disinantle a program that brought this country from the depths of the depression to being the richest the freest the strongest the most able country in the history of the world as we are being asked to dismantle these programs let me ask a simple question what is it that we are apologizing for are we going to apologize for having the most successful education system in the entire world for having more young people enrolled in college than any other country for having greater literacy than any other country are we going to apologize for traveling over the best transportation system of any country in the world for cutting down the cost of bringing our goods and services to market are we going to apologize for having the best harbors and networks for the best inland and boat ways of any place in the world are we going to apologize to the millions of americans who had their homes financed by fha by the veterans programs are we going to apologize for the government providing mortgage assistance and other programp for millions of americans are we going to apologize for the fact that even today the government is spending millions of dollars to keep the savings and loans institutions from going broke thirty years ago there would have been a panic if this many savings and loans were on the poor list if this many savings and loans had to merge but it is the federal government that is picking up the pieces to the tune of millions of dollars in just the last few months because of bad management are we going to apologize because the federal government assisted tens of thousands of farmers across this country that created the most productive agricultural system in the world that not only feeds everyone in this country at lowest cost but feeds a good portion of the rest of the world and provides vital foodstuffs for those people on what evidence is one man who comes into office who weekly demonstrates his lack of knowledge of the workings of these programs and others on what evidence is this one man asking us to turn back the clock to go where we were 20 years ago to dismantle the federal government a federal government that has served the people of this country well that has provided nutrition that has provided health care for the elderly for the poor education for our children who is going to educate the next generation of children who is going to provide health care to the next generation of the elderly who is going to finance the next generation of housing the president would have us believe that charity and the private sector would they never have in the past and i do not know why they would start now there is no indication in fact that they plan to i think that as we consider the impact of last years budget cuts and as this congress engages in another round of budget cuts we had better understand the multiple impacts that these cuts start to build on our nations children as we start to cut title xx which provides help for foster grandparents programs and for children awve start to cut the education programs as the gentleman who sits with me on the education and labor committee knows we sat through several hours of hearings this morning with local representatives of the national school boards association and not one of them could tell our committee how education is better today for this nations children than it was a year ago not one of them could provide an example of how we are better serving the children of this country then we were a year ago the question this congress must face and hopefully can be addressed not only in this special order but can be addressed throughout the rest of this year is where is the evidence who can say that life is better for those children than it was a year ago let me remind you that none of those children yet have been proven to be fraudulent have been proven to be wastefull have been proven to abuse the programs that this congress and this couritry designed to help them i think before we go any further this administration has an obligation to the people of this country to show them the evidencenot the hope not the desire not the promises but the hard evidence about how their program will treat children better this year than it did last year and next year better than it did this year because these is no evidence to suggest that that will take place again i want to thank the gentleman from new york who has been deeply involved in trying to provide for those who are less fortunate than the rest of us and who has provided tremendous leadership in this congress on childrens issues every fourth of july the politicians of our country stand up and say children are our most important resource the future of our country if we do not provide for these children the country will not exist in the future if we ignore these resources we will truly be poor i guess they figure on the fourth of july the children are all of a sudden not paying attention because the rest of the year these politicians slash the budgets they ignore the children who cannot vote and so are not listened to but on the fourth of july they look at a child waving the flag and they teil that child you my dear are our worlds most important resource you are the future of our country and then when they come back to washington they ignore it they ignore it time and again and there is no safety net in spite of the presidents rhetorie there is no safety net at this time for the children of

unitedstates legal tender commemorative coins to support the 1984 los angeles olympic games the rule provides for 2 hours of general debate the time is divided equally between the chairman and the ranking minority member of the committee on banking finance and urban affairs the first reading of the bill is dispensed with since the report on the bill has not been available for the required 3 days the rule waives clause 2 1 6 of rule xi againd consideration of the bill ordinarily the rules committee does not look favorably on requests to waive the layover rule however the urgency of establishing the method for the minting and the marketing of these commemorative coins was in the judgment of the committee sufficient to move forward with the bill the banking committee estimates a time lag of at least 1 year for the bidding process to be completed and the coins to be minted and sold each day of delay jeopardizes prospects of making the kind of sales which will genuinely benefit our athletes and the olympic committee the committee substitute will be made in order as an original bill for the purpose of amendment the rule is open so that any amendment germane to the bill will be in order however the rule does specifically make one amendment and one substitute in order it will be in order to consider an amendment printed in the record of may 19 1982 by and if offered by representative st germain it will further be in order to consider an amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in the congressional record of may 19 1982 by and if offered by representative annunzio the rule waives all points of order for violations of clause 5 rule xxi against the committee substitute the amendment and the annunzio substitute each of which contains appropriations language in the section providing for the distribution of funds the rule provides for a motion to reeommit with or without instructions it may seem unusual to consider a rule calling for 2 hours of debate on commemorative legislation however in the committee on rules the gentleman from illinois made an impassioned plea for 1 additional hour of debate in order that he might have ample opportunity to present his case for a different marketing approach to the olympic coins mr annunzio is chairman of the subcommittee on consumer affairs and coinage which reported by a 6 to 0 vote a procedure which varies signifi cantly from the procedure adopted by the full banking committee mr annunzio succeeded in persuading the members of the rules committee that the additional time was essential to fully air the differences of opinion in a manner which is fair to all parties since the members of the house will have sufficient time to consider two very different approaches to the sale of olympic coins i will not devote a great deal of time here to a description briefly the legislation managed on the floor by chairman st germain proposes to mint legal tender coins in 17 emblematic designs the coins would be sold through private marketers selected through a process overseen by the treasury department and allowing for competitive bidding a 30 million guarantee to the olympics is required from any private marketer receipts from sales would be split between the private marketers the los angeles olympic organizing committee laooc and the unitedstates olympic committee the substitute proposed by mr annunzio and reported by the consumer affairs and coinage subcommittee recommends one silver and one gold coin marketing would be accomplished through the mint as opposed to private marketers and through bulk sales only foreign sales would be arranged through private marketers who would be chosen in a competitive bidding process all sales would require a surcharge to be divided equally between the los angeles olympic operating committee and the unitedstates olymplc committee for training and construction of training facilities though there may be disagreement over the best method of marketing an olympic coin there is no disagreement about the importance of minting an olympic coin in july and august of 1984 los angeles will be the site of the xxiii olympiad it will be the first time in half a century that a city in the united states has served as host to this prestigious sporting event and the first time in history any nation has been host to three olympic games over 150 nations throughout the world are planning to compete before a worldwide audience that could number in the billions an olympic coin program is important in two respects the tradition of minting special coins can be traced back centuries to the ancient greeks throughout history special coins played a role in generating enthusiasm and support for the games and more recently have helped fund the staging of the games so that countries from all over the world could participate second the coin program plays an important role in providing support for the training of our athletes this training is a longterm process financial support is critical to our ability to provide american youth of all ages and skills the opportunity to develop their athletic ability and to build the pride

this time tomorrow 29 americans will be killed with handguns by the next day 29 more all told more than 10 000 persons will die this year in the handgun violence that makes many of our streets corridors of terror quite frankly there is no end in sight to the violence and bloodshed that are transforming our neighborhoods into battlegrounds where lawabiding citizens live in fear the fbi statistics tell us what we already know and feelthat violent crime rose by 11 percent and murder increased 9 7 percent in 1979 the fbi also reports that 51 percent of all murders are committed with handguns and that handguns are 21 2 times more likely to be used in murders than any other weapons this is not surprising when we consider that there are roughly 50 million handguns in circulation in our country and about 2 million more are added each year the direct relation between handgun availability and increased violent crime in america cannot be denied nor should it be ignored i pledge all my efforts to work for a sensible solution to stop the handgun deaths and i am urging my colleagues to join with me in this commitment the handgun crime control act of 1981 which i am introducing today is a rational and reasonable attempt to put an end to americas handgun crime it does not curtail the rights of sportsmen or gun collectors in no way does it infringe on the right to keep and bear arms instead it aims to preserve one of our most fundamental rightsthe right to live in a peaceful society my bill which several of my colleagues have cosponsored would accomplish this through a variety of measures first it would place an outright ban on the importation domestic manufacture or assembly or sale of socalled saturday night specials these easily concealable handguns have no sporting purpose and are used only to threaten human life the bill would close the loophole in the 1968 gun control act which banned the importation of saturday night specials but allowed the importation of foreign parts so that thousands of these essentially foreign saturday night specials are assembled and sold here in america other larger handguns could still be sold but handgun manufacturers dealers and owners would have to become more accountable for these deadly weapons through stricter recordkeeping no person would be permitted to purchase more than two handguns in a single year a 21day waiting period would be required for any person wishing to buy a handgun so that states can guard against selling a handgun to a minor a criminal or a mental incompetent pawnbrokers would be forbidden to sell handguns handgun owners would be responsible for reporting the theft or loss of their handgun under penalty of law the bill also provides mandatory minimum prison sentences of 2 years for the first offense and 5 years for the second offense for using or carrying a firearm during the commission of a felony i have included mandatory minimum sentences in the bill because i believe this is one element in our overall attack on handgun violence mandatory minimum sentences alone certainly cannot be considered an effective solution to the handgun problem also many states have enacted tough gun control laws but their effectiveness has been stymied by the ease with which handguns are transported from one state to another the only truly effective solution to curbing handgun crime is a national law that keeps saturday night specials off the streets and provides a uniform standard of accountability across the nation for the owiership distribution and transportation of handguns i refuse to accept the notion that opposing sides on this issue cannot find a common ground on which to base a rational effective national handgun policy perhaps we really are not at irreconcilable crosspurpose although the salvos of blunderbuss rnetoric may have obscured this possibility i think there is substantial agreement for instance that we all want to separate criminals from their guns that is what my bill is designed to do i think there is widespread acceptance of the concept that we put in jail those who commit serious crimes with handguns my bill provides for such punishment i would like to believe that we might also come to terms on two key provisions of my proposals the total ban on saturday night specials and the waiting period for anyone wishing to buy a handgun the former would stop the trafficking in handguns that are useless for anything other than to frighten threaten maim or kill the latter would at the very least make it possible to keep some handguns away from those who we all agree should not have them at the same time those who could legitimately possess a handgun would not be denied one of course i am not so naive as to believe that the policy i propose will work to perfection but it will save lives of that i am certain neither am i so unrealistic as to imagine that any possible accommodation will be easily achieved or totally satisfactory there are views deeply rooted and strongly and sincerely held on both sides of this issue the divisions are deep but it seems to me that if we as a nation can negotiate arms limitation with another country whose ideology and society are completely foreign to ours we ought to be able to come to an understanding on a way to limit arms in our own society it is time that we stopped shouting slogans and counterslogans at one another we who propose a national handgun policy have been accused of kneejerk response whenever a shooting tragedy or near tragedy occurs if that is true i would suggest that the response of the opponents to these proposals has seemed the same the violence in our streetsthe fear the deathdemands that we give our citizens something more than reflex reaction we must have a reasoned response we all want to stop the killing we all want to end the reign of terror by criminals in our society my bill is a vehicle toward that end i look forward to discussions with those who would challenge my views jack kennedy said that we must never negotiate out of fear but never fear to negotiate i suggest that the fear of violence and slaughter demands that we negotiate a reasonable solution to the handgun crime problem we must find a common ground to prevent our society from turning into a killing ground the american people have recognized the close relationship of handgun availability and crime for miiny years in fact since the 1930s public opinion polls have shown that the majority of americans favor stricter controls on the availability and use of handguns a 1980 gallup poll stated that 59 percent of all americans want stricter laws covering the sale of handguns it is time that we in congress find a way

first of four budget resolutions made in order by the rule governing house concurrent resolution 115the first concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1982 the fauntroy amendment in the nature of a substitute is the constructive alternative budget resolution fashioned by the 18 members of thecongressional black caucus of the house of representatives it is the one budget resolution among the four to be considered by the house which responds most succinctly and directly to the mandate given the congress and the president by the american people on november 4 1980 of the four alternatives before us it does the best job of eliminating deficit spending reducing the level of federal spending providing tax relief to the american people and spurring jobs and economic recovery for american businesses and american workers the 18 members of the congressional black caucus are now about to detail for your consideration and debate a resolution that balances the budget in fiscal year 1982 which indeed offers the american people a 7 85 billion surplus instead of the 50 4 deficit that the reaganstockman proposal imposes upon us it is a budget that spends 7 95 billion less than djes the reaganstockman proposal it in a budget resolution that offers the american people 56 4 billion in tax cuts nearly 2 billion more in tax relief than does the reagan stockman proposal and we do it in a fashion that will not concentrate 80 percent of the business and industry tax incentives among the major corporations while providing only 20 percent of the tax relief to the small businesses of the nation which account for 48 percent of private sector gross national products and employ 80 percent of the working people of the country i want you to pay particular attention to the presentations of representative ranoel and representative ford on the tax package that is part of this resolution for it goes to the heart of why we are able to respond best to the mandate of the american people the american people want a new beginning but not a new beginning that is business as usual what good is a socalled tax cut that does not deal with bracket oreep that keeps throwing american workers into higher and higher tax brackets with no real increase in income the reagan proposal continues business as usual inthis regard the congressional black caucus budget resolutionalone among the alternativesgives us a new beginning by correcting bracket creep and returning 17 billion to the american people in tax relief the reaganstockman proposal gives the american taxpayers business as usual when it fails to take into account the increased social security payments that american wage earners and businesses will have to pay this year the cbc budget gives the amer1can taxpayer and small businesses a new beginning a 10percent tax credit on social security payments that returns 10 8 billion zo the american employee and another 7 2 billion to the businesses of our country the 10percent a year acrosstheboard tax cut proposal of the reagan administration is more of the same old thing it will have the average worker earning 15 000 a year paying 93 more in federal taxes by 1984 while the twotenths of 1 percent of the people who earn 200 000 a year will have the government return nearly 20 000 a year to them the american people voted for a new beginning not more of the same old thing with respect to the budget and tax policies of this nation they voted for a balanced budget and reduced federal spending and tax relief not for a legalized raid on the treasury by rich individuals and multinational corporations that will rob the people of 220 billion a year in tax revenues by 1986 they voted for a strong america not an america weekened by throwing 1 1 million people out of work which the reagan human needs budget cuts alone would do in fiscal year 1982 and the fauntroy amendment gives them that they voted for a just and compassionate america not a callous america that would deny a 1 5 billion free lunch to hungry children while continuing a 3 billion free lunch program for the rich that we call the three martini lunch deduction the fauntroy amendiment gives the amerncan people what they voted for it is living proof that the budget can be balanced government spending decreased and tax relief given without necessarily cutting back before yielding to my colleagues in the congressional black caucus to provide you more of the details of our constructive alternative budget resolution let me say three things about this budget resolution that the democraitic study group described as the substitute that takes the boldest step of any proposal being offered to the house to deal with the federal deficit that offers the largest and fairest tax cut of any of the proposals before the house and that accomplishes all of this without hurting other important national programs the first is that while the fauntroy amendment in the nature of a substitute is authored by black legislators it is not a program for black people only the most serious problems confronting this nation just happen to be reflected most acutely in the black experience this is a program for all americans the elde ly on limited income most of whom are white the struggling young couples all over the nation who want but cannot find affordable housing anywhere most of whom are white the coal miners whose black lung benefits are being threatened most of whom are white young people from low and middleincome families who would be denied guaranteed student loans and basic opportunity grants for higher education most of whom are white the sick the cold the hungry the handicapped most of whom are white and all of whose burdens will be made heavier by the grammlatta budget proposal thus the solutions we seek are not for black people only but solutions that will benefit all americans black and white together young and old together rich and poor together protestant catholic jew and gentile together the second thing i want to point out is that our constructive alternative budget is based on a different assessment of the root cause of the problem we are experiencing in our domestic economy and the arena of world affairs than that of the reagan administration a in the area of the economy we maintain that inflation unemployment and loweconomic growth are not caused by government spending government taxation and government regulation as the administration would have us believe imprudence in each of these areas contributes to our economic woes and we are as determined as president reagan to sort out waste fraud and abuse at all levels of government expenditures but the fact is that our economic woes have nothing to do with the fact that we provide food stamps for the hungry medicaid for the sick housing for the poor and public service employment for the jobless our economic difficulties are rooted in the fact that other people are making better mousetraps nowadays our difficulties are rooted in the fact that over the past 15 years or more we have had a steady decline in economip performance in manufacturing output in product design and in productivity in sector after sector we are producing insufficient quantities of poorly designed products at too high a price when you do that not only does the world not buy what we make but we do not buy what we make this is best illustrated by an experience which i had a few months ago looking for a christmas gift for my young son marvin he said he wanted a portable radio for christmas i went to one of our local department stores and saw on the shelf a portable radio by rca amfm 87 i was about to purchase it when i noticed on another shelf something called sanyo it said amfm radio three speakers and tape recorder 47 now i love america and i have sense enough to know that when i purchase american made products i am sustaining jobs for americans but when i saw something better for less i must candidly admit that i bought the sanyo and i did it not because i like strange sounding names but because it was a better mousetrap the problem with our economy is that most americans are doing just what i did we are buying datsun toyota kawasaki suzuki honda yamaha panasonic sony seiko nikon and pentax that is our problem and it will not be solved by denying students basic opportunity grants or poor children free lunch or the elderly poor medicaid the problem is that we are losing market shares in the world at large as well as at home the consequence is rising unemployment inadequate profits and therefore reduced investments still worse productivity a falling dollar and still worse inflation our goal therefore must be to restore productivity the competitiveness of unitedstates industry and our other major economic sectors in both domestic and world markets to do this we must undertake the most fundamental reassessment of our economic structure since 1932or perhaps of all time as our colleague representative augustus hawkins has repeatedly pointed out and will do so again today to remedy that problem we must begin to implement the policies called for in the humphreyhawkins full employment and balanced growth act the third thing i should like to say is that the congressional black caucus makes a different assessment of what our problems are in the areas of world affairs our view is that our problems in 1hternational affairs do not lend themselves to military solution they are social economic and political in nature and thus we have emphasized a strong national economy and food and technical assistance as the primary weapons in the arsenal for our confrontation with soviet russia we favor improved national security but without wasteful military spending our budget as representative dellums will point out today calls for defense of our nation not domination of the world our emphasis on the area of foreign affairs must be for example upon development aid and technical assistance to nations like zimbabwe so that mr mugabe may build roads from the chromium mines to the sea where we can buy it sail it to detroit and make a kcair that goes a longer way to empty than does datsun that is what we need to be doing finally our speaker of the house thomas tip oneill has prominently displayed on a desk in his office in the capitol a quote from hubert humphreys last speech on capitol hill on november 17 1977 i think that quote summarizes the choices we must make this week on our budget resolutions he said the moral test of government is how it treats those who are in the dawn of life the children those who are in the twilight of life the aged and those who are in the shaows of life the sick the needy and the handicapped the three other choices before you this week fail the moral test of government the fauntroy amendment in the nature of a substitute which we now detail for you passes that test with flying colors i yield for the distinguished gentleman from new york to open our presentation of the details of our proposal"], [0.004278421401977539, 0.9957215785980225, 1, "i rise richment equipment

with providing them with any military or an aid program to countries that re economic aid was a failure it simply has not worked but we do believe that i there is at least a very strong possibil g ity that if we provide pakistan with a significant military and economic aid package we will be able to persuade s them to refrain from taking the next step which would be the detonation of a nuclear device particularly if wec make it clear that should they explode such a device they would probably lose the benefit of the military and economic aid we are about to authorize so in our view the adoption of this amendment would actually strengthen our nonproliferation objectives visavis pakistan by putting us in a much stronger position to persuade pakistan not to take the next step in its nuclear development plans which would be the explosion of a nuclear device which if it took place could have very destabilizing consequences for the entire subcontinent in global terms however this amendment would significantly strengthen our nonproliferation objectives in a number of other vital respects first of all in addition to the existing restrictions on american aid which prohibit military or economic assistance to countries that receive enrichment equipment receive reprocessing equipment or detonate a device we add two new restrictions on aid to countries that either transfer at nuclear weapon to a third country or nations that receive a nuclear device from another country furthermore we also provide that any country which detonates a nuclear device transfers a nuclear device or receives a nuclear device would not only have any new aid terminated but would also lose whatever aid was in the pipeline third we also strengthen our nonproliferation objectives by providing that the presidential waiver contained in the law can only be utilized with respect to those countries that detonate a device transfer a device or receive a device under extraordinary circumstances finally we significantly strengthen our nonproliferation objectives by providing that if the president because he believes it is in the national interest to do so waives the restriction on aid to a cquntry that receives nuclear enriched equipment receives nuclear reprocessing equipment explodes a nuclear device transfers a nuclear device or receives a nuclear device the congress

risked his own life to try to save so many jewish lives from nazi extermination a number of bills have been introduced over the years to confer honorary citizenship on various persons but the only successful effort to date related to sir winston churchill the conferral of honorary citizenship on raoul wallenberg however will not establish a precedent for similar action on behalf of a number of other heroic figures the fact that our action today will not serve as such a precedent is clear for a number of reasons raoul wallenbergs valiant efforts to save thousands of jews from the holocaust provide an appropriate basis for distinguishing this bill from bills introduced on behalf of others conferral of honorary citizenship on wallenberg unlike any other honorary citizenship bill congress has considered heretofore will symbolize our commitment as a nation to remember the holocaust and vigilantly guard against the possibility of any recurrence congressman lan~os who introduced this joint resolution testified before the subcommittee on immigration refugees and international law thatwe need to establish a clear record for posterity that america through wallenberg did act to prevent the holocaust in its final days during the subcommittee hearings i requested congressman lirrros to develop this idea further and place mr wallenbergs actions in the context of other actions or even inaction by the united states to prevent the holocaust congressman lairros answer i believe should be brought to the attention of the house and for that reason i will quote from it at some length it is important to underscore that wallenberg was not a diplomat wallenberg was a young man living in the comfort and safety and affluence of neutral stockholm during the brutal closing days of world war 11 he left behind a most promising career as the son of swedens most prominent family the safety the security the comfort of stockholm to voluntarily assume the task of saving human lives so raoul wallenberg did not think of this mission himself this was not an activity that stemmed from his own plans it was a mission that he tundertook at the specific request of the secretary of state of the united states the united states thtrefoe bears a very heavy responsibility for the untold numbers of years that this young swede spent under the nightmarish conditions of the gulag archipelago whether he died earlier or whether he is alive today it is we the united states who are responsible for his tragedy and for his lost life a great deal of criticism has emerged over the course of years concerning the failure of the western powers to act in decisive ways to stop the slaughter questions such as why werent the railroads bombed why wasnt there an attempt to liberate the camps earlier here is a tangible demonstration that the united states officially acted and successfully acted to save approximately 100 000 people our record for world war ii is a better record because of the actions of raoul wallenberg undertaken at our own behest honorary citizenship is singularly appropriate in the wallenberg case not only because of the place the holocaust occupies in the history of human depravity and our national commitment to the survival of the jewish people the fact that wallenberg acted at the behest of the united states and suffered untold misery as a result of it establishes our interest as a nation in giving this special recognition to him the soviet union in addition never satisfactorily has accounted for what happened to mr wallenberg the conferral of honorary citizenship on him may give the united states added leverage with the soviet union in determining whether he is still alive and possibly in securing his release honorary citizenship is exactly what its designation impliesnamely an honor that does not confer on either mr wallenberg or any members of his family any rights or privileges under the immigration and nationality act the concept of honorary citizenship must be distingished clearly from citizenship itself no member of mr wallenbergs family as a result of our action today can possibly claim any derivative rights under our laws even mr wallenberg himself will not be recognized as an american citizen under united states domestic law or under international law if he is found to be still alive conferral of honorary citizenship in no way can be described as giving away anything tangible the meaning and significance of our action today is entirely symbolicbut it is a critically important symbolic gesture in an age when many nations treat human life so cavalierly a few of the statements in the legislative record underscore the critical significance of the step we are about to take today secretary of state alexander m haig jr said that mr wallenbergs contribution during the dark days or world war ii in hungary stands out as a beacon to all those who respect human rights and dignity he expressed his full support for this legislation assistant secretary of state richard fairbanks informed the judiciary committee thatthe conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would serve to underscore the seriousness with which the american government and people view sovietbehavior in the wallenberg case conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would also serve to reaffirm to the government of sweden that the united states firmly supports the quest to resolve wallenbergs fate former secretary of state edmund muskie informed two subcommittees of the house committee on foreign affairs that the chronological record of state department and war refugee cables and conmnunications 0 documents the unitedstates governments position of responsibility for the selection of wallenberg the directive and funding for his activities the appreciation for his work and the deep distress over his disappearance mr muskie concluded that its isthe uniqueness the extraordinary link between a man raoul wallenberg and our nations conscience that makes this action appropriate mr muskie went on to say raoul wallenbergs mission on behalf of the united states behind nazi lines in world war ii was without precedent what hie accomplished on our behalf risking his own life to save the lives of tens of thousands of people is unparalleled in our history the cost to him the years of his life can never be repaid the action of bestowing honorary citizenship on wallenberg undertaken by the congress of the united states will recognize his humanitarian sacrifice under our direction this is an important part of american history this adoption of raoul wallenberg as our own citizen makes clear to our posterity that the american government did act to save lives threatened by the holocaust i can add nothing further to the eloquent statements submitted by numerous witnesses before subcommittees of both the committee on foreign affairs and the committee on the

that this bill despite the claims of its sponsors mandates the secretary of agriculture to take away limited research and extension funds from highpriority programs of the department of agriculture the state agricultural experiment stations and the state cooperative extension services and directs that these funds be placed into the relatively low priority research programs mandated by this legislation and i might add that since we removed the specific authorization sections from the bill in committee we really do not have any figures to say how much this bill is going to cost and how much damage we are going to ou to our highpriority agricultural research and extension programs i ask the question how much is this bill going to cost our estimates show that as a minimum the bill is going to cost 2 000 000 in research funds 1 250 000 in extension costs to establish and administer the six pilot programs mandated in this bill and much more to recruit train and pay the travel for an unspecified number of volunteers to advise family farmers and other producers all over this country on organic farming techniques my bet is this bill is going to cost upwards to 5 00 000 a year now what programs are we going to cut to implement this bill at usda or at the state level because that is how we are going pay for this program are we going to cut it from the agricultural research services which conduct basic agricultural research programs or the animal health and protection research program or range and pasture research or the national plant germ plasm research program or the tropical and subtropical research program or the research on acid rain precipation program or research on soil and water conservation or human nutrition research or are we going to raid the hatch act which funds each states agricultural research program or the mcintirestennis forestry research program or the special research programs to states for specific state commodity research grants or are we going to take it from the state cooperative extension program i think it is important to note that the house committee on agriculture and the house appropriations subcommittee on agriculture and related agencies have for years been fighting to increase appropriations for agricultural research and extension only with the passage of title xiv to the 1977 and 1981 farm acts were we really able to get the executive branch to consider even a minute increase in the specific aspects of the agricultural research and extension budget ironically we have a slight increase in the fiscal year 1983 budget for highpriority agricultural research programs i also think it is important to consider this additional fact the organic farming proposal espoused in the bill before us today did not appear one time in the recommendations in the annual reports to the president and the congress of the national agricultural research and extension users advisory board during the last 4 years for the edification of my colleagues this board made up of the users of agricultural research that is the producers processors consumers environmentalists rural representatives and labor representatives is charged by law with duty uf recommending research and extension project directions to the secretary of agriculture neither did the joint council on food and agricultural sciences made up of research scientist at the federal and state level consider organic farming as a subject of specific concern this bill then flies in to the face of traditional project programing it makes a mockery out of our efforts to concentrate our efforts on highpriority research and protect potentially high payoff projects during periods of government belt tightening that we find ourselves in today i think we need to make one point extremely clear here today organic farming is not new research thomas jefferson and george washington practiced organic farming 200 years ago it served the country well then when most people lived on farms we could afford to practice this technique when we did not have many mouths to feed but today we only have a little over 2 million farmers and ranchers and their responsibility has risen from feeding their own family to feeding over 75 people per farm today most farmers use the best aspects of organic farming such as minimum tillage animal manures and integrated pest management systems we need to advance our research on the best aspects of organic farming and usda is spending over 50 million this year in this direction in modernized versions of the art practiced by washington and jefferson the art of organic farming the knowledge of it is being passed on today from father to son as it always has been additionally clubs and groups are passing on this knowledge mostly to suburban gardening groups i practice a form of it myself in my own garden down in bristol recently usda began gathering information on this ancient technique and will complete its literature

with the understanding that mr mccurdy will accept my amendment concerning the waiver provision for sars the mccurdy amendment as amended by my amendment will have the effect of increasing congressional awareness of weapons costs while insuring that the department of defense is not forced to prepare the 100 or more sars that would be required by the increase in the sar dollar thresholds

unacceptable cost increases and schedule slippages the mccurdy amendment incorporates the provisions of the nunn amendment and prbvides for exception reporting when there is a cost overrun of more than 15 percent the amendment also provides for 1 yearly sar of a comprehensive nature to be complemented by quarterly sars when problems develop in weapons systems finally the amendment eliminates

there has been much discussion about new methods to impede the flow of illegals into the country there has been a relatively small amount of discussion on the equally important issue of how to reform and expedite the processes of exclusion and deportation of those aliens who have already set foot on our soil today i am introducing the immigration court and procedure reform act of 1982 which is a bill designed to expedite exclusion deportation and political asylum cases while enhancing due process for aliens and providing a judicial forum for these matters i am pleased to report that all of my colleagues from my home state of florida from both political parties have joined with me as original cosponsors of this bill the act establishes under article i of the constitution a court of record known as the unitedstates immigration court with a trial division composed of 50 judges and an appellate division composed 7 judges all of whom are to be appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the senate for terms of office of 15 years the trial division of the court is given exclusive jurisdiction of deportation exclusion and rescission of adjustment of status cases under the immigration and nationality act the appellate division has exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine appeals from final decisions of the trial division and certain final adjudicatory decisions of the immigration and naturalization service as well as final decisions of asylum officers who are established in a separate provision of the act to determine claims for political asylum an asylum officer will be an immigration officer designated by the attorney general to carry out this specialized task in order to get the other federal courts out of their involvement and streamline the process of deportation exclusion and political asylum provision is made in this bill giving the immigration court exclusive jurisdiction for habeas corpus and other extraordinary writs and for all injunctive and declaratory relief with respect to deportation exclusion asylum or any other matter concerning the status of an alien or his detention under this bill with the exception of the supreme court no federal court outside of the immigration court will any longer be able to be brought into these matters the most common tactic for delay will be eliminated the current procedures for dealing with matters of exclusion and deportation and political asylum area a hodgepodge of statutory and regulatory devices which have failed miserably under pressure of the everincreasing volume of such cases in recent years and the intervention of unitedstates district courts it is common knowledge that in the last few years we have had thousands upon thousands of aliens entering our country without obtaining passports or visas or other documentation permitting them entry under color of law most of these people come from economically oppressed countries and many have come from countries which are politically oppressive as well the orderly process of immigration set up under the immigration and nationality act has long since broken down and nowhere has the breakdown been more evident than in the handling of deportation exclusion and political asylum matters once an undocumented alien has crossed into this country he is subject to deportation if on the other hand such an undocumented alien is apprehended at a border or port of entry or coming off a plane he is subject to an exclusion process in either case the alien may seek political asylum in this country under the refugee relief act of 1980 and the united nations convention relating to the status of refugees by claiming that he is in danget of political or religious persecution if march 1 1982 co he is returned to the country from which he came determinations in such matters are made by the attorney generalor his designees or statutorily created immigration a id special inquiry officers who are employees of the immigration and naturalization service under the department of justice under varying circumstances there is the involvement of the state department and federal district courts the process is so intertwined and complex that an alien or his attorney with a little imagination can easily make a mockery of the system and delay the process for years if these matters were only an occasional occurrence the problem would not be nearly so grave however the magnitude of the problem can be easily seen by examining state department statistics which show that in 1971 state was requested by the immigration service to give its views on political asylum claims on 441 occasions compared to 1 616 requests in 1977 over 15 000 requests in 1980 and well in excess of 20 000 in 1981 these figures are even more startling in light of the fact that the state department is not required to give its view in all politial asylum cases and the immigration service says that it has not begun to scratch the surface of the number of claims lying in wait when it has the manpower and mechanisms in place to begin rounding up the thousands of aliens who are known to be here illegally but who are not detained or in the active pipeline for being removed from the country another example of the gravity of this matter can be found by looking at the exclusion process involving the haitians in my home state of florida last summer at one point in miami from june 1 1981 to june 4 1981 a total of 140 exclusion cases were heard by two special inquiry officers of the immigration and naturalization service of this number 96 received final orders to be removed from the country but only 11 were actually returned to haiti lawyers had successfully gotten a court injunction from a federal district court on the basis of alleged irregularities in the process a massive effort at exclusion proceedings is now underway again in miaml to clear the famed krome detention center and we can only hope that the extraordinary steps taken to get all the parties working together including the federal district court will make this effort successful where the other earlier one failed not only must we be concerned about the processing of

with seven of my colleagues i am introducing the petroleum disruption management act legislation designed to prevent or lessen varying degrees of petroleum disruptions there is an essential need for this legislation the expiration of the emergency petroleum allocation act of 1973 on september 30 of this year will leave a gaping hole in our ability to respond to emergency petroleum shortages unless a new and better national program is substituted for the epaaone that eliminates many of the former statutes shortcomingswe will be faceed with a multitude of state emergency plans which could in fact work to our disadvantage and actually exacerbate a potential regional or national petroleum disruption currently all is well on the petroleum supply front crude oil and petroleum products are plentiful however the glut of crude oil and products has given us a false sense of security the vast majority of energy experts view the glut as only a temporary phenomenon we will undoubtedly have another petroleum crisis it behooves us therefore to address the issue of emergency energy contingency planning particularly now that the political environment is calmer and the opportunity for a more thoughtful and effective approach is available if we wait until we are in the midst of another energy crisis to develop an emergency petroleum policy the result will be quite the opposite of what we want a crisis atmosphere may lead to the development of bad legislationlegislation that could likely result in stricter federal measures than perhaps are necessary instead we need to develop legislation now that will help minimize regional shortages before they become national crises while at the same time providing the president with authorities to deal with a national energy emergency the intent of the legislation is to give the president the flexibility and the necessary management tools to deal with petroleum disruptions in a timely and effective manner the options outlined in this bill would allow the marketplace to work to the maximum extent possible so that we do not have to depend on massive regulatory action by the federal government to find solutions to energy disruption problems the bill would require the president for instance to submit a report on the advisability of using tax incentives to encourage refiners to stockpile crude oil and products during periods of surplus more importantly it would require the president to develop four management programs which when approved by congress would be placed on the shelf for selection at a later time they would be removed for implemenjuly 28 1 981 tation only upon approval by congress the programs would be designed to address particular kinds of disruptions ranging from substantial regional shortages to severe national emergencies the four programs are based on the following first use of the strategic petroleum reserve second use of private dedicated reserves third implementation of national crude oil sharing and fourth use of petroleum product management techniques the first management tool would be used to deal with either regional shortages of a lesser magnitude or fullblown national emergencies to address either kind of situation the department of energy would be authorized to sell oil from the strategic petroleum reserve upon determination by the president of the need to respond to an imminent or existing disruption the second tooluse of private dedicated reserveswould serve as a transition program to deal with regional problems until the strategic petroleum reserve was filled to a desirable level the pdr would give regional refiners access to crude oil it would be operated as a limited exchange program between designated refiners with adequate supplies and qualified refiners who because of the disruption would be forced to operate below the national utilization rate to be eligible to receive crude oil from designated refiners those qualified refiners would be required to meet specified standards such as retrofitting their refineries having the capability to process heavy or sour crude oil and maintaining specified inventories as a result inefficient refiners would be prevented from gaining access to crude oil an exceptions procedure would allow other refiners to qualify for crude oil on a casebycase basis the third techniquea national crudeoilsharing programis designed to meet a severe national shortage refiners operating above the national average would be required to share crude oil with those refiners operating below the average the final techniquethe petroleum product management programwould only be used as a last resort in the event that all other management tools failed to produce an acceptable result the president would have the flexibilty to deal with an extreme emergency as he saw fiteiither by using price and allocation controls a national rebate program or any other plan he found acceptable at the time to the maximum extent possible the plan would be designed to protect the following public health safety and welfare national defense the maintenance of public services and the maintenance of agricultural operations related to the production processing and distribution of food a strong point of the legislation is its avoidance of a statistical trigger for the implementation of any of the management plans anyone who has studied the issue of contingency planning has found that it is virtually imposible to develop such a trigger given the vast array of potential regional and national shortage situations the most realistic and effective trigger is a political one key language in the bill would require the president and congress to act in concert in implementing one of the management programs at the same time the bill would automatically sunset the activating resolutions within 120 days unless reauthorized by congress thereby avoiding longterm government involvement in developing his contingency plans and in responding to petroleum disruptions the president would benefit from the advice of a cabinetlevel emergency energy council and energy advisory committee composed of industry representatives consumers and petroleum users the energy advisory committee in particular could be used to persuade industry to manage regional shortages thereby preventing the implementation of any of the four standby management plans this bill with its focus on sequential management sends the right signals to the country it asks government to develop a feasible plan during a noncrisis situation it asks the private sector to depend on selfhelp measures to meet its basic energy needs warning private industry not to expect a massive bailout by uncle sam in par ticular it tells small and independent refiners to retrofit and sour up if they want to become eligible for crude oil sharing during a disruption it builds tension into the system to prevent escalation to the final stage of sequentlil management by giving the advisory councils an opportunity to use jawboning and other measures short of federal intervention to solve disruption problems it only supplements the marketplace to protect national secarity public safety and health and our agricultural community and finally while it does give the president discretionary authorities to act during an emergency the authorities can be used only with the cooperation of congress during the spring of 1979 my home state of iowa and most of the midwest for that matter experienced severe shortages of diesel fuel yet the nation as a whole did not since fuel was in generally plentiful supply this is the kind of problem that i believe will be more typical of the energy problems that we will experience in the future while the diesel fuel shortages of 1979 gave the appearance of being a national problem they were in fact only characteristic of a regional disruption the 1979 experience highlights the fact that rural america is particularly vulnerable to supply disruptions when supplies get tight those refiners serving rural markets tend to be the first ones to feel the pinch because they are the ones who are crude deficient had we had a petroleum disruption management act on the books during the spring of 1979 i feel confident the high spot market prices and the shortages we experienced would have been prevented and they would have been prevented without massive government intervention i believe the concept of sequential management is an innovative and a realistic approach to a very tough issue i believe this bill can serve as a starting point as we study contingency planning issues and reach agreement on a suitable replacement for the emergency petroleum allocation adt i urge my colleagues to join with me by cosponsoring this legislation a fact sheet on the bill follows petroleum disrupton management act or purpose provide president with flexibility and management tool s to deal with

confusion in the marketplace which might come about over the uncertainty of how silver will be procured to accommodate the minting of commemorative coins to help raise money for the 1984 olympics the amendment simply says that in procuring silver to comply with the olympic coin act the secretary of the treasury shall use only silver from the treasury or other federally held stocks as opposed to going out on the open markets to procure what is need6d to mint the commemorative coins as my colleagues know i have over the years repeatedly pointed to the surplus of government silver my latest figures show that the treasury department alone has approximately 38 8 million ounces of silver in its stockpile while other sectors of the federal government have another 140 million plus ounces as long as this quantity of silver is sitting around it is serving no purpose we all remember back when the price of silver soared and along with that drastic price rise a corresponding leap took place in the prices of consumer products which contain silver such as medical and dental supplies photographic equipment electrical equipment and silverware an incursion into the market by the government at this time while not producing drastic price rises is unnecessary and could certainly send prices up to some degree the notion that the government might go into the private markets to procure silver could produce conditions of uncertainty which we do not need at this time therefore in the interest of market stability i urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment to give some assurance that the treasury will use government stocks of silver for the olympic commemorative coins"], [0.9903501868247986, 0.9903501868247986, 0, "i want to thank the gentleman for yielding i intend to speak on all of

gentleman for yielding further to me there is no little irony in the fact that it was the republican party in 1928 led by its candidate herbert hoover who built into its platform what became the smoothawley tariff act of 1930 which was a onethird as i understand it in crease in tariffs as the gentleman pointed out interestingly in that congress after hoovers election and it was a republican congress the debate over smoothawley was not unlike the debate over what we are going through today there were amendments all over the lot and the smoothawley bill was not going anywhere until the northeastern members of the congress joined in and decided to do for the northeastern manufacturing what the republican midwestern members were trying to do for agriculture if you go back and look at the stock market crash of 1929 there is an inextricable link i believe between the debate on the amendments as they came to the floor and were passed in 1929 and 1930 and the crash of the stock and equity values forecasting the drop in world trade and the contraction of the economy which followed my friend the gentleman from california is doing the house a great service indeed he is doing the people of the country a great service by bringing this to their attention i want to remind my colleague that the bill was signed in 1930 but its most important provisions were passed in october of 1929 indeed they passed at the very same time that the market crashed there are people and i am one of them who believe that the drop in equity value preceding the drop in trade was a response to the tremendous increase in tariffs not only on agriculture but on manufacturing is it any coincidence that the stock market has dropped 30 points only yesterday and today i would say parenthetically that when the congress passed the smoothawley tariff act almost every reputable economist every finance minister in the world begged president hoover not to sign the bill and when he said he might not sign it the stock market recovered about 80 percent of its value from october of 1929 and that crash on into june of 1930 and then hoover signed it and the stock market crash of june 1930 was almost as great as the stock market crash of within weeks i would say to my friend the gentleman from california every single nation in europe raised its tariffs to match the tariffs of the united states and the world contraction resulted we went into a terrible deficit taxes were raised by president hoover and the congress monetary policy tightened in response to the money panic and we went into the terrible depression why do i bring it up to demonstrate by history that this is not a jobs bill this is going to destroy jobs it is not easy for me to speak on this issue but i think it is important that we establish some legislative history here because it is going to como back in the next congress i represent an auto town a steel town buffalo n y we have high unemployment my heart goes out to the people who have had their lives and their families and their economic for tunes dislocated by the terrible economic consequences of high interest rates high unemployment and an economic downturn
