issue for all of th country but especially true among ms 3 farmers and ranchers in kansas i am one who supports renewable fuels and ethanol and soy diesel pro 1 vide a great opportunity for economi u opportunity in kansas fot kansa farmers and for american agricultur f and for our country we must becom u much more independent from the en s ergy sources abroad but for our farmers and ranchers to remain in business to survive into the future they have got to have access to natural gas and at prices that are affordable natural gas is the primary feed stock the ingredient for the production of many agricultural components but especially for nitrogen fertilizer that is so important and if we are going to produce ethanol in this country if we are going to produce soy diesel we are going to have to have the fertilizer at an affordable price that will allow our farmers to raise the corn and grain sorghum to produce the ethanol to raise the soy beans to produce the soy diesel our farmers are struggling across the country input costs are dramatically on the rise nearly 40 percent of the nitrogen capacity fertilizer capacity has been shut down in this country since 1999 six years ago approximately 15 percent of our fertilizer needs were met in the united states from abroad today 50 percent is imported prices have increased dramatically 250 a ton for nitrogen fertilizer in 2002 today 416 one of my farmers who farms in southwest kansas 30 years ago when he started farming natural gas was 19 cents today it is 9 we are seeing double triple and even fourfold prices that donny young talks about in trying to stay in business with these increasing input costs while the price of corn has stayed the same we in the united states need to become independent if we are going to produce the ethanol and it is important that we remember that natural gas is necessary to make that nitrogen fertilizer i encourage the adoption of this proposal a vote for h r 4761 is a vote for agriculture agricultures ability to produce an affordable food supply will continue to face huge obstacles if our nation does not come to grips with its desire to have limitless resources like natural gas for production and not realize that these resources have to come from somewhere our natural gas crisis has two solutionsincrease supply and reduce demand h r 4761 addresses one aspect of this crisis as it will increase the supply of natural gas from the outer continental shelf this additional supply will do two things it will send a strong signal to natural gas markets and could increase the elasticity in north american natural gas markets it indicates to these futures markets that the united states is committed to lifting the moratoria in the outer continental shelf to provide consumers with an additional supply of natural gas this message should ease the volatility in natural gas prices that all of us have seen since 1999 and the additional supply should help ease the natural gas prices over time why does agriculture care so much about this natural gas crisis simply put agriculture is a very large consumer of natural gas farm3 ers use significant amounts of natural gas for food processing irrigation crop drying heating farm buildings and homes and for the pro duction of crop protection chemicals and nitrogen fertilizers natural gas is the primary feedstock in the production of virtually all commercial nitrogen fertilizers manufactured in the untied states natural gas is not just an energy source it is the raw material for producing the fertilizer today in the case of the nitrogen fertilizer anhydrous ammonia natural gas accounts for over 90 percent of the total cash cost of production just like kansas wheat and wisconsin milk fertilizer is a commodity bought and sold worldwide and subject to basic global supply and demand economic principles as the unitedstates domestic nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing sector declines due to high natural gas prices kansas farmers and other unitedstates food producers will be subject to global supply demand forces on the fertilizer products they buy even more so than today the climb in natural gas prices since 2q00 has forced unitedstates fertilizer production costs to unprecedented levels over this period of high prices and intense volatility the unitedstates fertilizer industry began to shut down production nearly 40 percent of the industrys nitrogen capacity permanently shut down between 1999 and today this has and will continue to make unitedstates farmers dependent on offshore production from the major suppliers such as saudi arabia venezuela and russia this rise in natural gas prices and the permanent closure of so much unitedstates fertilizer production has dramatically impacted fertilizer prices throughout the marketing chain and in particular at the farm level according to usda unitedstates prices to farmers for ammonia climbed from 250 per ton in 2002 to 416 per ton in 2005 that is almost a doubling of the price of ammonia to farmers this continued loss of production from the unitedstates nitrogen fertilizer industry would force farmers to rely on a highly uncertain and highly volatile world market with no assurance that they will be able to obtain enough product to meet their full demand this is particularly important when considering the importance of nitrogen to farmers thirty to 50 percent of corn yields are directly attributed to nitrogen fertilizer passing h r 4761 represents a direct positive action to increase our nations domestic natural gas supply to help relieve the high prices pressuring american farmers fertilizer producers and homeowners allowing exploration and development of the outer continental shelf is an essential commitment that our nation must make these natural resources belong to all americans and should be developed for the benefit of the entire nation a vote for h r 4761 is a vote for agriculture please support passage of h

clear voices on behalf of limited federal government limited federal expenditures and i am proud that he has come out tonight to help us with this let me flush out what he was talking about in terms of increased federal receipts back in january of this year the cbo estimated that fiscal year 2005s tax receipts federal receipts would be about 2 045 trillion cbo is an organization that gets paid to try to estimate these things they generally do a really good job when we finished out the year i was looking at the same treasury report that my colleague made reference to awhile ago and for fiscal year 2005 which ended september 30 2005 receipts were 2 153 trillion over 100 billion more in federal tax receipts than we had estimated just 9 months previously so the numbers we have been talking about tonight the 50 billion in tax cuts the 56 billion and the impact extending the current tax law will have on tax revenues pale against over 108 to 109 billion of increased federal revenues that has come about as a result of the progrowth projob creation tax policy that was put in collectively in 2001 to 2003 in addition to that good news at the end of last week the gdp growth for the third quarter of calendar year 2005 was 4 3 percent that is a good growth rate on any economy a developing economy or whatever it is but let us make sure that we understand this is on the single largest economy in the world it grew 4 3 percent in the third quarter and that is staggering growth under any conclusion fl 2215 the unemployment rate was mentioned earlier as being as low as 5 percent that is full unemployment in reckoning of many economists and is certainly lower than the averages of unemployment of the previous 3 decades the decade of the 1970s which you remember we had a big depression then and as a result of a runup in oil and gas prices we had lower than in the 1980s when those of us in the oil business experienced a significant downturn in 1986 and later and then lower than the boom years of the 1990s when the unemployment rate was as low as anybody thought it would ever be the current unemployment rate is actually lower than that statistics are full of all kind of odd and important indexes that statisticians and economists use to try to make projections as to where the economy is going one of those that you do not hear a lot about is the consumer confidence index and that is supposed to be a measure of how consumers feel about themselves are they going to go spend money do they feel comfortable with their job and those kinds of things it jumped from an 85 2 percent rating in october to a 98 9 percent rating in november a 1month jump of over 13 points in consumer confidence what that tells us is that retailers for the christmas season ought to do very well one of my colleagues today said go try to find a parking spot in the mall these days and for all of the doom and gloom that is out there in the media it is not being reflected in americans going to the malls and working on christmas gifts and charity gifts for other folks that do not have it so the consumer confidence is up another statistic that gets talked about a little bit is that sales of new homes jumped 13 percent in october the largest 1 month percentage gain in 12 years and new singlefamily homes also climbed to an alltime record high of 1 42 million units more people again as we have said several times tonight more people owning a home in america than have ever owned a home now 1 month does not make a trend but continuing to talk about federal tax receipts and revenues the first month of fiscal year 2006 was the month of october of 2005 and during that first month federal tax receipts were about 149 billion and a year ago the equivalent month in october of fiscal 2005 which was october of 2004 federal tax receipts was 137 billion so a 12 billion gain in just 1 month against previous years months now you have got to be careful that may or may not be a trend but it is hard to say it is bad news thai the tax receipts for october of this year are greater than tax receipts for october of last year i think that is good news i would also like to point out a couple of tax provisions that are included in the extension that we will do later on this week that are important and one of those would continue the tax deduction for state and local sales taxes for states that do not have a state income tax states like yours and mine and my former colleague texas does not have a state income tax and so this provision would allow texans to deduct rather than the state income taxes to deduct state and local taxes which are used to fund many of the exact same programs that states who have income taxes use those taxes to provide goods and services to their citizens another deduction that is extended is the abovetheline deduction for higher education expenses now trying not to bore everyone with tax returnese or speak abovetheline deductions means that you get to detect that without having to itemize your deductions so higher education expenses the deduction for that is continued as well as an important expenditure for many teachers who find the school budgets do not provide some of the extras and maybe even sometimes some of the essentials that a teacher needs in providing a good classroom experience for her students teachers get to deduct their outofpocket expenses above the line which means they dont have to itemize deductions to get to deduct those personal expenses that the teacher may pay one that i came across tonight or an example of one i came across tonight is the tax incentive to revitalize the district of columbia included in the code of the past two tax cuts has been a 5 000 tax credit for anyone any new first time home purchaser here in the district of columbia well one of the folks on my staff who as you know staff are legendarily overworked and way underpaid one of the folks on my staff 2 years ago took advantage of this provision and bought his first home and has begun to build equity in that home over the past 2 years and would not have been able to do that were this tax provision not in place when you sell a home you have bought it from somebody who previously owned it hopefully and in all likelihood that person is going to go invest that money in another home so it is important that we have firsttime buyers to work into the market work into the housing market because as we stated earlier for many families the ownership of a home is the single largest asset that they have in their portfolio and this gentleman now has a home that he is paying a mortgage on of course but is building equity in that home building equity in his personal wealth and he is going to be better off as a result of having done that let me talk about something that we probably should have talked about right off the bat and that is the federal government does not grow this economy a lot of times the federal government gets a lot more credit for good economic news than it deserves and in all likelihood sometimes a lot more of the blame for bad economies than it deserves but the truth of the matter is a growing economy that we have right now is not created by a federal government it was created by hundreds of thousands of hard working americans employees who go to work every day and work for their employer to try to provide a good or a service that that employer can sell and make money on selfemployed individuals who have gone out there and taken the business risk of leaving that paycheck leaving the security of a check every 2 weeks to try to make it on their own those are the folks who are building this growing economy who are adding people to their payrolls who are hiring new people or setting up additional businesses to take advantage of opportunities that we are having in this growing economy so we cannot overstate the value of the hard working american in growing this economy but we do have some risks a lot of times of overstating the impact the federal government has in my view the role of the federal government is to get out of the way of these hardworking americans and let them continue to grow this economy pay their fair share of taxes of course but let us not do things that puts the government in the way of creating jobs gets in the way of furthering homeownership gets in the way of growing this economy and providing new opportunities for men and women in this country i participated in back in the early 1990s in a needs assessment for midland texas this was an attempt to survey on a statistically valid basis throughout midland county what were the needs of people within midland what were the needs of your family what were the needs in your neighborhood what were the needs within the overall community and we got all of this information together and began to sort them into like items and pared the list down to 10 so that we had in fact 10 top needs that the people in midland texas told us they were having in their homes their families their neighborhoods and the community and as you look down that list nine of those needs would have been positively impacted by a family that had a job it has been my experience that jobs cure an awful lot of ills within every community when families are working the family itself is better off communities are better off the strains on the social network that is the united way that is all those social charities that we have in place to create that safety net that is so vital in every single one of our communities is less strained when more people have jobs it is also better supported when more people have jobs so it is important that we give credit where credit is due with respect to this growing economy the gentleman from texas mentioned one of his or three actually of his constituents that are good examples of why these pro growth pro job creation tax policies are in effect now and that we ought to continue them in effect i want to talk about calvin fryar calvin is a good friend of mine from brownwood texas he and his partners own a company that distributes gasoline they also have convenience stores they hire people to work and he told me the other day at dinner that because we were talking about extension of these current tax cuts he said that the one that was the most important to him as a small business owner was the section 179 deduction section 179 provides for the immediate writeoff of certain equipment that is purchased by businesses and put into use each year and i think it is about 100 000 calvin told me that when that came into effect i think it was 2003 that it helped him make a decision to invest additional money into the businesses that he was trying to create and not only did he invest the amount of money that qualified him to immediately deduct that amount he also invested a lot of money on top of that and in doing so created jobs and not only did he create jobs for the people who built whatever it is he bought but he also created additional jobs for his company because he was expanding his opportunities within the gasoline distribution area as well as convenience stores so he was adding jobs to his business as a result of that one specific tax code that is expiring and under the tax law that we will pass hopefully pass on thursday will be continued another one of those that is very important and my colleagues earlier in the previous hour mentioned it and that is the tax rate on capital gains and dividends if you were to listen to the colleagues on the other side it is as if the federal government has some innate claim to some portion of your capital gains some portion of your dividends and i would argue that that is not logical where is it stated anywhere that the federal government has a claim on selling property that you have held selling property that you have invested in selling a business that you built from scratch why is it that the federal government has a claim to a certain amount of that and right now under the current tax law the federal government has a claim on 15 percent of that capital gain or 15 percent of those dividends that may or may not be correct it is the law of the land but certainly increasing that number you would have to answer the question is all right why does the federal government have a claim on or does it own in some way the capital gain that i get when i sell stocks and bonds or when i sell a business why is it that the other side believes that a higher tax rate on capital gains is somehow some right of the federal government that is not if we were to let those current tax provisions expire capital gains would get thrown back up to the previously high percentage rates everything is going to get thrown back in with ordinary income the taxable income rates and we will be right back into a circumstance where we are raising taxes the wrong way raising taxes by raising rates as opposed to raising taxes by having an economy that is growing at a staggering rate providing new jobs to workers in this country so i would argue against that as we close out this hour if you look at the reporting we are talking about the economy tonight and if you look at reporting of economic news it is i guess an attempt to be balanced balance is rarely neutral though you will hear somebody talk about well you know this economic statistic is looking up and looking better but if that path continues it will drive us into higher interest rates or if we have got increased job growth or jobs going to be created at too fast a rate then that is going to drive up inflation so it is rare that you ever have good economic news simply presented as good economic news and maybe we will never get to a point where that happens hopefully on the nights that we get to come in here and talk about the economy get to brag on the economy actually we will be able to help set the record straight as i mentioned earlier my good colleague mr hensarling has said often that we are all entitled to our own opinion but we are only entitled to one set of facts not our own set of facts just the set of facts as are out there hopefully we can be responsible for what we say in front of these microphones be held accountable for what we say the other side made a lot tonight about accountability and all those kinds of things i would argue that that same accountability ought to go to things that are said from behind these microphones if i have said something that is incorrect if i have made an insinuation or made some sort of a comment that was intended to mislead that i am called to account for that and i would hope the other side would ascribe to that same kind of philosophy that the folks in the chamber tonight who are listening to this debate or listening to these arguments not really debate since we are not going back and forth but listening to the three of us put out information that we believe is important for the american people to hear and to understandand to understand how we are coming to the conclusions that we are coming too that we be held to a very high standard of what we say and that we are able to back up each and everything that we do say with facts that are verifiable so i want to thank you tonight for being able to lead this hour and i want to thank my colleague from texas mr hensarling for his role in our talk tonight and i want to also thank my freshman colleague from georgia mr price for his helping nie out tonight as well so the message i would leave with the american people is this that we have got a growing economy we have got an economy that is well grounded and is going to sustain this growth but that what we do not need to do is to increase taxes tax rates on that economy but that we continue the pro growth pro job creation tax rates that have been in effect since 2001 and 2003 e 2230"], [0.0033836879301816225,

amazed at news reports at home when i go home and i watch television news and i read the newspaper and see what is being portrayed as usual for the american public if you just followed those stories you would not believe that there was anything that was good or positive going on in our nation you would not believe that the economy for example was doing very very well so one of the things that i try to do and i know others try to do as well is to try to assist and bring about some truth in reporting so tonight what we would like to do is spend a little time talking about the economy for the american people know better than what they see on the nightly news and what they read in the newspapers in fact so many of the folks that i talk to at home are really tired of the gloom and doom that gets reported on the news and frankly gets stated over and over and over here in congress by some members they are tired of congressmen and women who put politics and partisanship over good policy and i hear so often back home that folks say why cant you just get something done on behalf of the american people well a lot of good things are getting done and we are going to spend a little time tonight talking about our economy and some things that congress is doing and has done to assist the american people to help american families to help american children to help american communities it is important that we do that because there is good news to tell so what we would like to do is spend a little time tonight and review so many of the positive things that have been done to create really an economy that is on the move i would like to begin by just sharing a number of different charts that demonstrate clearly that the economy is growing this is a chart here that i think really crystallizes so many of the good stories that we have to tell this chart begins in the first quarter of 2001 and along this axis here is the annual change in gdp or gross domestic product that is how well is the economy doing as you see for the first number of quarters of 2001 and 2002 it is kind of going along kind of bumping up and down and then there is a remarkable change that occurs in early 2003 from then on from the second quarter of 2003 on what we see is a gross domestic product growth in every quarter 10 quarters in a row of a growth of greater than 3 percent and oftentimes greater than 4 percent in faqt the most recent quarter grew at a rate of 4 3 percent the individual who wants to know how to continue that kind of growth and who is excited about policies that encourage growth would say well what happened what happened at that point to bring that kind of growth about as most people know what happened was that the tax cuts the tax relief that congress enacted on behalf of the hardworking american taxpayers went into effect and that has resulted in this incredible incredible growth in the economy that continues that continues unabated and what congress has an opportunity to do this week is to continue and extend that tax relief hopefully to be able to continue the lines that we have seen grow in the economy this is another chart that demonstrates the kind of response that the american economy has to that kind of activity this talks about the creation of new jobs in our country in fact since the spring of 2003 there have been 4 46 million new jobs that have come about and this chart shows the percent increase each month from early 2002 through the current time you see again there is that remarkable change that occurs in the early part and midparet of 2003 where the growth in the number of jobs is remarkable again the inquiring individual would want to know well what changed there what made it so that we did not have negative growth in jobs we had positive growth in jobs as everybody well knows now that change was the tax relief the tax relief that congress enacted that took place in early 2003 just to put those numbers all together this chart which is a little busy shows two very clearly distinct lines one is the green line down here that is the number of jobs that increase in our nation each month the red line is the level of unemployment and as you see at the beginning of 2003 the unemployment rate was taken up here somewhere around 6 percent and the number of jobs began to increase at this point when the tax relief package went into effect we see that continued increase and in fact right now the unemployment rate is down at 5 percent which is lower than the average for the decades of the 1970s and the 1980s and the 1990s some economists will tell you that 5 percent unemployment rate is full employment because you have got a number of folks who are between jobs or are working to find other places of employment that is their design so 5 percent is basically full employment the number of new jobs that was created last month 215 000 new jobs so there is good news to tell i have been joined tonight by many of my colleagues and many of them will share some of the same kinds of goodnews stories with you first i would like to yield the time to congresswoman blackburn from tennessee she has been such an incredible leader in this congress in the area of tax relief and in making certain that we enact the kinds of policies here that result in smaller government lower taxes and more opportunity for americans with that let me yield to congresswoman blackburn"], [0.003656080225482583, 0.003656080225482583, 0, "americans are fed up they are worn out burned out and pocketed out of taking care of illegals who come here and expect a handout and a free ride and now americans they are speaking out recently taxpayers in houston forked out over 125 million in hospital costs in just 1 year by treating more than 53 000 illegals taking advantage of the system in our hospitals taking advantage of americans and really taking advantage of legal immigrants it is morally wrong for illegals to enter this country with the expectation that they will live off of others it is morally wrong for them to expect that americans will pay to take care of them take care of their health costs their education costs and their social services costs but now it is becoming illegal for illegals to get these services that even many americans do not receive taxpayers are finding their own answers while some federal lawmakers in washington remain deaf to their desire because they are too busy dueling over illegal immigration doctrines state leaders are stepping in across the couhtry just this week in colorado lawmakers took a cue from their citizens by cutting through the conflict and passed 11 bipartisan bills taking a tougher stance on illegal entry just like houston illegals have been drawn to colorado like moths to a flame and like many states colorado has left the porch light on for them because they have bad laws that encourage illegal entry such as laws that protect employers that hire illegals providing illegals benefits that many americans do not receive such as unemployment grants and even medical care this may explain why half of colorados immigrants are illegal but those days may be over because now state legislators are aiming to flip the switch and turn out the lights and turn off the benefits that make being illegal so lucrative this week they passed 11 immigration bills including making people prove that they are legal residents of colorado in order to receive state and federal benefits that is a farreaching requirement which will require many of those 1 million people to prove that they are in the state legally to receive benefits without that proof they lose the benefits that americans have to pay for because americans always pay always pay for illegal entry illegals will lose unemployment checks grants to pay energy bills and even some public medical care and even applying for these perks means a monetary punishment to illegals they are also now busting business owners who until recently have left their own porch lights on guiding illegals their way in the name of a bigger bottom line those businesses who exploit illegals make a profit off of cheap labor but americans pick up the tab for all social services now they are going to lose a grip on that filthy lucre that they have gotten businesses that exploit those already living in the shadows of our society beyond the scope of federal work and wage regulations it will cost those illicit businesses money in the form of fines if they do not keep records proving that they hire only legal residents and while many americans do not turn out at the polls it seems some illegals find some way to vote in this country and now it is going to be a felony if they do so and while colorado legislators have been hard at work they are letting the voters make the really tough decisions they are asking them in november on the ballot if they should sue the federal government for not enforcing federal immigration laws voters will also be asked to deny tax benefits to business owners who hire illegals each day my office gets inundated with calls emails and faxes of people demanding their voices be heard demanding we secure the borders demanding that government enforce the law and demanding that government uphold its greatest responsibility protecting the citizens the bills are mounting up illegals have run up their tab now its time we turn out the lights because the party is over and thats just the way it is"], [0.004062766674906015, 0.004062766674906015, 0, "i

at 2 00 freezing in 30degree weather with the wind howling in our faces eight shivering young men illegal aliens in their late teens and early 20s sat on the cold ground in handcuffs grateful to be caught one of them pleaded with the border patrol agent to find his girlfriend maria who was still stuck on one of the cliffs illegal aliens like the ones i saw in handcuffs contifnue to enter the united states from the mexican border at the rate of 8 000 per day today we have 11 milliof illegal aliens in the united states illegal immigration presents a huge problem that is why i decided to spend a week along the southern border to see firsthand how bad the problem was and what congress could do to fix it last year our border patrol agents arrested 1 2 million illegal aliens attempting to enter the united states from mexico significantly 155 000 of those arrested were from countries other than mexico they included illegal immigrants from iran iraq and afghanistan our porous mexicanunitedstates border offers the perfect cover for terrorists especially since tighter controls have been imposed at airports this poses a very serious national security problem according to cia director porter goss i personally spoke with border patrol agents who had apprehended suspects on the terrorist watch list one night while i was riding along with the border patrol two illegals from pakistan were captured one convicted sexualpredator was caught trying to cross so were wanted murder suspects drug dealers and smugglers i was impressed by the bravery of the border patrol agents who escorted me i saw a border patrol supervisor get out of his vehicle pull an illegal alien off of a 10foot wall and arrest him despite his violent attempts to resist the arrest the border patrol agent i rode with told me he had been shot at on several occasions twentythree of his colleagues have been killed in the line of duty since 1990 for example border patrol agents susan rodriguez and ricardo salinas were gunned down by a murder suspect agent jefferson barr was shot to death by a drug trafficker if the job of a border patrol agent sounds dangerous imagine the risk to people who actually live along the border i sat down in the living rooms of four different families who own ranches along the border one couple ed and donna tisdale documented on home video 13 000 illegal aliens crossing their property in one year alone the tisdales had their barbedwire fences cut by illegals running off the familys cattle when their dogs barked to scare off intruders the dogs were poisoned another rancher told me about numerous breakins at his home while his family slept as illegal aliens tried to find food and clothing one morning his daughters had gone out to feed their pet bunnies only to find them skinned and taken for food by illegal aliens trying to escape to a nearby highway the economic impact of crossers who are successful is catastrophic illegal immigration costs taxpayers 45 billion per year in health care education and incarceration expenses the cost of the estimated 630 000 illegal aliens in florida is about 2 billion a year meaning every familyin my congressioral district pays a hidden tax of 315 each year ald yet still faces depressed wages because of illegal immigration so how do we fix the problem first we need to crack down on employers who knowingly hire illegal workers jobs are the magnet drawing illegal aliens across the border and the united states house of representatives has acted to make it mandatory for employers to check the paperwork of new hires or else face stiff penalties if they do not now it is up to the senate to act second we need to complete construction of the double fence for 700 miles along the border near populated urban areas san diego saw a steep reduction in crossings from 500 000 down to 130 000 when the double fence was completed there third where mountains and rugged terrain make completion of a double fence impossible we need to have a virtual fence congress needs to appropriate more money for infrared cameras that enable agents to see the entire border finally we need more bordef patrol agents although congress has tripled the number of border patrol agents since the late 1980s more are still needed one million illegal im migrants come to america legally each year and my staff members spend the majority of their time helping those who want to come to our country to work hard and play by the rules e3 1900 we are protected from dangerous people entering the country at our airports ids are checked against the terrorist watch list and baggage is screened well who is doing the checks on the 8 000 people who arrive here illegally every day who is our last line of defense it is a bbrder patrol agent in a green uniform working alone at 2 tonight after all of us are asleep he will be working somewhere near the top of a cold 5 000foot mountain along the californiamexican border he will get a radio call telling him to approach a group of illegals who have been spotted by an infrared scope and are located near the top of that mountain he will track their footprints in the dirt and make hisway toward them as he approaches there is something he doesnt know are these illegal aliens a group of harmless teenagers who are scared and freeziig or are they heavily~armed and dangerous

latin americas renewed antiamericanism is venezuelas hugo chavez in the years since hugo chavez first took office as a democratically elected leader he has retreated from the ideals of freedom security and prosperity and began his own march toward oppression and socialism modeled after his mentor fidel castro and let me give a few examples in hugo chavezs venezuela there is no free press just statecontrolled antiamerican antifreedom propaganda there is no freedom of speech no freedom of dissent and no freedom to stand in opposition to the chavez regime just days ago for example several leaders of the opposition group sumate were charged with treason and conspiracy simply for accepting money from the national endowment for democracy to help educate their fellow citizens about venezuelas constitutional referendum proces in hugo chavezs venezuela the government owns the countrys key industries and controls the economy the flow of capital jobs and opportunity hugo chavez holds the hopes dreams and opportunities for an entire nation firmly in his fists in the years since he came to power hugo chavez has hijacked the courts and installed his cronies and allies to nianipulate the countrys constitution and legal system he has forged a dangerous alliance with fidel castro and is now receiving military and intelligence assistance and training from castros government he has acquired 100 000 machine guns from russia and admitted to trying to acquire nuclear technology from iran and he has e threatened to end diplomatic relations t with the united states hugo chavezis an 9 enemy of freedom who threatens the r balance of power in our hemisphere today i call on the united states to b pursue a three point plan that will pro i mote freedom security and prosperity t for the people of venezuela t first the united states should pro f mote the creation of institutions that will foster a free press free markets and the freedom of speech and religion r and free and fair elections for venezuela including the establishment of a venezuelan counterpart of radio and tv marti second the united states should establish a venezuelan security zone that will isolate chavez and limit his ability to destabilize latin america this new zone would restrict hugo chavezs ability to purchase arms nuclear information and technologies and weapons of mass destruction it would also make it more difficult for hugo chavez to enter into commerce trade or alliances with other nations led by dictators and antiamerican fanatics and it would require the restoration of an independent judiciary committed to representing and protecting the rights of all venezuelans third the united states should promote economic development in venezuela through free markets privatization and other means that will create lasting prosperity and opportunity for all venezuelans president reagan tore down a wall and liberated a generation president reagan once said freedom is a fragile thing and is never more than one generation away from extinction it is not ours by inheritance it must be fought for and defended constantly by each generation president reagans steadfast commitment to freedom should have left a lasting lesson on all of us but it did not and the foreign policy debate in this body could not be more dramatic those on the left have demonstrated they believe in peace at any price even if that price is the loss of freedom those of us on the right believe that freedom is worth fighting for and that together freedom security and prosperity will yield lasting peace make no mistake about it hugo chavez is a threat we must take him seriously and we must act now"], [0.004225399810820818, 0.004225399810820818, 0, "i thank the gentleman from maryland for yielding to me and i think particularly at this point i wanted to interject some thoughts first of all the gentleman from maryland as he pointed out just a second ago is a ph d physiologist who taught years ago in medical school and taught physiology but more importantly has also taught the subject matter which is difficult to understand i know i was there in medical school and that is the subject of embryology embryology medical students get maybe in a 4year period of time 6 months worth of embryology and of course to hear my colleague from maryland explaining the embryologic process it sort of takes me back to those days but i realize of course how difficult it is to understand for members of the body there are 435 of us of course and just a handful have ever taken any embryology there are no embryologists other than maybe the gentleman from maryland in the body so it is not an easy concept to understand but what i hear my colleague tell us is that it is possible to get stem cells from an embryo without destroying the embryo is it being done today no it is not being done today because quite honestly it is easier to scramble an egg than to do one over easy it is a little more difficult it will take some study and we are not talking about long many years science fiction at all and the gentleman from maryland explained it very clearly we are close we need a little research nonhuman primate research but we are a lot closer to this possibility than a lot of our colleagues and the general public understand i want to share with my colleagues as an ob gyn physician thete is a procedure that probably has been done for at least 10 12 maybe 14 years now there is an acronym everything hag an acronym it is called icsi intracytoplasmic sperm injection what do i mean by that an infertile couple where the problem is male infertility and a low sperm count a normal sperm count is 60 million that is a lot when we get below 1 000 it is very difficult and the chances of a natural conception are markedly diminished at that point but with this icsi technique they literally can obtain sperm by a biopsy in someone who has just a few sperm not 1 000 not 60 million but maybe just a few and take one sperm from that biopsy and under the proper lab oratory techniques maybe a specialized microscope take the wifes egg and inject that sperm with a needle with a very fine needle under the microscope intracytoplasmic sperm injection and all of a sudden an embryo is created life is created a child is created and after several days in cell multiplication as the gentleman from maryland was explaining then that is implanted in the moms uterus and the miracle of birth can occur for that couple we are not talking about a procedure icsi that is being done exclusively at the national institutes of health this is being done right in my community of marietta georgia by reproductive endocrinologists those doctors who specialize in infertility and doing those kinds of things and it has been going on for 10 12 years now so this is an opportunity to come and share this time with my colleague and say that this is not star wars for goodness sake we put a man on the moon in 1969 there is a way to do this that is to obtain embryonic stem cells without destroying or indeed even harming the embryo and that analogy that explanation of twinning and how the monozygotic single egg identical twin that the egg divides at a certain stage and indeed they are taking away 50 percent of the cells and in most instances if the division is complete they have two perfectly identical beautiful children that develop i know i have got two precious identical twin granddaughters now who are 7 years old they were born at 26 weeks right at that point where it is perfectly legal with very little prescription in our respective states to destroy those lives so this is a hugely important thing to me and i thank my colleague for pointing out the fact that we are not that far away with a little study a little funding to be able to develop this technique of obtaining these stem cells these totipotential cells as he described without scrambling the egg and doing it the easy way the simple way killing the embryo which is destruction of life it is not necessary and we are going to be talking tomorrow in this chamber about the great successes that we are achieving today with stem cell technology but not embryonic stem cells the results there have been pretty dismal we are talking about the great success 58 different research endeavors where progress has been made in these various diseases that the gentleman from maryland described utilizing either stem cells obtained from umbilical cord blood or from adult stem cells bone marrow and other tissues so this is why it is so important for our colleagues to hear from the gentleman from maryland and to think about this to understand exactly what he is saying because i think it is really on point and

policy in the united states congress since i have been here we have passed two very meaningful tax bills we have passed the jobs and growth tax relief act in 2005 and we also passed the economic growth and tax relief act we have to look at where we were in my opinion where we were was we were post 9 11 we had a corporate scandal we were in the beginnings or in the middle of a recession in our economy and we were having difficulty pulling ourselves out for alot of different reasons with the leadership of the president we followed through in congress to pass those two tax relief acts i think i would like to go to the numbers and talk about some of the things that i think are significant in terms of the numbers and how it has influenced americans i always like to personalize everything to my state so i have gome state numbers as well for instance this year who will gain tax relief 111 million taxpayers will see their taxes decline by an average of 1 877 significant numbers five million total individuals and families will see income tax liabilities completely eliminated because we moved the tax the lowest tax bracket down to 10 percent fortyfour million families with children will receive an average tax cut of 2 493 that is because we have moved down significantly the child tax credit fourteen million elderly individuals will receive an average of 2 000 and 25 million small business owners will save an average of 3 641 so those are the numbers in terms of what could possibly be saving average savings through the tax relief but i think we need to look at where we are right now we have an economy that is moving in excess of 3 5 percent in gross national product we have created over the last several years 1 85 million jobs over the last 12 months alone and 5 4 million since augustof 1993 what i think this translates to is more small business owners having more money to create jobs to buy more equipment which creates more jobs i think we also have individuals who have more discretion over their own dollars they can say what they want to buy when they want to buy it because they have fewer federal taxes to pay i think that empowers them to consume more goods which then translates to more business to more jobs so i see it as an engine that is moving in the right direction i believe that the tax relief package and the tax cuts that we passed are a large part ofthat"], [0.9877061815932393, 0.012293818406760693, 1, "i rise today to mark the fourth anniversary of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks and to remember those who lost

"advocates for more drilling off the coast of florida california all around the coastline of our country he particularly focuses on natural gas and professes that natural gas is a cleanburning gas and that there would be little to no risk to expanding that drilling well when one is a representative from the state of florida and we have 77 million people who visited our state just last year alone and 56 5 billion in taxable sales is generated by tourism most of which is the result of our beautiful beaches and our pristine coastline one can clearly see why most floridians would have a significant problem with the possibility of there being oil rigs off our beaches within the eyesight of tourists or our residents and mr peterson of pennsylvania has continually represented that natural gas is a potential alternative energy source well just off the florida coastline the minerals management service which is a government agency under the department of the interior has documented that there is only about a 70day supply of natural gas off the coastline of florida in the gulf under current consumption rates in the united states that to me does not appear to take us into the rest of the century in terms of dealing with our energy needs what we should be doing is uniting as members of congress representing this country and dealing with our longterm energy crisis by exploring alternative energy sources not going to the same old energy sources and trying to drill our way out of this problem drilling is not the solution there is far too much environmental risk to drilling whether we are drilling for natural gas or drilling for oil and the proposal that we will be considering that is attached to the budget reconciliation bill the budgetcut document that we will be considering at the earliest next week includes a terrible proposal that would expand drilling off the coastline of florida and bring drilling within 125 miles of floridas coast on the gulf that is a totally inappropriate proposal it makes absolutely no sense it would jeopardize our environment and i am hopeful that my colleagues from florida and other colleagues who represent coastal communities which will also be in jeopardy if this provision passes will join us in opposing this budget reconciliation bill not the least of which because there are many other reasons why it should be opposed because of the dire cuts that are in the budget that are going to rain terror down on americans across this country but to add insult to injury it also has a terrible provision in it that would allow drilling off the coastline around our entire country so with that having been said i want to talk a little bit about what we talked about in the previous hour and turn the conversation back to the budget reconciliation bill there are a number of significant problems with the budget cuts that the republican leadership is proposing but one of the things that i wanted to turn to is what democrats think we should be doing in terms of the budget democrats want to bring the budget back into balance what we proposed in the budget committee today included a proposal that would bring the budget back into balance by 2012 the democratic budget also has a smaller deficit than the republican budget every year and would accumulate less debt and waste fewer resources on interest payments that are needed to service the national debt we would include budget enforcement measures to protect social security we would do more for education the democratic proposal provides 4 5 billion more for appropriated education and training programs than the republican budget for 2006 and 41 billion more over the next 5 years we also reject the 21 billion in cuts that the republican budget requires the education and workforce committee to make over the next 5 years those are cuts that could fall on students loans and school lunches these are not the same old tired complaints it is insulting to suggest that cutting school lunches and financial aid are tired complaints if one is struggling to be able to give their children breakfast and lunch on a daily basis and make sure that they are provided with nutrition and they do not financially have the ability to ensure that they can do it themselves staring down budget cuts that take that opportunity away from them is nothing short of cowardly this is a cowardly budget reconciliation bill it does not show any guts at all and it abandons the american people let us talk about housing in the previous hour we talked a little bit about the housing cuts that this budgetcut bill would hand down and i am joined by my good and close friend whom i had an opportunity to serve with in now three different chambers the

affordable housing that our constituents were already facing i want to just point out this picture here over the weekend i had an opportunity to go door to door in my district because there are so many senior citizens trapped in their homes without power we still have half a million people who do not have power in south florida and unfortunately whether it is because of hurricane fatigue or just the fact that there was so much damage in the gulf coast region that it may be difficult to feel the pain that we are going through in south florida and understand it but there is not nearly as much attention as we need focused on what happened in south florida when i was going to door to door in my district to try to help some of the folks who have trouble getting out of their houses and i am talking about people who are in their 80s and 90s one of the apartments that the building captain in the condominium brought me into included this kind of damage this is the result of hurricane wilma and this is just one example there are hundreds and hundreds of condominium units and apartment buildings and homes and mobile homes that look just like this there is a perception whether it was created by the media or created by the lack of attention by the national media on what happened with hurricane wilma that everything is fine in south florida everything is not fine in south florida this is the third floor apartment and that is the ceiling of the apartment and as we can see we can look right through the ceiling at the sky this is this womans master bedroom and literally during the storm 1 minute after she walked out of that master bedroom the roof caved in on her bed a minute earlier and it would have caved in on her when we talk about the affordable housing problem that we already had now we have thousands of people in south florida whose homes have been condemned who are faced with nowhere to go because the average price of a house just in broward is 348 000 a year the

that everyodhe could agree on in the interest of time i would just say that i oppose the amendment it can lead to a lot of problems i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.00032517313957214355,

conscience of each member and as each member comes to the floor as each member speaks i think my colleagues can see that this debate uniquely is based on their own view of this and their deeply founded view of this in fact the whips office is not real busy today because we are not whipping this vote i do not think my friends on the other side are whipping this vote either why would that be why would we have a vote on a bill like this that based on the debate is so important that we would not be trying to persuade members because we feel on both sides of this aisle apparently today that this is a matter of real conscience this is a matter where people can deeply disagree this is a matter about the very definition of life itself because of that i am firmly on the side of those who believe it is not time yet to federally fund this particular kind of research there is private sector funding available some states like the state of california recently decided they would fund this in a significant way other states have decided they would totally outlaw research so this is clearly an issue where the country is divided the ethics of this issue as the gentlewoman from ohio suggested earlier are not as clear as they should be the future ownership and use of this research is not as clear as it needs to be the first principle of bioethics should be first do no harm we are not at the point in this issue where we can firmly say we are not doing harm we are at the point when we can say that all of those concerns that this research is not possible if we do not fund it with federal funding are just not right this research is possible i do not agree with it myself but i particularly do not agree that we should take the tax money of millions and millions of taxpayers who believe this is absolutely wrong and pay for this research in that way i urge a no vote on this bill mr speaker"], [0.0003350973129272461, 0.5003350973129272, 0, "i have no additional speakers i will

that period of time that 36year stretch i saw some alarming trends the outofwedlock birth rate went from 5 percent to 33 percent an increase in children living without both biological parents has increased to nearly 50 percent the united states has become the most violent nation for young people in the civilized world it has the highest homicide and the highest suicide rate back in 1960 cocaine marijuana and methamphetamine were practically unheard of and today of course we have a major epidemic so as far as i am concerned the greatest threat that we have to our nation is what is happening to our young people i would like to suggest that the best available solution that i have been able to observe is mentoring a mentor is number one someone who cares many children simply have no one in their lives no adult who shows unconditional love and acceptance of them and a mentor is somebody who does that mentoring also provides affirmation no one whether you are 5 years old 10 years old or 60 years old can function very well if there is not someone who occasionally says we care about you we approve of what you are doing way to go so a mentor is one who provides affirmation in a world where many young people get very little of it then thirdly a mentor is one who provides a vision of what is possible so many of our young children realize that when they get to be 16 they can leave school and it is assumed that they will do that because they have never seen anyone in their family finish high school or go to college or contemplate a career so a mentor provides vision mentoring works a mentoring program that i have been involved with in my home state of nebraska has done some followup study with the gallup organization we found that a mentoring program at least in this case increased attendance by those being mentored by 80 percent reduced disciplinary referrals by 60 percent and increased academic performance by 40 percent other studies have shown that a reduction in drug and alcohol abuse has been about 50 percent teenage pregnancy has gone down violent crime has been reduced graduation rates have been improved peer relationships have been improved including relationships with parents mentoring is costeffective it usually costs about 300 to 500 per mentormentee match whereas it costs 30 000 to 40 000 a year to incarcerate somebody a young person on drugs may cost more than 30 000 to 40 000 a year the national mentoring partnership estimates that roughly 17 5 million young people badly need a mentor and yet at the present time we have only about 2 5 million children in mentoring relationships so we have a gap of roughly 15 million young people the congress and the president have recognized the need by providing 50 million for mentoring for success grants and another 50 million for mentoring children of prisoners and this was provided last year however much more could be done i urge members of congress to recognize and encourage mentoring during this national mentoring month of january members of the mentoring caucus are introducing a resolution honoring mentors this will be done tomorrow and we hope that we will have a broad base of support throughout the congress"], [0.0009421110153198242, 0.4990578889846802, 0, "on rollcall no 486 i was unavoidably detained had i been present i would have voted yea"],

because he is himself a victim of this insidiousness i also want to thank chairman barton who with me introduced the truth in caller id act that passed the house not long ago i also want to thank and recognize mr upton mr dingell and mr markey for their significant contributions to that bill icommend our colleague from pennsylvania for offering this amendment it will highlight to the fcc that the house of representatives takes this problem very seriously we have swiftly passed legislation that is now pending in the senate and so we expect the fcc to do whatever it can nowand to move expeditiously once the truth in caller id act is signed into law not long ago i was like most americanscompletely unaware that is was so easy for someone to alter their caller id caller id spoofing is not your grandfathers prank call this technology has limited uses that i find legitimate such as for law enforcement and protecting battered women this technology has unlimited uses that i find completely unacceptable this technology enables people to pretend to be a bank a doctors office a court house or even a member of congress nefarious people are i say are using this technology to get a hold of private information and engage in identity theft the telecommunications and internet subcommittee of energy and cbmmerce held a hearing on this matter we heard stories of people recefing phone calls from their local court houses saying they had missed jury duty and that to confirm a make up the caller needed the persons social security number well who wouldnt be flustered when seeing a local court house phone number on the caller id and being told you had missed jury duty so these innocent people gave out their social security numbers we heard of people make fake calls to police departments claiming to be victims of home intrusion and being held at gun point the newark star ledger reported on july 12 2005 that mr wadu jackson plead guilty to placing a fake 911 call that drew dozens of police sharpshooters to a new brunswick home in march in a mistake belief that a teenage girl was being held hostage i know of three of our colleagues in the house who have been victims of caller id spoofing not in the personal lives but in their professional lives as members of congress they have had people call and leave obnoxious messages that indicate the call is coming from the members district office i can only believe that this was an early effort at testing this technology to interfere with the electoral process of our nation i think we do a service to our constituents
