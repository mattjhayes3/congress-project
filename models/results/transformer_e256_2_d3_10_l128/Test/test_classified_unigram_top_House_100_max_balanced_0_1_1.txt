prince of peace dr kings lagacy has all the trappings of nobility and royalty he faithfully lived a life of courage charity and moral bearing he showed all people that wise thoughtful and strong leadership can bring about change through the use of nonviolence of all the materials ive ever read regarding martin luther king an article written by coleman mccarthy a nationally syndicated colunist seemed to best put his life into perspective the writer said nothing of kings greatness can be understood without first seeing the reasons for his absolute commitment to the belief that the aftermath of violence is bitterness the aftermath of nonviolence is reconciliation he further says had king not taught and practiced that his national holiday would become as hollow as the one for george washingtons birthdayan excuse for the department stores to hold a sale kings holiday the writer says is a call to conscience not commerce it is important then that we remember dr kingmemorialize him perpetuate him and pay tribute to his leadership of a movement which touched the social conscience of this nation and changed the course of history martin loved his nation he loved the people of this nation and the world he even died for the nation he loved this nation and its people so much that he inspired a vision and a dream for the nation his dream was a simple dream uncomplicated and unencumbered in essence he believed and demanded that america live up to its creedthat all men are created equal the course of american history has been a relentless push by peoples of all races creeds and colors for america to live up to that creed that is why dr kings birthday celebration is so important and why i stand here today with great frustration knowing that the mission of dr king is far from finished this country has yet to meet its true creed that all men are created equal the recognition of dr kings life and death should not merely be symbolic it should be a living example of how our daily lives should be conducted america can and will i hope someday realize the dream the dream will come true when every american can work commensurate with his ability and training when every child receives quality education regardless of his race or status in lifewhen every american can live in a decent home in a decent neighborhood america will not see the dream until black mothers no longer die in childbirth at a rate four times as great as white mothers we will see martins dream only when children can replace their tattered clothing with new garments and senior citizens are no longer required to choose between eating and heating we will fully appreciate the dream when 50 million people no longer go to bed hungry and undernourished his dream will come true when the slums are

programs for the working poorsuch as educational loans the food stamp program legal services corporation and mass transit the 100th congress will grapple with the grammrudman budget deficit reduction act which will have a devastating impact on many programs designed for the nations poor and disadvantaged dr king isnt here with us today but if he were he would see the rise in defense spending support for the contras and yet would find many of the programs he so fervently and aggressively fought for wiped out at the stroke of a pen but if he were alive today he would be in the forefront lobbying congress in an effort to remove these programs from the presidents chopping block when dr king delivered his famous i have a dream speech in 1963 the unemployment rate for black workers was 10 8 percent today although the overall unemployment rate dropped in december to below 7 percent for black americans and teenagers it remains at a shamefully high rate for black males it was 14 8 percent and for black teenagers it was 40 percent in dr kings lifetime america needed a war on poverty in 1987 we still need one a congressional report indicates that the percentage of american children whose families have incomes below the poverty line has now increased to 22 2 percent the study further found that half of poor children live in femaleheaded oneparent families for children in black single femaleheaded families where the mother is under 30 and did not complete high school the poverty rate was 92 8 percent a recent report released by the unitedstates department of health and human services reconfirmed our worst fears about the disparity in the health status of black and white americans the report concluded that more than 60 000 excess deaths occur each year among blacks and minorities largely because they are easier prey for disease and violence dr king loved all people be they black white jew or gentile certainly the human rights problems that exist today in not only south africa but russia afghanistan and central america would be of great concern to dr king so similar are these situations to those that existed throughout much of this nation that dr king would attempt to prevail upon the leaders of those countries to bring about dignity and equality for all mankind dr king so fervently believed in the brotherhood of man he showed us the similarities between us and most importantly that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere each year then when we recognize this man it seems to me that we should come together to think reason and act just as he did dr kings legacy challenges each of us to use the power across america and around the worid to pursue equal justice due process of the law and true liberation for all people while we have made progress since the death of dr king the dream has yet to come true as long as inequality exists as long as injustice exists and until we truly become a land of brotherhood with equal justice for all the struggles which dr king had the goals that he set for us will continue the dream will come true when every american can proclaim in a loud clear voice that they are proud of this country and brotherhood is the hallmark of human relations lest not the dream be deferred we should use this day this hour and this year to reaffirm the ideas and the dream he had for america the struggle

administrations threats to veto congress reasonable and compassionate budget plan for fiscal year 1988 sadly the administrations continuing attacks come as no surprise to those of us who care deeply about the millions of elderly and poor americans who have always been at the very bottom of this administrations priority list for 7 straight years americas elderly and poor have been the target of a massive assault by this administration and for 7 years democrats in the congress have fought to shield these most vulnerable americans from the unyielding onslaught of the administration budget ax the administration advances the cynical and convenient argument that americas massive budget deficits simply make it impossible to do more for our elderly and poor yes our deficits are massive yes our deficits require us to make hard choices about our priorities however it is my conviction that many of the problems we face today are the result not of hard choices which the administration has made they are the result of wrong choiceschoices which have placed unfair tax cuts and excessive military spending above the real needs of the american people the administration blames the congress and our party for the tremendous budget defcits now plaguing the american economy but it is not our priorities which have caused the huge deficits these past 7 yearsdeficits which dwarf anything our republic has ever before experienced rather it the policies and priorities of this administration which are more than anything else responsible for the deficits we face whats really driving the deficit based on cbo figures from the early years of this administration the impact of tax cuts and excessive military spending more than equaled the huge deficits burdening america lets take a look at some of the numbers in every fiscal year between fiscal year 1981 and fiscal year 1987 the administration has demanded more increases in the military budget and more cutbacks in domestic programs during this period defense spending increased more than 40 percent while domestic discretionary spending decreased 21 percent moreover this 21 percent decrease represents the average reduction in domestic discretionary programs some programs such as subsidized housing and employment and training programs have been cut over 60 percent suppose for a moment that the administrations defense and revenue priorities since fiscal year 1981 had not been put into effect according to the house budget committee defense spending in fiscal year 1986 for example would have been 54 billion lower interest costs would have been 39 billion lower and revenues would have been 66 billion higher had these administration priorities not been put into effect thats a total of 159 billion that would not have been added to our deficits in fiscal year 1986 alone sadly however those administration priorities were put into effect and it is those priorities which are driving the deficit today contrary to what this administration would like to have the american people believe it has never once sent a balanced budget to congress no this administration has instead repeatedly sent the congress budgets with large deficits resulting from grossly misplaced priorities fortunately we democrats have succeeded in softening the blows inflicted upon the most vulnerable americans by these misplaced priorities unfortunately however we have so far not succeeded in changing the basic thrust of these priorities despite our efforts this administration has largely succeeded in shielding high income people and large corporations from contributing their fair share to the nations support it has succeeded in shielding the wasteful military from the kinds of massive cuts which have been inflicted upon critically needed domestic programs for americas vulnerable children elderly and poor what about the effects of this administrations priorities on specific programs that affect the everyday lives of americas elderly and poor what about the effects of these priorities on programs like medicare and medicaid which protect americas sick and frail when they need medical care what about the effects of these priorities on the social security housing health and human services programs which are supposed to make up the safety net protecting americas elderly americas disabled and americas poor from catastrophe and ruin most of these programs have been threatened often and cut repeatedly by the administration budget ax as a result americas most vulnerable people have suffered desperately over the past 7 years that suffering will continue to grow unless we act decisively and quickly lets begin with medicare which has suffered cumulative spending reductions of 34 billion since fiscal year 1981 in 1981 beneficiaries paid medicare part b premiums of 11 today they are paying 17 90 an increase of 63 percent in just 6 years the amount beneficiaries must pay for the first day of hospital care has risen from 204 to 520 over the same period thatsa whopping 150 percent increase incredibly the medicare reductions which have been put into effect over the past 7 years represent only a portion of the reductions which the administration has wanted and it has continued to press for large medicare reductions in its fiscal year 1988 budget the administration is asking for medicare part bpremium increases that would add 11 4 billion to beneficiary costs over the next 5 years meanwhile it doubles research on antisatellite weapons of questionable feasibility the medicaid program has also suffered heavily under this administration today medicaid protects fewer than half of americas poor given this administrations record of insensitivity to our nations most vulnerable citizens it is sad but not surprising that the administrations proposed medicaid cuts would total 1 3 billion in fiscal year 1988 and 19 5 billion over the next 5 years the administrations proposals would result in a fiscal year 1988 cut of over 50 per beneficiary the magnitude of the administrations proposed reductions goes far beyond what states could absorb socalled savings under these proposals would jeopardize the neediest among us and shatter our staterun programs the administration has also repudiated its longstanding promise not to cut into the social security program the quality of services provided to the poor elderly and disabled has been repeatedly threatened by administration proposals to reduce social security staff by more than 20 percent in each of the last 5 years most recently the administrations fiscal year 1988 budget requested 5 092 staff below congressional appropriation levels despite consistent rejection by congress of these staff reduction proposals the administration has continued to reduce social security staff below congressionally authorized levels through attrition and through its failure to hire any new staff perhaps the administrations most relentless assault on americas needy has been its attempt to eliminate all funding for any lowincome housing construction rehabilitation and senior citizen housing although congress has rejected many of these proposals federal assistance has been drastically reduced by more than 70 percent over the past 6 years the administrations budget proposals for fiscal year 1988 would all but end any federal housing assistance for lowincome americans and senior citizens despite the fact that nearly half the residents of hudassisted housing are among the poorest of our lowincome elderly this administration has also proposed the total elimination of the lowincome weatherization program and legal service assistance to the poor substantial reductions in funding were proposed for the lowincome energy assistance program the community service block grant program the job training partnership acts dislocated worker program and transportation assistance in the first 4 years of this administration spending on the aged was cut by a cumulative 26 5 billion grants funding locally provided health and social services received cuts ranging from 22 to 39 percent one initiative by this administration the blockgranting of social services virtually assures that older minority persons will not receive services which have been designed to serve their special needs programs are less likely to be culturally sensitive adequately trained personnel may not be available to administer supportive services and services are much less likely to be located in the most appropriate community settings lowincome senior citizens have been particularly hurt by reductions in food stamp eligibility and benefits although not generally identified as an elderly nutrition program one out of five households receiving food stamps have at least one elderly member making the food stamp program this nations largest elderly nutrition program despite administration talk of preserving a safety net lowincome elderly have been hurt most by this administrations misplaced priorities and have suffered a great loss as a result of this administrations misdirected policies the time has come to be brutally honest with ourselves and with the american people the administrations priorities have had devastating effects on americas most needy and most vulnerable citizens children the elderly the sick and the poor have all suffered horribly because of the misplaced priorities of this administration just a few months ago the adminstration described its budget proposal as a plan a hope a vision of what america is and where it is going but if you are poor homeless hungry or sick in america the administrations budget provides no plan no hope and no vision of what america is and where it should be going just look at america in the seventh year of this administration 12 6 percent of americas elderly still live in poverty including 31 5 percent of americas black elderly and 23 9 percent of americas hispanic elderlymore than half of indian elderly live below the poverty level 15 6 percent of americas elderly women live in poverty including almost 20 percent of women over the age of 85 in 1980 19 cents was spent on subsidized housing for each dollar spent for national defense by 1985 the administration proposed less than 1 1 2 cents be spent on housing for every dollar spent on the military two out of every five elderly americans consume too few calories proteins or basic vitamins and minerals to meet even minimal requirements for good health outofpocket health costs consume 16 percent of elderly income more than wher medicare and medicaid began even without further cuts outofpocket costs are projected to consume up to 18 5 percent of elderly income by 1991 thirtyseven americans are uninsured for any health costs 200 million americans are underinsured against the costs of catastrophic long term illness sadly what i have outlined here is just the tip of a large and threatening iceberg much more can and must be said about this administrations relentless assault against americas elderly and poor the words we have heard today paint a tragic portrait of americaan america in which pebple are suffering because of the misplaced priorities of an insensitive administration americas elderly and poor have been the target of this administrations assault for 7 long and tortuous years far too long for a compassionate nation contrary to what administrations speechwriters would like for us to believe its priorities are way out of sync with those of the american people time after time the american people have reaffirmed their compassionate commitment to protecting our most vulnerable citizens in keeping with that commitment time after time democrats in congress have fought back and tried to shield americas poor its homeless its elderly and its infirm democrats in congress have fought to strengthen programs weakened by the administration we fought to protect and expand the older americans act the house version of this very important bill contains provisions to help low income and minority elderly including native americans and others with the greatest social and economic needs for 7 straight years we have repeatedly fought to save medicare and medicaid from destruction this spring our house budget resolution once again protected both of these critical programs from major cutbacks and precluded any increases in outofpocket costs to beneficiaries just last week we acted to provide an extra measure of medicare protection against catastrophic illness however much remains to be done especially in the areas of longterm care and the medically indigent but the struggle continues and the challenge remains this administration as demonstrated by its veto threats and its budget proposals for fiscal year 1988 fully intends to continue its relentless assault this congress and these democrats fully intend to block that assault and strengthen the protective shield surrounding americas most vulnerable"], [0.0016654133796691895, 0.9983345866203308, 1, "in response to the gentleman let me point out that this legislastion in no way preempts states and states rights it clearly grandfathers all existing systems that states have in place today are in process of putting in place for monitoring existing nuclear powerplants and keep in mind that we have had nuclear power plants in this country in excess of 30 years today in addition to this the bill specifically gives states the ability to receive the same information that the nuclear regulatory commission would be receiving in the event of an accident the exact same parameters and the bill asks the states to pay for their share of this information of collecting this what is wrong with that and finally let me respond by

radioactive material and relevant meteorological conditions subsection c requires the data system to be operational within five years after the date of enactment section 3 sets forth the requirements of commercial nuclear power reactor licensees with respect to routine operation of the data system licensees are to first continuously record the requisite data and retain the record for 24 hours second be prepared to transmit the requisite data in the event of a nuclear emergency and third transmit the data to the nrc in the course of periodic tests of the system section 4 sets forth the

experiencing the emergency to transmit the data both current and that recorded over the preceding 24 hours to the nrc subsection b requires the nrc to first monitor the data second assess the severity of the emergency third assess the actions necessary to minimize onsite and offsite consequences of the emergency fourth assess the adequacy of the licensees response fifth ensure that appropriate state and local officials are adequately informed about offsite radiological conditions and sixth advise the licensee based upon the chairmans assessment of the situation although subsection b charges the commission with specific emergency response functions it is intended that authority to perform emergency response functions under this act would vest in the nrc chairman in accordance with section

health center amendments of 1988 allow me to give a brief legislative history of this bill the senate passed s 2385 on june 13 1988 on june 28 1988 the house passed a similar bill h r 4503 by voice vote subsequently the house amended s 2385 with the text of h r 4503 and sent s 2385 as amended to the senate with a request for a conference the senate took no further action on the bill but did ask for a meeting in meeting with members of the senate labor and human resources committee the house appointed conferees were able to resolve all differences with bipartisan support in both the house and the senate rather than proceed with a conference committee the house conference agreed to bring the bill back to the house on the suspension calendar on friday july 29 1988 the senate amended the house amendment to s 2385 by voice vote the senate amendment before us represents the bipartisan agreement worked out by the house conferees the community and migrant health centers programs are the centerpiece of our nations effort to provide primary health care to medically underserved areas in conjunction with the national health service corps these two programs are carefully targeted to reach the most vulnerable citizens who have little or no access to reasonably priced primary health care services in addition to this basic role it is the community and migrant health centers that the congress has looked to when there has been a crisis with health care delivery when unemployment was high and people lost their health insurance in 1983 when the numbers of homeless people began to rise and when we saw little improvement in infant mortality rates the congress provided funds to community and migrant health centers to address the new health care needs now with the number of uninsured individuals and families rising to record levels i believe it is imperative that we maintain and expand these two programs s 2385 as amended provides the necessary authorizations for fiscal years 198991 for grants to the community and migrant health centers as well as for the continuation of the infant mortality initiative through the centers which was begun last year in resolving the differences between the house and the senate bills the house conferees agreed to accept two provisions from the senate bill that i want to explain this bill as amended contains a senate provision requiring that grant and contact decisions be made by the central office of the health resources and services administration hrsai this provision is intended to assure that final grant contract decl ions are made in hrsas central office by retaining this authority in the awarding of grants and contracts and by monitoring the implementation of those grants and contracts the central office can assure that national program goals and requirements are consistently followed by all 10 hhs regions the regional offices would continue to perform their current functions including working closely with health centers and their communities and with state and local governments regional offices are in the best position to assure that all interested and responsible parties are coordinated and that local needs are being met under the bill as amended the only major difference for the regional offices would be that they would not make the final decisions on grants and contracts but instead would make recommendations to the central office of hrsa the other provision involves the authority to construct new facilities for community and migrant health centers current law authorizes the secretary to assist community and migrant health centers in developing medical care facilities that are appropriate for the type and volume of services that are offered by the centers in carrying out this authority the secretary is allowed to make grants for the acquisition or modernization of existing buildings this authority has proven to be inadequate because it does not provide for the expansion of existing buildings or for the construction of new buildings in those limited circumstances where there are no medical care facilities in the area to be served by the centeror the existing medical care facilities are not available for acquisitionand other existing buildings cannot be modified to serve as medical care facilities the bill as amended would provide new authority to the secretary to make grants for the expansion of existing buildings and for the construction of new buildings in certain limited circumstances the secretary could make a grant for construction if the secretary determines that first a particular center would not have appropriate medical care facilities by acquiring modernizing or expanding the existing buildings in the area in which the center need to be located and second the center has made reasonable efforts to raise the necessary construction funds from other public and private sources it is expected that this new construction authority will be needed in few cases but that in those cases it will be essential for health care services to be provided this bill has strong bipartisan support i urge all members to join in supporting this important bill i

involved in a motor vehicle injury accident during a 75year lifetime is better than 86 percent nhtsa also has provided some startling facts about automobile related fatalities and injuries approximately 3 528 000 people were injured in traffic injuries in 1985 there were 23 192 passenger car fatalities and 5 763 light truck fatalities in 1985 on average one life is lost every 12 minutes in traffic accidents in 1985 91 percent of the occupants o killed in auto accidents were not wearing their safety belts unrestrained automobile occupants were 40 percent more likely to be injured in an auto accident and twice as likely to require hospitalization as restrained occupants the facts on the record demonstrate that safety belts save lives and prevent injuries in the past few years more than half our nations state legislatures have made substantial process in enacting mandatory seatbelt use laws since 1984 29 states and the district of columbia have enacted mandatory safety belt use laws each of these laws has the objective of reducing deaths and injuries in motor vehicle crashes the fact is that virtually every study produced on the effects of increased belt use indicates that lap and shoulder safety belts can reduce the risk of fatal or serious injury by between 45 and 55 percent these laws work safety belt use has dramatically increased currently safety belt use in states that have enacted belt use laws averages about 45 percent ranging from 78 percent in north carolina to 23 percent in kansas the unitedstates department of transportations center for statistics and analysis has documented the success of increased safety belt use in terms of lives saved and injuries prevented among front seat passenger vehicle occupants safety belts saved about 2 200 lives in 19861 750 in states with belt use laws among front seat passenger vehicle occupants safety belts prevented about 25 000 moderate to critical injuries in 1986 20 000 in states with belt use laws at the current use level in belt law states45 percentbelts would have saved 3 100 lives if all states had belt laws in 1986 at the high use levels achieved in some other countries85 percentbelts could have saved 10 000 lives if all states had belt laws in 1986 the national highway traffic safety administration also indicates that safety belt use has dramatically increased since 1982 nhtsas yearly national safety belt use survey of 19 cities has documented a safety belt use rate increase from 11 percent in 1982 to 42 percent in the first half of 1987 an interesting fact in this survey was that among the seven cities without belt laws belt use was only 27 percent among the 12 cities with belt laws in effect belt use was 51 percent an important aspect of safety belt use that cannot be overlooked is child safety seats in passenger vehicles these statistics are worth looking at the national center for statistics and analysis reports that among children under 4 child seats saved about 200 lives in 1986 with 100 percent correct use child seats could save about 500 lives per year child seat use among children 4 and under in the 19 cities survey was 72 percent in 1986 it goes without saying that one of the most important aspects of educating the public about the advantages of increased safety belt and child restraint use is the active involvement of the many law enforcement educational industrial state medical consumer insurance and safety organizations in promoting this sound policy objective all too often the efforts of these organizations and individuals go unnoticed their wide range of support for national safety belt use day and other activities associated with vehicle safety programs is testimony to the national recognition of the critical importance of safety belt use the good work of these organizations are a genuine part of the success we celebrate today for that reason these organizations should be commended for recognizing the importance of buckling up

same goal in central america we have a difference of what strategy might accomplish that goal we all want peace and protection against real threats to our security i think we ought to understand that when we engage in these discussions there is a peace plan underway in central america and the question is what do we do here and how does it affect that peace plan some of us feel very strongly that to provide lethal aid which would derail the peace plan will be very counterproductive to us and to the people in the region we need to do what we can to give that peace plan a chance to work the real question before the house of representatives is what are we going to send to central america are we going to continue to send guns to guerrillas and guns to governments or are we finally going to begin to send what our neighbors so desperately need food medicine and clothing the kind of help one neighbor would normally give to another neighbor are we also going to help pursue peace not try to derail it the proposal before us offers two fresh approacnes and combines them as a transit or a bridge to peace for a short time period we say to the contra soldiers that we will provide you with sustenance needed to maintain life we have a responsibility for this peaceful aid this shortterm survival assistance of food and medicine to the young men and women in the hills while the final step of being taken in a peace process to provide lasting peace so that these folks can come back and join their families but more than this sustenance to the contras there is another part of this package providing aid to the children of that region the second part of the package is the childrens survival fund of genuine humanitarian aid which i helped write it recognizes the thousands and thousands of children who are victims of this war the children who have lost their limbs children who have known tile agony of burns and bullets who are hungry or homeless we need to start the healing process to bind up the wounds of war we need to start with these children the childrens survival fund will provide basic food medicine and shelter for the children victims of this war prosthetic devices for amputees treatment for the burn victims lifesaving immunization and oral rehydration therapy for victims and orphans during a trip to that region some while ago i met a young woman in a refugee camp on the border between nicaragua and honduras she was holding her 6monthold son in her arms who was desperately ill it appeared he would probably not live the mother asked for help and there was not anything i could do and there was precious little medical help in that refugee camp the tears from that sick child i saw that day are our tears too they are tears that congress should not and cannot ignore in this child survival package we finally begin converting what would have been lethal aid to assistance that will give hope and give life to the children of that region let me make one final point in many cases these children live in refugee camps they do not understand or care about the difference between democracy and communism but they know the difference between happiness and sadness they know what suffering pain and injury is i want them also to know what healing is and what opportunity is if we take these steps for both the contras and the war victims in this bill i believe we will promote regional peace and frankly we will help tens of thousands of innocent victims we will be taking two steps the first step and the right step i think the congress can be proud of that again we share the same goal the goal is peace and democracy in that region and the promotion at genuine hemispheric security i think we are close to that goal what we do in this package can assist that goal immeasurably we keep the contras until a peace settlement we help the children and we move this region toward peace i am proud to support this package i would al o insert for the record a more complate statement on the elements on the child survival package section 10 of this resolution children survival assistance is the most re ii 661 markable and important part of this legislation the intent of this section should be clear aid to children as defined under this section is to be distributed based on need not on politics our aim is to provide effective assistance as rapidly and efficiently as possible to children in need and to convert military aid into lifesaving help the language of this section allows the agency for international development the flexibility and responsibility to determine the precise amounts to allocate to each of the named types of assistance and designated groups with the understanding that the aid is for and only for innocent children who need these types of assistance the aid therefore should be allocated equitably by aid based on need both inside and outside nicaragua with at least onehalf of the funds benefiting children living in

approved i should say at the outset that the house moved particularly expeditiously today i had anticipated 2 more hours to finish my research so i will be tomorrow putting into the record some specific excerpts of decisions by judge bork but i am fully prepared today to discuss what is the fundamental point and that is judge bork has been continues to be and on the supreme court would continue to be in enhanced fashion the leading exemplar of the view that if there is a foreign policy dispute between the president and the congress the courts are going to do nothing as judge bork frames that it sounds quite neutral he says if there is a disagreement between the president and the congress about foreign policy the court should abstain in fact as judge bork well knows and as the president almost certainly knows and as attorney general meese undoubtedly knows and that is one of the reasons they designated him in the foreign policy field given the nature of foreign policy actions if there is a dispute between the president and the congress as to what the constitution requires in the foreign policy field and the courts stay out of it the president wins virtually every single time because what we have is a situation where the congress will enact a law and it may have been enacted in the prior administration like the war powers act we have an administration that beueves the war powers act duly enacted is unconstitutional it may be and we ought to be clear legislation that is enacted is not for one administration only the scheme of our constitution is when a bill goes on the books it binds everybody who comes after it unless they find the proper legislative majorities to undo it or if they can get a court to strike it down we have situations where a law putting some restrictions on the presi dents foreign policy activity could have been enacted in the previous administration we have laws that can be enacted over a presidents veto we can have amendments which are enacted as an inevitable part of something the president wants one of our colleagues made a rather big issue in the current hearings about the fact that the boland amendment was adopted as part of an overall package and therefore it did not stand on its own it was an indispensable part of the proceedings the president wanted for aid to the contras it was not stuck adventitiously on an adjournment resolution it was part of the very measure which carried with it aid for the contras had it not been there aid to the contras would not have carried so the boland amendment was not some adventitious element stuck on from nowhere it was part of a compromise in which a majority here said to the president if you want contra aid you have to have this amendment and if you do not take the amendment you do not getthe aid there are a number of ways in which laws restricting the presidents ability to commit this nations manpower or funds overseas particularly in combat situations get put into law we have the undoubted constitutional power using our power to appropriate to put limits on presidential ability to get american money or american troops or american policy into warlike situations there will be times when presidents will not like that and we have in power now an administration that is very explicit this administration believes that the war powers act is unconstitutional that the boland amendment is unconstitutional we have no abstract situation here these people have argued that congress may not use the power of appropriations to put limits on their ability to reflag ships in kuwait to send advisers into a military combat situation here they have said the war powers act is unconstitutional and they have violated it they have sent americans into warzone situations and said we are not going to abide by the war powers act they have announced that the boland amendment did not and could not have a part of the national security council or we cannot prevent the president from preventing a whole lot of things in foreign policy most of us think that we can the way to resolve these disputes because presidents have a right to assert unconstitutionality but they do not have a right to ignore the lawin secret that is inconsistent with trying to get an adjudication but they have a right to say no that goes too far the constitution is not pristine in terms of what the division of powers is when there is a dispute on what the constitution means in foreign policy it will go to the courts and the supreme court of the united states ultimately will be the umpire we are not talking about abstract arguments here but where the law is on the books the war powers act the boland amendment a president of the united states decides or even worse some of his aides decide without telling him handly a hypothetical that the constitution does not apply so the law is violated how do we then decide whether the enactment was constitutional or not judge borks view is that by a variety of doctrines the courts stay out of it so the way it works according to bork is that a law goes on the books that tries to restrict the president from getting into situations which many of the members feel might illegitimately in terms of policy involve us in a warlike situation may illegitimately spend money a lawsuit is brought in the right circumstances and judge bork in every case where such a suit has come before a court in which he sits and the arguments he has used has said that the courts will do nothing in the domestic area that might lead to some pulling and hauling in the foreign policy area let us be very clear if the courts cannot adjudicate the president wins because what happens if we say you should have used the war powers act before going into kuwait or done this before going into beirut with the marines you should do this before and take another nonhypothetical patrick buchanan until very recently one of the closest advisers to the president he published an article that i read in the boston herald a week ago yesterday which said if congress does not do the right thing and give money to the contras the president ought to take that money and send it to the contras anyway well it is not wholly farfetched to suggest that ronald reagan might be influenced in part by a man who was one of his chief advisers and if the president does that under the bork doctrine there is nothing we can do about it because if the courts cannot involve themselves the president wins what judge bork says is well that should be worked out by the normal political process we are talking about situations where the political process has worked as a result of some pulling and hauling and we have a war powers act we have a boland amendment the boland amendment certainly was the product of compromise we are not talking about substituting the court process for the political process what we are talking about is when the political process has worked as it should have worked when congress and the president having wrestled back and forth have put onto the books a law whether it was over a veto or in a prior administration or is the result of an inevitable rider to something the president wanted and that they gave to the contras and if it is on the books and if the president decides annually having participated in that compromise and it did not work out the way he wanted he will fight it and ignore it as we have seen it happen as he says he has the right to do according to judge bork that is the end of it because the courts cannot decide so we have one option we can get our sergeant at arms mr russ and the senate sergeant at arms mr giugni and they can round up an army of pages and doorkeepers and elevator operators and they can go down and arrest the president that is one option the other option is that the president has his way because under the bork doctrine once the president decides that he will simply ignore the law because of constitutional reasons a restriction on his foreign policy that is it the president wins"], [0.002349555492401123, 0.9976504445075989,

health expenses the bill makes important modifications to medicare to limit an individuals outofpocket medical expenses including the cost of extended hospital stays doctor bills and prescription drugs and contains provisions to prevent one spouse from becoming completely impoverished before medicaid will pay the cost of nursing home care for the other it also contains a new medicaid waivsr authority that will help states care for medically fragile infants and young children in nonhospital settings i am especially pleased that the bill creates a new benefit under medicarerespite care to provide temporary relief for a relative or friend caring for an elderly family member who cannot be left alone the select committee on children youth and families recently held a hearing on the sandwich generation that highlighted the concerns of family members who provide continuous care for their elderly dependent parents and their own children at the same time the families who testified expressed an overwhelming commitment and desire to provide a loving home they noted however that limited family support services such as respite care made that task very difficult evidence released at the hearing confirmed that the most pervasive and severe effects of assuming demanding caregiving roles are emotional strain and family stress respite care is essential for these caregivers who often juggle careers child care hou3ework transportation and financial worries according to a study releases at the hearing respite care allows families to maintain their dependent parent at home and avoid institutionalization for a longer period of time families used respite only when they were desperate for help and not as a substitute for family caregiving in addition respite care was the family support service requested more often than any other members of the select committee have heard this request repeatedly from parents foster family carogivers and many who work with families the now waiver is designed to reduce the growing costs of maintaining these medically fragile infants and young children in hospitals and provide them with care in more appropriate and loss costly homelike settings infants and children up to age 5 who have been infected with hiv or who show signs of aids or who were drugexposed and affected at birth and who are or will be receiving foster care assistance under title ive of the social security act would be eligible for the expanded sot of services under the waiver the waiver will give states the authority to include under medical assistance the following set of nonhospital based servcies nursing care respite care physicians services proscribed drugs and medical devices and supplies provided as part of a plan of care for a medically fragile child who without such services would probably remain in a hospital for stays that result in higher total medicaid costs in san francisco alone the savings would be more than 4 000 per child per month the new authority would also waive the medicaid comparability rules and statewideness provisions that can deter states from seeking a waiver and thus allow states to target these needed services better new research conducted by the office of technology assessment also found that for every low birthweight birth averted by earlier prenatal care the unitedstates health care system saves between 14 000 and 30 000 in newborn hospitalization rehospitalizations in the first year and longterm health care costs ota concluded that expanding medicaid to pay for prenatal care for all poor pregnant women is a good investment for the nation i want to call special attention to a significant provision in the bill that protect medically fragile infants in a manner that is both more humane and costeffective the new medicaid waiver authority included in this bill will assist states in moving medically fraglie infants out of longterm hospital care by improving medical and other services available to these children in nonhospital settings in hearings of the select committee over the last few years we have learned about serious and growing problems in providing outofhospital care to growing numbers of medically fragile infants and young children last year when the select committee held a hearing on aids and young children there were approximately 400 reported cases of aids among children under age 5 by mid may 1988 more than 800 cases had been reported among children in this age group even more disturbing are increasing reports of babies being born who have been drug exjune z 1 988 ii13877 posed and may be at risk of hiv infection in new york city one study reported that 1 in 61 babies born last december carried hiv antibodies additionally new york citys infant mortality rate climbed in 1987 after a decade of decline due to substance abuse and aids in san francisco 12 percent of all the births at the county hospital are babies with substance abuserelated problems just a few weeks ago the committee learned that requests for foster care for drugrelated reasons in los angeles county rose several hundred percent between 1981 and 1987 many of these childrensometimes called boarder bables are in state care because their parents are unable or unwilling to care for them these children often have long hospital stays not because they require inhospital care but because of the tremendous difficulty in obtaining and paying for the services needed to care for them outside the hospital yet nonhospitalbased care for these children is not only better for them but has increasingly shown to be cost effective the san francisco fragile infant program which provides a specialized foster care setting with attendant health services for medically fragile infants costs from under 2 000 per infant per month in contrast to 6 375 paid by meditaid to care for an infant in a hospital californias health care system often touted as a model for the nation should serve as a warning instead a report recently released by the southern california child health network warned that the health of californias mothers and babies had begun to deteriorate because parental care services were becoming less available in 1985 californias infant mortality rate increased for the first time since 1965 at a time when policy decisions are driven by budgetary considerations it is especially compelling that the southern california child health network found that an investment of 43 2 million in health care services to the 36 000 pregnant women who go without care each year in california would actually result in savings of 73 4 millionfor a net savings of 30 3 million through avoided hospitalization of newborns the evidence continues to mount that the principal cause of infant mortalitylow birthweightcan be reduced at significant cost savings with earlier and more comprehensive prenatal care the select committee in its report opportunities for success costeffective programs for children 1988 update found that a 1 investment in prenatal care for high risk women can save 3 38 in the cost of care for low birthweight infants while more must be done to address the very real and growing concerns about longterm care and who will pay for it respite care is a key step in any solution to this problem i am especially pleased that this conference report is intergenerational in scope and reasonable in its expansion of medicaid coverage to the most vulnerable groups young and old who live below the poverty line the bill requires states to provide medicaid coverage to pay for medicare premiums deductibles and coinsurance for all medicare beneficiaries with incomes below the federal poverty line equally critically it requires states to provide prenatal care to pregnant women and health care to infants who live in families earning up to 100 percent of the federal poverty line almost half the states still have not opted to cover this vulnerable population leaving millions of women and children remain at risk since 1978 this nation has made virtually no progress in bringing more women into care in during the first 3 months of pregancy fewer than 1 in 4 pregnpnt women receive care in the critical first trimester and this limited access has tragic consequences in 1985 the national neonatal mortality rate failed to decline for the first time since 1960 our colleagues chairman rostenkowski of the committee on ways and means chairman stark of the subcommittee on health and chairman waxman of the subcommittee on health and the

unanimous support for this measure i congratulate mr hawkins chairman of the education and labor committee for introducing h r 4107 the house companion bill to s 2117 and for bringing this legislation before the house today i am proud to be a cosponsor of the chairmans bill mr hawkins has been an advocate for strong enforcement of the age discrimination in employment act for many years he and senator melcher have developed a fair and effective solution to the problems that the eeoc has created as a member of the select committee on aging since it was created in 1974 i have had an excellent opportunity to monitor the effectiveness of the eeoc which has been charged with the responsibility of enforcing the adea since 1979 the adea balances the rights of employers to have managerial control and the rights of older workers to have their employment based on ability and performance rather than age as the number of older americans increases we will likely see more cases of age discrimination in fact we have seen a substantial increase in the number of charges filed under the adea in recent years this has increased the importance of the eeoc in protecting the welfare of older adults unfortunately the eeoc has not adequately responded i believe that the need for our action today is a result of this administrations lack of commitment to fighting discrimination in our society they have shown their contempt for the intent of congress regarding the adea on numerous occasions a former eeoc official called eeocs actions mindboggling incompetence wholesale and systematic management failure and gross insensitivity to the devastating effects of age discrimination upon its victims and our society on january 28 1988 the aging committee conducted a hearing to consider the quality of enforcement of the adea by the eeoc we were shocked by the marks that the eeoc received from our witnesses they failed miserably for example the testimony of mr charies e mckeag iii a former goodyear tire rubber co executive was a heartwrenching account of the failure of eeoc to uphold his rights and protect his future security by allowing the statute of limitations to run out on his case furthermore we have learned from the eeoc that there are over 900 similar charges that have been allowed to exceed the adeas 2year statute the seattle wa district office of the eeoc reports some 50 charges which have slipped past the statute of limitations these working men and women have lost their day in court unless we in congress act to correct eeocs mistakes the eeoc failed to protect the rights of almost 1 000 persons and failed to process their claims so that they could protect themselves by pursuing civil action this bill s 2117 will extend the already expired statute of limitations for an 18month period for persons whose claims were affected by eeoc inaction this will assist those who filed timely charges with the commission after december 31 1983 but did not bring a civil action on their claims and who neither had their claims conciliated by the eeoc nor were notified of the disposition of their charge and their right to sue in addition this legislation requires the eeoc to notify these persons of their rights under the adea and that they have been granted an 18month extension of the statute of limitations it also includes a requirement that the commission submit periodic reports to congress regarding the number of persons with claims the number of persons notified and the disposition of their charges it is my hope that these provisions will assist those that have been denied their rights under the law and prevent future necessity for such corrective action we must make no mistake about age discrimination it is a devastating form of unfair treatment which inflicts economic psychological and social hardships on its victims recourse is often too late and too little for a person whose career has been shattered with the quick blow of a company trying to reduce its payroll i believe that those of us who support the goals of the adea have been and will continue to be willing to support the necessary funding to allow the eeoc to do its job well however it will take more that just money to effectively run the eeoc it will take a stronger commitment from its chairman mr thomas and the administration i regret

homemarch 5 1 987 less people in america today than at any time since the great depression despite the last 4 years of economic recovery the homeless population has been growing at the rate of about 25 percent a year and the number of homeless is expected to increase still further unless action is taken the explosion in the number of homeless americans has outrun the ability of local governments and charitable organizations to cope with the problem cities across the country report that homeless peopleincluding families with childrenare routinely being turned away from emergency shelters due to the lack of space efforts to deal with the homeless crisis have been hampered by persistent myths about who the homeless are why they are in such a desperate situation and what can be done to help them there are six myths which perpetuate a distorted picture of the homeless these myths are first most of the homeless have always lived this way second the homeless are almost entirely made up of single adults third the vast majority of the homeless are the chronically mentally ill who generally choose to be homeless fourth state and local governments and charitable organizations have the resources to handle the homeless problem fifth economic growth will solve the problem and sixth the federal government cannot afford to deal with the homeless the facts are first most of the homeless have become homeless only in recent years second families with children are the fastest growing group among the homeless now comprising almost onethird of the homeless population third the mentally ill which make up only 29 percent of the total number of homeless are not a majority of the homeless and while some do refuse assistance most mentally ill homeless have not chosen to live that way fourth existing shelter programs are already filled beyond capacity despite the best efforts of charitable organizations and local governments to create more shelters fifth there is no correlation between an expanding economy and solving the homeless problem in fact the fastest growth in homelessness has occurred during the current economic recovery and sixth modest andtargeted federal funding can greatly improve the lives of the homeless without straining the budget in response to the alarming increase in homelessness in the last few years homeless relief legislation has been a high priority of this congress on january 21 the democratic steering and policy committee adopted a resolution urging prompt enactment of legislation and appropriations to care for the homeless the legislation before us today is the first important step in realizing this goal h r 558 authorizes 500 million in new budget authority in fiscal year 1987 for a variety of homeless aid programs the funds autnorized are largely for existing local programs that will be unable to meet the needs of the homeless during fiscal year 1987 without additional assistance notably all funds appropriated under this bills authorizations would remain available until expended h r 558 authorizes for fiscal year 1987 funding for the following an existing emergency food and shelter program an ongoing program for rehabilitating buildings into temporary shelters support services for the homeless at group homes rental certificates for lowcost rental housing new permanent housing for the handicapped homeless conversion of underutilized government property into facilities for assisting homeless families and individuals and outpatient health care and mental health services for the homeless in addition food assistance for the homeless reported out of the agriculture committee have been incorporated into the bill by the rules committee these provisions would not increase spending for fiscal year 1987 but would authorize increased spending of 225 million in fiscal year 1988 through fiscal year 1990 for food assistance to the needy these provisions amend the food stamp program to better target benefits to the homeless and to prevent homelessness expand the surplus cheese program and reauthorize the temporary emergency food assistance program through fiscal year 1990 as a representative from southern west virginia i am very much concerned with the plight of the homeless the residents of my congrssional district have been burdened with failing industries and the ensuing high unemployment rates for the past decade while the figures on what monetary relief this bill will provide to west virginia are either nonexistent or very rough in nature i have gleaned some hope for my states future ability to address the homeless situation through the assistance of this measure while most of the money is distributed on a competitive grant basis there are a handful of programs which are funded on a formula derived basis i have obtained tentative figures for the amount which would be made available to west virginia on three of these programs of the 225 million provided for emergency fiscal year 1987 funds for programs administered by the housing and urban development 100 million would be for the emergency shelter grants program this program provides grants for the renovation rehabilitation or conversion of buildings into emergency shelters to expand the supply of shelters for the homeless hud distibutes the grants to local governments which can use the grants themselves or distribute funds to private charitable organizations up to 15 percent of these grants can also be used for supportive services for the homeless such as job counseling and health services under the bill grant applicants could apply for a waiver of this 15percent cap on supportive services funding if appropriated roughtly 739 000 of this money would go to west virginia approximately 523 000 would be at the governors discretion while the following amounts would be allocated to the accompanying major cities 67 000 to charleston 70 000 to huntington 32 000 to parkersburg and 47 000 to wheeling the bill authorizes atotal of 70 million in additional fiscal year 1987 funds for an existing food and shelter program and for the community services block grant program to provide food shelter and services to the homeless 50 million of this would be authorized for the community services block grant program administered by the health and humanservices department the 50 million would be reserved for services for the homeless and would be given only to local community action agencies that are already providing services food and shelter to the homeless an estimated 538 000 of this amount would be distributed in west virginia the remaining 20 million of this 70 million is earmarked for the ongoing emergency food and shelter program administered by the federal emergency management agency this program provides funds to charitable organizations and local governments that run food and shelter programs for the homeless roughly 224 100 of this money would go to west virginia with approximately 17 100 at the governors discretion the counties in my congressional district would receive roughly 60 000 of this amount the amounts of federal funds that are being discussed to address the homelessness crisis are minimal when compared to the overall size of the federal budget the cost of h r 558 is in fact less than half the cost of one trident submarine furthermore federal dollars spent now can avoid higher costs to the federal treasury later initiatives taken now to prevent the growing number of families and working poor from becoming homeless in the first place will reduce future public expenditures to help move these people back into mainstream society studies have shown that every additional week spent without a home tends to create further dependency only adding to the ultimate bill paid by american taxpayers with homelessness getting worse by the month it makes fiscal sense for the federal government to target resources to reverse this trend before the cost in lives and dollars gets still worse finally providing the minimum needed for survival is one of the core responsibilities of government just as the federal government has a responsibility to protect the country against foreign attack it also has a responsibility to assure that everyone can be sheltered and fed at least at minimum levels while some government programs should be curtailed or eliminated in the fact of budget deficits giving people a place to sleep at night and food to survive are not luxury items in a decent society the

year i was pleased to join as an original cosponsor as i recognized the importance of preserving tropical forests and their unique wildlife i have been fortunate to deal with insular issues affecting samoa since i fiist came to congress my work has taken me to samoa where i have witnessed the beautiful and diverse flora and fauna of the islands and coastal areas i was equally impressed by the tospitable and proud people of the territory of american samoa they have good reason to be proud the tropical islands of samoa are an often overlooked scenic natural resource of the united states american samoa has one of only three tropical rain forests under unitedstates jurisdiction puerto rico has the beautiful el yunque hawaii has the highly vulnerable forest in the hawaii volcanoes national park and american samoa has the third the diminution of tropical forests worldwide is accelerating with numerous adverse impacts on our environment there exists a considerable amount of interest in the congress as well as elsewhere in the government and among private organizations to stem stop or even reverse the decline of world tropical forests it appears to me that we should first do whatever we can to preserve our own tropical forests a very important factor in sustaining the tropical forests of samoa is a small and often misunderstood animal pteropus samoenis or flying fox a symbiotic relationship exists between these little animals and the tropical forests they need each other to survive the flying fox helps to pollinate the trees and the forest provides safe refuge it is anticipated that a national park would help protect the forests and the flying foxes so that both will continue to thrive and contribute to the environment in our exuberance to establish a park and preserve the forest we have been careful to remember first and foremost the people of samoa they know their islands better than anyone the culture of samoa revolves around the land and respect for nature in agreeing to the cession of the samoan islands of tutuila aunuu and the manua group the chiefs requested that the indigenous ownership of lands by samoans be preserved therefore the legislation provides for the secretary of the interior and the governor of american samoa to enter into a 50year lease of the lands and waters in the park with the option to extend the lease on or before its expiration if the lease is not extended the administration of the park would be transferred to the governor the secretary and the governor would negotiate the amount of the lease payments which would be disbursed by the governor to the villages and families located within the park the high court of samoa would determine the amount of the payments to individuals thus the park would be established without federal ownership of the land prior to the establishment of unitedstates jurisdiction in samoa in 1900 the samoan people had inhabited the islands for thousands of years the people had long recognized the vulnerability of animal and sea life and had incorporated strict conservation methods as part of their way of life in addition it was customary for the chiefs to monitor the population sizes of various species of fish once the number of fish neared the threshold of endangering the continuing viability of the species a temporary ban on taking that type of fish would be instituted the ban which is called tapu in samoan would not be lifted until the chiefs determined that an adequate population base existed given the samoans historical concern for the environment it is not surprising that there is widespread support in samoa for a park that would continue to preserve the islands natural resources under h r 4818 the park will also seek to potect the traditions and customs of samoa subsistence farming and subsistence reef fishing as have been traditionally used in the past will be allowed to continue in addition the access to park areas will provide for the traditional subsistence harvesting of breadfruit coconuts yams kava wild fruits and vegetables and plants for medicinal purposes the park will also permit the careful and customarily limited extraction of native trees to be used in traditional samoan houses and ware as land in samoa is such an important issue the legislation provides that the boundaries of the proposed park area will be clearly defined and mutually agreed to by the governor and respective villages before publication of the park maps h r 4818 also requires the secretary of the interior to develop a program to train native american samoans to work in the park and to extend a hiring preference to these individuals to ensure that the park employees are familiar with the samoan islands the people language and traditions i am confident that there are adequate native american samoans as clearly defined in the bill qualified to meet the staffing needs of the park the real employment opportunities that the national park offers however will be generated from business established in samoa to support the increase of visitors the villages families and individuals of american samoa can provide tours food and lodging as well as other services to visitors to the national park of samoa a great deal of time and effort have been invested by many individuals and organizations to help make the dream of a

the needs of the american public this years total new budget obligational authority is almost 10 billion below fiscal year 1988 in fiscal year 1988 our bill had 56 18 billion in total obligational authority and this year it is down to 42 512 billion the funding levels of this bill are within the proposed levels in the presidents budget 27 million below the presidents request and 1 986 million below the 302b allocation and the outlay allocation the bill is in line with last years budget summit agreement three major programs that were expanded this year include the women infants and children nutrition program the food safety inspection service and tie food and drug administration first the wic program has been increased by nearly 127 million for fiscal year 1989 above the 1988 level and is more than 52 million above the presidents request this program has proven itself over and over again as one of the most effective methods of inprovlng our nations future citizens health and prosperity unfortunately funding limitations have prevented us from being able to serve even half of those eligible for the program wic is not the only nutrition program other nutrition programs help disseminate information vital to our citizens health through the human nutrition information service and send food for peace to africa asia south america and other regions of the world where there is a shortage of food we have provided funds to help serve nutritious meals for both the young and the elderly of the united states through programs like the school lunch program and the elderly feeding programs under title iii of the older americans act of 1965 second the food safety and inspection service has been increased by more than 12 9 million above fiscal year 1988 to 404 954 000 this is a vital program to assure that americans have meat and poultry products that are wholesome unadulterated and properly labeled and packaged while americans enjoy a nutritious abundant food supply we must be ever vigilant to ensure that our meat and poultry products are the best and safest possible third the food and drug administrations appropriation las been increased by more than 31 million to 481 844 000 for fiscal year 1989 the primary goal of the fda is to protect the consumer by setting standards on food testing drug safety conducting research on health hazards and helping to promote orphan drug development although may important issues are addressed in this bill none is more vital than providing assistance to our farmers and ranchers agriculture has been and will continue to be the backbone of americas economic military and political strength unfortunately the backbone of america has lost over 261 000 farmers and ranchers or 11 percent of the farm population since 1981 on the other hand you and i have both heard how much better off our agricultural producers were in 1987 the united states had record net cash farm income totalling 57 billion in 1987 compared to 52 billion in 1986 and 47 3 billion in 1985 estimates for 1988 earlier this year indicated an income in the 50 to 55 billion range but that was before the drought began to take affect and this level cannot be sustained and will fall in 1988 but for now the good news is that the ccc needs only 8 8 billion to restore prior years lossesa substantial drop from 14 3 billion of a year agoanother positive sign of the improvement in the agricultural economy last year also dramatic increased exports are helping to reduce total spending on agriculture the number of farm workers in the civilian labor force is 2 75 million s of april 1988 when added to the 20plus million workers who support the production and delivery of food and fiber to our citizens you have the largest single industry in the united states agriculture employs as many workers as the transportation steel and automobile industries combined one of the reasons our country has been able to achieve so much is so little of our family income is used to buy food in fact our families spend the smallest percent of their income for food than families in any other country in the world only 12 3 percent for all food and 7 9 percent for food purchased for use at home for every dollar spent on food last year only 25 cents went to the producer while athome expenditures for food averaged a 31 cents return to the farm away from home food

investigate the iran initiative to determine what went wrong and to take corrective action we must act resolutely to reassure them of the integrity of their government we must also act expeditiously to avoid paralysis of government and to ensure that america remains strong in its relations with foreign countries accordingly i strongly supported the preliminary investigations done by the foreign affairs and intelligence committees and i applauded appointment of an independent counsel i fully support the need for the house iran committee investigation the interests of the nation lie in getting all the facts of the iran initiative quickly getting them out to the american people and taking corrective action the interests of the nation also lie in protecting our national security secrets in my view this resolution comes up short on both points the resolution requires the iran committee to report to the house by halloween thats too long to wait various committees of the house have already done much of the basic spade work in the investigation which enables the iran committee to complete its work expeditiously it should be required to make every effort to complete its work by april 15 if developments so required it could ask the house for more time there is no justification for the holdup this is an investigation of arms sales to iran and diversion of related fundsthis is not an investigation of the past 6 years of the reagan administration we should finish by april not drag on until october can you imagine what the reaction of this house would have been if the president had said were looking into the matter but we wont let the american people know until october the resolution also defines an outlandishly broad scope for the investigation the issue facing the country is the iran initiative including arms sales and the disposition of the money generated by those sales if the majority wants a general review of the administrations support for freedom fighters around the world under the reagan doctrine or the activities of friendly countries the standing committees of the house are the appropriate forums the iran select committee should focus quickly and effectively upon the matters at issue which concern the american peoplethe iran initiative iran arms sales and what happened to the money paid for the arms moreover it approaches an abuse of congressional power to authorize the iran committee to look into the tax returns of americans all the way back to 1980 the resolution also sets a poor example for spending taxpayers money the resolution provides for openended spending the house at least ought to set an initial budget ceiling for the committee if events so required the committee could seek more money from the house later the most grave concern is that the resolution fails to provide the necessary protection for national security secrets the resolution grants the committee a right of access to such secrets as communications intercepts intelligence funds transactions and national security council proceedings the committee may need access to relevant parts of such material to do its job but the resolutior should mandate the protection for such secrets equivalent to that required for the intelligence committee the resolution should also provide that no committee member or employee of the house can disclose publicly any classified information possessed by the iran committee without the committees approval the committee should not give such approval until it first gives notice to the president with an opportunity for him to explain the effect of the proposed disclosure on the national security if the president objects that the disclosure would damage national security then the information should not be disclosed unless the house votes to approve such disclosure the nation cannot afford another church and pike committee exercise in which leaks damaging to our nations diplomatic and intelligence efforts appear daily in the press on a final matter the answer to a key question has eluded preliminary investigations what happened to the arms sale money it appears that only lieutenant colonel north knows the iran committee should soon consider obtaining a court order compelling colonel north to tell us what he knows that order woudl protect against use of the testimony against him and would produce the information that we need i speak out against this resolution with regret the congress and the president share a responsibility to investigate this matter both thoroughly and expeditiously the president is doing his part with his efforts to get the truth out and make all information available the house should do its part by providing a carefully crafted responsible resolution to guide its

bill sponsored in the other body by senator dan evans and his colleague from washington brock adams the entire washington delegation supports this measure the washington parks wilderness bill will go far in protecting three magnificent national parks that are located in my home statemount rainier olympic and the north cascades the legislation would also establish wilderness status for parts of the ross lake and lake chelan national recreation areas by enacting this legislation we will be doing a great deal to guide future park management congress will be setting a firm policy that it intends careful management of the three parks these are some of the most unique natural places in the united states if not the worldranging from miles of uninhabited ocean beaches to dense rain forests to mountain glaciers and alpine meadows we want the parks to remain as beautiful and pristine as they are today this bill will be an insurance policy for the future 118166 cor future generations of park visitors will thank us for the actions we now take on this bill under the bill more than 1 7 million acres of area already within the national park system in washington state would be given a wilderness designation the bill would designate 872 000 acres of wilderness and 594 acres of potential wilderness in olympic national park 635 000 acres of wilderness and 5 226 acres of potential wilderness in the north cascades national park and national recreation area complex and 217 000 acres of wilderness in mount rainier national park why do we need this legislation i represent an area which in recent years hs experienced one of the fastest rates of population growth in the united states the eighth district of washington state including areas east and south of seattle grew 29 percent between 1970 and 1980and continues to grow for many people in the puget sound area of washington state the national parks are convenient places to get away from the stresses of urban and suburban living mount rainier is just a 2hour drive from seattle with substantial population growth these parks are bound to feel the pressures of over development the threat is serious mount rainier the boundaries of which are within my congressional district has insufficient lowlevel elevation to protect the ecological community surrounding the mountain olympic national park has recently been listed as one of the 10 most endangered national parks in the united states by the wilderness society these parks are wilderness today they should remain wilderness tomorrow make no mistake the national park service by and large already does an excellent job of managing these park areas as wilderness this bill seeks to ensure that this careful management continues over many years a wilderness designation would require a high standard of management however the object of the bill is not in any way to discourage recreational use all recreational activities now associated with these park and recreation areas will continue wilderness boundaries in the legislation would be drawn to accommodate existing transportation corridors within the parks including campgrounds and lodges new trail development will also continue to be a high priority certain lands under the bill will be identified as potential wildernesslands that are either not owned by the federal government but targeted for acquisition or on which a nonwilderness use exists that the national park service anticipates terminating potential wilderness would allow the park service to administratively declare the area as wilderness once it has been acquired or the nonconforming use is terminated wilderness boundaries have been carefully considered throughout the bill wilderness boundaries have been drawn to protect private landholdings each park will be assured of continued substantial road access wilderness boundaries have been drawn around both existing roads and those currently in park planning documents what would be limited under a wilderness designation are physical changes which could negatively impact the environmental importance and natural beauty of these areas new road construction would be limited mineral extraction dam construc tion and largescale commercial recreational development would also be strictly limited by a wilderness designation at some point sooner or later we will have to say that limitations on development of these park areas are both necessary and desirable this legislation would ensure that the natural character of these areas take precedence we cannot forget that it is the natural significance of these areas that draw thousands of tourists every year the bill does make provisions for new visitor centers in two new park locations the pacific coast of olympic national park and at an entrance to the north cascades national park in the north cascades the bill is sensitive to the concerns of area residents the stchekin valley in the lake chelan national recreation area is truly unique with no roads into or out of this historic area at the north end of lake chelan its residents are proud of their beautiful surroundings and rightfully protective of their landholdings senator evans and i have sought to carefully protect these interests by specifically excluding the stehekin valley from wilderness status carefully considered wilderness boundaries exclude most of the valley floor from wilderness designation as well as the road far up into the mountains and into the cottonwood campground to the north stehenkin homeowners would be permitted a reasonable use of gravel and firewood for personal use private land private home development and the use of aircraft on lake chelan and the public airstrip in the valley would be protected report language recognizes an agreement concerning the stehekin airstrip made with the state of washington many years ago the proposed legislation would also make a number of necessary administrative reforms for the three parks at the request of the park service several provisions amend unclear and outdated provisions in existing law and clarify the legal authority of the parks other language enables park superintendents to have reasonable latitude in servicing often mountainous road corridors within 200 feet of existing paved roads several technical boundary adjustments with the forest service are also proposed by the bill a boundary adjustment affecting crystal mountain ski regort adjacent to mount rainier woum remove 311h acres from the park and turn administrative authority over to the forest service although subject to debate this seems like the only practical solution to a longstanding administrative problem for the park a portion of a ski lift tower has occupied park land since 1962 this technical exchange is needed so that the crystal mountain resort can make necessary repairs and modifications to continue operation of the lift rather than complicate matters by having the park service issue a special permit for continued operation on parkland the park and forest services have agreed that the continuing nonconforming use should be deleted from the parks jurisdiction as compensation a total of 240 acres of forest service land would be added to mount rainer national park in the areas of backbone ridge on the south and klapatchee point on the west side this exchange will place two park roadsthat briefly cross over into forest service landwholly inside the park putting mount rainiers roads inside park boundaries will ease agency management conflicts in a bill of this size and nature there have been concerns raised that we are trying to do too muchor not enough in this short legislative year i feel that we have done well this bill is certainly not intended to be a license to lockout public use and enjoyment of the parks public access for all including youngsters senior citizens and the disabled will continue to be a high priority people in the parks will continue to be the highest priority parks are for people to my knowledge this is the first attempt to place wilderness protection on national parks on a statewide basis work on the bill has been a

of objection it has raised the administrations first objection states that the bill authorizes 40 7 million more in fiscal year 1988 than was requested actually the committee recommends an increase of 11 9 million above the request as follows there is plus 2 3 million for landsat 4 and 5 and advanced system studies both landsat 4 and 5 are operating beyond their designed lifetime but continue to provide data to users through eosat the additional 23 million provided by the committee in fiscal year 1988 will assure continued operation of the system through the fiscal year as well as provide additional funds to begin development of a muchneeded advanced technology civil earth remote sensing satellite there is plus 6 7 million for severe storm research these additional funds maintain this important research at the fiscal year 1987 level aimed at a wide variety of activities including industry and agriculture and protecting the lives and property of our citizens there is in this bill plus 1 7 million for fire weather agriculture weather and fruit frost warnings these consist of daily forecasts for fire danger rating computations spot forecasts for wildfires and onsite mobile units for large fires within national parklands they include observations forecasts warnings and advisories and issuing of warnings of low temperatures that are especially important in citrusfruitgrowing areas these are services central to the mission of the national weather service and should be maintained finally plus 1 2 million for climate forecast centers these funds are necessary to maintain the current centers these centers are an important link that bring together federal state and private institutions to produce and disseminate climate data and information the committee intends that these climate forecast centers continue and that access to climate data and products be maintained the administrations second objection is that the bill would prematurely authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1989 i cannot agree with this the committee on science space and technology is very familiar with the programmatic and funding needs of noaa for fiscal year 1988 and fiscal year 1989 and these are covered in this bill there is no need for either the committee or the house to devote additional time to noaas fiscal year 1989 authorization finally the administration objects that the bill would impose restrictions on the department of commerces ability to manage effectively the national weather service through closings or consolidations of offices all the bill requires is certification from the secretary of commerce prior to any closing consolidation automation or relocation of any weather service office this provision does not in any way hinder the secretary from taking such actions but only that congress be notified in advance it should be noted that the national weather service has proposed to close 7 offices and reduced staffing in 21 other offices in each of the last 3 years without success because of congressional actions by establishing a procedure for such closings or consolidations the committee has improved rather than hindered the departments ability to manage the

ensuring that our nations children first do have healthy minds and bodies and second are better able to obtain a quality education what is the current status of our child nutrition programs as the vice chairman of the subcommittee on elementary secondary and vocational education which has jurisdiction over our child nutrition programs i believe that we have in place a strong national network of quality programs in which we can all take pride the past present and future success of our child nutrition programs is dependent on a strong federal state and local public and private sector partnership willing to invest the necessary resources to meet the nutritional needs of our nations youngsters when they are in awayfromhome settings at the heart of this network is the oldest and largest of our child nutrition programsthe national school lunch program today the national school lunch program provides nutritionally balanced meals to approximately 24 million school age children or 92 percent of all schoolchildren federal support is provided to participating school districts in a mix of cash and commodity support what level of support the federal government provides is in an inverse relationship to the economic status of the childs family the highest levels of federal support go to meeting the costs of providing meals to our neediest youngsters this is as it should be two important companion programs deserve mention the first is our school breakfast program which is designed to ensure that all youngsters begin their school day with the nutrients necessary to benefit fully from the days educational experience thanks to congressional action during the last congress i am pleased to note that modest increases in both cash and commodity assitance will now be available to improve the overall quality of the breakfast program meal patterns while our school lunch and breakfast programs play a vital part in meeting nutritional needs during the regular school year the summer feeding program complements that initiative by providing nutritious meals to our neediest youngsters during the summer months one of our fastest growing child nutrition activities is the child care food program which essentially provides meal services appropriate to youngsters enrolled in day care centers or family day care homes as more two wageearner families and growing numbers of single heads of households join our labor force the child care food progam will assume an everincreasing role in meeting the nutritional wellbeing of our younger children no overview of the status of our child nutrition programs would be complete without the mention of the special supplemental food program for women infants and childrenmore popularly referred to as the wic program wic is an early health intervention program that seeks to provide individually tailored food packages to lowincome pregnant women new mothers infants and children up to age 5 who are determined to be at nutritional risk medical services and nutrition education round out the wic program benefits wic program benefits cost an average of 30 per month in return studies clearly demonstrate that wic does make a difference in increasing the birth weights of infants of lowincome women who are at nutritional risk and the probability that these infantswill survive and enjoy a normal and healthy childhood what is the challenge facing the 100th congress in the area of child nutrition first we must see to it that the legislative changes enacted during the 99th congress are fully and quickly implemented second we must continue to take a long and hard look at all phases of child nutrition program policies and operations we cannot rest on our laurels so to speak rather we must strive to maximally utilize what will be of necessity limited resources to the end that we meet our commitment to providing for the nutritional wellbeing and improved educational opportunities afforded to all of our children what is at stake has been eloquently stated in the current offering of letters for women infants and children in the usa being conducted by bread for the world children are our future au of them while adequate diets wilu not compensate for the great differences in access to opportunity between those who have and those who do not it is a start food can enable some children to survive and many others

preservation program the pinelands reserve is an area of great cultural historic and environmental significance the pinelands reserve is also the location of the coahnsey aquifer which holds some of the purest pristine water in the world it is a testimony to the pride of all new jerseyans that these 1 million acres most of them pristine are able to exist in the most densely populated state in the country in addition it has been recognized by the united nations as an international biosphere reserve today everyone recognizes the historical and environmental significance of the new jersey pinelands region in 1978 and 1979 the state and federal governments recognized the need to preserve as much of this land as possible and entered into a cooperative agreement which might be termed an experiment the objectives of those who supported the pinelands experiment were to find a unique way to preserve large amounts of environmentally important land while at the same time transferring a controlled level of development from this land to less sensitive areas it pleases me that this experiment has been for the most part a success in spite of this success however there are some weaknesses in the plan these weaknesses are obvious to the people who live in the pinelands whether through loss of property value or cost of policing the region these people have found themselves primarily responsible for paying the bill for the preservation of the pines however i feel and i know that my friend mr hughes agrees that inasmuch as the pinelands are being preserved for all of us then all of us should share in some way for paying the bill therefore when we found that we must continue the acquisition program we felt we must also continue to address the concerns of the people of the region the legislation will continue the land acquisition program established by the original pinelands legislation we have differed though from the original legislation by decreasing the federal share of the funds to 50 percent instead of the 5 percent stated in the original program we have done this in light of the federal budget deficit and the fact that new jersey finds itself in a fairly good fiscal situation additionally the bill restricts acquisition to areas that are either within the preservation areas of the region environmentally sensitive lands that are threatened by adverse development or lands owned by a small landowner who has exhausted all other methods of compensation for the loss of his rights to build seeing the need to compensate landowners for the loss of the right to develop their lands the planning entity established a program of transfer of development credits for every acre of land that a person owns in the preservation region that landowner is entitled to a certain number of pinelands development credits or pdcs these pdcs can be transferred to growth areas in order to allow a developer to build units in excess of what otherwise might be possible it is a unique program that in theory works very well however in spite of the best efforts of the state and the pinelands commission the program has been only marginal successful while we realize that the state has recently established a credit bank in order to facilitate the trading of these credits we feel there is more that could be done to stimulate the program toward that end our legislation calls for the secretary of the interior to perform a study and make recommendations to the state and to the congress as to how this pdc program might work better furthermore in order to establish a method for the 52 local municipalities located within the pinelands area to have a voice in the process the planning entity established the pinelands municipal council the council was not intended to be a legislative body it is more of an advisory body that would provide input to the pinelands commission this council composed of each of 52 mayors has also not been successful congressman huths aid i believe that it should work and to that end this bill also calls for a study of the municipal council in order to provide recommendations as to how it might be improved finally if the pinelands experiment is to succeed it needs to be understood understood by the residents of the region of the state and of the country toward that end mr hughes and i concur that there ought to be a formal interpretive program in the region after much discussion we arrived at an agreement as to how this program should proceed this legislation will provide funding for the pinelands education and interpretive program there are presently a number of sites in the pinelands region that are very well suited to act as sites at which this program should proceed i speak of historic villages state forests and academic facilities many of which presently perform pinelands programs of their own in order to obtain the right combination of the best facilities we have decided to call on the secretary of the interior to design the educational program that utilizes these sites to the greatest extent possible as i have said i believe that the bill before us is a good piece of legislation it will contribute to the continued preservation and understanding of the pinelands area continued land acquisition and the pinelands interpretation and education program operating in conjunction with federal efforts to assist with programs designed to address the concerns of the local citizens will assure the success of the pinelands experiment"], [0.9902474284172058, 0.9902474284172058, 0, "4 weeks ago a

creative financing which will result in the public ownership of thousands of acres of pristine land the passage of h r 4519 will enable the department of the interior to exchange 68 acres of prime federal land in phoenix az for 107 799 acres in south florida owned by the collier family in addition the collier family will pay the federal government approximately 34 9 million in cash the arizonaflorida land exchange act focuses attention on three environmentally significant areas in florida the big cypress national preserve which will be expanded by 83 070 acres the florida panther national wildlife refuge which will be expanded by 5 109 acres and the ten thousand islands wildlife refuge which will be created through the acquisition of 19 620 acres the acquisition of thousands
