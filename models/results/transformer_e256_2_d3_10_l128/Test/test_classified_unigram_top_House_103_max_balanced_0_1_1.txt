committee of the whole yes i am speaking of the small indicla of parllcipatlon in ti political system and the subsequent law suit and possible challenges i must inform you and everyone else that the delegate vote issue is not the issue foremost in the minds of the people of guam for we have a concern with an issue more fundamental and that issue is the relationship of guam with the federal government today i introduced h r 1521 the guam commonwalth act this legisation seeks to improve the relationship between guam and the united states the legislaton maintains the relationship between guam and the united states yet allows guam to have more control over its domestic affairs some of you might ask what is wrong with the current relationship between guam and the federal government nothing unless you believe that the ending of the cold war and the development of the new world order signal a reevaluation of the relationship between guam and the federal government nothing unless you believe that the relationship should be a partnership between guam and the united states nothing unless you believe that the citizens of guam should have the right to determine how they should be governed guam is currently an unincorporated territory an unincorporated territory means that first laws can be imposed upon the people of guam without consultation second any local law can be abrogated by the unitedstates congress third unitedstates citizenship can be taken away from the people of guam fourth guam can be bought sold or traded by the federal government and ffth guam as a territory is in the truest sense a possession h r 1521 proposes restructuring the fundamental political relationship between guam and the federal government to a partnership which recognizes the mutual interests of both parties this new partnership will not affect guams role as a strategic outpost of the military in the western pacific the federal government should and will maintain defense authority in guam if commonwealth status is successful the only difference is that under commonwealth there will be an enhanced sensitivity to guams land needs and planning h r 1521 recognizes guams strategic role and continued reliance upon the united states for its defense and the act acknowledges that defense and foreign affairs are unique federal responsibilities some of you might ask why are the people of guam seeldng commonwealth status why not remain a territory as a territory guam has all of these tax benefits guam desires stability and some control over its status this reminds me of a man who asks his girlfriend why be maried when you are getting all of the benefits without the responslblities of mardage just be happy with the benefits you are getting the people of guam desire stability and control over its status some of you might ask why commonweath status why not statehood why not independence why not free association the voters of guam have made that determination in january 1982 two plebiscites were conducted to give the voters of guam the chance to choose the future political direction of guam the options included status quo statehood incorporation commonwealth independence and free association in the first plebiscite 49 percent of those voting chose the commonwealth option 26 percent chose statehood 10 percent chose keeping the status quo only 5 percent of the voters selected incorporated status while 4 percent opted for independence and 4 percent opted for free association independence later that year a runoff plebiscite was held between statehood and commonwealth choices this vote attracted over 81 percent of the voters an overwhelming 73 percent of these voters supported commonwealth status the voters chose commonwealth status it is believed because it was considered to be the most pragmatic and attainable of the options thus the philosophy of the commonwealth act is to structure a better relationship with the united states a relationship tailored to meet the unique circumstances that exist on guam a relationship tailored to meet the growing aspirations of the people of guam for greater seifsufficlency a relationship tailored to provide a more balanced partnership between guam and the united states besides establishing a partnership between guam and the federal government this legislatilon seeks to correct a historical

to determine how they should be governed and this priviloge this correction of this injustice this fulfillment of a promise was approved by the voters of guam it provides for full and equal participation of all of guams residents in monitoring and implementing this process h r 1521 not only seeks to establish a partnership between guam and the federal government but also seeks to correct

what they have also given us unfortunately is high recession and high unemployment and i rise today in opposttion to the solomon amendment and in strong support of the house concurrent resolution 64

of the recession that has plagued our economy some people look at recent economic figures and claim we do not need to act but i remind those agents of the status quo that jobs are being out not created in the downsized economy that leaves many people out of work many teenagers out on the streets and many families wondering how they will make ends meet in our deliberations it is easy top get lost in the numbers game while forgetting the impact our decisions have on the lives of the people we serve we talk about billions of dollars and thousands 6f jobs but rarely do we focus on the value of a good education or a steady job this stimulus package will create 675 000 additional summer jobs for our youth it will provide extended unemployment benefits to people who want to work but cannot find a job in my region of the country the new york city area 10 percent of the people are unemployed it will invest in infrastructure and education so that we can offer the displaced workers and their children a brighter future because we are required to account for the money we appropriate a dollar figure is attached to these programs and we debate their merits that is responsible government

to educate a healthy child cannot be measured the 753 million we plan to invest in mass transit wil create jobs and improve our ability to move people in and out of our cities can we really tell how much that means to the economic viability of our urban areas or the quality of the environment when we appropriate 3a million to fund service jobs for older americans can we put a price on the

acknowledge that the cause of africanamerican freedom and equality has led to the establishiment of a more just and free america today i would like to discuss one particular chapter in the africanapnerican struggle for freedoma chapter that i had the privilege to participate in and a chapter that i hope we can expand upon here in this congress as africanamerican history month unfolds this february black and jewish americans have begun holding regular meetings in my home district of san diego to advance a progressive dialog of understanding this should not be news most of us in this chamber remember that whenever there was a gathering to discuss strategy for change african and jewish americans were prominent participantstogether twenty nine years ago this summer three americansone black mississipplan and two jewish northernerswere killed in the struggle for equality and justice in the segregated south they were run off the road as they drove at night shot in their car by duly sworn officers of the law and burled in a mississippi river bank three americans not yet old enough to votekilled registering others to vote three americans practically separated at birth by the color of their skinlinked in a mississippi summer by their ideals and convictionsjoined forever at the bottom of a murky river in a haze of violence and bloodshed i know that there are members of this body who will remember all their lives exactly where they were when they heard that schwerner goodman and chaney were dead i know that there are members of this body civil rights activists themselves who heard the news and thoughtthere but for the grace of god go i there but for the grace of god go i i was not in mississippi that summer but i had been there 3 years earlier as a freedom rider and i had witnessed then first hand the attempts to preserve segregation as our bus motored through the kingdom of american apartheid i saw friends beaten and killed i saw mobs attack women i ducked from gunfire i sat for several months in an isolation cell in the mississippi state penitentiary i was drawn south in 1961 as an american and as a jew like many africanamericans i too was raised on stories of violent mobs and armed attacks of vicious prejudice exploding into unspeakable acts of cruelty and horror these stories were related to me in the relative safety of pittsburgh and new york but they conditioned meand other jewish americansto regard discrimination and violence by those in power as a threat to all groups and individuals without power it did not take long for my family to learn that the cossacks and the nazis had spiritual heirs in the united states here we soon learned the armed forces of oppression wore sheets and burned crosses and were no less vicious or cruel than the tormentors we had left behind in europe we also learned that there were those in power who hid behind country club walls rather than white sheets and that their oppression of minority groups while based on the subtle control of the marketplace rather than on the harsh handle of the whip was no less devastating and total and probably more so i relate this personal account to stress and to reinforce the perception of many in the american jewish community we in that community have formed alliances with africanamericans for many reasons we formed them because it was in our best selfinterest to do so we formed them based on mutual need and the shared understanding that our enemies were common and most importantly we formed alliances because we knew that working together we stood a better chance of establishing a just society that would allow all americans to achieve economic justice and political empowerment from the founding of the naacp in the early part of this century through the struggles to establish labor unions in the 1930s up to the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s blacks and jews served with americans from all walks of life in the vanguard of national movements to achieve social justice and political empowerment this partnership has had its high points and low points its successes and its failures together we have witnessed barriers fall and blood shed and we have seen our mutual causes advanced but it seems that we have not always kept our eyes on the prize and as many of us know all too well we have sometimes let misperception and misunderstanding distract us today in 1993 we are forced to ask the question do our shared goals carry greater weight than any differences are the bonds and values that tie us together stronger than the forcesboth internal and externalthat push us apart i believe emphatically that the answer to this question is a resounding yes we have come too far together to turn around we have too far to go to abandon our quest bound together both by the rich legacy that we share and by the possibility and necessity of our future successes jewishamericans and africanamericans must together concentrate on our larger goals for only those who oppose the march of freedom and justice are served by our failure to unite this congress contains the largest number of africanamericans in its history and i expect that this groupmy colleagues will be a decisive force for change together black and jewish hands voted overwhelmingly to elect our new president and together our two communities can help to ensure the kind of change that ournation so desperately needs as we pause today to recognize and honor the historical accomplishments of the africanamerican community blacks and jews stand as much in the shadow of crown heights as we do in the sunshine of our cooperation during the civil rights movement together we must decide to move either into the darkness or the light let us choose our path

economy of this country that he inherited that was in a state of doldrums with people losing their jobs and economic investment on the incline as the president quite correctly pointed out when he came to this chamber in the joint session he inherited an economy that was in very serious trouble an economy that over the last 10 years was causing average american families to lose their earning power even though they were working harder every day and every year an economy that was not reinvesting in itself that as the gentlewoman pointed out by the time president clinton came into office was investing less than 3 percent and we knew that was incapable of generating new jobs in this economy an economy that was seeing the disparities between rich and poor grow ever wider so that among the developed nations of the world we have one of the greatest disparities between rich and poor that exists in the world today and recognizing that something had to be done but it could not be done without some sacrifice it could not be done without some disopline and it could not be done without keeping our eye on the future this president was bold enough and courageous enough to come into this chamber to look us in the eye and to look the american people in the eye and say that if we had the courage of our convictions if we would do what we told the american people for the last 12 years we wanted to do and that is to get government out of the way so that small businesses and entrepreneurs can thrive that we would have the possibility of reviving this economy now for 12 years presidents of this country have been telling this country that they would put an economy in place to allow that to happen but that did not happen because as we now so clearly can see the largest tax decrease in history was given to the wealthy on the theory that they would invest in america in its economy in its people in its capabilities and that would revive the economy they did not do that they speculated they leveraged they absorbed countries they merged companies they leveraged buyouts they ruined savings and loans and they left us a huge huge deficit he said that in fact if we provided that tax cut the deficit would get smaller and of course as we know it did not we tripled the debt the debt of this country in those 12 years so president clinton has decided to take another path he has decided to ask this country to make the kinds of decisions along with this congress to get us out of the way of the growth of this country by proposing the largest deficit decrease in the history of this country by getting the government out of those credit markets for daytoday borrowing for borrowing that is far beyond our means to pay for and make room for american businesses make room for american entrepreneurs make room for americas families since he has put that proposal on the floor of this congress and since the markets and the american people have seen that he is serious we have started to see a revival of this economy as was pointed out by the two previous speakers we have started to see job creation on a monthly basis far in excess of what we saw over the last 4 years we are starting to see people return to work we are starting to see small business formation again we are starting to see people being rehired why because of what the president announced in this chamber and what this house passed and what the senate has passed people are understanding that the cost of doing businesb and living in america is starting to come down as interest rates lower people are able to refinance their debt to refinance their houses mind you we all lived beyond our means in the 1980s but now we have a chance to make that debt manageable and to make some room for the needs of today corporations are able to refinance the debt of 12 13 14 percent 18 percent that they incurred on their debt in the 1980s individuals are able to refinance their credit card debt home owners are able to refinance their homes firsttime home buyers have a possibility of entering a market a possibility for the first time in many years when the discussions in the congress and in the country and in our communities was that our children would not be eligible to own their homes because of the costs of money the interest rates and yet we now see the firsttime home buyers are coming back to the american economy which means that a carpenter an architect an engineer a cement mason and a laborer all get a chance to go back to work we are seeing new business formation we are seeing venture capital coming to the forefront again because those ideas that were not feasible when the prime interest rate was 10 and 11 and 12 percent today are feasible it is 5 and 6 percent so what we are seeing is by removing the government from those credit markets by this pledge by the actions of this house to reduce the deficit by some s500 billion over the next 5 years we now see people understanding that they too will be able to participate in the american economy in the american dream the education of their children will be less expensive this fall than it was last fall the opportunity to buy a car will be less expensive this year than it was last year and that allows the economy to grow and to start to put people back to work how has the president done this he has done this with a series of budget cuts specific enumerated budget cuts some 250 billion dollars worth of budget cuts he ventured into the area where no congress had the courage to go no president had the courage to go and that is to entitlements understanding that this was a matter of national sacrifice and commitment for the future of this country so he put in those budget cuts and then he also recognized that we were going to have to raise revenues either through an energy tax or some increases on the wealthiest people in this country it is not that he is taxing the wealthiest people in this country because he does not like them but the simple fact is the simple fact is that for the middle class in this country wages went down 17 percent but if you were in the top 30 percent of income earners real wages have gone up by 9 percent so we are starting to see that the wealthiest 1 percent of people in this country have garnered more wealth and more assets than any time in our history we think they should contribute to this national effort to revive americas economy finally let me say this that this is really very shortterm medicine for the longterm growth of this country we talk about sacrifice and we talk about budget cuts but if we are willing to make these decisions in the next 3 weeks and present to this president a bill that he can sign we will in fact see that not only the actions that we have seen take place between the first of the year and now on the anticipation of this bill being h4m40 signed but once it is signed into law we will see the confidence of people we will see a road map that will tell them that the government is going to reduce its participation in the credit markets and then they can look forward over a long period of time to reduced interest rates and that will cause additional economic activity so the question is really this should we now make some tough shortterm decisions with respect to our immediate future so that our children and our families and our businesses can prosper over the long term we should we cannot continue to live beyond our means either as families or as a government or as businesses this president my colleagues has given us an opportunity to get the books back into balance to stop that overdependence on foreign capital foreign investment in this country so that we can get hold of our own national economy so we can move on to talk about national health care and trade reforms and actions to make us an economic power in this country that is what is at stake here i can appreciate that the republicans do not like this they must feel terrible envy for this president because this is what their president kept saying they were going to do they never quite did it they did not have the courage to come in here and to level with the american people to rally the american people to recognize just as we see people filling sandbags on the mississippi river day in and day out 24 hours a day people who do not live on that river but they are willing to sacrifice their current job their vacation their time away from school to help their neighbor to help their economy to help this country my colleagues we need to put a

last year i think there is another aspect of this argument we need to consider as well we are reaching a point in our history that our streets are becoming very very dangerous i think we need to take a look at the role that atf plays in making it a safer place for all of us to live the atf itself is a very laborintensive agency in fact about 75 percent of its resources goes to salary and other personnelrelated accounts so a cut in atfs appropriation means a cut in people that means people come off the street whol are out there to protect our citizens the atf also has the best ratio of dollars collected to dollars expended in the federal government at atp we spend about 38 cents and we collect about 100 in revenue that is a pretty decent return on our federal investment also we find that atf is on the front line in the fight against violent crime and terrorism as members recall an atf agent cracked the bomb case at the world trade center in new york we also lost four agents lives in the shootout at waco atf goes after the most vicious and the most violent criminals in our society they work extremely close with state and local offices where we have what is known as the achilles task force which was established by the subcommittee and it is the most successful antigang and drug task force in law enforcement history again i appreciate the efforts of our colleagues in trying to find some areas to save some dollars but i think in this particular case we are in essence shooting ourselves in the foot because the money that goes into atf as i mentioned results in added

such time as i may consume i rise in support of h r 2668 the community investment demonstration act of 1993 this demonstration initiative would authorize hud to provide section 8 assistance to housing projects where a pension fund would enter into a partnership with a nonprofit municipality or other entities to provide investment funds for the construction acquisition or rehabilitation of housing for lowand moderateincome families this measure had been a part of an earlier suspension bill passed by the house addressing several housing initiatives however the provision was withdrawn at the time because of several questions which arose about the proposal the most important of these questions involved the overall role of pension funds in performing social purposes and the safety of these types of investments for the funds because these issues were pension related and not directly germane to the housing subcommittee or the underlying request for authorization i felt a hearing by the labormanagement subcommittee may have been appropriate so that these questions could be discussed as the ranking member of the labormanagement subcommittee the most important concern with this program was the efficacy of these types of investments by pension funds and the need to ensure through statutory language that nothing in this demonstration violated the rules and regulations of the erisa laws which govern pension funds short of a hearing i asked the majority and minority staff to analyze the legislation and provide me any of their concerns for the safety and soundness of pension funds and whether or not erisa laws could be circumvented by this legislation the labormanagement staff and members agreed that the program was conceptually sound because pension funds are already investing in housing projects in the private sector but they recommended adding additional statutory language which would make it clear that erisa laws could not be violated or circumvented in carrying out this program they also recommended and i concur that pension fund investments in this demonstration be limited to the purchase of securities supporting the project or that fund investments be securitized that clarifying language was added to the bill before the house as introduced by chairman gonzalez and myself our housing committees principal concern in this matter is whether the use of pension funds to help meet the affordable housing needs of our citizens is practical and whether we should authorize hud to consider participating in such a program our other critical concern is that we not authorize any program which could jeopardize the future of a pension fund or its participants i believe the use of pension funds for housing investment may be a legitimate use of private funds leveraged by federal housing assistance this legislation is also constructed in such a way that i believe will not jeopardize the future of any pension fund based on this i advised chairman gonzalez that since my principal concerns about the safety of the pension funds and the role of erisa laws had been satisfactorily answered i had no problem with this legislation now with respect to any issues beyond the safety of the pension funds i do not believe these are significant or necessarily relevant to the housing subcommittees decision to authorize this demonstration this initiative is a demonstration program designed to test the feasibility of using limited federal rental assistance to leverage millions of dollars in private sector funds for housing this legislation does not mandate that any pension fund managers participate in this demonstration a pension fund manager could not be directed to make investments in projects that would violate his fiduciary responsibilities the language in the bill as recommended by the labormanagement staff and members reiterates that point members should keep in mind that this demonstration is designed to establish whether a nonprofit or

years february has been the official observance of black history month which helps all americans appreciate the numerous signifi cant accomplishments that africanamericans have made in all aspects of american life america would not be the great country it is today without the contributions of africanamericans from communications to politics from science to sports aficanamericans have excelled to the pinnacle of their chosen fields many accomplished africanamericans are from or strongly associated with my home state of new york time does not permit me to mention all of them but i would like to highlight the careers of three such individuals lewis h latimer a noted inventor scientist and resident of long island invented and patented an incandescent light bulb with a carbon filament in 1881 later while working for the edison co he supervised the installation of the electric light system in new york philadelphia montreal and london mr latimer also made patented drawings of the first telephone for alexander graham bell another new yorker isabel baumfree later known as sojourner truth is well known for her speeches against slavery and in favor of womens rights born a slave in 1797 and after being freed by the new york state emancipation act of 1843 she became the first africanamecan woman to speak publicly against slavery after being freed she crossed the country speaking out at abolition rallies in 1947 when he joined the brooklyn dodgers jackie robinson became the first africanamerican to play majorleague baseball jackie distinguished himself as one of baseballs ailtime greats by compiling a long list of accomplishments including rookie of the year in 1947 most valuable player in the national league in 1949 and a lifetime 311 batting average most importantly his entrance into the game paved the way for other africanamerican players to play major league baseball in 1962 he was inducted into the baseball hall of fame as we celebrate the accomplishments of africanamericans this month it is important to realize that what africanamericans have ac complished should not solely be heralded in relation to race this celebration should not only highlight accomplishments of africanamericans it should make clear the vital importance that these accomplishments have made to american society as a whole in a time when the basic american family structure is

proposals on the issues we debate on this floor last week for example i went before the rules committee to request that the horn budget reduction proposal be ruled in order for consideration by the full house today the end result was that the rules committee denied members the opportunity to debate a proposal that would have offered a budget formula which would have reduced the deficit by a 144 billion over the next 5 years the sabo amendment cuts the deficit by s38 billion and the frankshays amendment cuts it by 51 billion these socalled cuts really are just transfers even so the rules committee had a moral obligation to allow the horn amendment with the largest deficit reduction the horn proposal achieved these reductions by establishing a flexible freeze for 1994 through the year 2000 second the president would have had the authority to identify specific areas to exempt from the spending caps however any additional spending must be offset by a real cut elsewhere in the budget
