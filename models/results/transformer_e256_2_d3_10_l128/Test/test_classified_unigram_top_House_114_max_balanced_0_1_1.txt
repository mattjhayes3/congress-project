course and making sure that we are here really speaking truth to power each and every week on behalf of the black caucus also to you congressman don payne thank you very much for your leadership and for really rising to the occasion on so many issues in the very short time that you have been here you have hit the ground running and really have made a tremendous difference i want to just speak for a few minutes as it relates to the review of the congressional black caucus for the last year or 2 years i have to just say that our leader mr butterfield has been a very bold and tremendous leader we have accomplished quite a bit and we have a lot more to do while 2015 has been very challenging i believe that the congressional black caucus has really stepped up and made a huge difference not only for the african american community and communities of color but for the entire country it has also been an inspiring year we have seen the birth and growth of the vital black lives matter movement we have also witnessed powerful and moving protests across the country in places like missouri new york and even in my district in oakland and in berkeley california with people of all backgrounds and ages coming together to demand justice to petition their government to exercise their democratic rights i am so proud of the young activists who are standing up and demanding an end to racism and injustice in many of our communities they are truly bringing the civil rights movement into the 21st century i want them to know that they have allies here in the peoples house for too long congress has ignored or brushed aside issues affecting the african american community and other communities of color it is past time that everyone steps up and does the good work that we were sent to washington to do that the congressional black caucus has done for many many decades we need to start by talking about and looking at what has happened with the voting rights act as you know this year marks the 50th anniversary of this landmark legislation the voting rights act was gutted by the supreme court in its shelby v holder decision and of course republican state legislators have fallen all over to restrict voting rights across the country everywhere these dangerous restrictions come in the form of voter id requirements elimination of sameday voter registration and really severe reduction in early voting efforts we must call these efforts for what they are republican attempts to take away one of our most fundamental rights but we will not let this happen i am so proud of the congressional black caucuscongresswoman terri sewell and john lewis and mr clyburn the entire congressional black caucus our bill h r 2867 the voting rights advancement act sponsored by congresswoman sewell who represents selma alabama would restore the preclearance provisions of the voting rights act for any state that has had 15 or more voting rights violations in the last 25 years in the preclearance process as dr king once said give us the ballot and we will fill our legislative halls with menand of course womenwith goodwill we can fill this body with those who really want to see democracy fulfilled so we need our young people to keep up the street heat and demand that congress act it is past time that we get serious about restoring the voting rights act and ensuring that all americansand that means all americanshave free and unobstructed access to the ballot box also the serious economic disparities that persist in the african american community are very very evident according to a report released earlier this year by the joint economic committee led by ranking member congresswoman carolyn maloney and the congressional black caucus we learned and it is very glaring that more than one in three black children are born into poverty and the african american poverty rate is three times that of white americans the cycle of poverty and inequality starts in our school systems where black students account for 42 percent of preschool student expulsions despite accounting for only 18 percent of enrollment now that is preschool expulsion every time i remember this and say this it really makes me very terrified about what is taking place with young black kids especially with young black boys because there is no way anybody no kids should be expelled from preschool that is ages 1 to 4 that is outrageous i am the mother yes of two fabulous great black men and i am the grandmother of two black boys and i find statistics like that very very troubling for african americans we have allowed our school system to be turned into a pipeline to prison we must act now to address systemic issues facing our education and our criminal justice systems i want to applaud congressman bobby scott and congressman conyers because they have worked for decades on criminal justice reform and we are beginning to see some progress as a result of their very diligent work our criminal justice system is broken it needs to be rebuilt from the ground up so alongside of our cbc colleagues once again we are calling for comprehensive criminal justice reform also i want to mention our effort which i cochair with chairman butterfield our tech 2020 initiative silicon valley is right next to my district in california there are great opportunities there for everyone however the tech industry has not been inclusive of hiring and contracting with and working with communities of color especially the african american community so i am very pleased that the tech 2020 of the congressional black caucus has been initiated we are working with our great leader reverend jesse jackson with an insideoutside strategy many of the tech companies understand what is taking place and that they need to be an industry that is inclusive of everyone so the black caucus along with rainbow push along with the tech industry are working on a variety of strategies to make sure that this industry which provides goodpaying jobs and opportunities is an industry that is inclusive that does not discriminate and that includes the diversity of this great country so i have to just say to congresswoman kelly and congressman payne thank you for giving us a chance to talk about so many of the issues that we have been working on when you look at the issue of poverty cutting poverty in half in 10 years we know how to do it we have legislation the half in ten act h r 258 to do that and the pathways out of poverty act h r 2721 we know how to provide opportunities the congressional black caucus once again is leading on all of these fronts it is a big agenda but it is an agenda that makes our country stronger so thank you congresswoman kelly and thank you congressman payne for the chance to be with you tonight"], [0.001265108585357666, 0.9987348914146423, 1, "first let me thank congresswoman robin kelly and congressman donald payne jr for hosting this important special order i appreciate your leadership in organizing this important discussion on the state of black health in america every april we observe national minority health awareness month this year is particularly significant as we mark 30 years since the groundbreaking health and human services task force on black and minority health report this report sparked the first serious discussion in washington on addressing the deep racial health disparities that exist in this country this year also marks 50 years since the creation of medicare and medicaidprograms that have kept and continue to keep americans healthy we are also celebrating the fifth year anniversary of the passage of the affordable care actthe most significant legislation to improve the health of all americans in more than a generation these legislative achievements continue moving us closer to health equity for allhowever major health disparities still exist the zip code in which you are born still determines your likely life expectancy gross disparities exist from zip code to zip codeeven within the same city or county so today i rise to join my colleagues in the congressional black caucus to bring to light the state of black health in america and call for more action to address persistent and lingering disparities in health access treatment and care since the passage of the affordable care act access to care has dramatically expanded in communities of color the uninsured rate has declined 7 3 percent in the african american community and more people have access to affordable quality healthcareall thanks to the affordable care act when we were crafting the affordable care act i had the privilege of serving as chair of the congressional black caucus and let me tell you we worked day and night with our colleagues in the congressional hispanic caucus and congressional asian pacific american caucus to push congress and the administration to craft the best possible bill since its passage the affordable care act has improved the american health care system healthcare is now more affordable and accessible than ever women can no longer be discriminated against because they are a woman have a preexisting conditionsuch as hiv aidsor have been the victim of domestic violence young people can stay on their parents health insurance until they are 26 and people with serious conditions like cancer no longer face the real fear of hitting their lifetime cap and being denied lifesaving treatment the aca also expands the capacity of the healthcare delivery system to better serve those at risk for and living with hiv aids these are the facts the affordable care act has dramatically increased access to preventative care for women lowincome communities and people of color despite rabblerousing and grandstanding from the right this law is saving livesevery day in communities across americafrom maine to my district in the east bay during the last enrollment period 16 4 million americans obtained health insurance and more than half a million came from my home state of california make no mistakethe affordable care act is working african americans and latinos historically underinsured or uninsured groups have seen the greatest declines in their uninsured rates this is especially good news for african americans who are living with hiv where the key to halting the epidemic is access to affordable and quality care with this increase in coverage we are beginning to close the gap in racial and ethnic health disparities and access to care however much work remains to truly realize health equity in america right nowin america the richest and most powerful country in the worldafrican americans still suffer from disproportionately high numbers of preventable deaths disparities in access to quality health care and underrepresentation within the medical community african americans have the highest mortality rate of any racial and ethnic group from cancer furthermore africanamericans are 40 more likely to die from a stroke than whites and 30 more likely to die from heart disease than whites and while african americans are only 13 of the unitedstates population they account for nearly half of all new hiv infections african americans also account for the highest hivrelated deaths and hiv death rates madam speakerthis is unacceptable in an age where technology and innovation are paving the way to new medical breakthroughs these persistent disparities in healthcare cannot be allowed to continue that is why today i urge my colleagues lets work together and commit ourselves to passing legislation that will end racial and ethnic disparities and achieve health equity the affordable care act was a good start but more is needed for years the congressional tricaucus has championed this effort by introducing the health equity and accountability act heaa congresswoman robin kelly will have the honor in introducing this important legislation this congress and i am proud to colead this effort as cochair of the capac health task force this important legislation builds on the affordable care act and puts us on track to eliminate health disparities in our country the health equity and accountability act would address incidences of terminal and chronic diseases that disproportionally affect communities of color including cancer diabetes heart disease and hiv aids so in recognition of national minority health awareness month i urge my colleagues to support this important bill in order to truly achieve health equity for all the state of black health in america is improving but much work remains before us as our drum major for justice dr king told us of all the forms of inequality injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane i urge my colleagues to join us in securing health equity for all"], [0.0013509392738342285, 0.9986490607261658, 1, "i thank congresswoman kelly and congressman payne for organizing this special order and for your continued leadership on so many vital issues and for staying the course and holding down the fort for the congressional black caucus it is so important that our message of unity and our messagewhich really describes what many of the issues are that all of our communities are faced withthat that message goes out both of you have really been tremendous in this effort so i rise this evening to join this critical conversation on race relations in america and to challenge our colleagues to work with the congressional black caucus to realize progress for racial justice and equality i join congresswoman kelly and congressman payne in sending my condolences to the families and the victims of the horrific terrorist attacks in paris lebanon nigeria and also in egypt know that we join in this quest for global peace and security throughout the world now tonights special order is an important part of our work to address the discrimination and racism that still plagues our nation specifically as it relates to african americans but we know that it impacts all communities of color it is manifested in many ways and it affects our entire country as congressman payne said so eloquently we are the united states so when one is affected all are affected all across the country at universities like mizzou and yale in places like baltimore and ferguson and in high schools like spring valley high in columbia south carolina we are witnessing the painful impact of institutional racism in our communities very recently we saw this in my home district at berkley high school in one of the most progressive and enlightened cities in the country black students were subjected to threatening messages on campus but i am so proud of the students at berkley they walked offit was not only black students it was all studentsand marched out peacefully through the city to protest these terrible despicable messages this is unacceptable all students have a right to learn free from violence and from threats as long as black students and any student of color feels unsafe in their classrooms our work for justice remains incomplete this crisis isnt limited to our schools tragically people of color face institutional racism from the moment they are born according to a report released earlier this year by the joint economic committee and the congressional black caucus more than one in three black children are born into poverty this cycle of poverty and inequality continues in our school system where black students account for 42 percent of preschool student expulsions mind you now that is preschool that is students from about 2 years old to 4 years old black students account for 42 percent of preschool student expulsions despite accounting for only 18 percent of enrollment i cant figure out how any student aged 2 to 4 is expelled from school that is outrageous yet 42 percent of preschool student expulsions are african american babies these kids dont even get a start let alone a head start outside of the classroom african americans are overpoliced overcriminalized and underemployed a report published by the new york times in april found that there are an estimated 1 5 million black men between the ages of 24 to 54 who are missing from civic life just missing it these missing men who account for one in every six black men have been victims of mass incarceration or premature death and this crisis of inequality extends to the structures of the community and have persisted from generations over the past four decades the average unemployment rate for blacks has been double the rate for white americans for many black families it feels like this is a permanent recession this must be our call to action that is why i am so proud of our young people throughout the country and students who are standing up to racism and injustice in their communities it is time for congress to listen to the young people saying that black lives matter and black students matter earlier this month i held a forum on racial justice in my district to address these issues more than 300 east bay residents from all backgrounds attended and raised their voices for justice this was the second forum that i have held throughout the last 3 months now i have been able to reach over 1 000 east bay residents so tonight in this dialogue which congressman payne and congresswoman kelly have talked about this dialogue leads to action hopefully our colleagues would think about hosting these types of forums and listen to what people are saying listen to what the impact of some of our policies are on their daily lives we must be part of the conversation and the solution but we must listen we must hear the pain and the suffering that people are experiencing as a result of discrimination and racial injustice now the congress must act to start addressing the systemic racism that degrades our institutions and threatens our communities it is past time for us to get serious about us addressing the lack of opportunity for black and minority families in this country right now today in this chamber there is legislation that can start moving the needle forward we need to empower our communities to build greater trust between law enforcement and communities of color and we need to address chronic recidivism which would be a huge step toward returning some of our missing men to their families and communities to do this congress should pass the safe justice act sponsored by congressman sensenbrenner and congressman scott congress should also pass the stop militarizing law enforcement act h r 1232 to stop the militarization of our nations police forces we also should pass the police accountability act h r 1102 and the grand jury reform act h r 429 so we can ensure that deadly force cases are heard by a judge and that there is more accountability for police officers as we reform our broken criminal justice system and work to help repair those families hurt by mass incarceration we will be strengthening america we will have people who really can make a contribution not only to their families and their communities but to the entire country the federal government shouldnt continue to put up barriers to work for those trying to rebuild their lives after making a mistake and should ban the box totally by federal contractors and by federal agencies we also need to repeal the lifetime ban on pell grants for those formerly incarcerated as it relates to drug felonies the ineligibility for public assistance and food stamps we need to remove these barriers so that people of color primarily african american men and latino men can get back into society get a job and take care of their families once again this is an example of public policy that racism wreaks its ugly head in our own institutions and policies finally we must address the poverty that plagues communities of color all across the country we have the whips task force on poverty income inequality and opportunity which i am proud to chair with our whip mr hoyer we are working with more than 100 of our colleagues now to advance policies that give all families including african american families living below the poverty line both in urban communities and in rural communities a fair shot this effort includes our half in ten act h r 258 which calls for a national strategy to cut poverty in half in the next decade that is more than 22 million americans lifted out of poverty into the middle class in just the next 10 years by being strategic and coordinating our existing programs our pathway out of poverty act h r 2721 would create goodpaying jobs it would lift families out of poverty into the middle class while strengthening our safety net for those who are still struggling ultimately the only way to end institutional racism is to give african americans and people of color a seat at the table and we need to pass legislation and policies that begin to remove these barriers my mentor the honorable congresswoman shirley chisholm used to say if they dont give you a seat at the table bring in a folding chair that is what our young people are doing around the country so i want to thank all of the people across our country who are bringing in folding chairs and ensuring that these important conversations happen we hear you we support you and we will keep fighting for you for ensuring liberty and justice for all which means just that it means for all in doing so we will make the united states a stronger

representatives to beg the majority party just to debate and vote on commonsense gun legislation that the vast majority of americans demand we should not be living in a society where debate and even

standing up for the millions of americans who want congress to do something and honoring the thousands of americans who have lost their lives to gun violence here we are standing up for our constituents who are tired of the excuses and want to hear a debate and want to see us take action on gun violence and here we are today to represent the victims the list is so long orlando san

are 50 times more likely to die of a gun death than in all of those other countries we have the most guns and we have the most gun violence we have the nra through fear intimidation and misinformation the nra has taken control over the debate on guns to such an extent that we cannot even vote in this chamber on whether we should keep guns out of the hands of terrorists right now someone can be on both the terrorist watch list and the nofly list in other words the fbi thinks you are a terrorist and the tsa bans you from flying but if you want to drive down to your local gun store and buy an assault rifle there is nothing anyone can do to stop you over the last 10 years people on the terrorist watch list tried to buy explosives or firearms 2 233 times over 90 percent of the time they were successful this is wrong the american people know it is wrong public health officials know it is wrong and nearly every single law enforcement association in america knows it is wrong which is why they are all in favor of closing the terrorist gun loophole in fact a recent poll by a republican pollster found 76 percent of gun owners and 71 percent of nra members said suspected terrorists should not be allowed to buy guns if you were to walk outside the house of representatives right now and stop someone walking down the street and ask the simple question should terrorists be allowed to buy guns you would get a very simple answer they would say no of course terrorists should not be allowed to buy guns but they can republicans here in the house wont even let us have a debate and a vote on it how did we get here mr speaker how has the debate shifted so far away from commonsense gun regulation that a proposal to close the terrorist gun loophole is this controversial why is it that here in the house debate is silenced and we are not allowed to vote the closest we came to a debate on gun legislation recently came last week when a controversy erupted about the standard procedure to observe a moment of silence on the house floor after a mass shooting it is shameful that we have allowed this country to get to a point where congress has to even have a standard procedure to observe mass shootings yet we arent even allowed to have a debate about legislation to address this problem it is time for us to stand up to the nra to have a fair and open debate about gun violence and it is

orlando florida is a stark reminder of the urgent responsibility that we have to reduce gun violence in this country this monstrous attack on the lgbt community in a place of refuge and empowerment requires us to act the shooter in orlando used an assault rifle that is virtually identical to the ones used by mass killers in san bernardino umpqua community college aurora and sandy hook elementary school that is no coincidence out of the eight highprofile mass shootings that have taken place in the past year seven involved the use of an assault weapon when an assault weapon is used in a mass shooting the number of people shot increases by 153 percent and the number of people killed increases by 63 percent these are weapons of war that are designed to kill as many people as possible as quickly as possible they belong on a battlefield they dont belong in our communities and i will continue to fight to reinstate the assault weapons ban this morning i want to use the time that i have to talk about two proposals that the speaker should bring up for immediate vote no fly no buy and universal background checks this is really really simple if you are too dangerous to fly on an airplane then you are too dangerous to buy a gun but under the laws that we have in place today someone who is on the fbis terrorist watch list who is too dangerous to get on a plane can still walk into any gun store in america pass a background check and walk out with an assault weapon or any other gun he wants in fact from 2004 until 2014 more than 2 000 suspected terrorists bought firearms legally in this country and they are going to continue doing so until we stop them until 9 11 bombs were the weapon of choice for terrorists looking to strike the united states but in the 15 years since then 95 percent of terrorist deaths that took place in the united states resulted from gunfire it is impossibleimpossibleto understand that house republicans have now voted 13 times to block the no fly no buy proposal that congressman peter king and congressman mike thompson introduced to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists in this country why what are they afraid of that we might actually stop a terrorist from passing a background check before he buys an assault rifle at cabelas bring the no fly no buy bill to the floor today lets have an upordown vote let the american people hold us accountable for where we stand this should be a nobrainer more than 80 percent of americans believe we should prevent suspected terrorists from buying a gun and more than 90 percent of americans believe that a background check should be required on every firearm sale so we can keep guns out of the hands of criminals and those with such serious mental illness that possessing a gun would make them a danger to themselves or others bills are pending to fix our background check system and to require a background check on every gun sale this is one of the single most important and effective steps that we can take to reduce gun violence in this country right now anyone can go to a gun show or get on the internet and purchase a gun without a background check as many as two out of every five firearm transactions today are conducted without a background check it is too easy for a criminal a domestic abuser a terrorist or someone with a serious mental illness to buy a gun through this loophole every day background checks block 171 attempted purchases by felons 48 attempted purchases by domestic abusers and 19 attempted purchases by fugitives it is critical that we strengthen the background check system and require checks on all firearm sales so we can keep more dangerous individuals from acquiring these deadly weapons bring the fix gun checks act to the floor today we held a moment of silence last week for the victims in orlando i know that all of us have kept the victims and their loved ones and the people of orlando in our thoughts and prayers since june 12 but the best way to honor the lives lost in this horrific tragedy is to do something to prevent it from happening to others a moment of silence is not enough we need a moment of sustained action in this chamber and we need it today it will be an insult to the victims of this shooting and their families and every victim of every shooting in this country if we continue to do nothing to prevent future

that question after the incredible harm that has already been done to these families our elected officials are once again turning their backs on the people of flint these families deserve better the people of flint were already hurting before the water crisis the average family income in the city is just 24 834 a year no one can raise a family on that many of these courageous and resilient families struggle to find highquality child care access healthcare services and afford healthy food and now the costs of this crisis are mounting for families the schools and the entire community we can and we must do more for our fellow americans in their time of need two years since this tragedy began families are still relying on bottled water for daily life imagine using bottled water for everything from brushing your teeth to making a bottle for a hungry baby we can do better by these families they need support including health care nutrition specialized education and developmental care and we need to fix the root of the problem the degraded dangerous pipes and infrastructure that caused this tragedy the shortsighted dangerous actions of michigan officials have already caused unimaginable pain for these families we cannot allow congress to betray these families as well let me just say that i was part of a congressional delegation that traveled to flint michigan to listen to the residents regarding the horrendous impact of these government decisions that led to the poisoning of those children and families the environmental injustice in flint is an example of how many lowincome communities of color throughout our country not just in flint throughout the united states an example of how they are treated differently than affluent communities congressman dan kildee and members of the michigan delegation have introduced legislation that would help these families rebuild their lives and get the care they need for their children the families of flint act h r 4479 is a comprehensive plan to address their most urgent needs it would provide for critical investment in flints water system to replace the lead pipes that poisoned these families this legislation would also provide essential support services to the families of flint to help these children mitigate and overcome lead exposure these are simple commonsense measures for the people of flint addressing this tragedy really shouldnt be a partisan issue every member of this chamber should understand the need for urgent action it could happen in any of our communities yet congressional republicans have not held one single vote or even a hearing on this bill that is just simply outrageous and let me just say that flint is not the only public health crisis that congressional republicans have ignored there are 17 000 americansincluding almost 1 600 pregnant womenwho have contracted the zika virus the president submitted an emergency request of 1 9 billion for zika funding more than 6 months ago and the republicans have failed to act on it now if we dont act soon the cdc will be out of money to combat zika in a matter of weeks congressional republicans also failed to do their job on gun violence every day more than 90 million people die from gun violence this too is a public health crisis but congressional republicans once again have refused to take up any commonsense gun legislation even though 91 percent of americans support background checks to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists and criminals it is clear that the american people need congress to do its job the women in florida who cant leave their homes for fear of a mosquito bite need congress to do its job the families who fear gun violence on their block need congress to do its job"], [0.0015264153480529785,

only in baltimore which we have seen most recently but in cities like ferguson in north charleston in new york where we have seen the convergence of poverty and the need for criminal justice reform converge i too want to offer my sympathy to the family of freddie gray we have watched them over the past couple of days in the midst of their mourning to be able to stand up and call for peace nonviolence nonviolent protests they should be honored and to those in baltimore and particularly my colleague from marylandi will call him congressman cummings with the bullhorn politics the bullhorn leadershiphe should be commended for the stunning and outstanding engagement that he touched the hearts and minds of his constituents walked those streets to be able to acknowledge the pain the poverty but that there is a better way that there is a way toward the stars that we all want our children to have and yes to ms graham who wanted better for her son michael i want him not to be embarrassed but to be proud that he had a mother with such deep love that she wanted to take him away from doing it wronglynot against protests not against the quiet marching of the spirit of dr king but to know that engaging in violence is intolerable and will not allow him to reach the very high heights that he can reach today i stand here to acknowledge the convergence of the need for criminal justice reform and the deep and abiding poverty in the african american community one in every six americans is living in poverty totaling 46 2 million people this is the highest number in 17 years children represent a disproportionate amount of the united states poor population it falls heavily on the african american community in my district there are 190 000plus living in poverty it falls heavily on the african american community this is not a standing invitation for the door to open and say lets blame president obama president obama has been a stellar leader on the questions of realizing the investment in people from the stimulus that brought us out of the depths of collapse of the markets and a complete imploding of the capitalistic system he provided the stimulus that moved us toward an economy where we were creating jobs but here we have in congress this dastardly sequester that is cutting head start seats not investing in infrastructure not creating jobs or providing opportunities for our young people so today i say that there needs to be a call for action that call for action is that this congress must get rid of sequester and must look at the baltimores and must look at the fergusons and houstons and l a s and new yorks and cities across america and realize that we are coming upon a summertime and if we dont act to invest in our children and to begin to give an agenda to release ourselves from poverty we will have doomed ourselves and i would offer to say that the inertia of moving toward criminal justice reform in this congress is unacceptable i call upon members to come together collectively to be able to pass legislation the cadet bill that i have introduced the build trust bill but more importantly i am calling upon our government to invest in our youth to get rid of the poverty to prepare them as they go into higher education as they go into upper grades we must have a program of summer jobs this summer and we must have a collaborative effort with corporate america wake up corporate america wake up corporate baltimore wake up corporate new york wake up corporate houston there must be an investment in summer jobs collaborating with the federal government to make a difference to lift families out of poverty we do know that summer jobs with young people elevate families ability to pay their bills and to provide resources for their families so if the story of baltimore is any it is one dont jump to conclusions dont jump to conclusions that freddie gray tried to hurt himself dont jump to conclusions that these young people dont mean well dont jump to conclusions that they shouldnt have done what they have done jump to the conclusions that these are young people who are hungry and looking for leadership and are in pain as congressman cummings said look for the opportunity for them help rebuild baltimore help give them jobs help tell them that the improved relationships between police and community are

orlando paris newtown or san bernardino ever happen again congress should immediately move forward and pass the denying firearms and explosives to dangerous terrorists act this commonsense bill would prohibit suspected terrorists from possessing guns or explosives keeping dangerous weapons out of the hands of people who wish to do our country harm is a solution that we should all be able to get behind the hateful attack in orlando also reminds us once more of the growing threat of isisinspired radical islamic terrorist on unitedstates soil is real and cannot be ignored or downplayed congress must reassert leadership in the fight against isis by passing legislation to hold the president accountable for developing a comprehensive plan to destroy isis through congressional oversight hearings we must also ensure that federal agencies and local law enforcement are effectively communicating with each other to identify international and homegrown terror threats through both traditional security approaches and social media internationally congress must act to cut off sources of funding to other radical islamic terror groups by restoring crippling sanctions on iran the recent agreement which frankly shipped billions of dollars to the worlds largest state sponsor of terror while helping finance organizations like hamas and hezbollah is simply unacceptable at home we cannot allow the tired partisan bickering to distract us from the difficult but necessary work of preventing gun violence we need to bridge the partisan divide and put the best interests of our country before politics a good first step is the legislation that i helped introduce with former congresswoman gabby giffords to require universal background checks on firearm purchases the vast majority of the american people support this commonsense idea and it is past time congress moves forward with this proposal that will keep more people safe we also need to improve communications so that local law enforcement is notified when someone attempts to purchase a gun and fails a required background check my colleague congressman mike quigley introduced a commonsense bill to make this fix which i strongly support other important efforts to prevent gun violence include my bill with congresswoman debbie dingell to prevent domestic abusers from being able to purchase weapons this proposal would help again prohibit firearm trafficking used to evade background checks and also a longoverdue increase in mental health resources in short there are numerous commonsense proposals that will keep guns out of the hands of those that should not have them while protecting our second amendment rights it is time that we take action there is no quick and easy solution to all the problems underscored by

effectively on all of these issues particularly his leadership on iran and that of course would be echoed with eliot engels excellent work there as well this is a group of leaders that have made a huge difference so thank you chairman royce for that h res 354 prescribes specific effective actions that government should take in response to the deadly threats to the jewish communities in europe as we all know the number of violent antisemitic attacks have increased from 100 to 400 percent in some european countries since 2013 alone murders in paris and copenhagen and elsewhere remind us that there are those who are motivated by antisemitic hate and have the will and the means to kill i would just note parenthetically that my work in combating antisemitism began back in 1981 in my first term from this very podium speaking out in favor of jewish refuseniks i joined mark levin and the ncsj 1 year later in 1982 on a trip to the soviet union where we met with men and women who were targeted by the kgb and the soviet evil empire simply because they were jewish sadly antisemitism has not abated and in recent years it has actually worsened 1915 this resolution calls for the united states government to work with our european allies on specific actions that are essential to keep european jewish communities safe and secure it is based on consultations with the leading experts who are working directly with these communities the resolution focuses on the formal partnerships between european law enforcement agencies and jewish community security groups here in the united states the collaboration between the department of homeland security and security community networkan initiative of the jewish federation of north america and the conference of presidents of major american jewish organizationshas been essential to protecting jewish communities here the formal partnerships between the community security trust in the united kingdom and the jewish community security service in france and their respective governments are also excellent models that need to be emulated the resolution emphasizes the importance of consistent twoway communication and information sharing between law enforcement agencies and jewish community groups it encourages the development of a paneuropean information sharing communication and alerting system and envisions governments intergovernmental agencies and jewish communities working together on it such a system should function dayround and yearround and include training for personnel who are implementing it the resolution also calls for european governments to support assessments in several key areas and accordingly adjust their actions and strategies details matter the assessments should gather and analyze data on crimes committed response from law enforcement types of attacks or incidents that are most prevalent and the types of targets that are most at risk it is essential to understand how law enforcement agencies usually receive reports of antisemitic crimes and what initial actions they take when a report is filed i remember years ago when i offered a resolution at the osce parliamentary assembly we heard that it was just hooliganism and other kinds of acts done by young people when you spraypaint a swastika on a tombstone in a jewish cemetery when you deface a synagogue and you attack a man simply because he is wearing a yarmulke clearly these are acts of antisemitic hate yet they were being dismissed as something that was other assessments are also needed on jewish community security groups particularly of their capabilities resources relationships with local law enforcement agencies preparedness including emergency response plans and the extent to which their decisionmaking is based on the best available information analysis and practices the resolution calls for governments to use these assessments to help these community groups develop common baseline safety standards these standards should include as i said before training controlling access to physical facilities physical security measures including cameras and crisis communications emergency exercises and simulations mapping access to facilities and sharing information with law enforcement agencies should also be part of the standards these assessments will help achieve the resolutions call for law enforcement personnel to be well trained to monitor prevent and respond to antisemitic violence and to partner with jewish communities for all of these assessments governments should draw information from sources that include jewish groups law enforcement agencies independent human rights ngos research initiatives and other civil society groups and leaders h res 354 calls for safety awareness and suspicious activity reporting campaigns like if you see something say something here in the united states other aspects of the resolution include appropriately integrating initiatives to counter violent extremism and those to combat antisemitism and the urgency of implementing the declarations decisions and other commitments of the organization for security and cooperation in europe that focus on antisemitism to accomplish these goals the resolution calls for european governments to ensure that they appoint or designate senior officials with the necessary authority and resources to combat antisemitism and collaborate with governmental and intergovernmental agencies law enforcement and jewish community groups finally the resolution reaffirms support for the mandate of the united states special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism as part of the broader policy of fostering international religious freedom and urges the secretary of state to continue robust unitedstates reporting on antisemitism by the department of state and the special envoy to combat and monitor antisemitism i would note parenthetically that i authored the amendment to the global antisemitism review act of 2004 introduced and sponsored by senator voinovich my amendment created the office to monitor and combat antisemitism within the state department that has proven to be a key tool in this fight the resolution has the support of leading organizations and it has 89 cosponsors including all eight of the cochairs of the bipartisan taskforce for combating antisemitism i would like to

wasnt surprised to see that that group pledges allegiance to isis isis publicly accepted the overture claiming this new relationship expands their selfdeclared caliphate to west africa at the same time we have seen boko harams propaganda increase in quality mimicking the production of isis videos sweeping what we call the virtual caliphate on the internet so the good news is that nigerias

it be done better i have no doubt one of the things i feel very strongly about it is not a case of having a mindless formula having a group of unelected bureaucrats i find that my friends on the other side of the aisle had spasms of angst and fury about unelected bureaucrats advising congress dealing with the affordable care act to try and help maintain targets for medicare savings but they have referred to unelected bureaucrats in this regard one of the things that i think is important is that we not implement a theory here that would engage us in more rulemaking more expenses this would effectively dramatically increase the amount of time and energy reducing the flexibility to be able to move forward it would be much more productive if we were focusing on the principle of

once again i thank the gentleman from north carolina the sponsor of the bill which also passed the financial services committee in june with a vote of 572 lets get into it title iii of the jobs act known as the crowdfunding title is one of the most promising provisions of that law and so by opening the door for equity crowdfunding to literally millions of americans people who want to invest in companies that they believe in title iii has the potential to further democratize our capital markets and doing so will create opportunities for main street to generate wealth unfortunately in part due to provisions added by the senate during conference negotiations and in part due to problems with the secs implementation of title iii equity crowdfunding in the united states may never reach its full potential as sec commissioner mike piwowar noted in his dissent to the secs rules that came out last year he said the rules will spin a complex web of provisions and requirements for compliance such burdens will spook many small businesses from pursuing crowdfunding as a viable path to raising capital fortunately once again the financial services committee has stepped up to the plate to address these problems and fortunately we have mr mchenry here who has put forward his crowdfunding act to fix it the fix crowdfunding act would address some of these issues and it does so in two important ways first the bill would enable special purpose vehicles as defined by the bill to be considered an authorized investor in crowdfunding offerings what does this mean well this means a group of investors can basically come together and pool the resources and then invest alongside some more sophisticated investors in these new growing startup businesses as i tell you this it is important to note that under current regulations unless you are well extremely wealthy you are typically prohibited from investing in private businesses here in the united states secondly mr mchenrys fix crowdfunding act increases the amount that a company can raise through this mechanism of crowdfunding before it has to go and register with the sec so while these things may be just technical fixes to a complicated set of security laws at the end of the day what they will do is break down what we say is historical barriers that prevented startup companies and businesses from connecting with literally millions of americans and investors across the country so the fix crowdfunding act that we are seeing here today will address many of the problems that currently exist with the crowdfunding regulations again i want to thank the gentleman from north carolina and also my colleagues on the financial service committee for their support i reserve the balance of my time"],

over the course of this year many western states including alaska have gone through a catastrophic wildfire season with more than 9 million acres burned to date this is a continuation of an unsustainable trend where the average number of acres burned each year has doubled since the 1990s to address this government spending on wildfire suppression has also doubled yet the total amount of spending on forestry activities has remained the same because the cost of wildfire suppression efforts has continued to climb over the past 15 years the unitedstates forest service has repeatedly had to transfer money from its nonfire programs to firefighting efforts in fact this year alone more than 50 percent of the forest service budget went toward wildfire suppression taking funding away from programs and activities that promote forest health and reduction of underbrush wood waste and dead trees which help these wildfires spread fire transfers also undermine timber harvesting which is critical for the health of the forests as well as our rural communities and counties in contrast to this 50 percent only 20 years ago the forest service was only spending as little as 13 percent or onesixth of its budget on firerelated activities however this is not simply a question of allocating more money for fire suppression the real solution to this problem is how we maintain our forests i

this because we dont have the option for amendments i think there is a better way to do this people have two views about the argument today but the real question of the debate we are having comes down to this do we let government pick and choose who it gives special taxpayer loans to or not i believe our constituents know very well what the right choice is they dont want their tax dollars backing up loans for any businesses that is not the governments job the private sector can and should do that our economy does best when the government is left out when government gets involved trying to centralize power and money in itself corruption is inevitable the exim bank is a perfect example of this and this is my concern an inspector general is investigating at least 31 cases of fraud of the exim bank and this fraud has wasted millions of taxpayer dollars but it doesnt stop there a former exim bank employee johnny gutierrez pleaded guilty this year to taking bribes on 19 different occasions to help applicants get loans from the exim another exim bank employee was indicted for taking 100 000 in bribes to help a nigerian businessman get loans from the exim and we all remember a congressman william jefferson who was sentenced to 13 years in prison for taking bribes to help a company get loans from the exim you see there is a pattern a pattern that wont be solved today regardless of what side you are on since 2009 in fewer than 6 years there have been 49 criminal judgments against exim bank employees or people who benefited from the exim many of these people have gone to prison for it in fact if you add them all up that is 75 years they are serving now i wish i could tell you that was my only complaint and problem and it ended there but it does get worse a large number of loans of exim guarantees arent even for american companies the bank actually uses taxpayer money to back up loans for companies owned by governments of china russia saudi arabia and others these loans to corporations outside of america dont always go well do you remember newsat that is an australia company that lost 139 million in taxpayerbacked loans newsats ceo allegedly diverted company funds to his yacht company so the question is when does the corruption become too bad when is it that too many people take bribes how many taxpayer loans must be issued by fraud so
