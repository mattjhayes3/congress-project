district showed a definitive difference in the amount of monies paid by senior citizens for prescription drugs it was higher in the 18th congressional district in houston than in canada and in mexico we find that those who are 85 years old 40 percent of them do not even have the ability to pay for any drugs they have no benefit whatsoever and we must realize that seniors are living longer we also find that seniors are paying twice as much for their prescription drugs if they are medicare beneficiaries and they do not have that provision and so they are buying onethird less drugs what does that mean it means sicker seniors that is what it means these are individuals who have worked hard in our communities then we find the cost of our prescription drugs the amount of money our seniors pay is far more than any other health need that they have and this i would say to my colleagues begs for us to have a prescription drug benefit under the medicare provisions i do not know why it is so difficult this is something we should support i cannot go home and tell my seniors in the 18th congressional district that in the united states of america they cannot have a drug benefit but yet in mexico and canada prescription drugs are cheaper i would say it is time now to support this motion to instruct today i rise in support of the spratt motion to instruct the conferees on the budget resolution the spraft motion sets the stage for enacting a medicare prescription drug benefit or other legislation to improve medicare before the reporting date for a tax cut reconciliation bill by setting september 22 as the date for reporting a tax cut bill protected by reconciliation furthermore the spratt motion recedes to the senates slightly smaller tax cut and also recede to the senate by dropping the reserve fund language in the housepassed resolution that provides for an additional 50 billion in tax cuts while the republicans propose large tax cuts over the next 5 years and reconcile the finance and ways and means committees to report legislation republicans do not show the 10year cost of this tax cut which could be as large as the 792 billion that the republicans proposed and the american people rejected in 1999 moreover the republicans do not intend to strengthen or support medicare due to the fact that there are no reconciliation instructions to require legislation that would actually use the 40 billion reserve earmarked in the budget resolution in addition the republicans have cut nondefense appropriations while defense significantly increased for the third consecutive year republicans have chosen to provide large tax breaks for the wealthy this budget resolution provides at least 200 billion in tax breaks over the next 5 years for the financial elite of america furthermore this resolution is a major down payment for george w bushs proposed trilliondollar tax scheme i will not stand by while our childrens future is bankrupted to fund this irresponsible budget resolution this budget contains deep cuts in domestic spending by 114 billion over the next 5 years fails to provide anything to strengthen social security or medicare cuts nondefense discretionary spending by 19 7 billion in 2001 and 138 billion over the next 5 years below the level needed to maintain purchasing power after adjusting for inflation and pretends to reserve 40 billion for a medicare prescription drug benefit contingent upon essentially turning medicare into a voucher program republicans have used slight of hand to hide the facts of their irresponsible budget by showing the effects of proposed tax cuts for only the first 5 years and not the full 10year projections commonly used during the last 4 years i am disappointed in the budget resolution because i do not believe that it provides adequate investment in our nations future americas future depends on that of her young people in providing them adequate resources and opportunities to become our future leaders including providing them education and ac cess to adequate health care the budget resolution provides inadequate resources for the education of our young people i firmly believe that we must focus our attention and our energy on one of the most important challenges facing our country todayrevitalizing our education system strengthening education must be a top priority to raise the standard of living among american families and to prolong this era of american economic expansion education will prepare our nation for the challenges of the 21st century and i will fight to ensure that the necessary programs are adequately funded to ensure our childrens success we must provide our children access to superior education at all ages from kindergarten to graduate school recent studies emphasize the importance of quality education early in a childs future development and yet despite these studies the budget resolution still inadequately funds programs that would provide for programs targeting children in their younger years in addition we need to open the door of educational opportunity to all american children it is well known that increases in income are related to educational attainment the democratic budget alternative rejects the republican freeze on education funding and allocates 4 8 billion more for education for fiscal year 2001 than the republican budget over 5 years the democratic party demonstrates its commitment to education by proposing 21 billion more than the republican budget resolution the congressional black caucus offered an amendnient in the nature of a substitute that promised to invest for the future of our nation the cbc substitute is a budget that maximizes investment and opportunity for the poor africanamericans and other minorities this budget for maximum investment and opportunity supports a moderate plan to pay down the national debt protects social security and makes significant investments in education and training the cbc budget requests 88 8 billion in fiscal year 2001 for education training and development this is 32 billion more than the republican budget provides the cbc substitute proposed a 10 billion increase over the presidents budget for school construction other projected increases include additional funding for head start summer youth employment trio programs historically black colleges and universities and community technology centers in an age of unprecedented wealth the cbc has the vision to invest in the american family and not squander opportunities afforded by a budget surplus i will not support the failed policies of the past senator mccain has best characterized this budget resolution as one that is fiscally irresponsible i support a budget that invest strengthening social security provides an affordable prescription drug benefit for all seniors helps communities improve public education with quality teachers smaller classes greater accountability and modem schools and pay down the national debt these are the policies that invest in our children and in the future of our nation in the 21st century"],

support of eliminating the marriage tax penalty i rise in strong support of the house and senate going to conference and sending to the president this week legislation that wipes out what i consider to be the most unfair tax of all we have often asked from the well of the house a pretty simple basic question that is is it right is it fair that under our tax code 25 million married working couples pay higher taxes just because they are married is it right is it fair that 25 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 in higher taxes just because they are married and today the only way to avoid that marriage tax penalty when both the man and the women that are in the workforce is either not get married or get divorced it is wrong that under our tax code one pays higher taxes just because they are married i was so proud of this house just this past week when we passed and sent to the senate legislation which wiped out the american tax penalty for 25 million couples this afternoon the senate by a vote of 61 to 38 an overwhelming vote including democrats joining with republicans voted to eliminate the marriage tax penalty of course the bills are a little bit different we have to work out the differences the bottom line is we want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty let me give an example of a couple from the district that i represent in the south side of chicago in the south suburbs who suffer the marriage tax penalty this is michelle and shad hallihan they are two public school teachers they live just outside joliet illinois shad teaches at joliet high school michelle teaches at manhattan junior high they suffer about 1 000 in marriage tax penalty their combined income is about 62 000 they are homeowners and i would point out that since we introduced the bill to eliminate the marriage tax penalty a year and a half ago shad and michelle have since had a little baby if the democrats have their way this child will probably be out of college before we eliminate the marriage tax penalty because there is always an excuse not to do it today the bottom line is for michelle and shad hallihan and for their new little baby ben 1 400 the average marriage tax penalty is real money in the joliet area 1 400 is 3 months of day care at a local child care center for little ben 1 400 is 3 000 diapers for little ben 1 400 is one years tuition at a community college called joliet junior college in joliet illinois it is a washer and dryer for their home our legislation that passed the house of representatives will help people like michelle and shad hallihan the democrats talk about their alternative it would leave michelle and shad hallihan out they would still be stuck with the marriage tax penalty under our legislation which passed the house of representatives with the vote of every republican and also 48 democrats who broke with their leadership to support the elimination of the marriage tax penalty we helped couples two public school teachers like shad and michelle hallihan as i pointed out earlier shad and michelle are homeowners they also have a baby and of course they give money to church and charity so that means they itemize their taxes under our proposal we double the standard deduction to twice that for single people under our proposal that helps those who do not itemize but if we are going to help people like michelle and shad hallihan we have to help itemizers that means we need to widen the tax bracket so in the 15 percent bracket two joint filers a couple with two incomes have to be able to earn twice as much as what a single person can earn in that tax bracket under our proposal in the 15 percent tax bracket we widen it so that twoearner households can earn twice as much that will help shad and michelle hallihan i would point out that the proposal that the gentleman from massachusetts talked about would not help those who itemize and think about it most middleclass families who itemize their taxes itemize because they own a home or they give money to church and charity we as members of congress can all think of our neighbors back home middleclass working families who pursue the american dream they buy a home and because of their mortgage interest costs and because of their property taxes they itemize their taxes the democrats say if one itemizes their taxes they are rich so they should continue to suffer the marriage tax penalty now michelle and shad make 62 000 a year back in the south suburbs of chicago that is kind of a middleclass working family under the democrat definition of rich they are rich making 62 000 a year our goal is to make the tax code more fair when i am in the south side of chicago at a steel workers hall in the tenth ward or a legion post in joliet or at a local iron workers hall in la salle or a chamber of commerce function or coffee shop people tell me theirs taxes are too high but they also point out that the tax code is unfair that is why we should help people like michelle and shad hallihan let us eliminate the marriage tax penalty let us go to conference"], [0.0021469593048095703, 0.9978530406951904, 1, "the issue that we address today will affect every constituent in every congressional district throughout the nation you will hear us repeat numbers facts and figures but truly what we are trying to emphasize that these are just not facts and figures but real people the 2000 census is just around the corner and if we do not stop the partisan rhetoric which has clouded this issue for far too long we will once again keep millions of americans from having a voice as chair of the census and civil rights task force for the hispanic caucus and cochair of the census task force for the democratic caucus i am committed to achieving a fair and accurate census the impact of a fair and accurate census will be felt across the nation in every community and in the lives of every american the information gathered in the census is utilized in many ways it is used by states and local governments to plan schools and highways by the federal government to distribute funds for health care and countless other programs it is used by businesses in creating their own economic plans our last census in 1990 was the first time in history that the count was less accurate than the one before in 1990 more than 8 million americans were not counted and more than 4 million were counted twice in texas as already indicated over 500 000 were not counted in my own home city of san antonio as referredto earlier 40 000 were not counted in a report released by the general accounting office this past week it is reported that 22 of the 25 large formula grant programs use census data as part of their allocation formula those 25 formula grant programs distribute approximately 166 billion in federal funds to the states the 22 formula grant programs that utilize census data account for 97 percent of the total that is 161 billion these are federal tax dollars that citizens across the nation have paid federal dollars that should come back to the community in the form of improved infrastructure better neighborhood schools health care for the poor and the elderly local economic development and much more in my state of texas where over 500 000 were not counted it is estimated that we lost close to 1 billion in federal funding over the past 10 years we were second only to california in the harm caused by an inaccurate count this astronomical loss of funding breaks down to 1 992 per missed person it is estimated that if we utilize the same inaccurate enumeration methods for the 2000 census texas will stand to lose 2 18 billion in federal funds we must realize that this is not a political issue this is an economic issue it is an education issue it is an infrastructure issue and most importantly it is about fairness it is about time that we stop the partisan rhetoric and choose people over party politics every person in this nation counts and every american deserves to be counted it is important to point out exactly who was missed in the 1990 census it is really no surprise because the very people who were not counted in the last census are those communities who are typically overlooked of the 8 million americans not counted minorities children and the poor were disproportionately represented nationally 5 percent of hispanics 4 4 percent of african americans 2 3 percent of asian and pacific islanders and over 12 percent of native americans living on reservations were undercounted in texas the net undercount from the 1990 census was 2 8 percent almost twice as high than the national average of 1 6 percent the percentage of hispanics and children missed in texas were all greater than the national average of the 500 000 texans missed over half were of hispanic origin statewide 3 9 percent of african americans 2 6 percent of asian and pacific islanders and 2 8 percent of native americans were undercounted while missing or miscounting people is a problem for the census the fact that particular groups children the poor people of color city dwellers and renters were missed more often than others produced census data that underrepresented these particular groups each of us should be outraged by these types of inaccuracies the census bureau and other experts have told us that the most accurate census can be obtained by utilizing modern and proven scientific statistical methods these are proven methods proven to be the most accurate system to obtain the census now we know that the constitution calls for an enumeration i agree we should try to count as many people as we possibly can i also realize the obstacles that face us if we rely on this head count alone today society is highly mobile most households are twoincome families there are language barriers and there are people who have a distrust of government these are just some of the obstacles facing us if we choose to continue to employ a head count system alone proven scientific statistical methods can overcome these obstacles and will give us the more accurate count over and above the accuracy we know that this system is cheaper than the actual head count the supreme court recently ruled that these scientific methods can only be used for redistricting and distribution of federal funds and that a head count must be done for the purpose of apportionment if we know we can get the most accurate census through these methods and that they will save us money we must utilize them the gentlewoman from new york who just preceded me has introduced legislation that will amend the census act so that scientifically proven statistical methods can be used for every purpose of the census apportionment redistricting and distribution of federal dollars i believe in this bill and urge all of my colleagues to support it so that every american will be counted and have a voice we must stop the partisan

gentleman from california for their leadership on a crucial and devastating fact of life for our seniors in america it is important to note that those of us who have worked on this issue believe that this is the congress to get it through i am delighted that as an original cosponsor of this legislation for this congress i again stand up to be counted as i did in the 105th congress i do that for the many constituents that i represent in fact allow me to share the story of a husband and wife from my district in houston written to me just a few days ago in january these individuals retired having worked in our school system educating our young people and now in their retirement they are pleading for relief because presently they are spending an average of 4 792 annually on drugs paid by a texas teachers retirement income and social security onefifth of their income is used to pay for prescription drugs i would simply say this has got to stop that means that these senior citizens who have worked all of their life who in fact have a commitment to being part of the engine of this economy for many many years are now having to sacrifice the meager income that they have and to make choices as my good colleague indicated between room and board and health the prescription drug fairness for seniors act is not a giveaway it does not interfere with competitiveness as my pharmaceutical friends have said it does not do damage to the marketplace as they have attacked us so readily what it does is it simply tries to emphasize fairness pharmacies will now be able to purchase prescription drugs for medicare beneficiaries at the same low prices available to the federal government such as the federal supply schedule price or the medicaid price since drug prices presently paid by the federal government are approximately half the retail prices paid by senior citizens participating pharmacies will be able to pass on large cost savings to senior citizens i know that my good friend the gentleman from arkansas has been in his district and has seen the sincerity expressed by seniors who have said they do not want a handout but after we have given them the option of medicare why shouldnt medicare have the same ability to be able to purchase low priced pharmaceuticals competitively priced equal to that of the hmos has anyone ever been in the midst of seniors maybe those who are a little older in their seventies and eighties and heard them plead to us for clarity about these hmos who am i to pick what are they giving me the confusion abounds and yet now we have promoted these hmos over medicare that has been so helpful in providing good health care for our seniors and we have given hmos the upper edge by providing these incentives and yet sometimes seniors are moved from one hmo to the next it shuts down and they get letters and it is confusing oh yes i believe that hmos provide a viable service but those who are on medicare should not be deprived the ability to get lowpriced prescription drugs and to have a fairness process in place so i believe that we are in fact providing what the constitution says we should have and that is equality and we are doing it for a population that is now suffering they suffer because of the way pharmacies are doing business and many americans whose retirement plans rely in part on private pension plans are also struggling this is because many of those plans which were designed decades ago do not contain comprehensive medical plans and even the ones that do include medical insurance typically do not pay for medication in fact i have talked to senior citizens who have said i am going to get that mail order program because i have heard that if you do mail order that you can get cheap prescription drugs so i think it is important that this legislation not have one moment of a slow process it should be expedited it should go through the committees of jurisdiction with flying colors we should respond to the tragedy of senior citizens having to make choices between what they will buy whether they will pay for food for the evening meal or which meal they will escape or not be able to have so that they can get the necessary prescriptions i will just simply say as we work together on this legislation tears have come to my eyes when i have met with senior citizens who first of all are grateful for life gratified for the medical care that many of them have been able to access but when they give me the list of prescriptions that they have to take every single day they do not do it in anger they just simply say we have got to take it but give us a reprieve help us not to be have to choose one over the other so i want to thank the gentleman as i close i want to just make a personal note that from my home district in addition to these prescription drugs i am gratified for the medical health system of which we also need to look at with the patients bill of rights access to medical care i am grateful for the system that is in my community the public hospital system now under attack by county government my commitment to the senior citizens of that community the children of that community is to say that i am going to fight for this legislation the prescription drug fairness for seniors act as well as a patients bill of rights as well as fighting for lois morris our health care director in harris county and fight against anybody who would move to shut it down or to deprive our citizens of good health care by cutting the budget i want to thank

fundamental issue of fairness an issue of fairness that the american people have been asking some pretty basic questions about over the last several years i represent the south side of chicago the south suburbs in cook and will counties as well as bedroom communities and farm communities in illinois and i found whether i was in the steel workers union hall in hegwish or a neighborhood in chicago or at the local legion post in joliet or the local grain elevator in tonica people often ask a basic question is it right is it fair that under our tax code that the average married working couple pays higher taxes just because they are married they say why do the folks in washington allow a tax code to be in place that tells us that if we choose to get married and work we are going to pay more in taxes they are stunned when they learn that 28 million married working couples pay an average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married clearly the marriage tax penalty suffered by working married people is fundamentally wrong and something we should change i am so pleased that the leadership of this house the speaker of the house the gentleman from illinois has made reduction and elimination of the marriage tax penalty the first priority this year first out of the box and on a fast track as a taxrelated initiative to help middleclass families the marriage tax penalty has been in place for almost 30 years and no one has gone back to fix it i am pleased this republican congress has made a decision to bring fairness to the tax code by working to eliminate the marriage tax penalty the marriage tax penalty is something that affects real people i have a photo here of a young couple from joliet illinois shad and michelle hallihan two school teachers they teach in the local public schools in joliet shad and michelle suffer a marriage tax penalty of almost a thousand dollars because they are married they recently had a child a baby and as michelle hallihan pointed out to me she said that 1 000 the marriage tax penalty that they suffer that is 3 000 diapers that they can buy for their child that goes to uncle sam instead of taking care of their child it is real money 1 400 in joliet illinois where shad and michelle live is one years tuition at joliet community college and it is 3 months of day care at a local day care center let me explain how it came about our tax code has grown more complicated and since the late 1960s married working couples moms and dads husbands and wives with two incomes have paid higher taxes just because they are married of course we have made this a priority and i would like to announce of course this wednesday the committee on ways and means is going to be marking up committee action will occur on legislation essentially to wipe out the marriage tax penalty for almost 28 million married work couples a real change that is going to help people this is how the marriage tax penalty works take a machinist and a school teacher in the south suburbs of chicago they have identical incomes this machinist is making 31 500 as a single person under our tax code he is going to be taxed at 15 percent rate so he meets a school teacher a gal with an identical income of 31 500 and they choose to get married and at the point they choose to get married they begin filing their taxes jointly when we file our taxes jointly we combine our two incomes in this case this machinist and school teacher who previously were taxed at 15 percent because they chose to get married their combined income pushes their combined income to 63 000 they pay almost 1 400 more in higher taxes because they are pushed under our tax code into the 28 percent tax bracket the higher tax bracket that is wrong but today that is the current situation for working married couples so really the incentives is in the wrong place marriage is one of the most basic institutions in our society and our tax code punishes marriage i would point out that had this machinist and school teacher chose to live together outside of marriage they would not suffer that extra tax only when they choose to get married do they pay that higher tax and i think we all agree that is wrong that we impose higher taxes on married working people i am proud to say that the house republican leadership under the leadership of speaker hastert has made elimination of the marriage tax penalty our first initiative in an effort to bring fairness to the tax code and lower the tax burden on working families this afternoon the gentleman from texas unveiled the legislation that will provide tax relief for 28 million married working couples it is similar almost identical in many ways to the marriage tax elimination act h r 6 legislation that we introduced earlier this year which now has 230 cosponsors and overwhelming majority of republicans and i am pleased that 12 democrats have joined with us in an effort to make this a bipartisan proposal let me briefly share what the proposal that we will be working on in the committee on ways and means on wednesday will do it is the goal of the house to act and approve and send to the senate by february 14 valentines day our effort to wipe out the marriage tax penalty think about it what better valentines day gift to give 28 million married working people than elimination of the marriage tax penalty this legislation will essentially wipe out the marriage tax penalty for almost everybody who suffers it that will be a big change in our tax code the legislation that we will be acting on and voting out of the house in the next couple of weeks will help 28 million married working couples for those who do not itemize their taxes they will see immediately 230 dollars in marriage tax relief for those who itemize because they own a home they will see 1 400 marriage tax relief under this legislation i would point out that this makes a big difference under our plan we provide immediate marriage tax relief in 2001 next year helping millions of couples and because we double the standard deduction for those who do not itemize for joint filers to twice that of singles 3 million married working couples will see their tax code simplified because they will no longer need to itemize and fill out extra forms so we make filing for taxes easier and for those who do itemize primarily homeowners they will see marriage tax relief as well twentyeight million married work couples will see up to 1 400 in marriage tax relief as a result of what the committee on ways and means will approve on wednesday and i expect that an overwhelming majority of this house will see it approved before valentines day what a great valentines day gift that we can give 28 million married

happening the justice departments civil rights division is the most important weapon we have to fight for equal opportunity through its investigation and prosecution of criminal civil violations violationsof the fair housing and lending laws employment discrimination and other civil rights abuses unfortunately the majority has consistently underfunded this office why this year the administration has asked for 97 9 million and is getting only 86 million from this bill and this is in the midst of a 200 billion budget surplus that is the wrong message to send to the american people about the importance of civil rights this amendment can fix this by fully funding the division with an additional 11 8 million now in the past few years the civil rights division has been more important than ever in pursuing criminal civil rights abuses the nation has experienced the horrors of the torture and deaths of matthew shepard and james byrd and the murder of a reproductive health care provider dr bernard slepian more recently four new york city police officers killed amadou diallo an unarmed immigrant in the lobby of an apartment building and another four officers brutally assaulted abner louima these are just a few of the cases that the division is reviewing the federal bureau of investigation stated that there are 10 461 law enforcement agencies across the united states reporting a staggering total of 8 049 hate crimes in 1998 alone these are conservative numbers though because the truth is many hate crimes go unreported because the victims fear retaliation and many police departments just do not collect such data now while law enforcement offices and agencies pursue the bulk of the offenders the justice department must train those agencies and prosecute those offenders the local officials car not with added funding the civi rights division can hire five just fiv more lawyers and assure that many c these perpetrators are brought to juc tice three prominent civil rights groupe the naacp the aclu and the na tional asian pacific american lega consortium have pointed out in a let ter to the house that one of the mos pressing issues for many americans i that of police misconduct the department has investigated th police departments of washington d c new york city new orleans and lo angeles and many others for numer ous offenses including excessive force prior investigations have led to con sent decrees with local police depart ments including steubenville ohio and pittsburgh pennsylvania foi using excessive force and impropei searches in december 1988 thejustice depart ment was conducting six public inves tigations with eight attorney throughout the country and in december 1999 the department was inves tigating at least 12police department with just the same number of attorneys as the previous year we cannot expect the department tc increase its workload in this mannei without adding additional resources andso this amendment would permit the division to hire three muchneeded attorneys to prosecute police misconduct and so my colleagues i urge my colleagues to support the serranoconyers amendment it adds modest funding to the civil rights division all to oftenthe majority gives our nations civil rightslaws mere lip serviceoffering us civil rights on the cheap the budget before us today confirms my worst fears if you look at the actual evidence in critical areas such as hate crimes police misconduct employment and housing you will see that there is overwhelming evidence of ongoing discrimination in our society yet the budget actually under funds the critical civil rights division to the tune of 11 million consider the problem in hate crimes our nation has only recently began the healing process in the aftermath of the tortures and deaths of james byrd jr and matthew shepard in laramie wyoming in the years 1991 through 1997 there were more than 50 000 hate crimes reported 1 this is why the conyersserrano amendment would allow the division to hire five new attorneys to help prosecute hate crimes and other civil rights crimes the incidence of police misconduct toward minorities is also growing dramatically in pittsburgh a police officer shot to death a black motorist who had slowed down and peered through his side window while observing a drug arrest in riverside california a 19yearold black woman was shot to death by a policeman in her car at agas station and we all know thatamadou diallo a west african immigrant was shot 41 times in the vestibule of his bronx apartment by four police officers at a time when the civil rights division is on the verge of being totally overwhelmed i our amendment would also allow the division il to retain three additional attorneys to fighl against police pattern and practice misof conduct the problem with regard to employment and housing discrimination is no better the number of employment discrimination cases in federal courts has almost tripled between 1 1990 and 1998 from 8 413 complaints to 1 23 735 the bipartisan glass ceiling commist sion recently found that 95 percent of top cors porate jobs in america are held by white

chased out of his apartment in vidor texas after he had moved there pursuant to a fed eral court order requiring that the allwhite housing complex in that city be desegregated this is why our

in opposition to the bill before us today and in strong support of the substitute being offered on our side here we are in washington in the middle of july but one would think with the legislation before us that it is the middle of the winter because we have been hit with a veritable blizzard of large taxcutting measures the closer we get to election day my constituents in western wisconsin honestly know a snowjob when they see it unfortunately i think this is just another of a series of electionyear politics playing politics with future budget surpluses because that is what this debate is really about what is the best priority use of future budget surpluses if in fact they do materialize there is a clear difference between the two parties on this i came to washington with a lot of concern in regards to the 5 7 trillion national debt i am the father of two little boys who are just 4 and 2 and i refuse to support policies that are going to make it more difficult for us to eliminate this legacy of debt that we are due to pass on to future generations unless we have the courage to resist large tax cuts now and use the money for debt reduction and shoring up social security and medicare the series of tax cuts when you put them all together would virtually consume every last cent of projected budget surpluses if in fact they materialize at all there is no guarantee that they will but let us talk for a minute about the policy implications of these series of tax cuts and who better to listen from than the chairman of the federal reserve board chairman greenspan this is basic macroeconomics 101 he has been telling us consistently in his testimony large tax cuts now are bad economic policy because it will overstimulate the economy and force the federal reserve to increase interest rates to slow the economy down that would be detrimental to all citizens who need to make home car credit card student loan or other payments it will also make it more worthy to invest in new capital and create more jobs here are just a couple of statements that chairman greenspan said saving the surpluses if politically feasible is in my judgment the most important fiscal measure we can take at this time to foster continued improvements in productivity another one we probably would be better off holding off on a tax cut immediately largely because it is apparent that the surpluses are doing a great deal of good to the economy perhaps most importantly chairman greenspan said this lawmakers are counting on unpredictable economic trends to continue producing the budget surpluses they need to pay for their tax cuts the longterm forecasts are often inaccurate and lead to vast errors in predicting budget deficits and surpluses you should not commit contingent potential resources to irreversible uses that is exactly what we are doing in these series of tax cuts when you look at them all together go slow we can provide modest tax relief for families who need it but we need to do it in a fiscally responsible way let us not bank our future on projected surpluses that may never materialize let me be clear the house leadership has embarked on a series of tax cuts that will obliterate a surplus that is the hardwon product of nearly 8 years of fiscal discipline taken all the tax cuts offered in this session over two trillion dollars they will consume virtually the entire projected budget surplus in the next 10 years and then explode in the second 10 years now is not the time to abandon responsible budgeting by spending money before it even comes in the door further this bill will leave fewer resources for other priorities within the medicare program including extending the solvency of the medicare trust fund creating a medicare prescription drug coverage benefit investing in education and providing relief to rural hospitals and other health care providers i support the substitute to h r 4865 this substitute is fiscally responsible and will provide tax relief for middle income seniors who need the most assistance rather than eliminating the tax for all seniors this proposal sustains the tax on social security benefits for individuals who earn more than 80 000 and for couples eaming more than 100 000 roughly 95 percent of all seniors are covered under the altemative furthermore this substitute will only go into effect those years in which there is enough of an onbudget surplus to replace lost revenues i have always felt that if projected budget surpluses do in fact materialize we have a number of existing obligations that we must meet such as paying off our 5 7 trillion national debt shoring up social security and modernizing medicare with a prescription drug benefit and investing in education these should be our top national priorities before we pass large tax cuts that will benefit the most wealthy and consume the entire projected budget surplus that may or may not materialize if those commitments are given their due priority then fiscally responsible tax relief can be provided to those struggling families trying to make ends meet we must not enact risky tax cuts today that will result in harming our seniors and our children tomorrow i urge my colleagues to vote against this final bill americas seniors are depending on us to balance the needs for tax relief with the need for medicare solvency we can do both in a fiscally responsible way"], [0.0022478699684143066, 0.9977521300315857, 1, "i rise to express my strongest opposition to h r 2684 the vahud and independent

regretfully i cannot in spite of the hard work of my colleagues chairman james walsh and ranking member alan mollohan who did their best under difficult budgetary constraints this bill makes unacceptable cuts to essential housing science space environmental and veteran programs for example this bill funds the department of housing and urban development at 26 1 billionnearly 2 billion below the administrations request this translates into cuts in all of huds major programs including the community development block grant program home program public housing capital assistance drug elimination grants homeless programs fair housing activities brownfields cleanup and development leadbased paint abatement and housing for persons with aids the residents of l a county where housing demand is more than three times higher than the rest of the nation and rents are at record levels will be devastated i have received dozens of letters from service and housing providers in los angeles decrying these proposed cuts they state over and over again that these cuts will severely undermine their ability to serve our homeless veterans and working families for example los angeles countys average apartment rent is a startling 982 a month 19 higher than the national average this june southern californias median home price hit an alltime high of 204 000 these trends are troubling for a number of reasons rising rents means our working families will be forced to double or tripleup leading to severe overcrowding in fact the la housing department estimates that 25 of poor renters already live in overcrowded conditions many of them having 7 or more people sharing a twobedroom apartment rising rents also means that many families will be forced to seek cheaper housing inland leading to longer commutes more freeway congestion and more smog rising rents is also bad for business as it makes it more difficult for growing companies to attract workers making them less competitive and forcing them to leave the area furthermore this bill makes unacceptable cuts to the national aeronautics and space administration better known as nasa the bill butchers nasas budget by a whopping 1 billiona 7 cut from last years level programs facing the republican scalpel include basic research in astronomy earth science and space science nasa administrator dan goldin has stated that these cuts will decimate key elements of the nations space program requiring the largest restructuring since the end of the apollo program this bills cuts to nasa will effectively decimate the nations future space science program making substantial reductions in the explorer programs the discovery program and ptehber 9 4 999 supporting research and technology all mainstays of universityc research upcoming missions managed by scientists at the university of california campuses will also be impacted including the mars polar lander missi6n at ucla extreme ultraviolet explorer observatory at uc berkeley and the triana satellite at uc san diego the bill also reduces the national science foundations budget by 24 million from last years level and 275 million less than requested by the administration nsf supports basic research thats fundamentally important to all aspects of our lives from basic biological research to information technology at a time when we are grappling with the need to improve our schoolchildrens math and science skills this cut will deprive thousands of teachers the training they need in these very fields basic research is also vital to maintaining this nations preeminence in science and space exploration into the next century our california universities in particular are extremely concerned about the impact of these reductions on universitybased research california receives over 10 of all national science foundations research grants and these cuts will limit the number of grants to promising new researchers to dangerously low levels to add

maintain current services while the appropriations committee added 700 million to the va account they rejected an attempt to restore even more funding my colleague from texas representative chet edwards offered an amendment to increase veterans health care spending by an additional 730 million mindful of the need to be fiscally responsible mr edwards proposed to pay for this increase by delaying the proposed cut in the capital gains tax which is one the prized goodies included in republican leaderships tax bill this amendment failed on a party line vote reaffirming that republicans

eliminate waste fraud and abuse in the federal government and in federal spending i want to start out by alerting members to a brief history lesson on where congressional overspending has gone over the last 30 years in fact going back to 1970 members can see the line below the baseline here is the amount of money that the congress has spent money that it did not have this is deficit quantity spending back in 1970 we began a dangerous habit and trend going down here in 1976 here we were at almost 100 billion in deficits we continued to drop and drop spending more and more without regard to the cash that was on hand for the federal government we can see here in 1982 and 1986 the height of democrat control of congress was when we were on a virtually spending spree here in washington then when deficits got at about their worst down in this area that is about the point in time that the american people changed their mind this is when the republican revolution took place americans were fed up with a congress that year after year after year from 1970 right on up to the 19921993 fiscal years had spent more money than it had on hand in fact borrowing from my children and the children of every other american in order to appease the spending appetite and habits of washington that ended at about this point here we can see the line beginning to go up when a new idea a new party was put in charge with majority status in congress members can see when we took over that the deficit spending began to ease that we began to start moving toward a goal of spending the dollars that we actually had on hand to run the legitimate purposes of the federal government back there in 1994 when republicans took over the congress they promised in a great contract with america that we would balance the budget by the year 2002 well we underpromised and overdelivered because right here in 1998 was the first year in 30 years that the expenditures came above the line here of our baseline spending in other words we began to start saving money this little purple section here represents a cash surplus that we began to accumulate here in washington d c it is this surplus that has allowed us to do a number of things one it has allowed us to stop borrowing the money i would remind my colleagues when we start borrowing money spending more money than the congress actually has to spend we borrow it from somewhere and the fund of preference for many many years has been the social security system in fact this congress and the white house has raided the social security trust fund the social security system to the tune of about 638 billion over a little bit shorter of a time frame this goes back to 1984 once again we can take a look at where we were when we came here and president clinton continued and this was the year of the tax increase and the year that the congress spent quite a lot of money at the presidents insistence again in 1998 this congress got serious about stopping the raid on social security members can see the dramatic decrease this is not the final column of the graph here this is an actual decrease in the propensity of congress to borrow from the social security system this is an effort to stop the raid on social security members can see that that does end right here this year in 1999 the first year we stopped raiding the social security system in order to pay for government that is a trend we want to see continue in fact we want to see this line continue to go down further and build greater surpluses including the social security fund in order to accomplish that we have to exercise some fiscal discipline right now this year in congress that is the debate that is taking place presently between the white house and the congress here is one of the suggestions we came up with as a republican majority to avoid raiding social security as the president has proposed to do we have proposed that of the increase in spending that we have budgeted for this year that we just tighten our belt a little bit for every dollar in federal spending we are asking the federal government to come up the federal bureaucrats and the federal agencies to come up with one cent in savings in efficiency savings in order to help rescue the social security fund and to stop borrowing from the social security system we want to stop that raid we think that out of every dollar that is spent in washington we can find that one cent in savings and continue to run the legitimate programs and the legitimate services that are needed and necessary under our federal system and do it in a way that allows us to save social security at the same time that is what that one penny on the dollar represents when we suggested this idea folks over at the white house almost had a heart attack they said one penny on the dollar we cannot possibly come up with one penny on the dollar in savings because that would cripple the federal government finding this one cent in savings therein lies the difference between the republican majority in washington and the liberal democrat leadership that we find down at the white house we believe that the government can do what every american family does every day work a little harder to find that one cent savings to just simply start realizing that we can be more efficient and more effective with a whole assortment of federal programs to find that one cent again it was a little frustrating but not surprising here in washington to hear the various cabinet secretaries say we cannot find that one penny on the dollar all of the federal departments are so efficient so lean so effective so accountable with their dollars that we cannot possibly find the savings necessary to save social security so we as members of congress decided that we would take it upon ourselves to help that is the point of todays special order i appreciate members going through that brief history with me about how it is we came to the position we are in it is a very relevant and important position to consider because at this very moment the impasse in passing a budget hinges on the difference of opinion between this congress and that white house to find that one penny and do it in a way that honors and respects not only the taxpayers of america but the children of america who rely on a sound and credibly run government and certainly the seniors the current retirees who rely on social security there are a number of great examples one of our colleagues who i have been told was planning on joining us here issued a report out of his committee and that report lists assuming i can put my fingers on it lists just agency by agency the savings that can be found here are some good examples here is the gentleman from california who has arrived in his report he e2319 suggested that we could find savings in the department of agriculture he cited examples in the department of defense the department of defense spent nearly 40 billion on programs for 15 overseas telecommunications systems that cannot be fully used because the department failed to obtain proper certifications and approvals from the host nations that is according to a 1999 inspector general report we found savings in the department of education 3 3 in loan guarantees for defaulted student loans according to one general accounting office audit there is more we will talk about more of that today he found savings in the energy department in the health and human services department administration and so on and so forth it is not hard to find savings to find that one penny if you are devoted to rolling up your sleeves and doing the hard work of finding the money it is an important proposition i suggest for this congress and for the white house rather than fighting over the relative merit of saving one penny out of a dollar to save social security we ought to be joining in partnership and rolling up our sleeves together and getting down in the trenches at the department of education in the department of defense over at the department of energy over in health and human services and working together cooperatively to find all the efficiencies and savings that we possibly can to build a credible government for the future security of our children and for our nation i yield to the gentleman from california who has led the house through this investigation of where these funds may be found and pointed not only me but other colleagues in the direction that we ought to look in order to find some of these savings"],

history as he just did he just indicated that in 1974 when the congress was under democratic control it added 3 months to the fiscal year implying that it did it simply for some fiscal gimmick reason that is nonsense he and i were both here at that time and we ought to both remember what happened we had a new budget act passed that year what that budget act did was change the fiscal year the fiscal year used to start on july 1 and because congress could not get its work done since it only came in in january and had just a very few months to do its work what they did was to change the fiscal year so that in the future instead of running from july 1 to july 1 it would run from october 1 to october 1 recognizing the reality of the congressional schedule we did not do as the majority party at least in the senate suggested doing we did not add a 13th month to the fiscal year in order to hide the spending of 20 billion as is now being done on the laborhealtheducation bill i also will insert in the record an article in usa today dated september 28th which is entitled congress looks to gimmicks to bend budget rules i would like to return to some of the thoughts that i was trying to complete a few minutes earlier we have heard a great deal of debate today about whether or not congress is going to be invading the social security surplus in the coming year or not i want to lay out what the facts are the congressional budget office on july 1 indicated that we would have for the coming year a surplus of about 14 billion that was based on the assumption that congress would stick to outlay caps for appropriations bills which were in existing law but the congressional budget office which is after all the fiscal referee and the chairman of which is appointed by the republican majority that congressional budget office says that the house committee on appropriations has already allocated 17 billion above the caps for nonemergency spending then on top of that they are well down the road to allocating 14 billion more to the various appropriations subcommittees pretending that the 14 billion surplus which existed in july still exists it does not as cbo makes quite clear then if you add to that the 4 billion which they have set aside for the socalled emergency census and if you add to that the funding which the majority party leadership has already indicated it supports for supplementals totaling about 10 billion in outlays and if you add to that the tax extenders which they intend to pass and the medicare giveback package which they intend to pass you can see why virtually every major national newspaper already recognizes that this congress is spending 35 billion or so out of that social security surplus i am not criticizing the individual decisions made by the majority i am simply suggesting that if those decisions are to be made they ought not be masked behind a smoke screen of false rhetoric and in my view that is what is happening on this issue i would simply point out as a practical person that when we get rid of these artificial constructs if we handle things right we will still be in a position where next year we will pay down the deficit by about 10 billion no matter what phony social security construct or what phony budget cap construct is put on it in the end when this congress comes to its senses rec ognizes it cannot gut the presidents priorities and that it cannot fool the public into thinking that these gimmicks that they are engaging in do not spend money what i am saying is in the end if we negotiate this outright we will still bring down that public debt this year by about 120 billion and we will have done the same thing this year in a fairly similar amount we all ought to be able to recognize that that is a reasonable achievement and if we would just recognize that rather than wasting immeasurable time building these phony constructs i think in the end we would produce a better budget and we would have more time to focus on what works rather than focusing on which accounting gimmick is the most sly and in the process just by accident we might even improve the publics ability to believe what we say so i would say in closing i think rather than listening to the false rhetoric that we heard on the floor earlier today on the social security proposition i think the public in judging what this republicancontrolled congress is doing on the budget ought to take the advice of that wellknown defender of liberty john mitchell the former attorney general under richard nixon who said once that to understand what the republicans were doing it was necessary to watch what we do not what we say i think the press has been doing that i think the public has been doing that and that is why

plan in the 1980s that we are now finishing i am very proud of the fact that the city of houston as my colleague says the fourth largest city in the country just does not do things like everybody else does we are a major city and a great city in this country because we do not just do it the same way we are the city that built the astrodome we are the city that has a port that is off the shores of texas and the second largest port in the nation we are a city that does not say that they are not a great city unless they have rail and the reason is and i might point out to my colleagues if they had been involved in all the rail systems as i have and the chairman has for over 15 years they would understand why l a is getting out of the rail business because it is a boondoggle and a black hole for a city that is spread out like l a i might say that houston has stepped outside of the box and developed a regional bus plan that is the model for major cities in america this bill has over 20 million in it finishing the last part of 500 million in building one of the best bus systems in the world because we did not grab ahold of the notion that in order to be a great city they have to have a rail system every line that the gentleman from texas talked about every one of those lines loses huge amounts of money and takes money away from mobility systems for those cities but they do get to take a picture of a nice train and put it in their brochures and it makes everybody feel good the problem here in this particular dispute is that the houston metro following the design of many other cities and the gentleman says no elections were held in those other cities it is because the other cities did not pay attention to the voters in those cities and developed the same strategy that is going on here in houston they developed the strategy of starting a little starter line and when it does not make money and becomes a huge hole for transit funds they go to the people and say we made this great investment but it does not work only because we do not have this other line and when that does not work they say well we are just going to build another line and then they wake up and develop what dallas now has dallas now has a rail line but now has surpassed houston in congestion because dallas is more concentrated on rail than they are for the mobility in dallas i do not want to see that happen in houston it is my responsibility as a member of this committee to make sure that the full funding grant by the fta the 500 million is finished what houston metro wanted to do is take money from the regional bus plan from our regional mobility plan and move it to a rail line that makes no sense whatsoever transportationwise my good colleague and friend the gentlewoman from texas says no criticism there is all kinds of criticism including houston metros own study that says this does not help mobility this does not help transportation and this does not help the environment this is an economic development project to build a signature main street in houston texas a very worthwhile project but this is not a transit system this will not carry anybody this will not get anybody off our freeways this will not get bubba i say to the gentleman from texas out of his pickup and put him on a rail system this is an economic development project my position is if they are going to build a huge rail system in the houston region then the people of the houston region ought to vote on it and decide whether they want a rail system or not instead of doing the back doorway that was done in dallas that was done in portland that was done in miami that was done in many other cities that i described there is no transit benefit here major transportation decisions like the proposal to build this system in houston should be decided by the whole community as things stand today houstonians cannot make an informed decision because metro does not have a comprehensive light rail system

luckily through the bipartisan leadership of my friends and colleagues the gentleman from michigan and the gentleman from nebraska many of these issues have been addressed convincingly let us look at the facts the levinbereuter plan provides better oversight for human rights and protections than exist under current law it provides strong and enforceable antisurge protections which are part of the original agreement with the chinese government and will now be codified the levinbereuter provisions not only ensure that chinese play by the rules in trade but more importantly they strengthen unitedstates law to provide quick and effective weapons if there is a violation the bill includes language from levinbereuter urging that the wto approve both the prcs and taiwans accession in the

concession and compromise the good friday agreement itself was a compromise the good friday agreement itself was based on very strong concessions made by all sides particularly by the catholic community the nationalist community the republican community who made very deep concessions in return for a pledge by the british and irish governments that all the provisions of the good friday agreement would be carried out no provision was more important in the patten commission than the section dealing with police reform because in the north of ireland for three decades the royal ulster constabulary was guilty of the most vicious and gross human rights violations imaginable it is hard for us as americans to envision in the english speaking world in the united kingdom which stands for

police have to be reformed that was an integral part the integral part of the good friday agreement and the patten commission which was chaired by chris patten a conservative mp a former conservative mp a minister in margaret thatchers government he came up with a series of reforms which again were themselves a compromise there is much that is lacking as the gentleman from new jersey chairman smith has pointed out time and again the patten commission itself the patten commission recommendations themselves are deficient yet now the british government is attempting to compromise the compromise it is attempting to water down the compromise of the patten commission to come out with a series of reforms that will not be reforms at all it will just be a readjustment of the status quo it will be a continuation of the royal ulster constabulary not even under a new name because the old name will still remain it will be a subset but it will still be there and this is wrong the entire peace process is at risk the entire peace process is being put at risk by the british government by the ulster unionist party and probably nothing is more aggravating than to hear someone like david trimble who is head of the ulster unionist party to say that we in the congress should not get involved that the american government should not get involved the reality is that on the night the good friday agreement was reached and the morning that it was signed david trimble would not sign it until he was assured by president clinton that the unitedstates would stay involved and now that we are involved he is saying that we should get out and back away from the agreement and allow it to go back to the status quo the way it was for three decades and seven decades and even three centuries if we want to go all the way back where the catholic community was systematically discriminated against and had their rights violated it is essential for us in the congress to stand together it is essential for the president to speak out as clearly as he has in the past to let the british government know to let tony blair know let the british secretary of state peter mandelson know that they cannot continue to violate the rights of catholics they cannot take the nationalist community for granted the fact is an agreement was signed an international agreement and the british government has the absolute obligation to enforce that agreement it cannot back down and cannot succumb to blackmail from david trimble because if it does it puts at risk the entire peace process and we will go back

things that are in this tax bill we believe vice president gore is correct when he says we ought to make careful decisions and selections about whose taxes are going to get cut that is what we ought to attempt to do we ought to target those tax cuts but you have to target the tax cuts especially when you are dealing with pensions and health care as much of this does you ought to target it so as to increase the number of people who have pensions all of us here in congress arent going to have any difficulty contributing to get another 5 000 we have plenty of disposable income to come up with the money to be able to increase our contributions the problem is for that minimumwage or slightly over individual in a small business who is struggling to get it done the same on health insurance if you are trying to increase the number of people who have health insurance you have to do more than what is in this tax package my friend from texas senator gramm was talking about the value of the tax deduction the value of the tax deduction is much greater the higher your income i get a 40percent subsidy as a consequence of the level of my income but if my income is 16 000 a year i dont get any deduction if i am paying at the 15percent rate i get a 15percent deduction that is how it works the joint tax committee estimates that 26 million people will get benefits as a consequence of the health care provisions but only 1 6 million of those people are people who currently dont have health insurance republicans in congress i think correctly are saying that what governor bush said in the third debate that is the difference between my opponent and i he wants washington to decide and select who gets a tax cut republicans apparently are saying that the governor is wrong because we are going to select who gets the tax cuts if you are going to have a tax cut right now it seems to me one of the things we ought to try to do is to say this remarkable recovery we are having right now has been fabulous but there are some people who have been left behind lets try to help them acquire pensions in their part of the american dream lets try to help them acquire health insurance in their part of the american dream we dont do that as i said i heard my republican friends assert several times that democrats were on board and support many of the provisions that is true but we added provisions that were stricken out we added provisions that would have made the proposal much more fair i believe you cannot apply a fairness test every single time you are doing things thereare times when life isnt fair but when you are giving tax cuts to american working families it seems to me a test of fairness is appropriate when you are trying to increase the number of people who have pensions in the workforce when you are trying to increase the number of people who have health insurance a test of fairness is appropriate for members of congress to try to apply to the piece of legislation we are considering those are the two objections i have to what is going on right now the first is i think we have lost our way when it comes to fiscal discipline the discipline that enabled us to say to a citizen when a citizen comes and says senator it only costs 100 million over 10 would you offer an amendment and i would always say in the 1990s well i have to have a pay for i have to find an offset not anymore if the paygo provisions of the budget act are repealed as is proposed in this tax bill no longer will that be necessary it used to be i would say look this is going to be tough because it is beyond what we authorized in the budget act and to get 60 votes to waive the budget act is going to be hard not any longer does it appear to be difficult to waive the budget act that discipline that enabled us to get where we are today is at risk in the closing days of the 106th congress i hope that in this election the american people will say loud and clear we recognize the value of that fiscal discipline we benefited from economic growth we benefited from lower mortgage payments we benefited from greater opportunity as a consequence of congress getting its act together all the way through the 1980s and 1990 1993 and in 1997 secondly i have great objection as i look at especially the tax cut proposal but also the bba giveback proposal that we simply havent applied a test of fairness that is why it was a mistake for republicans to have a meeting with only republicans if you want something to be bipartisan you have to let democrats in the room likewise democrats cant hold a meeting and expect it to be bipartisan if we are the only ones in the room and then go out and say gee i dont understand why senator hatch wont sign on board it is something he supported years ago i dont understand why he wont support this it is similar to something he was talking about the answer is he wasnt in the room he didnt have an opportunity to voice his concern he didnt have an opportunity to say what he liked or didnt like what the republicans did is they brought something that stripped out things we had agreed to and they did not apply a test of fairness as a consequence i am pl eased especially connected to the loss of fiscal discipline that in the closing days of the 106th the president has indicated he is going to veto these two pieces of legislation i think the american people will be the beneficiaries of it my hope is on both of them that it will result in bipartisan negotiation and producing something the president can sign it can be done we dont have to run out of here over the weekend we know exactly what to do it would take us about 30 minutes to put together a tax bill and a bba giveback bill that would get 80 votes on this floor we wouldnt have to sit and say i wonder if the president is going to sign it we would know he would sign it if we have 80 votes he is going to sign it the last time i checked that is still enough to override a veto but we didnt do that as a result we are left here on october 27 27 days beyond the time we were supposed to be done and home we are left here still a long way to go before we have an agreement a long way to go before we will be able to say we have closed up shop and we have finished the peoples business i yield the floor"], [0.9944016337394714, 0.9944016337394714, 0, "i rise in support of h r 4444 which would extend to the peoples republic of china permanent normal trade relations more importantly however passage of this bill serves to ratify the bilateral trade agreement reached between the unitedstates and china last fall as a condition for chinas accession into the worid trade organization this will be the only vote congress has on this momentous agreement on the one hand china is a potential boom market for our industries particulariy agriculture which is critically important to my district bringing china into the wto has the potential of making the port of hueneme in my district an even more important portal for pacific rim trade with 20 percent of the worids population china is an appealing market it behooves us to work diligently and intelligently to open that market to unitedstates sellers the other hand carries many pitfalls chinas track record in meeting its obligations under international agreements is not good china is the only remaining communist superpower china has stolen our nuclear secrets and threatens stability in asia with her belligerence towards taiwan and others we ignore that reality at our own peril last year i voted against a oneyear extension of chinas most favored nation status based on two criteria the united states maintains a multibilliondollar trade deficit with china and has for years and china has repeatedly demonstrated an aggressive military stance that includes stealing our most important nuclear secrets at the beginning of this debate i was not automatically against chinas entry into the world trade organization but i did have some very serious concerns wto membership carries more protection for the united states than does most favored nation status mfn has been a oneway street it was a unilateral decision on our part to allow china access to our markets with no reciprocal opening on chinas behalf wto is more of a twoway street china must meet and maintain certain opendoor criteria to remain in the wto our trade with china historically has been a oneway street in 1990 our trade deficit with china stood at 10 4 billion by 1998 that deficit had climbed to 56 9 billion it is estimated our trade deficit with china in 1999 will be 66 4 billion chinas entry into wto and the ratification of the unitedstates china trade agreement can ease that deficit but only if the agreement has teeth i believe the wto process has those teeth in 1992 china and the unitedstates signed a bilateral memorandum of understanding on trade access china has violated it many times in 1992 we also struck a deal with china to protect intellectual property including copyrights on unitedstates products today unitedstates copyrights for motion pictures and software in china are still being stolen by chinese companies a situation that results in the loss of billions of dollars and many thousands of american jobs chinese noncompliance has forced us to threaten trade sanctions several times on the national security front china was continuing a systematic raid on the designs of our most sophisticated thermonuclear weapons at the same time that it was modernizing and pretending to normalize relations with the unitedstates among the stolen designs was information on the neutron bomb which to date no nation has opted to deploy and hopefully no one will even though china has been caught redhanded it continues to deny its espionage meanwhile it continues to showcase its belligerency by transferring sensitive missile technology to north korea and by repeatedly threatening to attack taiwan the unitedstates china agreement can have positive consequences for the unitedstates china and indeed the entire world the agreement will force china to open its markets to unitedstates goods and services which will result in a lowering of the trade deficit it could wean china from its passion for subsidies and govemment interference in its industries it could educate the chinese on the rule of law as opposed to its current system of rule by the whim of its leaders it could also hasten the spread of democracy within her borders each time a country has opened its economic markets an open market of ideas has followed but we must step carefully we must not let our desire to access chinas markets to blind us to chinas distaste for democracy her threat to our national security and her history of violating international laws and agreements for the wto agreement to work it must level the playing field for unitedstates exporters and be fully enforceable anything less will not open chinas markets or advance the historical trend toward truly free trade and the rule of law since the unitedstates signed a bilateral trade agreement with china last year i have said repeatedly that my vote for or against permanent trade relations with china would rely on specific factors it must protect american jobs ensure chinese markets are open to american goods and services protect americas strategic interests andbe enforceable i have made it clear that without those provisions i would vote against permanent normal trade relations some of those protections were not in the bill until last night those protections are in the bill only because i and other members of congress withheld our support until every t was dotted by working behind the scenes we were able to force concessions that make this agreement a better deal for american businesses american workers and for those who support greater human rights for the chinese people last night a bipartisan provision was incorporated into the bill that makes it easier for us to monitor chinas trade compliance and act if need be that provision builds on provisions in the world trade organization agreement that allows us to continue to treat china as a communist economy thats important because our safeguards and antidumping countermeasures are more stringent for communist economies than it is for capitalist countries in addition the revised bill continues congress allimportant right to debate and vote on chinas human rights practices and international behavior each year the european union signed its wto agreement with china on friday followed by an agreement with australia on monday both were negotiated with chinas history of duplicity in mind in particular the eu agreement improves the deal signed by the unitedstates by making china significantly more open to foreign investment and trade under wto rules those provisions are open to the unitedstates as well we have given china permanent normal trade relations but this is not the end only the beginning china has at best a mixed record of living up to international agreements and i still have concerns about chinas adherence to this one but i am satisfied we have the

provision is attached to the defense authorization bill and this is the kennedy hate crimes legislation it was not part of the house package it was not considered in the house i say that because i know that we do that in this body where something is considered in the senate it is considered in the conference but it certainly is something that has not been considered and debated in this body i think that makes a difference as we consider this motion to instruct let me first look at what this kennedy amendment in the defense authorization bill provides it is the hate crimes amendment it is what the motion to instruct binds this body to support in the conference it first of all expands the protected groups to include gender sexual orientation or disability now what is important to remember is that we already have a federal crime there is a federal crime to interfere with anyones exercise of a federally protected activity this could be voting this could be traveling interstate commerce exercising any number of federally protected rights it is a federal crime if those rights are interfered with because of race because of color because of religion or ethnicity so that is the current state of the law the kennedy amendment would expand those protected rights to include other categories as i mentioned gender sexual orientation and disability the second point that needs to be made about the kennedy amendment is that it makes it a federal hate crime and it creates the federal hate crime and expands it without the requirement of a federally protected activity this is a significant difference from the current law what we need to remember is that this is a significant substantial expansion of federal jurisdiction over crime in our country it is not always wrong to expand federal jurisdiction as has been pointed out we have done that from time to time in this body but whenever we expand federal jurisdiction we should ask some basic questions first of all is this expansion constitutional that is the responsibility we have secondly if it is constitutional is it necessary is there such a gap in the current law that this expansion is required so we want to talk about those particular questions but before i do i wint to address what the minority leader spoke about how this conduct of targeting minority groups or special groups because of a certain characteristic is intolerable in our society and i agree with that completely in fact when i was a united states attorney i had the responsibility that i did not ask for of prosecuting a hate group that group was known as the covenant the sword and the arm of the lord it was in northern arkansas it was in my district that group led by james ellison had targeted homosexuals it had targeted minorities from jewish americans to african americans they had blown up a jewish synagogue in missouri they had killed a pawnshop owner in texarkana arkansas because they perceived that he was jewish it was clearly a hate group it was a hate group that had violated the law i prosecuted that group at the same time i prosecuted them they had targeted my family for assassination so i know something about hate groups i certainly have not been the victim of racial discrimination i would never say that but i know about hate groups from that experience i see how wrong they are for society i see the poison they are for the new generation coming up we should do everything in our society that is appropriate that we can stand against this we should speak out against it we should express outrage by it and prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law i would personally love to be a prosecutor that would go from jurisdiction to jurisdiction prosecuting hate groups and those that engage in hate crimes i think we have to do that so with that background i want to say that targeting any group because of race gender sexual orientation religion or disability should not be tolerated in any civilized society but it should most certainly not be tolerated in the freest country in the world the united states of america but then we come back to the first question and that is is this expansion of federal jurisdiction constitutional we are all aware of the warnings that have been given by the united states supreme court we recall the lopez decision which arose out of our expansion of federal criminal jurisdiction to guns being found in school zones and we said that ought to be a federal crime the united states supreme court said but even these modernera precedents which have expanded congressional power under the commerce clause confirm that that power is subject to outer limits the court has warned that the scope of the interstate commerce power must be considered in the light of our dual system of government and may not be extended so as to embrace effects upon interstate commerce and they continue to warn the congress of the united states to be careful that we do not effectually obliterate the distinction between what is national and what is local and create a completely centralized government that is a warning by the united states supreme court they also said in another case we are also familiar with in united states v morrison something i believe in which is an expansion of the violence against women act to create a civil cause of action for criminal conduct that was engaged in because of someones gender which allowed them to bring a civil lawsuit the court struck that law down as well and said the constitution requires a distinction between what is truly national and what is truly local obviously citing the lopez case and recognizing this fact we preserve one of the few principles that has been consistent since the clause was adopted the regulation and punishment of intrastate violence that is not directed at the instrumentalities channels or goods involved in interstate commerce has always been the province of the states so clearly we have some warnings from the supreme court is it constitutional they have raised some questions about it the washington post not exactly a conservative journal editorialized and said rape murder and assault no matter what prejudice motivates the perpetrator are presumptively local matters in which the federal government should intervene only when it has a pressing interest the fact that hatred lurks behind a violent incident is not in our view an adequate federal interest a constitutional warning by the washington post so certainly there should be some questions about is this the right direction to go constitutionally secondly even if we say that it is is it necessary i would point out and i am pleased with this that our federal sentencing guidelines based upon the direction given by the united states congress they have enhanced the penalties for hate crimes but they have done it after the conviction when it is appropriate to consider the targeting of a minority group as a factor in increasing penalties this is what the federal sentencing guidelines says if the finder of fact at trial the court at sentencing determines beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intentionally selected any victim or any property as the object of the offense of conviction because of the actual or perceived race color religion national origin ethnicity gender disability or sexual orientation of any person the penalty should be increased by three levels and as we all know that is a significant increase in the amount of time that they would be incarcerated so the current state of the law is that the targeting of these special groups is a significant federal factor in enhancing punishment that is right that is appropriate but that is a different scheme than making a special federal statute that would give special protection to certain groups the second thing i would point out is it necessary is what are the states doing in the current prosecutorial scheme the minority leader mentioned the cries of the mother of matthew shepard calling that this is not to be tolerated in our society and how we should honor the victims of violence and we should honor them but in matthew shepards case a homosexual college student as my colleagues know that was murdered in laramie wyoming it was a state court prosecution in which one the defendants pled guilty and got two consecutive life sentences they might create a federal hate crimes statute that they will not get any more than that and the other could be facing the death penalty when it is tried in october another one the murder of james byrd a horrendous crime in texas targeting an african american it was a state prosecution in which the jury gave death by injection rather than life in prison and so it was the ultimate punishment that was meted out in this case under a state prosecution in alabama there was a slaying of billy jack gaither who was beaten to death and then burned by kerosenesoaked tires the men who murdered a homosexual over unwanted advances that perpetrator will avoid the death penalty only because the family requested that the death penalty be waived that was a state prosecution i could go on and on in which state prosecutions have been successful not in 40 years not in 50 years but in the maximum penalty in these particular cases true and i am delighted that in many of those instances federal resources have been devoted to make sure that they were able to obtain the conviction of the perpetrator finally i would point out the testimony of a judge who testified in the senate committee on the judiciary on this particular bill in this case it was judge richard arcara who testified in opposition to the hate crimes legislation and he stated the issue is not whether we are for or against the prosecution of hate crimes all decent rightthinking people abhor hate crimes the real issue before you is whether the acts of violence covered by the proposed statute which are already criminal offenses under state law and which may already be federal crimes as well are not being adequately prosecuted and punished at the present time in other words why is a new federal statute needed and so again the question is it constitutional and secondly if it is is it necessary under the present circumstances the reason i bring these questions up is that my colleagues might conclude ultimately after we debate this that the answer is yes yes and we need to do this but is the appropriate time to consider it in a conference report which is not being considered by the house in fact we are instructing the conferees to go to this particular kennedy proposal when in fact there is also the hatch proposal senator hatch offered a proposal that was adopted as well and it addresses hate crimes but it does it in this way it creates more funding for the states and their prosecution of hate crimes so it gives more resources and grants to the states the second thing it does in a very thoughtful way is that it creates a study to examine the efficacy of the current law do we really need it is it necessary and this is another approach so i would say let us do not bind ourconferees that they have to go a particular direction there are other options that should be considered so my fellow colleagues i believe that there are some important questions that say let us do not adopt this binding motion to instruct our conferees finally i think there is an issue of fairness that troubles some people should certain groups in america when it comes to crimes of violence be entitled to greater resources in investigation and different laws in the prosecution than other groups this is fundamental it is difficult because we all know that there is a problem in our society when we target minority groups or groups that are targeted because of disability or any other reason they should be punished to the full extent of the law and we need to send a signal to our society that it is not tolerable but there are ways to send that signal rather than considering a massive expansion of federal jurisdiction my colleagues these are serious issues and i do not believe the right place to approach it would be in the conference we need to come back and sort through each of these as the supreme court has directed so i would ask my colleagues to oppose the motion to instruct i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.9928244352340698, 0.9928244352340698, 0, "i rise to urge support for h con res 290 the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year

act for the 21st century air 21 as a result this budget resolution keeps faith with the american taxpayer and preserves the integrity of the transportation trust funds tea 21 the resolution allocates

highway and transit programs in fiscal year 2000 last years omnibus appropriations bill applied this cut to the highway and transit budget categories even though highway and transit spending was within the levels established by the tea 21 firewalls in effect highway and transit spending was cut to cover a funding breach in the general discretionary budget category the house leadership has assured me that these funds will be restored in fiscal year 2001 so that over the twoyear period from 20002001 the link between highway trust fund revenues and spending that was established in tea 21 will be maintained not only does the resolution fully fund tea 21 it assumes that all tea 21 funds will be used according to the formula distribution that was agreed to in tea 21 the resolution also assumes that highway and transit programs are held harmless from and not reduced by technical differences between office of management and budget and congressional budget office scoring of the tea 21 firewalls similar to last year these technical scoring differences will be accommodated in a manner that does not reduce the guaranteed spending levels below those provided by tea 21 air 21 regarding aviation the budget resolution allocates to the appropriations committee sufficient budget authority and outlays to fully fund air 21 thereby ensuring that the taxes and interest credited to the airport and airway trust fund each year are used for their intended purposes and that the general fund contributes its fair share toward meeting aviation funding needs the 18 percent general fund contribution that is assumed both in air 21 and in this budget resolution is far less than the historical average of 30 percent it is important to note that this budget resoluton ensures sufficient resources to fully fund federal aviation administration operations as well as aviation capital programs and it does so without reducing funding for any other transportation program such as coast guard and amtrak this is because the function 400 allocations in this resolution have been increased to accommodate the funding increases in tea 21 and air 21 without requiring reductions in any other function 400 programs therefore it is simply not accurate to say that tea 21 or air 21 will force the appropriations committee to reduce funding for faa operations amtrak on coast guard funding for all of these programs has been accommodated within this budget resolution i congratulate the budget committee for restoring honesty to the budget process and ending the use of the transportation trust funds to mask the deficit or fund other nontransportation programs given the commitment of the senate majority leader and the chairman of the senate budget committee to fully fund air 21 without

people injure 44 000 more and cause nearly 20 billion in damages with this new monitoring system we could send out early waming of impending earthquakes that utilities could use to shut off valves and schools to rush our children to safety there also is additional money for the university of utah to continue their earthquake research on the wasatch front the wasatch front is the newest range in the rocky mountains and it is getting bigger it was created by earthquakes and it will continue to grow with the help of earthquakes earthquakes occur regularly in my district and we need to be prepared for them 80 of utahs population resides on top of active earthquake faults the university of utah is one of our nations leading earthquake research centers this money will also be used to collect information needed to deploy resources after an earthquake we will be able to map the severity and location of an earthquake to know how and where to send emergency response teams this bill is a good investment in protecting our citizens from a disaster that we know is coming it would be a disaster for the american people for congress to run away from their responsibilities and not prepare our country for earthquakes i urge all my colleagues to support h r"], [0.00020706653594970703, 0.5002070665359497, 0, "first of all let me thank the gentleman from iowa and the gentleman from florida for allowing this money to be included in the emergency supplemental it is absolutely critical for our farmers in my particular district i have got 26 counties all of which are dependent on agriculture and they are hurting and hurting worse than they have in decades and the fact is that we got to get the money to them immediately while this is as my friend from ohio says a paultry sum it is still better than nothing at least to start the ball rolling so that the creditors can in fact advance the money to our farmers for their spring planting at least the northern part of my district where they are still doing it in the southern part they have already done it but i do want to commend both of my colleagues for their work in getting this included i did want to ask the gentleman from iowa a question and that has to do with the money to administer the loans is there a fact our fsa office is going to have the ability to administer that 1 1 billion of loan guarantees that this bill would

defense programs which is sufficient to meet the needs of todays military however i am concerned that 18 billion of this bill has been designated as emergency spending and would therefore not be subject to the budgetary caps included in the balanced budget act of 1997 i support providing additional resources to the department of defense but i believe that we must be honest with the american people in reconciling our need for additional defense spending with our ability to do so under the existing budget caps i would like to highlight an important project included in this bill that would provide 10 million for the disaster relief and emergency medical services dreams program this is the third installment on funding for dreams that would help to save lives and reduce health care costs in 1997 congress provided 8 million for dreams and in 1999 10 million for dreams these federal funds have been leveraged with state of texas funding financial support from the national institutes of health and the ana and philantrophic sources dreams is a joint army research project with the university of texas houston health science center and texas a m university system the dreams project will demonstrate in both civilian and military terms how to attend to wounded soldiers from remote locations during emergency situations the project will fund three different research projects including emergency medical services ems diagnostic methods and therapies for shock injuries and chemical as well as biological warfare defense the ems program will use emergency helicopters to fly directly to injured persons and treat these individuals after a trauma injury using the fiberoptic traffic monitoring system already being used in houston the dreams project will help helicopters to reach their victims faster the second part of this ems program is to collect realtime patient data and relate this information back to trauma physicians to make immediate diagnosis and recommended treatments the chemical and biological warfare program will help to develop chemical sensor tests to treat victims on toxic substances in addition dreams in developing mechanisms for the biological decontamination and detoxification of these chemical agents the city of houston is an ideal location for these tests because of that large number of petrochemical and industrial facilities located in our area the diagnostic methods and therapies program will determine possible applications to treat patients during the golden hour following a traumatic injury these methods will include mechanisms to treat the decreased blood flow that is common in many trauma patients this project is also exploring how to prevent cell death as a result of traumatic injury the dreams project will yield new results and procedures to help patients become stabilized before sending them to trauma centers i am pleased that congress has included this vitally important research funding and urge my colleagues to support
