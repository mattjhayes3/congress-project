percent majority say people making more than 1 million a year should contribute to what the problems are in this country so that fell apart then we had the gang of 6 senatorsthree republicans three democratswho had been on the bowlessimpson commission who said we should do something about this they were in the press they had press conferences and this was going down the road and doing all kinds of great things while that was going on there was a decision made and a law was passed to create a supercommittee to which i appointed senator patty murray of washington to run no one in the senate democrat or republican has more respect than patty murray she worked so hard with the other 11 members of congress to come up with something a few days before they were to arrive at a decisionand the gang of 6 members are out here doing all this stuff all the timei get a letter signed by virtually every republican senator saying we are not going to raise revenue for anything the supercommittee didnt work there the gang of 6 is gone so we passed this last august to fund government for 2 years and to say if we dont arrive at another 1 2 trillion in deficit reduction during this year it automatically kicks in at the end of this year or the beginning of next year so that is where we are and the republicans in the house are trying to change that so that is what this little history lesson has been all about i dont like to sequester i wish we didnt have to do it it was a hard pill to swallow but it was the right thing to do if we are ever going to reduce the staggering deficit we are going to have to make some hard decisions so that is what this is all about but that is the point it is hard to do therefore we have to do it to sequesterwhich in effect would take almost 500 billion from domestic programs and almost 500 billion from defense programs they were designed to be tough enough to force two sides to reach a balanced deal it hasnt happened yet as i said earlier with general eisenhowers statement i didnt make that up that is what he said my complaint about the republicans being so unreasonable about everything is something where i am not a lone wolf crying in the wilderness we have two longtime nonpartisan watchers of congress one from the american enterprise institute which is a conservative think tank another from brookings institute that wrote an article saying it is the republicans cant you see what they are doing here is one thing they said we have been studying washington politics in congress for more than 40 years and never have we seen them this dysfunctional in our past writings we have criticized both parties when we believed it was warranted today however we have no choice but to acknowledge that the core of the problem lies with the republican party they further said the gop has become an insurgent outlier in american politics it is ideologically extreme of scornful compromise unmoved by conventional understanding of facts evidence and science and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition what brave men to do that to write these commentswhich are true i have been saying that i dont want to fight about everything republicans insist on balancing the budget on the backs of the middle class seniors students single mothers and those who could least afford it that is what they are doing over there today it is their refusal to compromise that leaves us facing the threat of sequester and it is difficult but it is balanced going back to the august budget agreement now in order to protect wealthy special interests is no solution neither is refighting the battles of last year democrats agree we must reduce our deficits and make hard choices but we believe in a balanced approach that shares the pain as well as the responsibility is the sequester the best way to achieve that balance no but republicans refuse to consider a more reasonable approachone for example that asks every american to pay his fair share while making difficult choices to reduce spending democrats will not agree to a onesided solution that lets the superwealthy off the hook while forcing the middle class and those in greatest need to bear all the hardship democrats believe we can protect americans access to health care create jobs while investing in the future and protect the poor and elderly but we cant do it alone it will take work and compromise and so far republicans have been unwilling to make a serious effort to achieve that result republicans have rejected our balanced approach their onesided solution to acrosstheboard cuts would take away from the many to give to the few here is what the plan would donot all of it but here is what their plan would do remember they are taking it up over there in the house today it would cut medicaid benefits increasing the number of uninsured children parents seniorsand that is in addition to people with disabilitiesby hundreds of thousands just eliminate them it would also put seniors in nursing homes at risk some of them would have to move out of the nursing home i guess it would punish americans who receive tax credits to purchase health insurance when their financial circumstances change causing 350 000 americans to have no coverage this would add to the tens of millions who already exist that way it would weaken wall street reforms protecting big banks at the expense of consumers their legislation would once again target middleclass workers food inspectors air traffic controllers border patrol agents drug enforcement and fbi agents they would have to be laid off it would cut funding for preventive health care programs that fight chronic illnessessuch as heart disease cancer strokes and diabetesthat cause 70 percent of the

expanding federal regulatory burden is a bipartisan problem and i commend the chairman of the committee my friend from missouri for his efforts in working not just in his time as chairman but working with the committee in the previous years and i know that he understands that this is not a republican or a democratic problem because the regulatory burdens on small businesses increased by 30 billion from the years 20012008 and federal regulations now cost americans 1 75 trillion each year which is up 50 percent from the 1 1 trillion in annual costs just in 2005 and last year the federal register contained 80 000 pages in its first year in print the federal register contained 2 355 pages and each year federal agencies continue to release thousands of pages of new regulations and accompanying information and i know that the gentleman understands that and we share the goal of reducing this burden because the burden is detrimental and it affects small businesses in fact studies indicate that adhering to federal rules cost 10 585 per worker for small businesses with 19 or fewer workers but only 78 percent of that amount for businesses with 500plus workers it affects small businesses disproportionately overall on a peremployee basis it costs 2 400 or 45 percent more for small businesses to comply with federal regulations than their larger counterparts small businesses face the greatest disadvantage in complying with environmental and tax regulations compliance with environmental regulations cost 364 percent more in small firms than large and 67 percent more for the cost of corporate tax compliance so we agree on the problem the question is where do we go from here and this is where i have a concern with what chairman graves is putting forward what does h res 72 call for that were not already doing the committee on small business has been reviewing regulations in a bipartisan fashion for years the gentleman has been involved in that and as a result of these examinations its called on federal agencies to modify or alter regulatory requirements that impose costs on small firms this has included regulations pertaining to medical equipment at cms accounting requirements at the sec real estate procedures at hud environmental regulations at the epa and on it goes so the reality is weve already done as a committee what this resolution calls for and i will include in the record the 112th congress small business committees oversight of federal regulatory and paperwork burdens administrative plan what the committee has already passed so my question for the gentleman from missouri to answer during the course of the debate is what exactly does this resolution do for small businesses that were not already doing is there anything in this thats not already being done now does it actually reduce any real regulatory burden on small businesses does it reduce paperwork does it limit government requirements on the small business community i would submit that this particular resolution does not it sets up a bureaucratic process here in the congress with a goal of inventory of regulations a long list of inventory regulations but this list will be submitted as part of an administrative reporting process it does nothing for small businesses so i would suggest in closing that instead of approving this bookkeeping resolution what congress really needs to do is strengthen the tools it already has available to reduce regulatory burdens this includes the regulatory flexibility act which mandates that federal agencies consider the potential economic impact of federal regulations strengthening the requirements and increasing agency reviews and regulations regulatory relief that we passed here in the congress during the 110th congress reported out by the small business committee related to bipartisan regulatory reductions and as we continue to revisit these issues here in the 112th congress we must remember that small businesses are who were trying to help so in closing im concerned that what this legislation does is add an unnecessary step to getting down to the business that we can all agree on which is actually reducing the regulations that we all agree are a problem"], [0.9649624079465866, 0.03503759205341339, 1, "and i couldnt figure out how they have done it over the past few years i figured there must be

not this nation goes to war and we are not going to see any war funded absent a declaration of war by this congress it is imperative that we act because by september this administration will have spent 1 billion on the war without congress having any say in that whatsoever we will have gone to a war without any ability of congress to have a voice now to its credit this house has taken up numerous proposals relative to the war in libya that have sought to limit the sphere of conduct of hostilities against libyano ground troops and no money to rebels this amendment however gives the house one last opportunity within this bill to speak very clearly about article i section 8 clause 11 and to do it in the context of an appropriations bill which says that we will not permit any funds to be spent unless this congress moves forward with a declaration of war i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0005466938018798828, 0.4994533061981201, 1, "i yield myself as much time as i may consume i rise in support of the resolution introduced by my colleague from new jersey the chairman of the subcommittee before i begin my remarks i want to join the gentleman from florida and of course the many others in offering my condolences to the entire coast guard family for the tragic loss of one of their shipmates during a drug interdiction operation in the waters off of southern california this past weekend we all recognize that the servicemen and women of the coast guard willingly and routinely expose themselves to highly dangerous conditions on behalf of our nation nevertheless it is a profound tragedy when a servicemember makes that sacrifice and our thoughts and prayers are with the coast guard at this time the legislation i stand in support of today has been developed as a compromise over the past 2 months during negotiations with the senate it would amend h r 2838 the coast guard and maritime transportation act of 2012 that passed the house last november and it also incorporates numerous provisions from the amendments to h r 2838 that cleared the senate in september and i appreciate the gentleman from new jersey for his willingness to work with me on this legislation in a bipartisan and open manner im confident in saying that this bill embodies a fair and bipartisan compromise for everyone involved and that we can feel proud of this work as the ranking member of the coast guard subcommittee its been a high priority for me to advance policies to revitalize and expand our domestic maritime industries and this legislation marks a significant achievement in doing just that it creates jobs in the shipbuilding industry by taking vital steps towards improving our icebreaker fleet and finishing the program of record for response boatmedium earlier this year i had a chance to visit jobcreating shipyards that will be a part of the modernization effort of the coast guard these shipyards provide goodpaying jobs for hardworking engineers welders electricians and mechanics all over the northwest and throughout the country the reauthorization of the maritime administration will improve the fortunes of those shipyards and i am pleased that that is included in this bill as well but weve also in authorizing the coast guard reformed a number of key programs the coast guard has one of the most expansive missions in the federal government this multimission maritime military service is responsible for a broad range of activities including mariner licensing emergency oil spill response vessel inspections and navigation safety the coast guard remains indispensable to the maintenance of a reliable and secure marine supply chain that supports maritime cargo operations which contribute 649 billion annually to the unitedstates gdp sustaining more than 13 million jobs this legislation authorizes funding levels for both the coast guard and the reserve that provide for increased funding levels in fiscal years 13 and 14 over the fiscal year 12 level i believe the funding levels in the bill remain insufficient to address the documented needs of the coast guard the coast guard has been asked to do more with less and im afraid that their only choice during this time of budget uncertainty is to do less with less and thats just wrong so while i would prefer these levels to be higher i understand that these funding levels are likely the best that can be provided under the constraints we must be aware however that funding levels in this legislation are absent any consideration of what will be needed to address the estimated 260 million in damages to coast guard facilities in the northeast as a result of hurricane sandy these costs will be addressed in the future i assume and i want to highlight as well that this legislation contains several provisions that will improve the coast guards readiness and capabilities in the increasingly important arctic region specifically this bill directs the coast guard to complete a business case analysis to assess the costeffectiveness of reactivating its heavy icebreaker the polar sea this analysis is overdue and it is vitally important at present the coast guard has only one icebreaker the healy although the coast guard expects in 2013 to reactivate the other heavy icebreaker the polar star the plain fact remains that the coast guards icebreaker fleet remains severely undercapitalized and overextended as it will be years before a new icebreaker can be delivered its essential that we make informed decisions on the polar sea now in order to have a balanced assessment of coast guard polar icebreaker capabilities in the near term this legislation also advances provisions that address many administrative personnel procurement and regulatory issues affecting the coast guard specifically several new authorities to bring the coast guard into parity with the other armed services have been included additionally this legislation contains new authorities that will improve the efficiency and oversight of the coast guards major acquisition programs especially new advanced procurement authority and development of multiyear capital investment programs the bill includes language i authored that requires the coast guard to complete the procurement of 180 response boatmediums or rbms as originally planned in the program of record for this vessel this is a critical piece of maritime security and the completion of these boats will lead to additional job creation in small shipyards besides addressing the needs of the coast guard this legislation also advances several important initiatives to support the unitedstates merchant marine title iii of the legislation protects the jones act by strengthening the review and notice requirements for future administrative waivers this provision originally called for in h r 3202 the american mariner jobs protection act should help preserve more opportunities for unitedstates carriers and seafarers the title also provides for a formal authorization for the committee on the maritime transportation system title iv of the legislation includes several provisions that will improve the maritime administrations ability to accept manage and recycle vessels held in the national defense reserve fleet im also pleased title vi reauthorizes the marine debris research reduction and prevention act more and more marine debris from the 2011 japanese tsunami continues to wash up on the shores of the pacific coast including in my state of washington japan in the midst of a recovery from this disaster though has shown extraordinary leadership and friendship with the united states by recently announcing that they will donate directly 5 million to debris cleanup it is important that we reauthorize the marine debris act to ensure that the national oceanic and atmospheric administration has the authority it needs to work with states to address this threat i very much appreciate the cooperation of chairman lobiondo for including this important environmental measure and i also applaud my colleagues mr thompson and mr farr for their work to see this program reauthorized in closing this legislation reflects a fair and balanced compromise we have an obligation to support the coast guard and support our unitedstates merchant marine a safe and secure maritime environment is good for job creation good for the economy and good for the american people in my estimation this legislation fulfills that obligation i urge its passage today and i just briefly want to thank once again mr lobiondo for his incredible work to be bipartisan open and transparent in working to bring this legislation to passage with that i reserve the balance of my time"],

preventing their pay and services from being impacted by a potential government shutdown next year the underlying bill we are voting on today lacks key provisions that are needed to protect our veterans in active duty military my amendment will add these provisions my amendment will ensure that our patriotic military men and women are not victims of partisan gridlock my amendment ensures that basic military pay will not be interrupted in a potential shutdown my amendment guarantees that our armed forces will be paid for the entire year not just for the 6month duration authorized by this continuing resolution unfortunately congress has failed to do its job and we cannot allow a government shutdown to impact the basic pay of our men and women in uniform this is a guarantee and an assurance that they have a right to expect we will uphold no matter what my amendment also addresses the fact that three critical veterans administration authorizations are set to expire at the end of the year the first is for contract medical disability authority without this extension which my amendment provides the va would not be able to pay for contract medical exams from discretionary funds this could significantly delay veterans receipt of benefits the second authorization which my amendment extends would give the va the authority to establish sites to treat homeless veterans and those with mental illness without this extension the va would not be able to provide these essential services at these sites the third va authorization set to expire helps the va provide housing and treatment to homeless veterans with a serious mental illness again without this extension the va would no longer be able to provide for therapeutic transitional housing assistance for veterans who are homeless or who have a serious mental illness our veterans stepped forward when we asked them to serve this great nation in return it is our undeniable responsibility to help them find employment when they are able to work and to care for them when they are not to night there are about 70 000 homeless veterans who will sleep on the streets of our country this is a situation that is absolutely deplorable and we must act to provide them with the assistance they deserve none of what ive proposed here should be a partisan issue this is about keeping our sacred promise to those who have defended our freedoms there are nearly 100 000 veterans in my southern arizona district and two military installationsdavismonthan air force base in tucson where i grew up and where my father was deployed and fort huachuca in sierra vista and the 162nd fighter wing of the air national guard just across the district line i am offering this amendment in thinking of the men and women who are stationed there and across this nation and across the world during our recent work period i went to the airport in tucson to honor the men and women of our army national guard as they left for deployment in afghanistan i told them and their families on behalf of all of us how grateful we are for their service today i ask you to join with me in putting action behind those words this is not a partisan issue we can and must find common ground in this chamber on this very issue this morning my colleague congressman platts and i introduced a bipartisan bill the veterans health care access act our bill will make it easier for veterans to get access to the health care they need what other issue we face is more important than this to both sides of the aisle than supporting our armed forces and our veterans at a time when we need to get services to our veterans who are newly returning home from iraq and afghanistan we cannot be creating uncertainty and allowing a lapse of service or pay this is about the army sergeant i met on the flight going home who is now diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury and who will soon be medically discharged he deserves to know that we will stand up for him and others like him let me say again that the passage of this amendment will not prevent the passage of the underlying bill i urge my republican and democratic
