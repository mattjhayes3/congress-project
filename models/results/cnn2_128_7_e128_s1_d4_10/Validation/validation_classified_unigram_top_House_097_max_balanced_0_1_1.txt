stepped up security commitments to the duarte government indicate that the circumstances of the conflict in el salvador are changing rapidly from those a year ago when the administration assured members of this house it had no legal obligation under the war powers resolution to report to congress on the involvement of unitedstates military personnel in el salvador in a memorandum early last year the administration argued that unitedstates advisers in el salvador were not engaged in hostilities nor equipped for combat nor located in areas where such involvement would likely occur it is no longer clear that such a legal judgment holds true today the war powers resolution by which our current military involvement in el salvador must be judged calls on the president to consult with congress before introducing unitedstates armed forces into hostilities or into situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances further in any case in which such forces are introduced into hostilities or are in danger of imminent involvement in hostilities or when forces are introduced into the territory of a foreign nation while equipped for combat with certain exceptions such as training of in numbers which substantially enlarge unitedstates armed forces equipped for combat already located in a foreign nation the president is required to submit a report within 48 hours to the congress stating the circumstances requiring the involvement of unitedstates military personnel the statutory basis for his declsion and the estimated scope and duration of hostilities or involvement the resolution provides further that such forces will be withdrawn within 60 days after the president reports to congress that he has introduced such forces unless congress acts to authorize the continued presence of unitedstates military personnel in the area concerned in response to questions raised concerning the administrations obligation under the war powers resolution a year ago the state department submitted a memorandum to the congress stating that provisions of the war powers resolution did not apoly to the serding of unitedstates military advisers to el salvador because they had not been introduced into hostilities nor were they in danger of imminent involvement in iuch hostilities instead unitedstates personnel would be stationed in carefully selected areas and special precautions would be taken to provide for their constant security unitedstates personnel would neither accompaty salvildoran forces in combat situations nor act as combat advisers and would carry only personal sidearms recent events in el salvador have proved sufficiently alarming to the administration to prompt a tripling of our security assistance to the duarte government and to publicly leave the door ajar to the possibility of sending additional advisers and even unitedstates combat troops these events require that the administration thoroughly reevaluate its legal obligations to the unitedstates congress under the war powers resolution the bold guerrilla attack on ilopango air bape on january 27 1982 the destruction of the golden bridge over the lempa river in october and other examples of major guerrilla operations in the countryside and cities suggest a new level of confidence combat capability effectiveness and determination on the part of the armed guerrillas in stark contrast to the lack of such qualities a year ago during the socalled final offensive not only are the guerrillas apparently stronger today than they were a year ago but their effective military reach has expanded no longer is violence limited primarily to rural areas but it has instead spread into the capital and major salvadoran governmental military installations even the secretary of state has acknowledged that an unpredictable environment exists in el salvador today no longer can the administration have the confidence that unitedstates personnel can be safely stationed in areas of security rather there is the increasing prospect that unitedstates personnel may be inadvertently drawn into the crossfire between government and guerrilla forces the guerrillas have also made it abundantly clear in recent weeks that they intend to continue to escalate their violence in an effort to disrupt the elections scheduled for the end of march although the administration assured us a year ago that unitedstates advisers would be limited exclusively to training roles and would in no fashion be involved in combat or operational patrols nor in combat advisory roles it is increasingly unclear where the line between training and implicit us involvement in the actual planning and conduct of salvadoran government military operations is drawn the recently publicized film unitedstates personnel armed with m18 rifles suggests first that the administrations commitments to congress that unitedstates personnel would carry only personal sidearms has been violated and second that the level of danger of unitedstates personnel has increased to the point where our advisers themselves feel a compelling need in the interest of selfdefense to carry more than just personal sidearms under such circumstances it is clear that the prospect of american soldiers becoming casualties in the salvadoran war has increased dramatically finally the reporth last week regarding the stationing of a unitedstates navy destroyer off the gulf of fonseca add to the apprehension of many who view the presence of unitedstates warships with unitedstates military personnel on board in an area of tension and hostilities as a risk of potentially great consequences it would appear that the administration is treading dangerously close to the legal borderline and is at a minimum testing the authority of the war powers resolution if the administration believes that it is in the vital interests of the united states to keep or increase unitedstates military personnel in el salvador it should reconsider seriously its obligations to comply with the war powers resolution many observers inside and outside the unitedstates government have already concluded that the sending of unitedstates military advisers has been counterproductive to unitedstates policy interests and find now the difficult question to be one of how the united states can reverse this illadvised policy decision before the consequences of one wrong decision are compounded by the consequences of others accordingly this past week in a series of letters to the president i have proposed that tbe administration accept the offer of president lopez portillo of mexico to use his good offices as an intermediary in seeking political reconciliation in central america as a first step i have urged the president to anrounce that the unitedstates advisers will be withdrawn from el salvador upon the successful completion of the march elections regardless of who wins these advisers have become a symbol of american reliance upon military means of support for a government unable to control the excesses of its own military esthblishment in a situation where the fundamental problems are rooted in poverty illiteracy and social injustice the very presence of american military forcesregardless of whether they are carrying armshas had the unfortunate effect of closely identifying the united states with the human rights violations of the salvadoran military and converting what bevr s an essentially internal conflict i ato an anticolonialist struggle one of the problems of n great power is how to extricate itsulf from an illconsidered policy in vietnam 3he commitment of a small number of troops and the failed polities that followed led to the commitment of greater numbers and to policies that failed to an even greater degree by removing the advisers from el salvador at an early stage president reagan has a unique opportunity to rectify rather than multiply a mistake few american policymakers consider our sending of advisers to have been anything but a mistake not only have the advisers opened the unitedstates to international criticism from friend and foe alike but it is difficult to believe that a contingent of this minimal size could have a significant impact on the ability of salvadoran authorities to cope with insurgency the problem from a policy point of view is how to establish an appropriate quid pro quo for disengagement in the midst of the vietnam conflict henry kissinger proposed a series of very reasonable deescalation measures to the north vietnamese the problem was they were rejected and the nixon administration got locked into escalating a conflict at a time when prudence indicated the reverse course of action while vietnam analogies are not all appropriate the reagan administration would be well advised not to tie as secretary haig has proposed reduction in the number of our advisers to the actions of other states in the region policy options should be controlled in washington and not become subject to the whims of militaristic potentates bent on irrational behavior the objective of unitedstates cooperation with el salvador should be to encourage and facilitate the holding of free elections not to determine the outcome there would seem little reason to maintain military advisers after elections are successfully completed if the moderate forces of president duarte should prevail a good case could be made that having won a mandate in free elections the presence of american military advisers would no longer be needed less direct forms of support and assistance would be sufficient if the extreme right should emerge in power as many now conjecture withdrawal of our advisers would be a desirable means of disassociating the united states from the human rights violations that would likely insue at the same time announcement that a fiee election is our objective and that the advisers would be withdrawn following its successful completion would remove one of the main justifications for the extreme lefts effort to prevent salvadorans from going c the polls at the heart of the problem in central america and the caribbean basin is an assessment of whether problems are essentially rooted in longstanding patterns of injustice as the unitedstates catholic conference asserts or whether fundamentally the dilemma is one of castroite intervention as secretary haig contends if the former view is given greater weight a policy of economic assistance seems most in order if the latter military options come more to the fore conservative advocates of interventionism have a tendency to exaggerate the castroite dimension of the problem and underestimate the potential counterproductive effects of an overt unitedstates response liberal critics of american foreign policy on the other hand have a tendency to be overly generous in their assessments of the ideals and intentions of insurgency movements perhaps the most appropriate perspective is to recognize the social and economic inequities that exist but not to sympathize with the radical alternatives presented the united states has a profound influence over events in the caribbean but that influence is exercisedmost effectively when active american involvement is limited to economic assistance and peace corps kinds of activities military options dont solve social problems on the other hand economic assistance in some circumstances may not be enough but the united states acting alone on behalf of and within the confines of a smaller latin state is likely to exacerbate rather than diminish hostilities strategic options are far better exercised in concert with other latin states and at this time the most hopeful strategic initiative would appear to be the one proposed by mexican president lopez portillo his specific suggestions may be imperfect but the offer of his offices as a neutral intermediary may be the best chance to achieve a reduction in central american tension available president reagan risks a great deal if he too lightly spurns the assistance of our increasingly important neighbor to the south the president also risks support of congress and the american people if he does not comply with the strict provisions of statute contained in the war

ohio burns more coal than any other state in the union however it should be obvious even to the casual observer that there is much to be learned about acid rain and its origin therefore any statement

necessary data on which to build a program to address acid deposition instead of immediately taking action to add new controls on coalfired powerplants this bill will allow us to gain the facts on the contribution to acid deposition by auto emissions and oilfired powerplant emissions for example in a department of energy sponsored study it is shown that auto exhaust fumes and the burning of oil in the northeast may be the primary source of acid rain in that and surrounding areas quoting from the report which coincides with a national academy of sciences report close examination of fuel use information and source emissions characteristics inthe adirondacks florida and california suggest that local oil burning and automotive sources may be the major contributor to the occurrence of acid rain in these areas the report goes on to say that 30 percent of the acidity of rainfall in the northeast is due to nitric acid which can be produced from auto exhaust and high levels of transportationrelated nitrogen oxides can be found in the air over the adirondacks during the sumnmer months further it is reported that boilers buring residual oil have been reported to produce 3 to 10 times more sulfates per unit of sulfur content than do boilers burning coal this conclusion of course contradicts statements made by several authorities who say acid rain is caused by emissions from coalfired plants in the ohio valley there is clearly the need to proceed cautiously on proposals claiming to eliminate acid rain to do otherwise i believe would be irresponsible and could have very adverse economic effects on a large portion of society 9"]]}
