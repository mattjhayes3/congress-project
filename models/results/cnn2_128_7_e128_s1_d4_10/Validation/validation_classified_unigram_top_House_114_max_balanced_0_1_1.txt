should not make it easy for these people to have guns what should we do about it we have two very simple bills and we begged the speaker of this house to allow us to take up those bills to debate

the standards why on earth would we want to pass a rider that favors foreign manufacturers who ignore our laws and penalizes unitedstates manufacturers who are following our laws but it even gets

rhinos and elephants are on the path to extinction for example back in the seventies there were approximately 65 000 rhinos in africa since then about 1 000 a year have been killed and now there are only 5 000 left in africa that is a 94 percent drop in those rhinos there are only five white rhinos in the whole world elephants are not faring much better from 2002 to 2010 the elephant population across africa dropped 66 percent back in the thirties and forties there were approximately 5 million african elephants now there are about a half a million african elephants one of the most famous was satao in this photograph that was taken last year he was presumably the oldest elephant that was in existence in africa he was killed last year for his tusks which almost touched the ground in fact national geographic a year ago today did an article on him and how he was killed for his tusks and how other elephants are being killed for their tusks he was about 46 years old when he was killed for those tusks the reason that poaching seems to be on the increase over the last few years is that there is a low risk of apprehension and it is easy to commit these crimes also even when someone is captured penalties for wildlife trafficking are far less than for drug trafficking who uses these tusks who uses these rhino horns the number one country in the world that is the consumer of the illegal ivory trade is china vietnam is the number one country in the world that uses the illegal trade of rhino horns this is where these tusks and these rhino horns go and it brings in a lot of money for example a kilogram of rhino hornsif i remember my math correctly that is 2 2 poundssells for 60 000 so there is a lot more money involved in the sale of rhino horns and of elephant tusks than even of gold and platinum overall the illegal wildlife trade is about 10 billion to 20 billion a year it should come as no surprise that terrorist organizations are also involved in this criminal enterprise like al qaedas affiliate al shabaab and like joseph konys lords resistance army they are cashing in on the illegal wildlife trafficking it is getting so bad that the poachers have become very sophisticated in the sense that they no longer just shoot elephants for example because that makes a noise that warns them they are even being poisoned an elephant is poisoned and the elephant dies then when people approach the elephant they not only see the dead elephant but they see other animals that were feeding on the carcass of the elephant and they are all dead too so that the poachers can get those tusks they have become very innovative local park rangers are underresourced they are illequipped and some of them are corrupt as well so we cant fight what we dont know there

own two hands and their own intellect to make good things to create benefit for others to create jobs hire people protect families and to make a contribution to society many young people want to pursue these avenues yet we have to be honest about what is happening we are entering in this country into an entrepreneurial winter what does that mean in other words the number of startup businessessmall businessesis less than the number of small businesses dying we do not have a net increase in the number of small businesses and again this is where most americans live and work making good things for others in small business that is where jobs are created how do we address this problem well the tendency again in our body is to think about public solutions but lets examinenot through my opinion but just the analyticsas to why small businesses are not creating new jobs and are not starting up as aggressively as they have in the past it is really two things it is health care and regulations smart regulations are necessary to protect the health and wellbeing of all americans but when you have oppressive regulations that tend to stack the deck toward those who are larger and can hire an army of lawyers and accountants it represses the ability of small businesses to take risks and create jobs the second problem we have is health care i got an email yesterday from someone who said congressman my health care has gone up so much that i have to move into government housing now think of the irony of that again we need the right type of health care reform one that is going to reduce costs and improve health care outcomes while we protect vulnerable persons but what has happened some people have been helped by the new law but many many families have been hurt with escalating health care costs and again it creates an environment in which small business is repressed again i think our government should be smart and effective and i think that is what most americans want but washington continues to remain mired in mediocrity and political dysfunction and partisan gridlock have made smart and proper government difficult this arthritic recovery has dimmed the financial prospects of too many individuals who again have stagnant wages or who have given up hope and feel directionless isolated and alone we can do better and we must do better despite these challenges i believe the start of a new congress is an exciting time to renew our government and this promise of our nation i would like to say this mr speaker there is nothing wrong in america that cant be fixed by what is right in america but it is going to require bold resolve innovative public policy and a return to our highest ideals"], [0.0019237995147705078, 0.5019237995147705, 0, "mr

that is neither a partisan issue nor is it a partisan difference many americans are frustrated with the pace of progress against isis in iraq and syria i want to see the administration and congress working together to protect our nation the reforms in this bill are an excellent start what we have before us today is an example of what we can achieve when both sides work together to craft responsible reforms in a spirit of unity and common purpose which is in the face of the threats we challenge we ought to summons i want to thank the majority leader"]]}
