to share with us the printed word and it is good to have him here mr ryan will be joining us a little later if i could just take a moment here to let the members know that the great debate took place here on this floor a number of amendments were proposed to make sure that we pass a budget that is just and fair for every american but i must bring to the members attention because i think members do not realize what is happening or if they do realize what is happening i want to make sure that it is in the record that they know we talk about debt a lot in our 30 something working group and talking about debt and doing something about debt are two different things the republican majority continues to spend in a recordbreaking way that is bankrupting this country and changing the philosophy of this country which is payasyougo democrats we are the only party in this house that can say that we balanced the budget we have actually done it we have actually had surpluses as far as the eye can see republicans can only talk about well we would like to cut it in half and we would like to cut it back a quarter or what have you but i just want to make sure that folks understand that there was an article written on tuesday of this week entitled another possible bump to the debt ceiling 2 7 trillion budget plan pending before the house would raise the federal debt ceiling by nearly 10 trillion less than 2 months after the congress last raised the federal debt borrowing limit the provision is buried on page 121 of a 151page blueprint it serves as the backdrop for congressional action this week i think it is important and i usually have my letters here from the secretary of the treasury but i think it is important that the american people and the members of this house understand that what they are doing to this country recordbreaking debt i just want to make sure before we start off and then i am going to be kind of quiet here tonight because i know that we have a lot to share it is almost too much to share but i just want to share this with the members one more time we are talking about who are we borrowing from we are borrowing from japan at 682 8 billion

time as i may consume on tuesday president bush said that he took responsibility for the recent failure of the federal government to fulfill its ultimate duty of saving the lives of its own people within its own borders but what does responsibility mean if it means anything it means the sincere concern for what has happened under his watch it means stopping at nothing to find out why a nation led by officials who claim to care about keeping americans safe presided over a recovery effort which left behind so many innocent men women and children as they were crying out for help it means caring about the truth and it means putting people before politics today this congress has to offer the american people its own definition of responsibility the appalling aftermath of hurricane katrina which swept over citizens from louisiana to alabama to mississippi was the product of a combination of failures failures of planning failures of execution failures of accountability it is the responsibility of this body to examine why our federal government was behind so many of those failures there is only one way to do this and only one path the public will respect only one route to producing real answers to real questions which the american people will trust we need a 9illtype commission for hurricane katrina the 9 11 commission was our governments response to the tragedy of september 11 2001 and after an exhaustive study it produced a report that was trusted by the american people and by the members of our government this trust was earned the 9 11 commission was not beholden to any interests besides those of its own integrity and the good of the country this honorable response to the tragedy of september 11 puts to shame what has been proposed today in the wake of hurricane 1atrina what was perhaps our federal governments greatest failure to date to defend life at home is being met with a failure of leadership and openness and honesty in this chamber today the republican leadership of the house and senate has called for the creation of an overtly partisan congressional committee to investigate the governments pre and postkatrina actions they have speoified thatit would be a committee appointed by republicans with a republican majority they would give republicans control of every aspect of the proceedings and they alone would control who would be subpoenaed they alone would control which documents could be examined and they alone would control the scope of the investigation they would have the power to take the investigation in any direction they chose with no checks no balances and no incentives to get real answers they have nominated the fox to guard the hen house i do not object to such a plan because republicans would be in control as opposed to democrats i object to it because it is the republican party which controls the levers of government and as such manages fema and the department of homeland security and every other federal institution which must be examined the conflicts of interest that are present are so obvious that it is incredible anyone would deny them but the members of the majority do not only do this but they put forth one justification after another for their plan each one less convincing than the one before it they tell us that the structure of the committee is based on precedent and cite the bipartisan commission which investigated the irancontra affair as evidence of this never mind that in that situation a republican president was being investigated by a democratically controlled committee eliminating the political pressure to sweep truths under the rug last night in the committee on rules they told us rather incredibly that nobody is better to evaluate in this body than its own members but the american people do hot believe that after all accountability has not exactly been the hallmark of this republican leadership this majority did not investigate those who concealed the department of health and human services real estimate of how much the 2003 medicare legislation that we passed would cost it did not investigate the role of top bush campaign contributors in writing vice president cheneys energy plan it did not investigate the valerie plame scandal it did not investigate what led to our dehumanizing and shameful treatment of detainees at guantanamo bay in cuba and abu ghraib in iraq why did these investigations not take place the majority has no answer except promising to us that this time things will be different last night the chairman did offer his personal assurances again and again that the commission would allow the democrats to ask questions it probably hever occurred to us that we would not have been able to do that but this is ultimately a promise that he cannot keep only allowing a handpicked group of witnesses to be questioned prejudices the investigation before it has even begun if a true interest in a fair open thorough and independent investigation runs that deep with my republican colleagues why not just create the independent panel that is the central question i have for my colleagues today why will you not support the creation of an independent commission what are you afraid of the american people clearly had faith in the 9 11 commission model why do you not a commission controlled by the politicians of one party charged with investigating itself will face tremendous internal political pressure to eliminate embarrassing truths from the public eye to defer blame and to hide facts that is the fundamental truth because we all know how politics works politics by the way is exactly why those recent scandals i just mentioned were never investigated is the creation of an independent commission an abdication of our responsibility absolutely not in fact exactly the opposite is the case if we intentionally create a partisan political investigation that would be an abdication of our responsibilities the american people need answers they need true accountability and the only way that we can live up to our responsibility and give them answers they can trust is through an independent commission the public already overwhelmingly supports the creation of such an independent commission by 76 percent and over 160 members of this body representing more than 100 million of our nations people have already supported the creation of such a commission through a substitute resolution by the gentleman from florida my colleague its findings would not just help us to prevent another terrible disaster from taking place they would also help our government to regain its credibility in the eyes of the public a newsweek poll from earlier this week found that fully 57 percent of the general population has doubts that government officials will respond well the next time a disaster strikes those doubts would not be reduced until people believe that a real independent investigation of katrina has taken place but the findings of the congressional commission being proposed by the republican leadership will be forever tainted by the pervasive public belief that details were overlooked or truths hidden for political reasons we have plenty of evidence to believe that 2 weeks ago our government missed an opportunity to rise to the occasion when it was sorely needed the consequences were worse than we could have imagined we cannot afford to miss another opportunity here today and we object to the fact that this resolution is titled bipartisan commission

to pay a fine is taken into consideration under the current communications act also the chairman assured me that the 500 000 fine is merely a cap and that there is discretion based upon certain factors so a violation is not automatically going to cost an artist that amount of money furthermore an artist is not likely to be fined for a broadcaster placing their recorded performance on the air unless they had knowledge that it would be played or that they intended for that performance to be played on the public airwaves such an example demonstrates that an artist would have to be involved

at after considerable effort of a bipartisan group involving both house and senate judiciary committee staff over several months from hearings in the house and from other reports we have learned that current federal law designed to protect animal enterprises have been proven to be reasonably effective in protecting animal enterprises however serious gaps and loopholes have been identified in current law with respect to protecting employees and associates of animal enterprises present law protects employees of an animal enterprise but we have found that employees board members and family members of businesses and nonprofits affiliated with or doing business with such enterprises are complaining that they are now being stalked harassed intimidated or threatened with some individuals even being physically assaulted and had their homes businesses or cars vandalized since the animal enterprise terrorism law was enacted in 1992 there have been some1 100 complaints of such incidents with property losses reported of being more than 120 million those complaining include farmers scientists biomedical and biotechnology industries research universities teaching hospitals financial institutions magazines newspapers and other advertising groups and others who are viewed as assisting or enabling targeted animal enterprises the evidence is that in many instances extremist elements among the animal rights groups are taking advantage of the fact that the animal enterprise laws do not cover affiliates and associates by using threats harassment intimidation and fear and other extreme tactics to pressure them into severing their activities with such enterprises s 3880 is designed to cover these gaps or loopholes by providing to employees businesses and associates of animal enterprises similar protections to those already covered in other words the bill prevents a person from doing indirectly to an animal enterprise what they are prohibited to do directly now citizens engaging in legitimate animal enterprise activities and anyone associated with them are entitled to be protected from criminal acts and to be able to go about their daily a tivities free from threats to their person or property and that of their family and associates state laws are generally good at providing those protections however the interstate nature of the planning and execution of the criminal harassment tactics used by some individuals or groups skilled at exploiting gaps or weaknesses in the laws have made it difficult for states to get at problems effectively that is why this bill is deemed necessary while we must protect those engaged in animal enterprises we must also protect the right of those engaged in first amendment freedoms of expres sion regarding such enterprises it goes without saying that first amendment freedoms of expression cannot be defeated by statute however to reassure anyone concerned with the intent of this legislation we have added in the bill assurances that it is not intended as a restraint on freedoms of expression such as lawful boycotting picketing or otherwise engaging in lawful advocacy for animals in addition we also wanted to recognize that there are some who conscientiously believe that it is their duty to peacefully protest the operation of animal enterprises to the extent of engaging in civil disobedience if a groups intention were to stage a sitin or liedown or to block traffic to a targeted facility they certainly run the risk of arrest for whatever traffic trespass or other laws they may be breaking but they should not be held more accountable for business losses due to causes such as delivery trucks being delayed any more than a boycott or protest against any other business to violate the provision of the bill one must travel or otherwise engage in interstate activity with the intent to cause damage or loss to an animal enterprise while the losses of profits lab experiments or other intangible losses are included it must be proved that such losses were specifically intended for the law to be applied if there is no damage or economic loss or damage or loss is less than 10 000 the offense is

partnership with the gentleman from ohio chairman oxley and the gentleman from ohio chairman ney for the followthrough on the important flood insurance reform that was as he mentioned a moment ago enacted this last year the committee has been focused on making sure that the promise of flood insurance reform is in fact realized while our hearts go out to those who have suffered what has happened in the gulf region i think the spotlight of this terrible catastrophe will help us follow through on the important work that we have started with the committee and in terms of dealing with the flood insurance program i acknowledge that what we are doing here today is an important necessary step the additional 2 billion in borrowing authority is unprecedented but the floods are unprecedented i think we should acknowledge on the floor that this is just the down payment that the 2 billion by no stretch of the imagination is likely to be enough we are probably going to be back asking for another 2 billion or 4 billion before we are done but it is important to allow fema to move forward at this point i hope that this will enable us to provide a platform for further reform i hope and i appreciate the prodding that the subcommittee did earlier with fema and its performance it is appalling to me that fema never pushed forward requesting the mitigation funds that were authorized now we have the money in the house version of the appropriations bill but we need to move forward to see to it that this congress puts money in place that will move people out of harms way i hope the committee will work with us to look at other adjustments that may be necessary in the flood insurance program certainly the notion that people who live protected by levees and i use the term levee protection advisedly may notneed flood insurance well i think we are seeing an example of where in fact they probably do need flood insurance i think there are other questions that we need to explore i know the committee on financial services is exploring other aspects and i appreciate consultation with the gentleman from massachusetts ranking member frank is about issues in terms of the viability of small financial institutions that have been wiped out well i hope that with the same spirit of necessary reform and accommodation we can look at how we finance the flood insurance can we afford to put 2 billion 4 billion 6 billion of additional flood losses on the backs of 4 million policyholders it seems to me from a distance that that would be both unfair and undesirable i hope that this is
