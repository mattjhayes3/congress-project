that the united states benefits from freetrade agreements and there is no accurate data indicating that it will be different by expanding trade with mexico contrary to claims that this agreement will result in a mass exodus of american companies to mexico this freetrade agreement will likely have the opposite affect american compa ies are already free to move operations abroad but many businesses prefer to operate in the united states citing our skilled and educated work force incomparable infrastructure and abundant energy resources export growth is one of the most important components of a successful economy and it has been one of only a few industries that has steadily created new jobs throughout the recession historically freetrade agreements have given american companies access to lucrative new markets providing opportunities to grow mexicos 85 million consumers will give the united states the economic boost that we sorely need currently the state of new jersey benefits from s3 billion worth of exports to canada and mexico combined in 1987 when mexico lowered its tariffs from 100 percent to 20 percent new jerseys merchandise exports to mexicogrew over 155 percent in 5 years making new jersey one of 38 states whose exports to mexico have more than doubled and exportrelated jobs pay as much as 17 percent higher wages than nonexport related jobs nationwide a freetrade agreement among the three countries is worth 6 trillion when mexicos tariffs on united states goods dropped from 100 percent to 20 percent united states exports shot from 14 billion to 40 billion

protect united states workers from the lax enforcement of mexican labor laws also americans have been told that because mexico is much poorer than the united states expanded trade would reduce our standard of living though this argument appears logical on the surface businesses consider many other factors other than wage rates to decide on a location to do business companies look for locations to manufacture based on transportation facilities communications infrastructure market energy resources and education level united states workers compete successfully with lower wage mexican workers

innova tion that we have had had in this committee and it has been a very difficult one it has not been partisan at all there has been a suggestion that maybe it should be far more partisan but agriculture is not a issue here as a matter of fact when we realize that only 2 2 percent of the entire population of the united states is involved directly involved in agriculture production it is amazing to me that they all wound up here in congress because we have 435 absolute geniuses and absolute experts in agriculture because everybody is interested in agriculture no matter how far away we have grown as far as our basic roots are concerned we are all experts in this field weall know what programs we want to fund we know what could be cut and yet that is not the way the game is played because there are some discretionary and there are some mandatory facets to this whole question and some of these expenditures lie on one side or the other about the only thing that the committee on appropriations can do is take the discretionary side and deal with it as we must given the 602 b or the budget allocation we got from omb i think we did a credible job with a very difficult task and one that is not to the liking of anyone particularly those of us who have actually lived in the agricultural community and worked in agriculture and know that there is no margin or very little margin very little profit we despise the fact that in a national sense we are the target and the aim of a lot of discussion about the ridiculous situation we have in funding agriculture programs we are a target for cutting expenditures in government because no one believes that with our little rosy derrieres wellfed as they may be that there are so few people involved in really producing the kind of food that we take for granted today the quality of it and the rest because we do not need those agricultural pro grams any longer if it was not for those programs there would not be that kind of an agricultural program in the united states i also get just a little bit testy with the fact that we hear a lot of people from other businesses that say why can you not run agriculture like you run any other kind of business i will tell members why not because we have no control over our margins we have no control over our production costs we have all the planning in the world but we take all the risks in the world it is an unique kind of business we do it better here in the united states than any place in the world we are the greatest agricultural technologists there are the greatest producers on a unit basis but we do not ever get any kind of a margin benefit out of these programs we are never sure how long we can stay in this kind of a business as a result of that when i first came to congress in 1980 there were 4 percent of the population of this country involved directly involved in agriculture today it is about 2 2 percent so tell me about high interest rates tell me about other things that nobody can control in the agricultural communities that has driven these people off of the agricultural production plain rolled it into larger and larger operations so you have scale as a matter of fact for the family of four today to be involved in agriculture to have any kind of a chance of surviving in that particular endeavor it takes about a 1 5 to 2million basic investment that is in land and equipment and so forth so it is a highcost highrisk undertaking q t we in the united states produce the best food the best quality food and the best quantity of food of any nation in the world we are helping the rest of the world feed itself through our own technology we have reduced the spending in agriculture through various programs over the years we have gotten rid of the honey program it cost us dearly because we cut the program but we did not say that we had to go back and make good on the deficit payments that we had to make to honey growers we are phasing out the wool program which is supposed to be a big savings it has absolutely saved not one dime because they are still collecting the tariffs and those costs are still carried out to the taxpayers so if you were going to get it off the taxpayers you missed one more time there are several other reasons for looking at this business of how are we going to cut because when we are dealing with this we do not always want to get what we pray for because if we keep going in the direction we are going in agriculture in cutting the core we are not going to have any core production it is just that simple we do it or we do not do it we came up with the best we could user fees is not a new idea around this place it was initiated sometime ago also this is the straw we are trying to grasp to produce the kindof inspection we owe the people and consumers of this country today it may not be the best way to do it but that is about the only avenue that we had to explore in that particular vein to get inspections done it is not a happy solution to this thing but if you have got a better one come up with it we need all the help we can get we appreciate that and we have the authorizing committee that will be involved in this process because if they want to raise the allotments in those particular areas they have the authority to do that with that i want to say that we have done the best we can with this bill we are not apologizing to anybody for what we have done we have made the cuts where we thought they should be and the increases where we thought they should be we have all agreed on it that we are going to support this thing i know it does not smell good or taste good but it is about the only kind of medicine we have available to us let us get on with the business of

concerned about jobs in america theyua batter be listening to this debate nothing of particular significance has changed in china since 1990 when this howe first went on record by an overwhelming majority favoring a termination of mfn for china it should be clear to any objective obs r that all these years of mfn status have not led to any substantive ckanges in the behavior of the chinese regime the reasons for denying mfn to china cam be summarized in four categories hiamm rights vractices trade policy military polcy and foreign poiabout human eights little needs to bes aid china remains a loolice state and it remains one of the most serious human rights violators in the world mr 8 peaker particularly offensive is ckinas use of forced labor which includes the involvement of as many an i million prisoners in the manufacture of export goods the american peodle are by far the largest recipients of slave labor goods coming from china and putting maericans out of work of course there s the ongoing oppression and cultural genocide against the people of tibet a people whose only crime is the desire to be excluded from the regimentation imposed on society by the chinese communists as for trade policy the latest figures show that china is running up et another huge trade surplus against our own american exports in 1992 alone the united states trade deficit with china reached a level of 11 2 billion a rise of nearly 50 percert over the previous year during the first quarter of this year our trade deficit with china rose by yet another 25 percent over the same period from last year our turade deficit with china has tripled since the ienanmen square massacre and it stands today second only to the trade deicit wth japan the h4 8 jdy 22 1993 deficit with japan is 50 billion china 18 billion and growing to 22 billion this year alone can there be any wonder why the chinese regime does not take our gov ernments protests about human rights and trde pollcies serlously can any mernber here honestly say that china is more economically competitive than amerlca or is the denial of a racess to the chinese people for american goods the real problem wh1 know it is i believe every member knows the answer to that quesbon worse yet china is using this trade surplus to finance a massive military buildup a buildup which has been accelerating since the chinese regime used the military against the chinese people back in 1989 in that brutal massacre while we and every other civilized matlon around this world are reducing our defense spending china is increasing theirs this year alone military spending in china is increasing by 15 percent and it is financed by the trade surpluses that we are allowing to happen we are allowing this massive military buildup this military buildup is across the board it includes upgrades in both nuclear weapons and ballistic missile capabillties believe me we americans should be as worried about these developments as chinas neighbors are and they are scared to death the fourth and final rejson why china does not deserve mfn is its foreign policy this is a regime which has sold m11 missiles to pakistan just xecently given nuclear technology to iran and algeria and refused to support the united nations sanctlons against north korea the one regime with a worse track record than beijing unless of course we include the khmer rouge in cambodia for whom china continues to be the principal patron in conclusion i would like to conment on the presidents executive order i address these comments especially to my friends on the other side of the aisle whom i have great respert for particularly the gentlewoman from caifornla the presidents order does not go far enough to produce any significant resuits we will be right back here again next year consequently this order is not likely to have any effect at all on changing the attitudes of those angry old men in the great hall of the people that is precisely why the joint resolution i am offering today is so important this house has gone on record for 3 consecutive years as favoring a termination of chlnas mfn if we do not do so again this year we will have sent a message of confusion and weakness to the chinese government and we will have negated any possibility that the presidents order may get zome results this joint resolution should be seen as a reinforcement for the presidents order it adds leverage to the presidents approach by letting the chinese regime know that congress remains willing to revoke mfn if beijing does not modorate its behavior become civilized america is always most effective abroad when it is united at home and speaks with mone voice that is what we ought to be doing here today one last thing we have a bill coming to the floor soon it provides 3 billion to help americans who have been ravaged by the midwest floods that is deficit financing we have problems in cleveland and in new york and in los angeles

the amendment this afternoon and in strong support of space station freedom i rise as the most fiscally responsible member of the house of representatives according to the national taxpayers union last year and i also rise as a representative of a state that does not do much nasa business so there is no porkbarrel spending for nasa in the state of wisconsin i am taking the position that i am today because this is a note on whether or not to continue a manned space program that has put america on the cutting edge of technology since its inception in 1957 all one needs to do is look at the spinoffs from nasa activities and how they have improved our lives and even extended those lives without the manned space program we would not have had a revolution in telecommunications which has made long distance telephone calls dirt cheap we would not have had the development of medications that have eased pain and extended the life expectancy of people in this country and around the world we would not have seen new materials developed whether it be velcro or materials that could be used for artificial hips and joints and we would not have been able to see things that have made our lives easier such as sunglasses that many people now use that can more effectively diffuse the rays of radiation from the sun the space station holds the potential of keeping america on the cutting edge of technology if we back away from this program now the technology which america has developed will be developed by those who do go into space the russians the europeans and the japanese who will be there regardless of what this congress decides today i do not want to see that happen as was mentioned earlier there was a hearing at the subcommittee on space yesterday with an allstar panel of witnesses lead by dr michael debakey just in the area of medical research alone there was evidence placed on the table at that hearing to show that we need microgravity research in orderto develop a permanent heart ventricle valve in order to understand better the human bodys immunology which is the key to curing cancer and aids all kinds of other things will flow from the permanent microgravity research which can be done on space station freedom during the last presidential campaign we heard an awful lot about thinking about tomorrow this is a vote madam chairman that will show who is thinking about tomorrow and who is not a 1250 vote no on the roemerzimmer amendment to keep america on the cutting edge of technological research vote no on the roemerzimmer amendment to keep our technology being what makes american business best and reduces our balance of payments deficit as far as possible vote no keep america no 1 in space so the rest of the world can follow our lead rather than the united states of america following somebody elses lead"]]}
