negotiate a partial test ban it was his proudest achievement the people who were opposed to the partial test ban cited many of the same reasons we hear today as to why we cannot have a complete test ban they said that there would be no way to really know if the arsenal was secure if we could not test in the atmosphere that it would somehow inhibit weapons development because we could not agree with the soviets on the number of onsite inspections we lost the opportunity 25 ycars fage today to prevent all nucleo weapons test from the planet earth imagine how different the world would be without mirvs withort the ability to strike one side or the other first today we face different concerns the opponents cf this suggest as they do normally tha if we somehow attempt to do this we will be undercutting our negotiators this administration is not interested in a comprehensive test ban they have said so over and over again to suggest that somehow things are going to change now in geneva i think is very far from reality second for those of us who believe strongly that this is in our national interests forget the idea for a moment that somehow our arsenal is affected one way or the other because both arsenals are affected equally if we do not test and the russians do not test both sides lose confidence in their systems that they will work but the one thing we can have the one item that is most persuasive is that the united states and the soviet union can use as a club in the rest of the world the position that they have stopped testing and they do not want to see other nations test nuclear weapons if my colleagues are interested in preventing muammar qadhafi or the ayatollah from having nuclear weapons the best way that happen is to end and prohibit testing in the united states and in the soviet union we will sacrifice nothing for that and we will gain a great deal let me turn to the issues that have also been raised in the past against this one that cannot be verified today in nevada soviet scientists as part of a natural resources defense council agreement are going to listen with seismometers to the testing of nuclear explosions chemical explosions in the nevada desert they have done the same things for the united states scientists in the soviet union last september we can monitor the very lowest level of testing we have complete confidence whether they are testing and they have complete confidence of whether we would be testing so the question of verification is no longer acceptable second the argument that somehow our arsenal is degraded by this whole process that we will lose confidence in the ability of our nuclear weapons to work or be safe this argument might have some merit if any number of tests in the past were dedicated to these concerns the vast majority of nuclear weapons tests have nothing to do with safety have nothing to do with reliability they have to do with the testing and the effectiveness of new designs for those of my colleaigues who believe that we need ever more sophisticated nuclear weapons clearly they are not going to support this amendment because they will want to see the arms race continue if however

these countries and all the baltic states these will be muted celebrations because for the past 48 years the soviet union has denied freedom and independence to these brave people during its occupation of the baltic states the soviets have overtaken a continuous campaign to virtually eliminate the cultural heritage traditions languages and religion of the lithuanian estonian and latvian people in recognition of the denial of human rights to the baltic people i am reintroducing today two resolutions calling for full freedom and independence of the baltic states and expressing the sense of the congress that our nation should do everything possible through diplomatic channels to see that soviet personnel are removed from these occupied lands these resolutions reaffirm the policy of the united states to refuse to recognize the unlawful soviet occupation of the baltic states and to continue to maintain diplomatic relations with the independent republics of lithuanla estonia and latvia as independent states soviet leaders have widely publicized their new policy of glasnost with the announced intendion of expanding the freedoms and rights of the soviet people if the soviet union is sincere in this regard it should immediately grant the long denied independence to the peaceful and freedom loving people of the baltic states who pose no security risk to the soviet union the resolutions i introduce today the text of which follow my remarks encourage the president to enter into discussions with soviet leaders to end soviet occupation of these lands release baltic political prisoners and restore the selfdetermination of the baltic people through our efforts to recognize the independence of lithuania estonia and latvia we call world attention to the soviet denial of human rights and freedom to the people of these nations for almost half of this century the baltic people are proud and strong and will never relinquish their quest to regain the independence that has been stropped of them by the soviet union and they are deserving of our moral and diplomatic support to help them achieve their dream of the reestablishment of thre truly independent states of lithuania estonia and latvia 1t con res whereas the united states since its inception has been committed to the principle of selfdetermination whereas this essential moral principle is also affirmed in the charter of the united nations whereas the union of soviet socialist republics is according to its constitution a volunary federation of autonomous republics whereas the three baltic republics the republic of lithuania the republic of latvia and the repubic of estonia did not become member republics of the union of soviet socialist republics voluntarily but rather were occupied militarily by russian armed forces in the early days of world war ii and subsequently incorporated by force in to the union of soviet socialist republics and have since been governed by governments approved by and subservient to the government of the union of soviet socialist republics whereas the ethnic makeup of the baltic peoples the lithuanians latvians and estonians is distinctly foreign in language culture common traditions and religion from that of the russian people whereas by deportation and dispenslon of the native populations of the baltic states to siberia and by a massive colonization effort in which russian colonists replace the displaced native peoples the soviet union threatens complete elimination of the baltic peoples as a culturally geographically and politically distinct and ethnically homogeneous population whereat despite such treatment the spirit of the citizens of the baltic states is not broken and the desire of the citizens of the baltic states for national independence remains unabated whereas the united states has consistently refused to recognize the unlawful soviet occupation of the baltic states and has continued to maintain diplomatic relations with representatives of the independent republics of lithuania latvia and estonia and whereas the united nations and the united statcs delegation to the united nations have consistently upheld the right of selfdetermination of the people of those countries in asia and africa that are or have been under foreign imperialist rule now therefore be it resolved by the house of representatives the senate concurring that it is the sense of the congress that 1 the president and the secretary of state should take all necessary steps to bring the baltic states question before the united nations and to urge that the united nations request the soviet union a to withdraw all russian and other nonnative troops agents colonists and controls from the republics of lithuania latvia and estonia and b to return all baltic exiles from siberia and from prisons and labor camps in the soviet union 2 until the baltic states become independent the secretary of state should through such channels as the united states information agency and other information agencies of the united states government do his utmost to bring the matter of the baltic states to the attention of all nations by means of special radio programs and pubilcations 3 the united states should not agree to the recognition by any international conference of the soviet unions unlawful annexation of lithuania latvia and estonia and it should remain the policy of the united states not to recognize in any way the annexation of the baltic states by the soviet union 4 the president should require that all government map publishers and should request that all private map publishers show on all maps of europe the republics of lithuania latvia and estonia as independent states with a footnote explaining that the military occupation and forced incorporation into the soviet union of lithuania latvia and estonia has never been recognized by the united states 5 the right of selfdetermination should be returned to the peoples of lithuania latvia and estonia through free elections conducted under the auspices of the united nations after soviet withdrawal from the baltic states and 6 the right of selfdetermination should be made a prime political objective of the united nations and should be accorded through free elections under the auspices of the united nations to all peoples now involuntarily subjugated to soviet communism h con rzs whereas the united states does not recognize the illegal annexation by the soviet union of the baltic nations of estonia latvia and lithuania whereas the united states as a member of the united nations has pledged to uphold the ideals of the united nations charter and to take joint and separate action to promote universal respect for and obserance of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race sex language or religion whereas during the 83rd congress the select committee to investigate communist aggression of the house of representatives thoroughly investigated the seizure of the baltic nations by the soviet union and in its third interim report concluded that the evidence is overwhelming and conclusive that estonia latvia and lithuania were forcibly occupied and illegally annexed by the union of soviet socialist republics whereas the united states as a signatory to the final act of the conference on security and cooperation in europe endorsed principle viii concerning equal rights and selfdetermination of peoples which states all peoples always have the right if full freedom to determine when and as they wish their internal and external political status without external interference and to pursue as they wish their political economic social and cultural

opposition to the substitute offered by mr wylie my colleague and ranking minority member of the banking committee the wylieroukema substitute would provide an inadequate level of funding for housing and community development assistance for fiscal year 1988 despite the fact that h r 4 the committee bill provides for funding levels within the house budget committee levels even these levels represent reductions of almost 70 percent since 1980a fact most recently stressed by none other than the realtors mortgage bankers and the homebuilders in a june 9 1987 letter to the members of the house these groups do have a stake in housing but as most of the members of the house know they are not flaming liberals by any means we believe that enactment of a housing authorization bill this year is consistent with house and senatepassed budget resolutions is a critical element of an overall national housing policy this lends credence to the fact that further reductions as proposed in the wylieroukema substitute are entirely uncalled for the wylieroukema substitute would eliminate all public housing new construction activity leaving only a 1 900unit program for indian and alaskan native housing it would eliminate section 8 moderate rehabilitation the section 312 rehabilitation program and would use 72 000 vouchers in lieu of existing programs based on hud testimony vouchers cost on average 250 more than section 8 certificates and voucher recipients had to pay more than 30 percent for rent for example it would require that vouchers be used for 30 percent of the assistance that would be provided under rural housing programs it is a plain fact that rental housing is one of the rarest commodities in rural america therefore this voucher approach proposed by mr wylie and mrs roukema is tantamount to a 30percent cut in rural housing assistance from last years levels the rural housing programs have already taken deep cuts the 2 billion loan level in the committee bill is only onehalf of the pre1980 levels other reductions from the committee approved levels are proposed in the wylieroukema substitute such as slashing congregate housing and reducing lowincome housing counseling no funding for a limited child care demonstration in public housing for the nehemiah homeownership experiment and the very small neighborhood development demonstration would be provided if the wylieroukema substitute is adopted these three programs represent attempts by the committee to leverage federal dollars for local private and public resources lowering the cost of federal assistance the child care demonstration is designed to free up public housing tenants so that they might go to school or to a job hopefully to move them from public assistance into the labor force the nehemiah homeownership program would replicate a proven innovative innercity homeownership approach to provide stable sound neighborhoods in place of bombedout slums finally the neighborhood development demonstration would garner the grass root resources to be effective in developing neighborhoods we can never come up with more effective and efficient housing and community development

to be swayed by the arguments made in support of the wylieroukema substitute which suggests you get more for less at a 14 2 billion level wylieroukema projects 138 626 newly assisted units whereas h r 4 at a 15 8 billion level only provides for 127 044 units spend 1 6 billion less and get 11 000 more units they would have us believe not so mr chairman hocus pocus my colleagues when you take into account the length of time housing assistance will be available under these contractswhich can vary from 5 years for vouchers to 40 years for public housing and fmha unitsthere is no question that h r 4 helps many more needy families than the wylieroukema substitute by multiplying the number of additional units by the number of years they will be available for occupancy we define the total number of unit years provided in each bill for the major housing programs of hud and fmha h r 4 provides 2 277 000 unit years while the wylieroukema substitute provides only 1 731 000 unit years less means less especially when you remove the hocus pocus and compare apples with apples i urge defeat of the wylieroukema substitute and support of h r 4 the committee bill"], [0.0013161003589630127,

economics first of all we talk about our huge trade deficit and everybody quotes the figure of 170 billion however this only states the merchandise trade deficit and is not a true figure of our actual trade deficit since it omits service exports for instance we say we have a trade deficit with canada of 22 billion when in fact if you count service industries exports we only have an 11 billion deficit with canada it goes on and on with our trade policies we count exports and imports wrong we do not include securities and investments the gentleman before me has an amendment that is going to seriously affect our foreign investment that offsets the trade deficit the reason we are not seeing massive depression right now or recession is because our trade deficit is offset by our balance of payments of investors the japanese want to invest for instance in the united states because they do not want to invest in japan so they come over here and invest that creates new industry and more domestic investment that is why we have created so many more new jobs unlike any other country i think it is bad policy to write a bill based on emotion and write a bill based solely on unfair trade practices there are some i grant you that and we ought to get rid of them through hard negotiation something we have not done before but i need to point out to members that we have a new entitlement program in here the trade adjustment assistance program included in h r 3 is a new entitlement program not only will we give people who are laid off those who are laid off 4 000 we make them get training so they can receive cash every week plus in addition we make up the difference if they are paid less on their new job than in their old job the government is going to pay them the difference to the tune of seed money of 1 6 billion totally disregarding what economists all over this united states say both liberals and conservatives and everybody in between that the main reason the very no 1 reason that we have the trade deficit in the balance of payments is because of our federal budget deficit i would also like to point out another provision in this bill that i find incredible it includes a provision to further restrict exports of crude oil from this country and also starts a whole new restriction on refined petroleum products exports in other words foreign countries that desire to engage in foreign trade with us by buying our oil or gasoline or jet fuel or whatever now may not do so the hypocrisy of this provisionone that would restrict exports from this country when the entire purpose of this bill is to expand exports from this country and on top of this it targets an industry that has already been brought to its knees because of the depression in the price of oil this congress is kicking the oil producers when they are down about as low as they can go this to me is a disgrace and i urge my colleagues to vote against the trade bill"],

amendment in the nature of a substitute that would allow for several changes in the tongass timber fund without destroying an industry which employs nearly 6 000 people in my state under our amendment the usfs would be required to target funding at a 4 5 bbf per decade rate but could make a determination in any given year that such a level was not warranted due to market demand also the secretary could change the 4 5 bbf per decade rate if he determines that the industry demand is different at the request of several members we have agreed to provide in this substitute that future expenditures in the tongass shall be subject to the usual appropriations process my substitute lherefore will have the same budget savings as the committee bill cbo estimates this savings at 144 million over 4

to restructure the sdi program it is obvious that many attitudes are changing on these issues even within the administration scientists are rethinking their positions on the viability of the system this sort of scientific debate is healthy and should be expected at the same time our negotiators are attempting to overcome obstacles in achieving an arms control agreement with the soviets once again there is much debate on the proposed sdi system since this program was unveiled billions of dollars have been spent to research and develop the technologies which might support creation of a spacebased defensive system our government has encouraged and funded research on the part of private companies and institutions in developing and improving these important technologies its hard to argue against research and development such research always produces civilian spinoffs even though it is impossible for us to calculate today what they might be we are all familiar with the spinoffs from research in the early years of our space programranging from freezedried food to new medical technologies the technology currently being developed for sdi like that of the space program holds the opportunity for limitless commercial spinoffs for example more sophisticated computers enhanced radar detection and tracking improvements in conventional weaponry to name just a few we should not on the basis of policy differences decide to terminate or curtail this sort of groundbreaking research and development the scientific community deserves our continued interest and support even if this sdi system is never deployed i maintain that there will be a wealth of technology springing from the laboratories of our nation that will benefit our society and our economy i want to urge my

is a fact of life that very few people out here in the heartland approve of a pay raise for members of congress that letter touched a nerve with me for the past year i have spoken throughout the fourth district of michigan on the need for us all to tighten our belts to get the budget deficit under control and make some tough choices it seems that congress as the constitutional holder of the
