substance of h r 1665 let me touch on the historical significance of the land that will be protected these three tracts totaling 532 acres comprise the area covered by confederate general longstreets flank attack and other events associated with the battle of the wilderness this ground bore witness to one of the most decisive attacks launched by the confederates during the war in virginia it also marked the beginning of the end of the confederate war effort on the morning of may 6 1864 massive union attacks pummeled confederate lines in this area to the point of collapse only the timely arrival of general james longstreets first corps of lees army of northern virginia prevented total disaster as longstreets troops arrived at the widow tapp farm west of the tracts in question here the general threw them into the fight piecemeal stopping the union assaults and even pushing the federals back several hundred yards at midmorning longstreet conceived the idea of a surprise counterattack against the union left using the unfinished railroad which borders the tracts in question on the south as cover confederate troops formed unseen opposite the union left by 11 all was ready ripping their way through thickets and underbrush confederate troops on a front more than a quartermile long thundered northward into the flank of the union line the federals offered brief resistance but then their lines collapsed the momentum of the confederate attack carried grayclad troops all the way to the orange plank road there disaster struck confederate general longstreet was caught in a confederate volley and fell gravely wounded only a few miles from where a year before stonewall jackson was mortally wounded by confederate troops with that devastating blow the confederate attack lost momentum but the federal lines had been ruined never again would they threaten the confederates in the wilderness and indeed later that day the confederates would resume the attacks and push the union lines to the edge of disaster later that day woods on these lands would take fire consuming wounded and dead alike the fires of the wilderness would become the signature horror of two of americas most horrific days as members can see this stretch of land is a key component which will serve to complete the wilderness battlefield ensuring our heritage for generations to come the vast majority of this land is currently owned by developers this spring the prospective developers of this land offered a 3year window for the government to acquire the tracts after 3 years they intend to move forward with development recognizing the need to preserve this land legislation was passed in the 102nd congress to allow the park service to acquire the land by donation since the early 1990s this tract has been the object of intense effortsby nonprofit organizations all of which have failed to preserve the tract i introduced h r 1665 because we are running out of time to save this battlefield from being lost forever h r 1665 would permit the park service to buy the land which is already within the authorized boundary of the park the park service which supports h r 1665 has worked cooperatively with the owners of the land and the spotsylvania county board of supervisors to protect the land for several years once the park service has been given legal authorization to acquire the land they will enter into negotiations with the developers and other landowners to determine the price to be paid to buy the land the language in this part of the bill prescribes that acquisition of these tracts of land will be from willing sellers only i appreciate being given the opportunity to discuss my efforts to save this historically significant battlefield alternatives to federal acquisition have been exhausted congress and the national park service must act to acquire the longstreet flank attack site i urge my colleagues to vote for h r 1665"], [0.0007383227348327637,

normal trade relations with the communist government of china let me just say for the record that this is a bipartisan effort as we can see tonight some people on the other side of the aisle have been very active some people on my side of the aisle have been very active perhaps one of the greatest disappointments i have had with this administration is that during president bushs term in office i was very disappointed in his policies toward communist china and in fact after tiananmen square was bitterly disappointed in how we took that and the positions we were taking in response to the massacre of democracy advocates in tiananmen square when george bush lost the election in 1992 to president elect clinton i thought to myself well at least here is someone that i will be able to work with on the issue of human rights unfortunately i had bought in to president clintons posturing on human rights and i might add unfortunately all of us who have been active in the human rights arena have been disappointed with this administration i personally feel that this administration has been the most antihuman rights administration in my lifetime and it certainly has undermined the tough stands made by president reagan and president jimmy carter and has even superceded george bush in the area of human rights for example in china this president has decoupled trade negotiations with china in relationship to anything to do with human rights the administration no longer has that as part of its negotiating position this president personally decided to make that decoupling had a republican president done that i imagine people would remember it a great deal more because there would have been a much greater fracas caused by that but tomorrow we will again address this issue that has been one that has gone on every year since my election to congress and tomorrow the house will debate legislation that has been introduced however it will be my legislation that will be debated and that of course makes me feel a bit humble i remember the time when i came into this body 10 years ago when i could not have dreamed of having a piece of my legislation being the focal point of a major days work of the united states congress but i have introduced legislation that will disapprove of the extension of socalled normal trade relations with communist china which was previously known as most favored nation status for the past 10 years since the massacre of the democracy advocates at tiananmen square and by the way let us remember that the folks over in beijing the same people who have been in charge the same gang that has been in charge those people still deny that there was ever a massacre at tiananmen square of democracy advocates but since then the congress has undertaken this debate every year bilt there has been little change in the repression that is taking place in china the gentlewoman from california"], [0.0010317564010620117, 0.501031756401062, 1,

to close the school of americas but 10 years ago i got to know people from another part of the world people who have such a love for family such a passion for life and despite their many many hardships that i still cannot forget them though my work in that country is through on november 16 1989 at the university of central america in el salvador six jesuit priests their housekeeper and their 15 yearold daughter were pulled from their beds forced to lie on the ground and executed in cold blood at that time el salvador was in the midst of a horrible civil war the united states had sided with the salvadoran government and we had sent the salvadoran military a total of 6 billion those murders murders of men of god and innocent women shocked the entire world and congress wanted to know exactly what was going on in el salvador speaker foley called for a congressional investigation and asked me to head it up my top staff personnel a congressman jim mcgovern and i traveled to el salvador to investigate these murders for 2 years we held meetings conducted interviews dug around we learned that the salvadoran soldiers not only committed the massacre but also were ordered to do so by the people at the highest levels of their military command who then engaged in a massive coverup reaching the highest levels of salvadoran government the very same salvadoran government to whom we were sending billions and billions of dollars after the moakley commission report was made public we eventually cut off all military aid to el salvador soon afterwards that civil war ended but today 10 years later our work towards human rights in central america has not ended in addition to learnfng who committed the jesuit murders we learned that 19 of those 26 implicated in those murders were graduates of the school of americas let me repeat nineteen of those 26 implicated in the jesuit murders were graduates of the school of americas the school of americas is a united states army school run in fort benning georgia that trains approximately 2 000 latin american soldiers every year the classes they teach include combat skills commando tactics military intelligence and torture techniques and this education comes at a very high price the school of americas costs the united states taxpayers 20 million every year and that is what we are trying to stop here tonight my colleagues and i are offering an amendment which will stop any money in the bill from being used to support the school of americas we are standing today and saying enough is enough it is time to close down the school once and for all because its graduates were not only involved in the jesuit murders the school of americas graduates raped and killed four american church women they assassinated archbishop romero while offering mass the school of americas graduates massacred 900 innocent civilians in el mozote and school of americas graduates were implicated in the trujillo chairrsaw massacres in which at least 107 villagers were tortured and murdered manuel noriega the infamous panamanian dictator is a graduate of the school of americas as were onethird of general pinochets officials just 2 months ago general rito del rio was expelled from the columbian military because his human rights violations were so horrible he also is a graduate of the school of the americas the list goes on and on and on put simply the school of americas has trained some of the most brutal assassins some of the cruelest dictators some of the worst abusers of human rights that the western hemisphere has seen and i think it is time for the united states of america to admit its mistakes and remove this horrible blemish from our military establishment because if we do not stand for human rights in georgia how can we possibly expect to promote them anywhere else in the world this spring president clinton was forced to apologize for our involvement in the civil war in guatemala that left 200 000 civilians dead how many more times will our president have to apologize to the people of central america before we close the school some people say the school is changed they say it trains people in drug interdiction in fact 8 percent of the students that even attend the antidrug courses a dozen of those who did in the past have been also tied to drug trafficking the fact remains every day this school is open every day it trains people in torture techniques and commando tactics is a day too many human rights are the foundation on which our country was created we shed blood over those principles we fought wars and sacrificed lives to protect them why would we want to export anything less to the rest of the world i urge my colleagues to take a stand for those without a voice take a stand for human rights take a stand for human decency and shut down that school of americas our founding fathers would expect nothing else i reserve the balance of my time"],

problem he faces is not unlike a problem that many of us have or will experience in our own districts many of us have federal buildings within our districts that oftentimes were built during the depression era buildings that are no longer up to current standards and are having difficulty being leased these buildings i think are many times located in prime areas of our communities in downtown locations in commercial areas and many times these buildings have historical significance that warrant preservation h r 2513 by the gentleman from indiana deals with such a building located in his hometown of terre haute and it is a building that is currently owned by and partially occupied by the postal service i have committed to helping the gentleman from indiana with this bill not only because of my personal respect and admiration which i hold for him but also because i know that any one of us can and do face the same problem in our own districts i am aware of the fact that the gentleman from indiana has worked diligently for over 2 years to try to find a solution to this problem this bill would transfer the postal service building from the postal service to the general services administration the general services administration as consideration for the transfer would be obligated to permit the postal service to continue to occupy approximately 8 000 square feet of the building that has about 45 000 square feet of rentable space for free for a period of 20 years the bill would also authorize an appropriation of 5 million to the gsa to renovate the building and to acquire parking i fully appreciate the value of this building to the community of terre haute this structure which was constructed through a public works project during the depression is listed on the national register of historical places aside from its historical significance the building goes a long way toward enhancing the value of downtown terre haute by providing citizens a host of services that are easily accessible to the public citizens like to be able to walk across the street to visit the post office visit the social security administration time however has taken its toll on this building it is deeply in need of repair and diminishing standards have made it difficult to keep the building operational as i said it is estimated by the gsa that the building would require between 4 million and 5 million in renovation the citizens of terre haute under the leadership of the gentleman from indiana have joined together to keep the postal service building as a viable part of the downtown area in my opinion the federal government has a clear duty to act as a responsible property owner and should be a partner in finding a solution to the future of this building the buildings historical significance and its importance to preserving the economic viability of the downtown area must be acknowledged by the federal government however i am deeply concerned about one provision of the bill that provision which allows the postal service to occupy 8 000 square feet of space for 20 years at no cost i recognize that the purpose of the free rent provision under the bill is to compensate the postal service for the value of the building yet without the whole building generating revenue i anticipate that the expense of providing the postal service with free rent will greatly reduce the fair market value of the building the free rent provision will amount to an encumbrance which will diminish the buildings economic value for the next 20 years as we all know a lot can change in 20 years all future prospective owners of the building may be discouraged from a equiring the building because of the heavy burden of free rent for the postal service and the postal service has acknowledged that it intends to stay in the downtown area they even acknowledged to us in a conferencecall that were they not in this building they would move to another building a few blocks away where they would be required to pay rent why then should the postal service not continue to pay rent in the postal service building that is a question that i do not know that we have a clear answer to the postal service simply says that if they are going to transfer a building to the general services administration they are due some consideration that it has some value this argument certainly is a sound one if the building does in fact have economic value but the estimates provided by the gsa indicate that the building in its current condition has little if any economic value and will require an expenditure of over 4 million to bring it up to a standard to attract tenants at market rates and then of course the payout over the years of 4 2 million perhaps would make the building less attractive not only to the government but to any private investor considering such an investment so having expressed my concern about the particular provision of the bill i want to say again that i commend the gentleman from indiana for his diligence in trying to deal with a problem common to all of us i think that the proper thing for us to do is to support this bill to move it forward and in fact when we had a hearing on this bill the gentleman from indiana delayed moving the bill forward for 30 days to allow the gsa to come up with any viable option that they may have their efforts thus far have been unsuccessful but he kept his commitment to do so and our commitment on this side of the aisle was to allow this bill to move forward and perhaps to move it to a point where some ofthe suggestions that i have made could be incorporated in the bill we are supportive of the effort that the gentleman from indiana has made i commend him for what he is attempting to do

theme the spirit the energy the leadership that is crucial to making the vitally important educational reforms that are necessary in order to improve the quality of education for our kids it was based on that recognition that i worked with the leadership on both sides of the aisle in order to get a special provision included in the bill addressing the importance of training and professional
