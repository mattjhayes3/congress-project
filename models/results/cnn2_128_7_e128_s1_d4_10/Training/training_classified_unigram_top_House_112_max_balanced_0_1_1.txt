student loan rates but what did they decide to do in deciding on not doubling the student loan rates they gave the house a choice in which they would take it out on womens health denying women early screenings for breast cancer for cervical cancer denying newborn infants early screenings for birth defects thats how they decided they would pay for it we tried to offer a democratic alternative the legislation of mr tierney of massachusetts which would have taken away the unjustified unfair tax breaks to the largest oil companies in the country at a time of record profits and use some of that money to pay for making sure that the interest rates dont double but the republicans wouldnt allow us to offer that today what were trying to do is to defeat the previous question so that we will be able to offer the democratic substitute which would keep the interest rates from doubling we would pay for it by taking away the unfair tax cuts to the largest oil companies and not do what the

you of 800 000 private and public sector jobs instead of doing everything we can do to halt the loss of jobs and put people back to work this bill takes the wrong approach putting our economy and our country back on the path to recession for every job opening in this country we have 4 7 unemployed people who are looking for work why would we want to add to their numbers so be it cannot and should not be our response to this economic crisis not with a 9 percent unemployment rate and over 15 percent in communities of color and record layoffs and furloughs at the state level and especially not when republicans have the temerity to demand tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires paid for through borrowed money this is just wrong and its immoral as a member of the house appropriations subcommittee on labor health and human services and education i am in strong opposition to these cruel cuts budgets are moral documents and they are a reflection of who we are and what we value this spending bill makes it clear that the poor the young women the elderly teachers firefighters cops and the communities that they protect and serve are not valued make no mistake this bill will harm the most vulnerable among us and it represents a wrongheaded approach to reducing the deficit or expanding job growth in our country i am especially concerned about the proposed cuts to education and training programs among the range of cuts include workforce investment act programs which last year helped over 8 4 million job seekers find jobs they got additional education and job training support this is being cut all told when counting rescissions of prior funding elimination of the requested fy11 funding and the advanced funding needed to run these employment and training programs they will experience nearly a 5 billion cut republican cuts in job training will only prolong the recession keep unemployment high and keep more americans collecting unemployment instead of training and getting ready for our 21st century job opportunities how can we justify cutting job training programs in the middle of an economic crisis how will my republican colleagues respond to the unemployed in their communities who come to them and ask them for help will they just say so be it pell grants pell grants provide vital funds for students who wish to attend 2 and 4year colleges but who need help to pay their expenses in my district alone there are 16 institutions that provide pell grants to over 18 000 recipients this proposal would cut pell grants by 845 making college less affordable and accessible for lowand moderateincome students more than 8 million students benefit from pell grants and many would be hurt by this cut especially as schools are raising tuition fees to meet rising costs and to deal with tighter budgets the bill also entirely eliminates federal funding for supplemental educational opportunity grants which colleges and universities use to assist undergraduates who have the greatest financial need that program assisted 1 3 million college students last year head start under this proposal is cut by nearly 1 1 billion this will effectively knock out 200 000

for school the job corps program this program is cut by 891 million which will result in 21 384 jobs lost in communities in every state the majority of which are in the private sector there will be 1 7 billion lost in economic activity as a result of this and 36 000 atrisk young people will be turned away from job corps costing the government and the economy as much as 17 billion over the course

most secure currency in the world we would be downgraded we run a real risk as to whether the dollar will continue to be the global currency right now many international transactions are related in dollars we know that as it relates to energy all of a sudden on august 3 we run the risk that the american dollar will no longer be the global currency having a major impact on the unitedstates economy j p morgan tells us we could expect an immediate increase in interest costs of 75 to 100 basis points what does that mean well for the taxpayers of this country it means it is going to cost more money for us to pay for our borrowing that will raise the cost of interest payments which i would suggest is a not very productive use of taxpayer dollars causing taxpayers to have to pay more for our borrowing but it goes well beyond the federal taxpayers it affects every family in america the estimates are that the effect of the increase in unitedstates obligations on interest rates will have an effect on all borrowing so if a person is buying a home they can expect the interest costs will increase by about 1 000 a year if a person is a credit card holder they can expect their interest rates to go up about 250 a year that is the effect it is going to have on every american family if we pass august 2 without increasing our debt limit if a person has money in the stock market they can expect there will be a reduction in the value of their wealth we saw that happen once before when retirement account values slipped dramatically we are at risk of having that happen again if we pass august 2 without increasing the debt limit the impact it will have on our economy on jobswe expect it will clearly have a negative impact on our job market we will lose jobs and we very well

their obligations then what do we do about medicare do we continue to pay medicare at 100 percent well i assume we are going to run out of money what do we do about our military our soldiers who we all say we want to support do we continue their salaries or do we reduce their amounts by say 40 percent if we pay all of those there is no money left over to pay veterans benefits what happens to our veterans who are depending on their checks to be able to meet their obligations then what do we tell our students who are preparing to go to school in the fall about their pell grants that their pell grants arent going to be available and maybe they cant go to school in the fall they have to make plans right now what do we do about small business owners who are depending upon their contracts with

by having two people who work on the budget committee who have great intellect great integrity and care about america mr ryan from wisconsin and mr van hollen from maryland the american public sometimes is not sure that it has that kind of quality if only they were here sitting in the budget committee or on the floor and listening to these two gentlemen who have disagreements and represent their positions well i voted for every budget compromise that has been passed over the past 3 years without fail the result however invariably has been an unremitting undermining of our efforts to reach a balanced fiscal policy and to invest in that which will secure our future the economy education infrastructure national security and innovation while each of those bills was preferable to default on our debt or the shutting down of our government they have been simply stopgap measures that have not prevented continuing lurches from congressionally created and all too frequent fiscal crises and shutdowns the headlines regarding this agreement put it in perspective an oped in the new york times says congress avoids reality again the wall street journal says a least bad budget deal while a usa today headline says minimalist budget deal beats another shutdown the editorial concludes with this however unless we come to grips with the fiscal issue we will be inflicting a huge

officially declared itself an illegal alien sanctuary city by the board of supervisors in 1989 and now lawmakers are taking that a huge step further by actually creating legislation to grant illegal

assured through costly spanish language advertising campaigns that they will never be reported to federal law enforcement agents such as ice immigrations and customs enforcement or homeland security

to the floor of the house to discuss the personal decisions that a woman has to make and i can assure you that the question of choice the question of abortion the question of what a woman does to her body is not one that a woman takes lightly on many occasions there is the necessity for a doctor and his female patient to make decisions to save the life or health of the mother just as the federal courts have ruled unconstitutional and rejected the texas law that requires a doctor to talk first to a woman seeking an abortion and to allow or force them both to listen to sounds that might discourage this needed action this is going to be held unconstitutional this is not a law that can pass you can not tell a woman her insurance company can not provide her all the benefits of that coverage it goes way beyond the pale i would ask my colleagues to vote against this rule and protect the right of a woman to choose and the dignity of all people in this nation to make their own
