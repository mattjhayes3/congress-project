with the houses business the gentlenan from mississippi was talking about what we do not what the president does and that needs to be taken into account what we are about to do today is addto when we add up all of the tax cuts that have now been proposed by the majority in the house and the senate it is 500 billion this is money that is saying our debt continues to go up and the risk to social security increases with every bill that is passed like the one before us today we do not with small businesses any favors or family farmers any favors by enacting a tax cut which brings them minimal relief minimal relief at the same time it undermines the fiscal discipline that has produced the longest economic expansion period in the history of our country the democratic alternative would provide an immediate 4 million exclusion for estate tax that would exempt more than 90 percent of the family farms from paying any estate tax at all i would welcome the opportunity today on this floor to debate between the bill of the majority and the bill of the minority on a linebyline basis then the rhetoric would stop i say to my friend from arizona and we could have an honest discussion why would you not permit an honest discussion of these issues why do you pass over the fact that the statement of the gentleman from mississippi was 100 percent true why do you continue to do that with rhetoric why is it so important to continue to discuss tax cuts when we ought to be debating the very issues that we seem to all be agreed to vote against this bill and vote for the motion to recommit i rise in opposition to this fiscally irresponsible tax bill and in strong support of the democratic alternative which will be offered as the motion to recommit i said on many occasions that the tax bill that this body passed and the president vetoed last year was the most fiscally irresponsible legislation in my 21 years in congress we are well on our way to replicating that dubious achievement this year if we pass this bill today the total cost of tax bills passed by the house or the senate to date will total nearly 500 billion when the interest costs are taken into account more costly tax bills stand in line to follow the tax bill before us is simply a political document that never will become law worse this tax bill put forward by the majority does not provide meaningful relief from the estate taxes for small businesses and farmers it may be a good deal for wealthy individuals with estates of 10 million or more but it doesnt do much for the vast majority of small businesses and family farmers in my district we do small businesses family farmers and ranchers no favor by enacting a tax cut which brings them minimal relief at the same time it undermines the fiscal discipline which has produced the longest economic expansion period in the history of our country the democratic alternative developed by charlie rangel and john tanner is a fiscally responsible tax proposal which would provide real and meaningful tax relief for the largest number of small businesses incidentally it also could be signed into law the democratic alternative would provide an immediate 4 million exclusion for the estate tax which would exempt more than 90 of family owned farms from paying any estate tax at all there are 193 024 family farmers in the state of texas with farms valued at less than 5 million dollars who would benefit from the estate tax relief in the democratic substitute the bill before us does very little for these family farms the democratic alternative contains several other important tax breaks for small businesses that i have long supported it immediately implements the 100 deduction of health insurance for the selfemployed it makes permanent both the work opportunity credit and the welfaretowork credit for businesses which hire disadvantaged workers it increases the business meal deduction and the firstyear 100 deduction for investment expenses and importantly the democratic alternative will maintain the fiscal discipline that has produced our strong economy because the tax cuts in the democratic alternative are paid for no wonder the small business community has been so impressed with this proposal the president has promised that he will sign into law the democratic tax package the fact that the leadership left only a procedural vote to indicate support of this amendment raises the question of what is more important to them actually providing tax relief to small businesses or keeping a political issue alive vote against this bill and vote for the motion to recommit so we can pass business tax relief which genuinely has been targeted towards small businesses and which can be signed into law"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "i rise before you today

time as i may consume i would like to say to my good friend the gentleman from michigan that we are prepared to accept the motion to instruct that the gentleman has offered and i would say with regard to the legislative process that we have been through that we have from the outset been concerned about the substantive inputs of the administration and the leadership of both the house and senate and both the democratic and republican leadership and in fact the house bill which i think is an outstanding piece of legislation which will go a long way to address the concerns of the american people of the business community of those who have been negatively affected by the failure to have certain equipment or software whatever the case may be ready for y2k needs that in all those cases we have in the legislation we passed listened to everyone who had input in this process and have adapted the legislation that passed the house while taking those inputs into consideration agreeing with some and disagreeing with others i know that same process has taken place in the senate where they also have passed a good bill so when the conference meets and considers the relative merits of both the house bill and the senate bill we will be interested in hearing the input of the leadership and have heard the input of the administration in that process for that reason we are prepared to accept this motion to instruct i would say however that the house of representatives is a sovereign body that it is duly designated on the basis of the united states constitution to represent the will of the people that we represent and we will do so with input from a number of different sources but most importantly with input from the majority of the members of the house who supported the bill that we passed through the house of representatives taking into account the fact that we want to see legislation signed into law by the president which will reflect the need to address the y2k problem to avoid frivolous and fraudulent lawsuits to encourage parties to work on solving the y2k problem and not on an increasing amount of litigation we believe those things are reflected in the bill passed by the house we believe they are also reflected in the bill passed by the senate so we will proceed in a fashion that will allow us to come up with legislation that surely the president will want to sign because it is urgent that we solve this problem one of the points to be made about y2k legislation addressing this problem is that time is of the essence it is not only important that we pass this before january 1 2000 it is important that we pass this and get it signed into law by the president now because the effects of this legislation will take place immediately those who need to solve y2k problems will be less fearful of getting into a litigation mess and more anxious to get about the business of correcting the actual technological problems that individuals and businesses face with their computer systems if they know now that they can get started now or continue work now without fear of a massive problem with litigation that is what this bill that we have passed through the house is designed to do i know that is what the senate intended as well so surely when we work out the differences between the house and senate bills we will be able to present to the president something that he should sign immediately given i know the concern that the president has for addressing this problem and addressing it immediately and not dragging us through a long process involving a veto the addressing of this problem with new legislation that we would have to take up with another version passed through the house another version passed through the senate another conference and then still not knowing whether the version that that we come up with in that conference would be signed by the president so it would be my hope that the version that we pass out of the conference will be signed into law by the president recognizing that we have already been taking into account the concerns raised by the president have in the legislation passed in the house and in the legislation passed in the senate a reflection of a number of those concerns but obviously not all of those concerns because as i said this is a body that must do the will of the people that we represent i reserve
