right now we are talking about saving lives we are talking about responsible background checks on gun purchases as well no fly no buy if you are on the terrorist list if you cant fly then you shouldnt be able to buy a gun what is so difficult about that for our republican majority to understand actually on the background check legislation we are talking about expanding the background check bill that already exists to include internet sales something relatively newnot new compared to when we passed the bill in the middle ninetiesand we are talking about gun shows this would save lives to have background checks on everyone who is there to purchase a gun eightyfive percent of the american people support responsible legislation for background checks which is what we are proposing and 90

around but as a lawyer with legal training i did something radical i actually read this bill it didnt take me very long because as mr farr pointed out it is only two pages long i want to talk about what this bill would really do because this bill would do far far more than its proponents claim that it would do let me say first of all there is no federal money that is spent on abortion in most cases in the united states this has been the law of the land for a long time i disagree with that law because i think it limits full reproductive health for women who can least afford it but that is the law of the land so what are we talking about here what we are talking about is states being able to deny money to anybody who is directly or indirectly involved with abortion services with nongovernmental money with private money from women and their family with insurance money with nongovernmental money so here is how this bill would work a state could decide that if a hospital provided abortions with nongovernment money it simply wasnt going to authorize state money or medicaid money to that hospital i dont mean just medicaid money for womens services i mean all medicaid money or state money all money for services this bill could say that an obgyn who has coprivileges at a hospital that provides abortion could now not serve anyanymedicaid patients this bill would say that a doctor who provides services at a neighborhood healthcare clinic who has privileges at a hospital that provides abortion could now be banned from taking medicaid patients that is how broad this bill is written what this would do is it would allow states to terminate all government funds to any entity that directly or indirectly provides abortions with nongovernment dollars so what would this do well 72 million people in this country are on medicaid right now these people are men these people are women and these people are children these people are people who take womens medical services and those who dont need them these 72 million americans risk the loss of all of their healthcare services under medicaid because of this radical bill now okay lets say that wont really happen lets say that is just an overbroad interpretation of the bill so then our colleagues on the other side say well lets just limit ourselves to community health centers if we use this bill to deny funding for planned parenthood everyone will go to community health centers lets see how that would work right now we have 24 million patients in this country in community health centers the community health centers themselves tell us for every one of those 24 million patients they are taking right now they are turning away seven people so we have 4 2 million planned parenthood patients lets say those 4 2 planned parenthood patients decide to go to the community health clinics that is not going to work they tried this in louisiana in louisiana a federal judge found there would be 29 providers for 5 000 women to get healthcare services that is untenable that is unacceptable and it puts our nations womens health at risk listen since we have been debating this bill today we are 1 hour closer to a government shutdown and we have done nothing to make sure we are not going to do that i would suggest that we refocus our efforts that we stop beating up planned parenthood that we stop beating up womens health that we get together collectively and we say how are we going to keep this government open how are we going to work together to make sure every man and woman in this country has a good job good health insurance and that they can provide for their families that is what we are elected to do and that is what i commit myself to do on behalf of this body i yield back the balance of my
