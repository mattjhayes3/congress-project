whether we want to focus attention on minority cancer week and i think that it would be appropriate for me to respond to those questions as the sponsor of house joint resolution 119 and the chairman of the subcommittee on census andpopulation i am pleased to bring this bill before the house under unanimous consent house joint resolution 119 designates the week of april 19 through april 25 as national minority cancer awareness week this resolution draws attention to an unfortunate but extremely important fact about cancer while cancer affects men and women of every age race ethnic background and economic class the disease has adisproportionately severe impact on minorities and the economically disadvantaged for example the incidence of cancer overall among blacks hispan ics and the poor is higher in comparison to the general population and while the overall cancer survival rate is improving steadily the survival rate among blacks and hispanics has declined accurate data does not exist for cancer rates among other minority groups but it is likely that groups such as native americans also suffer disproportionately from this deadly disease the national cancer institute has established a goal to reduce the cancer mortality rate in the united states to 50 percent by the end of this century while this is an ambitious goal it is certainly achievable if we apply present technology and research to all communities on an equal basis the designation of national minority cancer awareness week will promote increased awareness of prevention and treatment among those segments of the population which are at higher risk of contracting cancer it will also give physicians nurses other health care professionals and researchers an opportunity to focus on the populations at risk and to develop creative approaches to attacking cancer problems unique to these communities in fact the national medical association the american medical association and the american cancer society have both endorsed this resolution as a means of drawing attention to the april 8 1 987 problem of cancer among minorities and the poor i am pleased to note that during the third week of april the university of texas system cancer center m d anderson hospital and tumor institute locted in houston will sponsor a national symposium on cancer and minorities the largest undertaking of its kind this conference will bring together leading cancer specialists health care professionals and lay people to address a public health problem of major importance as we continue to assess our progress in preventing and treating cancer let us take 1 week to focus on the impact of cancer among people at greater riskminorities and the econmically disadvantaged if we successfully fight the battle on this most dangerous front we will go a long way toward winning the war against cancer in conclusion i hope that my explanation here answers the questions about whether we should focus specifically on minorities in this week in this month when we are looking at the whole question of cancer i think the arguments given by the american medical association the national medical association and the cancer society address this problem i thank the gentlewoman from maryland and the chair for his courtesy in permitting me this opportunity to present this important resolution"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "1 want to join with my distinguished colleagues who support the child care provisions of h r 1720 shortly after congress convened i met with speaker wright to emphasize the importance of addressing the crying need for safe affordable good quality day care numerous statistics bear out the fact that growing numbers of mothers are returning to the labor force at some time after they have children the child care provisions of h r 1720 are an important first step toward satisfying this need as the author of the first bills to improve the quality and availability of child care services i am pleased the bill encourages states to get a better understanding of their existing child care resources and their ability to meet the increased demand for this service if anything gives me concern about this provision it is the timing of this study under the bill the study can be done either prior to or in conjunction with the disbursement of these funds encouragement alone may not be suffi cient to ensure this study is undertaken and completed i would have hoped this would be mandatory and timed so that adequate child care services are in place before we require the working poor to be employed we must be absolutely certain that quality day care is availal le to these parents we do not need a repetition of the tragic deaths of children in reston va or the near tragedy of jessica mcclure in midland tx before we wake up to this fact i am also concerned that this bill does not address the lack of coordination of existing child care programs especially for the working poor whom this bill is supposed to help it is vital that we have a considerably better understanding of why existing federal child care programs are not meeting the demand for this service in particular we need to better

parents of a 1 to 3yearold can find a safe and sound day care program for 200 a month in chicago or for that matter in any other major urban center the answer is you can because of the critical

only after years of workstarting in the early fifties continuing with 22 days ofhearings and 51 days of markup in 1965 and ending with 17 days of hearings and 25 days of markup in 197576 i committed much of my first 18 years in congress to this endeavor the copyright act of 1976 was a bipartisan legislative achievement of the first magnitude legislators of both parties understood that copyright legislation raises unique difficulties while a relatively obscure discipline copyright touches every american in their homes schools libraries and workplaces determining the scope of a law which deeply affects how all of us may enjoy books films television programming computer software information products and services music and the visual arts requires great caution particularly in a rapidly changing society such as ours that seeks both the free flow of information and the free marketplace with the memory of the 1976 revision still fresh in mind i am introducing legislation today to amend the 1976 copyright act although narrow in scope and seemingly technical these amendments contemplate fundamental changes in our copyright system my legislation responds to the same brooding presence that has lurked in the background of unitedstates copyright legislation for 100 yearsthe berne convention for the protection of literary and artistic works in many ways we drafted and passed the 1976 act with a weather eyeon berne the bill i introduce todaythe berne convention implementation act of 1987removes from law provisions incompatible with the proscriptions of the berne conventionas revised at paris on july 24 1971and adds to our law provisions required by that convention not now present in the statute the objective of the bill is simple to permit the adherence of the united states to the berne convention if after hearings and consultations we determine that berne adherence on balance serves the interests of this country and its citizens i am honored to have mr moorhead join me as a cosponsor this kind of bipartisan tradition reaches back to the 1976 act i am aware of the administrations conceptual support for adherence to berne and i look forward to working together with the executive branch on the implementing legislation i also anticipate a close working relationship with the world intellectual property organization wipoi and its director general dr arpad bogsch on this important subject in preparing this bill i have been guided by the hardlearned lessons of historyboth the history of our domestic copyright revision struggles and that of our several unsuccessful efforts in the past to adhere to berne my bill is based in part on the toll of the ad hoc working group on unitedstates adherence to the berne convention i would like the record to reflect the hard work of the members of that group and in particular those of its chairman irwin karp and of its guiding hand in the executive branch harvey winter from the office of business practices in unitedstates department of state i would be remiss if i did not mentlon the efforts last congress of senator charles mcc mathias jr who introduced similar legislation in the senate like our law the berne convention has changed over time its 76 adherents now include most of the industrialized world a number of developing countries and a few nations in eastern europe the united states the soviet union and the peoples republic of china do not adhere the united states and the soviet union along with another 76 nations belong to a more recent treaty the universal copyright convention both treaties are administered by united nations organizations berne by the world intellectual property organization and the ucc by unesco the united states has a seat on the committee that oversees the ucc but since we withdrew from unesco we have a smaller voice and no formal vote in the overall planning and budgeting process affecting uccrelated activities many nations adhere to both treaties and the united states enjoys copyright relations either through the ucc or a formal bilateral relationship with almost 100 states if we adhere to berne we gain or clarify or improve our relations with 24 nations that adhere to berne but not the ucc and with whom our copyright relations are now nonexistent unclear or otherwise problematic the interest in adherence to the berne convention that sparked this initiative is rooted in part in the desire to promote the international protection of works of american authors this arguably would be achieved by having the united states embrace particular legal rules accepted by 76 nations including our major trading partners in western europe canada and japan but we now have copyright relations with most if not all of these states by virtue of the universal copyright convention and berne membership would not by itself increase the level of protection we now enjoy in those states upon closer scrutiny the benefit most frequently pointed to in support of united states adherence to the berne convention appears to be enhanced political credibility in our global effort to strengthen copyright norms to suppress piracy and to secure in all the countries of the world a realistic minimum standard of protection for creative works a major forum in which this policy objective is being sought is the uruguay round of the general agreement on tariffs and trade where we are seeking the adoption of a code or standard of conduct relating to protection of intellectual property within the gatt for copyrights that standard or code may well be the minimum economic rights of the berne convention and if we join berne our trade negotiators around the world could insist on these standards as those that constitute adequate protection for gatt as well as bilateral purposes while we all agree that protection of our creative works abroad is often inadequate everyone does not agree that this is the case with respect to our own works under our own copyright law we are nevertheless being called upon to modify the equilibrium of our domestic copyright law in order to help secure better protection for our authors in other countries we want to protect and promote the copyright export earnings of unitedstates industry but we should not do so at the expense of the unique needs and traditions of our society and our preferences as to the proper mix of rights limitations and conditions we have come to rely on over the years the legislation i am introducing today seeks to raise all of the questions that must be asked for the fullest range of private and public interests to be aware of what berne adherence will mean now and tomorrow the goal of the bill is to stimulate debate about the issues and to further understanding about the berne convention in a democratic and open setting i have never seen a copyright bill that failed to evoke some controversy and this one will be no exception it will stir debate within the framework of full public hearings and give my subcommitteethe subcommittee on courts civil liberties and the administration of justicethe information it needs to decide how to proceed the bill is a first draft and undoubtedly will undergo refinements the united states chose not to join the berne union in the past because we did not then want for our society the kind of copyright laws that the convention required a fresh look is needed and i encourage my colleagues to do so this legislation was drafted after assessing both the level of berne obligations under the current paris act conscious of the practices of those states party to berne at a similar stage of development as the united states that generally share our values of free speech and artistic freedom also examined were the literally dozens of bills introduced over the last 60 years to bring the previous copyright laws into conformity with berne conforming our law with berne may not involve many major changes to the copyright act of 1976 it will however require congress to move that act a few inches further along in several areas where the 1976 act stopped just short of a point of berne compliance we may also have to add a few rights proposed but not accepted in the 1976 revision the ultimate political question may become whether or not the country is prepared to accept copyright notions that were unacceptable scarely a decade ago copyright experts disagree on the extent to which we have to change current copyright law whatever the case none of these experts has testified before my subcommittee i look forward to giving them this opportunity in the very near future serious issues must be confronted for example adherence to berne will require the elimination of the formality of the copyright notice and perhaps more importantly will preclude the future conditioning of the existence of the authors copyright upon any sort of formality many will feel this to be a just and longoverdue step some will have doubts everyone must consider however whether the elimination of such formalities upsets the balance of rights and privileges copyright proprietors now live under and of which formalities have long been a part berne also appears to require some modification of the compulsory license for the public performance of music on socalled jukeboxes finally the moral rights section of the bill will engender lively debate in order to examine the berne issue with some specificity i am proposing a bill that would if enacted clearly place unitedstates law in substantial compliance with the provisions of the treaty my bill errs on the side of legislating compliance with berne rather than remaining silent on the issues during the hearing process the subcommittee we will learn whether all of the proposed amendments are necessary and desirable whether the treaty compels other changes as well and whether adherence to the treaty is worth the price the proposed legislation clearly proceeds upon the presumption that the berne convention is not selfexecuting and requires implementing legislation there is as well serious doubt as to whether copyright treaties such as the berne convention are constitutionally susceptible of selfexecution in any event under article i section 8 of the constitution the power to enact this nations copyright and patent laws is allocated exclusively to the congress and this power is not diminished or qualified by any potential executive authority to conclude international copyright arrangements under which all or part of those benefits are extended to foreign nationals and their works let me now turn to a description of the bill it contains 16 sections section 1 of the bill sets forth the short title the berne convention implementation act of 1987 section 2 provides for drafting clarity that whenever in the proposed legislation an amendment is expressed in terms of an amendment to a section or other provision the reference shall be considered to be made to a section or other provision of title 17 united states code section 3 sets forth several congressional declarations including first that the berne convention is not self executing under the constitution and laws of the united states second that the proposed legislation together with current law will enable the united states to meet its obligations as a nation adhering to the berne convention and no further legislation will be needed and third the provisions of berne shall be given effect under title 17 united states code as amended and shall not be directly enforceable in any action brought pursuant to the provisions of the berne convention itself in section 4 the bill would modify chapter 1 of 17 it would add definitions of architectural works berne convention and berne convention work to section 101 in the same section the definition of pictorial graphic and sculptural works is modified expressly to exclude architectural works in section 5 section 102 a is amended to add architectural works to the list of types of copyrighted works although an aspect of the berne convention not examined with serious scrutiny by any group the protection of architectural works appears to be required by the berne convention in a fashion not now fully available under title 17 specifically while rights holders in twodimensional architectural plans or blueprints may enjoy copyright protection in such works as considered pictorial works such a copyright has not extended to the exclusive right to control the building of the structure so depicted in three dimensions the right of an architect to control the construction of his or her work is therefore given a basis in our copyright act by these amendments section 6 of the bill relates to the national origin of berne convention works it amends section 104 of title 17 in two ways protection for foreign works is explicitly extended to berne convention works and the proscription against selfexecution is codified this letter codification is fundamental to the entire question of implementing legislation and of adherence to the convention it should be absolutely clear that all copyright rights available in courts in the united states must be found exclusively within the provisions of title 17 it should also be clear that state law rights that are not preempted by section 301 are not affected in any way by this legislation or by berne adherence section 7 sets forth a major change in chapter 1 of the copyright act this change is found in a new section 106a the moral rights of the author section this section creates important berne rights in works other than works made for hire the rights of paternity and integrity are provided and are independent of the economic rights in the work the right of paternity means that authors may claim authorship in their works independently of any license or conveyance of their copyrights the right of integrity gives them power to object to any distortion mutilation or alteration of their works that would prejudice the authors honor or reputation"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "11 years ago in an act of supreme cynicism and political viciousness the united nations general

think that anything in this bill is any more important than how we are going to finance our deficit and how we are going to finance our national debt and that is in the section that addresses the primarydealer status and which prohibits equal access to other governments few members of the house i suspect are even familiar with the term primary dealers however basically they are the principals in the distribution and redistribution systems of government bonds here or in other countries that buy and sell directly with the central banks as such participants in the system they are integral to the management of the monetary supply systems billions of dollars flow through unitedstates primary dealers every day they are indeed the basis by which we finance the whole deficit in some cases a primary securities dealer in united states bonds might be a nonunited states national such as japan or canada or the united kingdom indeed what has given rise to the provisions in this bill in the

back we passed a fifra bill through this house three times in the last congress in the last days of the last congress a very fragile compromise had been reached i will have to admit this specific issue was not addressed but we had a fifra bill so those who say we have not had a fifra bill are simply incorrect now let me go to the question of who gets or who could get money this is not an automatic payment there are steps that you have to go through to be able to receive compensation that is true for a farmer with one barrel a retailer with thousands of barrels or whoever has the pesticide i ask again what happens to that toxic chemical that has been suspended to protect the health and safety of the american people it is not like others have said a bottle of aspirin that is bad you can simply throw the aspirin away that is the difference those who are looking only at the money issue for whatever reason are wrong wrong wrong these are dangerous pesticides that our government has said should not be used and have to be disposed of adequately and safely we got involved in this situation so that the farmer does not dump the suspended pesticide in the nearest creek so that the retailer does not take it to the city dump so that the chemical manufacturer does not improperly dispose of the pesticide this is what we are talking about safety the protection of wildlife the protection of water and the health and safety of american citizens when the manufacturer put the product on the market it was legal when the retailer bought it it was legal when the farmer bought it it was legal it was after the fact that epa ruled under fifra that this chemical cannot and should not be used we have no problem and no quarrel with that decision the question is how do you proceed from there the congress in its wisdom decided in 1972 that the best way would be for the government to pay the costs unless you want to have the army corps of engineers or epa or someone collect it all and see that it is adequately disposed of but much is being said about how companies like chevron got so many millions of dollars but the money is to ensure that the product can be adequately and safely retrieved and disposed of under proper supervision"], [0.009782969951629639, 0.5097829699516296, 1, "i thank the gentleman from illinois i yield to the gentleman from
