such time as i may consume i rise in support of h r 4394 the comprehensive onecall notification act of 1994 this bill addresses the need for nationwide minimum standards for onecall notification systems the purpose of these systems is to enable excavators to make one phone call to determine the location of any underground facilities the onecall center then notifies any underground facility operators who axe responsible for locating and marking their facilities thereby greatly reducing the risk of damaging an underground facility the natural gas pipeline explosion that occurred in edison ny last march was caused by excavation damage often referred to as thirdparty damage and it demonstrates the need for federal attention to this matter fortynine states currently have some sort of onecall system in place although the scope of coverage and level of participation varies from state to state it is the goal of h r 4394 to improve and enhance each states program to provide the greatest amount of protection to underground facilities including natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines fiber optic cables electric cables etc digging near such underground facilities can result in injury or death to the excavator and destruction of property surrounding the excavation site by reducing the risk of excavation damage that occurs as a result of not knowing where underground facilities are buried this legislation will not only help protect those facilities but will also help save the lives of excavators and those living in the vicinity of the excavation site h r 4394 takes as a step closer to ensuring the safety and reliability of underground facilities excavators and the public in general all that is required of states is that they formally consider the federal program that is outlined in the bill and make a determination as to whether or not it is an appropriate system for their state this legislation does nothing to undermine the efforts of the 49 states with existing onecall programs instead it encourages improvement and gives the states the needed flexibility to develop programs that are consistent with the individual needs of each state the secretary is authorized to award grants to states that either adopt the federal program or certify that their program is at least as protective of public health and safety as the federal program the bill also directs the secretary to develop a model program that will be used for education and promotion of the onecall system this model will be developed and amended at yearly dot workshops and will include participation by underground facility operators excavators federal state and local governments onecall system representatives and industry i would like to thank my colleagues mr pallone and

on the floor over the past 9 hours from various members i find it quaint indeed but not at all surprising that the only objections made to projects which were protected by the committee on rules in the way which the gentleman finds outrageous are to projects in the districts of democrats i find no such outrage expressed by the fact that those same rules protect a number of projects in the

districts one of those projects is in the district of one of the republicans sitting on the floor now now i would suggest that if the gentleman is going to express moral outrage that he target it in a balanced way to targets on both sides of the aisle this is the first time i have taken the floor on this bill i had not intended to take it at all the fact is that there are going to be literally hundreds of projects that come through this house in bills ranging from this bill to the defense appropriation bill and if we are going to be officious and nitpicking about the stage in which some of those projects are and if we are going to have selective amendments offered from that side of the aisle to eliminate only projects in democratic districts then i suggest to you that there are going to be a lot of amendments offered from this side of the aisle eliminating projects which are similarly not authorized on that side of the aisle i do not think that is the way the game ought to be played i think the committees have a right to make a judgment about whether or not a project is meritorious or not regardless of whether it is located in a republican district or a democratic district no congress has ever changed any presidents budget by more than 3 percent that 3percent difference is what makes a president and not a king i make absolutel no apologies for the fact that the congress on occasion exercises judgment and approves an occasional project which has not yet made it through the authorizing process even though in the end most of them probably will but i just note with great interest the partisan selectivity of the amendments before us on the floor tonight and in theinterests of avoiding partisan nastiness on bills to come i would urge members to recognize that if those targets are going to be exclusively on the democratic side of the aisle there are going to be a lot of targets on the republican side of the aisle when the coming bills come to the house floor"],
