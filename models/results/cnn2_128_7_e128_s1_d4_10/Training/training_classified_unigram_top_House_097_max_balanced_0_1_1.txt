been making very appropriate comments on the floor of this house as has the gentleman from texas whose subcommit tee has been working very actively in this area it was just 4 years ago that president jimmy carter told the american people the social security system was in dire financial trouble and that the only workable solution was the largest tax increase in the peacetime history of the nation soon after the enactment of those tax increases in december of 1977 the carter administration officials reported to the congress that the new taxes put the systems retirement and disability trust funds on sound footing until the early part of the 21st century well it is clear today that the heavy tax burden imposed in 1977 was not the answer the social security system is in deeper trouble now than it was just 4 years ago and the problems are many and complex it is imperative that we all understand them before truly workable solutions can be found since social security was enacted nearly 50 years ago it has grown far beyond the intent of those who created it during the great depression major additions to the system were made in 1939 1956 1960 and 1965 through the enactment of survivor benefits disability benefits college benefits vocational training early retirement and medicare today social security is as much a welfare program as it is an insurance program it is an economic drain on the country and an unreliable reservoir for the needy it is without a doubt virtually on the brink of collapse as my colleague just alluded to the facts are clear when social security became law in 1935 the maximum tax imposed on business and industrial workers was just 30 today the maximum tax is 1 975 in 1950 the program served 2 million people at a cost of 522 million today it provides assistance for 36 million people at a cost of 175 billion to finance social security in 1935 there were 11 adults in the labor force for every 1 person 65 years or older today there are only three workers for every one on retirement in the social security system by the year 2020 the ratio will be 2 to 1 in other words two people working for every one on some form of retirement it is the younger age group no longer growing as rapidly as before which is having to pay an even larger tax as a means of providing for the benefit of those who have reached age 62 and beyond when social security was enacted the life expectancy of the average american was 61 years of age now today it is 73 2 years those who do reach the age of 65 can expect to live an additional 14 years for males and 18 4 years for females which suggests that the burden the obligation on the part of the social security system is far beyond because of life expectancy what was ever originally conceived today despite the massive tax increases imposed 4 years ago social security benefits are far outstripping the revenues that are coming in the reagan administration has estimated that under current conditions the retirement and survivors portion of the system which is the heart of the system will go broke by next fall unless we take action now the problem is twofold first we must immediately take steps to make sure the system doca not run out of money next year or the year after second we must provide now for longterm reforms in the program that will prevent those sporadic crisis from reoccurring and we must find these solutions without looking toward even higher taxes the reagan administration has proposed a series of changes which it believes will resolve the financial crisis however these proposals are by no means the fhial word i am firmly convinced that the administration is willing even anxious to work with the congress on alternative solutions if they prove more effective i am convinced that one reason the reagan administration proposals were introduced was for the purpose of starting a national public debate on the issue of the systems financing and attracting the publics attention to the pending social security crisis we all face while i do not necessarily agree with all the changes proposed by the administration i do believe that president reagan exercised courage and foresight in addressing these critical problems directly and openly it is reassuring to me to have a president who is willing to face controversial issues forthrightly and not shy away from the political consequences of a spirited public debate if nothing else he has moved the congress and the nation to some action and that is the meaning of political leadership the list of alternative solutions and i would emphasize again the alternatives to the problems we face is lengthy the congress has a wealth of proposals from which to select among them are first revisions in the formula for the disbursement of disability benefits including the application of worker compensation benefits and a longer waiting period prior to eligibility for benefits second elimination of future student aid benefits or a reduction in those benefits third a gradual elevation of the full retirement age from 65 to 68 between now and the year 2000 or beyond but if the retirement age is increased it would not be done immediately but gradually over a transition period fourth elimination of vocational rehabilitation funding fifth alterations in the computation of the costof living allowances or a delay in those payments i made mention earlier of how this member along with mel laird a former member of this house and secretary of defense and jack betts who was our ranking republican on the social security subcommittee for three congresses introduced legislation for years with no action until we finally got the congress to move to prcvide for costofliving indexes pegged to the consumer price index but at the time we enacted that we did not conceive of inflation rates hitting the doubledigit range certainly not for several years running in my opinion if inflation does not come down if we are locked into that kind of inflation rate there really ought to be a twotrack system for that costofliving computation but the president and the administration feel and i would like to support them in this view that inflation rates will subside that when it comes back down to something more reasonable and normal then of course there need not be a change in that costofliving computation as a matter of fact the president specifically said in his campaign and again within the last week or so that under no circumstances would the 36 million people currently on social security have a diminution in their benefit that he was locked into preserving that benefit which they had earned sixth now we could include the 21 million federal workers including members of the congress in the social security system here again there are arguments pro and con those who oppose it say we are going to wipe away that federal retirement system and deny someone a benefit i say here again we will not do it immediately if we move in that direction there will be a transition period the carrot for the federal workers would be that the social security benefit on the bottom is nontaxable and the retirement benefit is taxable so there is a benefit to be derived there why not have federal workers and members of the congress treated like every other citizen as a base in the social security system in the private sector you have a pension plan if your company is providing one in the federal service if you want a benefit over social security there would be that kind of ongoing program but we would work it in in a transition period over the outyears seventh provision for the transfer of funds from one fund to the other the system currently operates with three separate funds retirement and survivor disability and medicare eighth financing of the medicare portion in whole or in part through general tax revenues and the shifting of medicare funds to the retirement and survivors account that is an option i certainly do not support that but there are those who would move in that direction ninth financing of the entire system through general tax revenues there are proposals to do that i would argue against it when the time comes but it is an option tenth a reduction in the percentage of benefits received by those taking early retirement at the age of 62 with a gradual increase in the percentage between the ages of 62 and 65 in this regard when we made this change in 1962 we did not perceive that there were going to be as many people retiring at an early age as there are today in those days we were talking about maybe a wife being somewhat ill not up to par or a husband for whatever reason wanting to take that option of retiring at 62 instead of but today you have 70 percent of the people retiring on social security availing themselves of the early option and why not they are just looking at the figures last year we increased the costofliving payment by 14 percent this year we are going to increase it 11 percent if things do not improve drastically it will be 10 percent next year social security benefits are going up faster than wages and they are tax free so no wonder people want to retire early so times have changed from when we originally changed the law to promay 2l 1981 vide for early retirement let me say that there la a lot of erroneous information circulating regarding the administrations proposal in this regard the impression seems to be that everyone retiring before age 65 will automatically receive only 55 percent of their regular benefits in actuality for every month beyond his or her 62d birthday that one waits to retire his benefit would increase by 1v4 percent so if one decided to retire at the age of 63 years the benefit level would be 70 percent if he decided to retire at the age of 63 years and 11 months it would be 63 percent so it is not an absolute reduction from 80 percent to 55 but a graduation by month as a means of trying to discourage people from retiring early i will be inserting a table in the record at the conclusion of my remarks which shows this monthbymonth breakdown now here again we can make a change in the law but we do not have to make it immediate admittedly it would be unfair to people nearing their 62d birthday and are planning to retire then to suddenly change the rules but for people down the road a way yet a change could be taken into account in formulating their retirement plans i think there is a transition period here that could be taken into account and it could be worked out now these are just some of the alternatives being talked about many experts are talking about others including a change in the basic formula for the determination of retirement benefits others are discussing variations of the 10 which i have alluded to here i personally am of the opinion that all the alternatives should be explored in depth but that one important criteria for such consideration ought to be observed i do not believe the congress should or will enact any legislation that creates a hardship for those senior citizens who are depending on the social security system as their pri mary means of support puthermore the congress should not consider legislation that will jeopardize those who have already based their plans in the near future on the benefits available under the current retirement system it would be unconscionable for the congress to pull the rug out from under those individuals and families who are economically locked into retirement years that depend on benefits derived from the social security system it is only fair and just that we provide for changes that give all americans the time and the opportunity to adjust to those changes the crises facing the social security system can be met they can be overcome without damaging the basic fabric of the system and without going back on a 50year commitment this nation has to its senior citizens it can be done if we all work together deliberately openly and honestly and exercise the courage any difficult decision demands"], [6.407499313354492e-05, 0.49993592500686646, 0, "madam
