decades and it iso is a controlled giowth it is a growth that hag not gotten out of hanhd mr speaker it is a growth that grows frbm 3 to 4 7 percent quarter afi 6ei quarter with an inflation rate that is 2 percent or less and unemployment rates that are in the 5 percent and less range that is where we want not too hot and not too cold a nice steady accountable growth and i would point out this that growth that we have in our economy is growing in spite of the fact that 3 5 percent perhaps of our gdp is going off the top to the litigation that goes on in this country we have to overcome that and still grow at a rate of about 3 to 3 5 percent to match a targeted growth rate that will deal with population growth and to deal with inflation and help us develop our infrastructure in this country to accommodate the future as our infrastructure depreciates that is what it is going to take to grow and what it is going to take to balance the budget should we have the will to do that would be to go into the nondefense discretionary spending recognizing that we have three large entitlements in our budget and those are the spending that just goes on year after year that is growing at a rate of about 6 2 percent a year and that is aggregate and that is social security medicare and medicaid those three entitlements are essentially unless we change some of the larameters are the right now the un touchable budget items and eventually this congress will have to look at them but those three entitlements will grow at about 6 2 percent of their aggregate the interest rate will grow perhaps even faster than that in the outyears you add all those things up and if you recognize that to make changes in that for this year is very difficult to do and also recognizing that we have defense spending that is critical to our national security and we need to take that off the table from a cut perspective and what is left is the nondefense discretionary spending that is the items of all everything else that we spend that i have not identified as being an entitlement of social security medicare medicaid defense spending that nondefense discretionary spending we will call that other to balance the budget we would need to simply cut the nondefense discretionary spending by 5 percent areal 5 percent cut and that would be 0 95 on the dollar that would be asking americans to get along with 0 95 out of every dollar that they have right now today not grow in relation to inflation and not grow with any kind of a cola now if i were looking at this from a business perspective i would advocate that we just simply balance our budget in that fashion but i am also aware that the votes on the floor of this congress will rot accommodate for that so i will be seeking to put together a budget that looks at some of the other components and gets us to the point where we can reasonably practically and in fact part of the equation here is politically balance this budget it cannot and should not be done by simply raising taxes by doing so it would stifle growth and it would get a reverse effect beyond in the opposite direction that my colleagues who just got finished speaking would say i am just going to go backwards through some of the remarks that i heard made over this past hour and address some of them i certainly cannot address them all but the argument that all of the money that was spent all this is a quote all that money is wasted meaning the money that was spent for reconstruction in iraq all wasted with no oversight no oversight mr speaker i take exception to a statement such as that i went over to iraq with three of my colleagues last august and returned here about august 20 with the very mission in mind to take a look at where the 18 5 billion that we allocated out of this congress had been spent where the practices were where the projects were how the money was being spent and what was the return on that investment and i brought a chart along with me coincidentally not knowing that would be the subject matter that was brought up here on the other side of the aisle this evening a chart that illustrates where these project dollars have gone i would point out that these red dots on this map of iraq represent 2 200 more than 2 200 completed projects in iraq and these projects will be road projects they will be sewer projects water drinking water potable water projects they will also be some bridge projects and some pipeline work for the oil pipe lines that are there you will see along on this border with iran the red dots along there many of those are border defense stations and what you will not see are the 250 planned border defense stations that are under construction or in planning around these othei borders that we have there is another 1 100 projects that are either in planning or under construction that do not show up yet on this chart i will have a chart that reflects the projects that are planned the projects that are started then this one reflects just the projects that are completed over 2 200 and i visited a number of these of course it would not be possible to visit them in their entirety but i stopped up here in this region around kirkuk and there went to the mother of all generators i forget just how many kilowatts that generator does put out but i remember what it weighed 750 000 pounds brought in on two large loads and then the other loads would be the rest of the generating plant across about 10 7 kilometers excuse me it was more than that it was a long stretch at least across the northern part of iraq with that kind of a long trail ofa convoy to deliver the generator and the turbine that drives that generator down to this location just south of kirkuk and that being one of two huge generation plants that are now in a position where they are up and running in iraq this one is fed by a natural gas pipeline some of them are using different types of fuel but up in this area around kirkuk there is so much oil that it actually seeps to the top of the ground in some places where i come from the area we call it the prairie pothole region where we have these potholes of water that are collected because of the dips that are cut out in the prairie from the last glacier well the water that collects there reminds me of the oil and certainly the oil is in smaller quantities that collects in the depressiois within the desert up there around kirkuk i and that is not the largest oil location up around kirkuk but down here in the southern part in the basra region there is far more oil and i look at the system of collection the well system the collection system the refinery system distribution system all of it is old tired dilapidated has not been reconstructed or modernized in at least 35 years and yet the oil production out of iraq is greater than it was we keep hearing no they are not producing as much oil now as they were then not true the royalties that iraq was receiving prior to the war were 5 billion a year the royaltiesthat are coming from the oil that is pumping today are 26 billion a year that does not necessarily reflect that they are pumping five times as much oil but it reflects that they are selling perhaps more oil than they did then and pumping more oil than they did the electricity that is being generated in iraq is anumber that is close to twice as much electricity at their peak days as it was on a standard day in iraq at the beginning of the liberation back in march of 2003 and as i measure project after project benefit after benefit it cannot be said that and i will quote again all that money is wasted how could all that money be wasted when we have 2 200 completed projects 3 300 projects altogether people that have potable water that never had it before people that have flush toilets that did not flush before they did not have water to flush in them looking at the infrastructure that is there in places in baghdad where they had the sanitary sewer and i would point out for the lay person listening that a sanitary sewer is not really all that sanitary that is what you run your sewage through and yet that sewer was an easy place for some people to pull a waterline through in those days before the ltberation of baghdad so their drinking water in many areas was delivered through a black piece of plastic pipe that was pulled through the sewer itself and they would pull it through and then the distribution runs out to the locations where it was being used and that is all fine as long as you keep your waterline in condition and it does not ever get a leak in it and you do not ever let the pressure go down but both of those things invariably happen and when that happens the pressure goes down in your drinking waterline and the sewage then is drawn into that drinking waterline and it then pollutes the drinking water that has happened in a number of areas in baghdad we are reconstructing that we are providing them with clean new sanitary sewer systems and sewer plants to be able to handle their systems in a modern fashion and an environmentally friendly fashion so the iraqi people that were living without services now have services i will say that the electrical service that was up to 10 11 perhaps even 12 hours a day in baghdad at the beginning of the liberation is down to less than that now perhaps even as low as 4 to 6 hours a day but the rest of iraq was getting 2 to 4 hours a day and now they are up to 10 11 12 hours of electricity a day the next wave is to increase the generation capacity and the distribution so that baghdad can get back up again to a level that they were before but overall there is more electricity being provided into iraq today than there ever was the demand is perhaps twice as great as it was because you know what happens when people get electricity they figure out a way that they can put another appliance to work and plug it into a wall and use it like air conditioners that did not exist in any significant numbers now they are there in significant numbers tapped into that electricity we also know that satellite televisions were against the law in march of 2003 and today iraq is replete with satellite dishes onrooftop after rooftop in fact i did a survey from the air by helicopter over the top of a region up in kirkuk where many homes were built in about the same style and i had done so over the rooftops of mosul in the fall of 2003 and there my survey showed that about twothirds of the homes then already had satellite tvs and now iam seeing that in some of the neighborhoods in kirkuk there actually are more satellite dishes than there are roofs so you will see sometimes two or even three satellite dishes on a single roof that look like they are singlefamily dwellings from the air everyone in iraq has access to satellite tv which means access to the outside world there is access to internet cell phones those things have grown dramatically landline telephones have grown dramatically the number of newspapers are up to over 175 newspapers in iraq television stations up and running communication is flowing free enterprise is robust in the streets of baghdad people that are running shops out there making furniture out alongside the streets set it out on the side of the street and sell it and yes a bomb goes off once in a while and it is sad and it is tragic but the people of iraq clean things up and they grieve and they go back to work because they are optimistic about the future of iraq they are more optimistic about the future of iraq than the surveys show people are in the united states of america what went wrong her6 where people that we say do not have hope have more hope than those of us folks that have the great blessing of living in the united states of america with all of this hope that we take for granted and cannot apparently appreciate so the effort that has been put forth there it is not all that money that is being wasted not by a long shot mr speaker 3 300 projects all of them worthy and worthwhile and no they were not all cheap there was money that was spent for security and there were some projects that were sabotaged that had to be reconstructed again there is a project over here on the tigris river south of kirkuk where there were nine pipelines that went across the tigris river and those pipelines were cut in the liberation operations with the unitedstates air force and we went back to patch those pipelines together did so they were sabotaged again they were put across the river on a bridge and so we undertook the effort to put them all underneath the bottom of the tigris river they are backfilling that now and it is nearly completed and those lines will be opened up and running by i believe the target date is february 28 so another big day to turn those valves on and get that oil flowing south into parts where it can be converted back to cash and be able to help the funding in the great country of iraq this emerging free arab country that has now at least brought forth the name of a prime minister and i do not think formally has elected him yet but on that day that that happens and they seek this duly elected parliament iraq becomes the most representative arab nation in the world when they sit down at the united nations and their representative speaks on behalf of the iraqi people it will truly be a voice of the iraqi people quite unlike the voice of much of the rest of the arab world where the voicethat speaks for the countries that represent those parts of the arab world in the united nations often is the voice of a tyrant that would cut the tongues out of its oin citizens if they spoke up in criticism of the regime that is there in many of those countries but this country can become the lodestar of a free arab people an inspiration to the rest of the arab world an that is a chilling concept but it also inspiration that can cause the rest of should tell us that there is no negothem to see what iraq is stepping into tiated settlement we must defend ourwhat they are earning along with the selves the israelis have had to guard coalition forces efforts and sacrifice to every theater every bus stop every be able to be that inspiration for the hospital every school every synarest of the arab world and if that day gogue and still the infiltrators come in comes and i pray it comes mr speak and detonate their bombs and blow er we may well see freedom echo their women and children to pieces across the arab world in the same fash that happens out of a deep hatred ion that it echoed across eastern eu that we dont understand in this counrope when the wall went down in ber try and i dont claim to understand it lin november 9 1989 on that glorious but i know that hatred is directed at day that symbolized the end of the us we saw it september 11 we saw it cold war a victory for the united on 18 to 20 other attacks including the states and the forces of freedom uss cole we saw it in the unitedstates emand the forces of freedom could not bassy bombings in africa we have seen be stopped almost the first attack also on the twin towbloodlessly they echoed across eastern ers in other efforts shut off by good ineurope and we saw country after coun telligence work in this country try be liberated we cannot rest our choices though are guard every theater every bus 0 2320 stop every school every hospital since that time we have noticed every church every synagogue and pull that those who knew freeddm the least back into the shores of the united hungered for it the most the people on states and somehow think that we can the east side of the wall stepped up to protect every center in this country help all of our efforts our coalition and we wont be able to and we will see forces in iraq in greater numbers than the attacks come and we will see our the people on the west side of the wall women and children and our men blown the people on the west side of the into pieces wall had the privilege of living with or we can take this battle to them freedom since the end of world war 11 we can fight this war where they are the people on the east side of the wall but going out just to kill the enemy remember the days they werent free mr speaker isnt enough it is not a they remember the day of november 9 solution it is something that has to be 1989 when they had that opportunity done in certain areas of the world and to grasp their own freedom and within under those circumstances where there a couple of years that freedom did echo are training camps and active leaders across eastern europe and it needs to that are plotting and planning to atecho across the arab world tack and kill americans that must be so i submit that there done is a vision and mission in this overall but to go out and think that we war on terror and we need to do a far could kill all of our enemies is the better job of articulating why we are in equivalent of realizing that we had a this war i would point out that the lot of flies on our porch and in our loss of americans on september 11 was kitchen and then go out to the barn right at 3 000 americans that is more with the fly swatter and think we are americans lost there than was lost de going to take care of all those flies in cember 7 1941 in that day that would the barn with the fly swatter no you live in infamy can swat flies in the barn all day every we cannot forget september 11 we day and you will never accomplish the cannot forget that we were attacked task you have got to change the habiwithout cause we didnt provoke any tat that breeds that many flies you one who attacked us they attacked us have to clean the barn because they hate our way of life they and you need to leave an environment attacked the very center of western in there that doesnt breed those flies civilization and then they will leave you alone on and no amount of negotiation un the porch and in your kitchen as well derstanding no amount of sitting so i submit that the plan of the around and talking is ever going to re united states and the mission that has solve this disagreement these people been laid out by our commanderinwant us dead they have demonstrated chief president bush is to create a new that and we saw the celebrations in habitat to promote a new habitat in the streets in other parts of the world the region this is a habitat called as the twin towers fell that should freedom we happen to know that tell us that they will give us no quar where there is freedom there isnt a ter habitat that breeds terrorists we have if anyone doubts that take a look at never gone to war against another free israel take a look and see the cir people it has never happened in the cumstanoes there when the israelis history of this country and i dont thought they could trade land for think it has actually happened in the peace and yet they are still attacked history of the world hamas won the election there that so to the extent that freedom can be means the terrorists the people who promoted and we give people that opare sworn to annihilate the land of portunity to reach out and grasp and israel are running the government of earn their own freedom is also the exthe region that may or may not be a tent to which we can be safer as a peonation called palestine ple western civilization can be safer and the people in that part of the world can learn some tolerance for christianity for judaism for capitalism for free enterprise for this whole idea of western civilization that they seem to take such exception to there are good people in that part of the world and those good people need to be empowered and we need to be supportive bf them the allegations that were made here on the other side of the aisle about corruption in iraq with millions of unitedstates dollars we dont know that and i wont tell you that you can go into an environment with a 18 5 billion mission and spend every dollar that would be competitive with a project in the united states because i know that some of that money had to go for security and some of that money had to go for a high price to get the work done because who would go into that environment and do that work but that work was necessary and to the extent that anyone hag defrauded this government yes we need to search that out we need to have oversight but democrats in this congress are not absolved from that responsibility i did not hear a single solution come out here on the other side of the aisle not one all i saw was complaints lamentations objections because all things that go wrong are all republican responsibility according to the other side of the aisle and of course if they were just in power then everything would be all fine but we dont know what they would do because they havent proposed a solution not a single specific solution they are absolutely without an agenda but they have enough energy they have enough air velocity in their lungs to every night come down here and beat up on the people that are out here trying to move america ahead one statement was said that i will agree with

well and so are the majority of the american people who have seen to it that there is majority in charge in this congress we do have our work to do i wont shirk that responsibility i step up to it gladly but we need to have our eyes wide open we need to promote a responsible budget and i will be promoting a balanced budget and a path we can get to a balanced budget in a way that we can get the votes in this congress to get it done if we do that we can ensure financial security for our children and our grandchildren but that financial security that can come with fiscal responsibility here in

legal immigration system does not meet the needs of american employers lawful immigrants seeking residence in the unitedstates and families seeking to reunite and pursue the american dream and yet that does not need to be the case one of the main reasons we have a huge illegal immigration problem is that our legal immigration system just does not work we could be talking today about the widely recognized problems and debate comprehensive immigration reform but we will not do that today i am deeply troubled that this bill which would drastically alter our nations immigration laws was rushed to the house floor just a little more than a week after it was introduced and after only one committee hearing it was voted out on party lines on this key issue we should be able to work together immigration is not a republican or democratic issue it is truly an american issue the history of america is a history of immigration and immigrants from the first europeans to settle on our shores in places like jamestown and plymouth to the millions who were greeted by the statue of liberty and ellis island trying to flee hunger and poverty in the old world in search of a new life and a new start in america legal immigrants continue to this day to be a vital part of our social fabric and our economic growth i firmly believe in the necessity of legal immigration our country was founded on the principle of immigration and we are fortunate to have millions of hardworking lawabiding immigrants living in this country studies show that far from being a tax burden on us immigrants add billions of dollars to the unitedstates economy statistics also reveal that immigrants are likely to set up their own businesses which creates jobs for workers and sales opportunities for american companies it is important to recognize the many benefitseconomic and otherwisethat legal immigrants provide to our country however like many americans i am concerned about the influx of illegal immigrants into our country i believe the best answer to this problem is to comprehensively address our nations legal immigration system and to also fully and effectively enforce our immigration laws on the books but this bill focuses almost solely on new enforcement actions it is a piecemeal attempt to solve a much larger problem and it will end up jailing foreign citizens who come illegally into the united states and make all employers in the country deputy immigration officials these are not sensible solutions to the immigration problems that exist i strongly believe that we need to secure both our southern and northern borders it is also imperative to secure our seaports and airports but we also need to acknowledge and deal with the fact that an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants hide in the shadows of our country this bill simply ignores them and tries to fool the public into thinking that real changes are being made to secure our borders over the last 20 years congress has passed into law 17 different immigrationrelated pieces of legislation but a clear problem still remains rather than seriously doing something about immigration the congress has passed politically expedient but not policybased legislation it is clear that the immigration and nationality act ina needs dramatic changes and the american people have continually called for such changes the ina needs to be updated to meet the labor shortages that american employers face it needs also to be fundamentally altered in how it handles foreignborn workers too often the ina is more complex and arcane than even the irs tax code this leaves businesses citizens and prospective immigrants confused and unsure of what to do in my central new jersey district alone this means that i have more than one fulltime employee to help the citizens and residents of my district navigate these laws and the outofcon trol bureaucracy they have created this bill is extreme and will not fix these arcane rules and procedures and it will certainly fail to do what it promises this bill requires the department of homeland security to detain all illegal immigrants who enter the united states until they can be returned to their country of origin yet the bill does nothing to provide dhs with facilities or capacity to do just that dhs will not be able to meet this flawed expectation and it will prove to be an untenable burden on an already overextended detention system the bill also creates a new employment eligibility verification system eevs based on a small previously existing pilot program this would require all employers to check their employees work status this essentially deputizes employers as immigration officers and forces an undue burden on them to do the governments work currently employers are already required to check the work documents of all of their employees the gao has estimated that this new provision alone will push an unfunded mandate on employers of close to 12 billion a year this simply is not a practical solution this bill is strongly opposed by a broad range of organizations such as unitedstates chamber of commerce american immigration lawyers association american nursery landscape association catholic charities usa associated builders and contractors united auto workers and even the u n high commissioner for refugees this broad coalition of organizations and interest groups understands that this is not a solution to our existing immigration problem and in fact may exacerbate the problem i urge my colleagues to oppose this bill and to seriously and comprehensively address the important issue of immigration i"], [0.00025588274002075195, 0.5002558827400208, 1, "i was unavoidably delayed on rollcall no 456 had i been present i would

voting rights act has a proud and important legacy in my yime state of georgia and across the united states with minor changes that would modernize the voting rights act and better reflect the reality of what is happening in the 21st century i would be joining many of my colleagues in voting yes today but the bill we have before us is fatally flawed this rewrite is outdated unfair and unconstitutional i cannot support it in its current form this rewrite treats georgia as if nothing changed in the past 41 years in other words this rewrite seems based on the assumption that the voting rights act hasnt worked as a georgian who is proud of our tremendous progress and proud of our current record of equality i am here to report to my colleagues in the house that the voting rights act has worked in my state and now it is time to modernize the law to deal with the problems of today not yesteryear it is true when the voting rights act was first passed in 1965 georgia needed federal intervention to correct decades of discrimination now 41 years later georgias record on voter equality can stand up against any other state in the union today black georgians are registered to vote at higher percentages than white georgians and black georgians go to the polls in higher percentages than white georgians onethird of our statewide elected officials are african americans including our attorney general and the chief justice bf our supreme court plus african american representation in the state legislature closely mirrors their representation in georgias population but dont just take my word for it on georgias progress listen to this ringing endorsement from my colleague from georgia congressman john lewis an icon of the civil rights movement under oath in federal court 5 years ago congressman lewis testified there has been a transformation its a different state its a different political climate its a different political environment its altogether a different world we live in weve come a great distance its not just in georgia but in the american south i think people are preparing to lay down the burden of race if he said that under oath sworn to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth why is he telling the house something different today the reason he was under oath was because he was testifying in front of the department of justice that it was okay for the majorityminority districts in georgia to be diluted in direct violation of the voter rights act my other friend from georgia congressman scotr voted for that though it defies common sense this rewrite of the voting rights act gives no consideration to any changes that may have occurred since the first law was passed in 1965 the house is voting today to keep my state in the penalty box for 25 years based on the actions of the people who are now dead by the end of this renewal georgia will have been treated by federal law as a bad actor for 66 years to put that in perspective 66 years ago fdr was in his second term and the japanese were more than a year away from bombing pearl harbor by passing this rewrite of the voting rights act congress is declaring from on high that states with voting problems 40 years ago can simply never be forgiven that georgians must eternally wear the scarlet letter because of the actions of their grandparents and greatgrandparents we have repented and we have reformed and now as fannie lou hamer famously said i am sick and tired of being sick and tired lastly this renewal is unconstitutional in 1966 the supreme court of the united states ruled that section 5 of the voting rights act the section that singles out certain states for federal oversight was constitutional only because it was narrowly tailored to fix a specific problem and temporary you dont have to have a law school degree to know that this rewrite of the voting rights act fails both of those tests at 41 years we are already way past temporary and the application of section 5 is now arbitrary because this house cannot present evidence of extraordinary continuing statesponsored discrimination in the covered states that is different from the rest of the nation as such section 5 has served its purpose and is no longer an appropriate remedy in light of todays new voting problems the voting rights act represents a grand trophy of great accomplishment for congress but after 41 years the trophy needs dusting we could have given the trophy a new shine for a new century but sadly that didnt happen and still this bill states explicitly that my constituents cannot be trusted to act in good faith without federal supervision that assertion is as ignorant as it is insulting i cannot and will not support a bill that is

be alone in this time of great strain for her you want her to be able to confide in a brother or sister or clergyman or priest or rabbi or uncle or aunt or grandparent or a teacher and those people want to be able to help her now as i said before there may be room for legislation to say that you shouldnt take people across state lines for the purpose of getting an abortion for commercial purposes but to make a criminal out of anybody who is trying to help a young girl as they see helping her as she sees helping her because she cannot confidein her parents and especially if that helper may be the grandparent or the brother or the sister or a clergyman is simply wrong so this legislation is far too broad it will place young women who need help in a situation where they cannot get
