had been able to reach an agreement on the issue at hand but as that has not been possible im offering this amendment to strike section 301 a of the bill section 301 a would eliminate provisions included in the coast guard authorization of 2010 that i authored to establish an ombudsman in each coast guard district the district ombudsmen are intended to serve as liaisons between the coast guard and ports terminal operators ship owners and labor representatives the ombudsmen will enable these stakeholders to seek further review of disputes regarding the application of the coast guard regulations let me be clear that the provisions creating the ombudsman specifically provide that the district ombudsman shall not provide assistance with respect to a dispute unless it involves the impact of coast guard requirements on port business and the flow of commerce the provisions further clarify that in providing such assistance the district ombudsman shall give priority to complaints brought by petitioners who believe they will suffer a significant hardship as a result of implementing the coast guard requirement i authored the provisions creating the ombudsman at the request of the port community which approached me seeking another mechanism to engage with the coast guard to ensure that the application of regulations achieves critical safety and security objectives while having the least possible impact on commerce many members of congress and particularly those on the other side of the aisle profess that limiting the power of government and ensuring that businesses are not burdened by inappropriate regulations are among their top priorities given these priorities and given the need to ensure that regulations do not threaten commerce or jobs i am frankly quite deeply surprised that the majority would seek to eliminate a provision that specifically provides businesses with an avenue through which they can seek changes in regulatory decisions in an effort to improve their businesses let me also be clear that i understand that the coast guard has not yet appointed any ombudsmanand i know that the service would probably prefer never to appoint an ombudsman because they would prefer that their regulatory decisions not be challenged that said rather than eliminating the requirement that the coast guard appoint an ombudsman i believe that this authority should be implemented quickly to give businesses the opportunity to improve the application of coast guard regulations finally let me also explain that this provision does not require any new personnel to be hired the statutory language is clear and staff have reconfirmed with the coast guard that the position of ombudsman could be a collateral duty that a qualified staff member performs in addition to their other duties this is not my ideal arrangement but i raise this point so that it is clear that the implementation of this provision does not require the coast guard to hire new

ive sought to do in everything that weve done in the subcommittee since ive been on itis to really stress prevention because we can avoid people going to hospitals we can avoid people going to nursing
