unique moment in order to give a tax windfall to the wealthiest americans quite simply the republican proposal is unfair to the vast majority of taxpayers in my home state of michigan as well as across the nation according to the joint committee on taxation one out of every three families will receive no tax relief at all under this bill in addition citizens for tax justice estimate that families making between 38 000 and 63 000 will receive an average tax cut of 17 while families with annual incomes of 300 000 or more will get an average cut of 8 300 of course the decision to push this inequitable plan has opportunity costs while giving tax breaks to the rich the republican legislation does nothing to extend the solvency of the social security and medicare trust funds by even one day and will not allow for medicare reforms such as a comprehensive prescription drug benefit and restoring cuts to critical services such as home health care hospital reimbursements and nursing homes if we do not strengthen social security and medicare and pay down the national debt during good economic times we never will we must not squander this chance to put our fiscal house in order but

the first problem with this gop bill is that it severely shortchanges education by 3 5 billion this bill would end our commitment to hire 100 000 new teachers and to reduce class sizes i am concerned by the fact that this bill would eliminate head start for some 53 000 children and cut 1 3 billion for urgent repairs to schools across the country these are critical issues for my district and for many districts across the country this bill will also eliminate school counselors serving 100 000 children this action will deprive schools of the professionals they need to identify and help troubled children this bill also does considerable injustice to bilingual and immigrant education the amount included in the bill for programs addressing these issues is 54 million below the budget request the professional development of our bilingual education teachers is critically important the labor hhs and education bill in its current form provides an amount that is 28 5 million below the budget request for the important programs of bilingual education professional development the grants that are provided for the development of our teachers in bilingual education are needed to increase the pool of trained teachers and strengthen the skills of teachers who provide instruction to students who have limited english proficiency these funds support the training and retraining of bilingual teachers the disparities in minority education will be increased if this bill is passed secondly this bill severely shortchanges programs that assist displaced workers this is a major issue for my constituents in el paso as i know that it is for many of you in your home districts in el paso and in other areas along the unitedstates mexico border nafta has created many displaced workers and this

level these cuts will make it more difficult for these workers to find jobs this bill also cuts adult job training for almost 40 000 adults the cuts in adult training programs equal 93 million or 10

million homeless veterans in this country and the provisions in this bill will deny employment assistance to thousands of these americans who have faithfully served their country this is unacceptable

very necessary for example let us suppose that a jet plane which was a cargo plane had a particular type of cargo which had to be labeled cargo only and flown from one destination to another to arrive safely and the cargo they had in some cases were oxygen cannisters but let us suppose that cargo which happened to be oxygen cannisters was not labeled cargo only and ended up on a passenger plane it

is in it and i urge my colleagues to remember that we will probably be long after this bill is done we will be trying to find out what is in it there are nine separate authorizations i believe instead of having only 1 hour to debate all of those afthorizations plus the budgetary decisions that were made here in the bill before us today i believe each of those authorizations should be pulled out of the bill they should be debated separately and sequentially for at least an hour before we vote on each and every one of them secondly i think we should have had 24 hours to understand what is in this bill we are going to be haunted by a number of things that are in this bill among the authorizations that are added to this bill are the medicare medicaid and state childrens health insurance program which i probably favor but i think we ought to know more about how they are being put together second we have the admiral james w nance and meg donovan foreign relations authorizations act i do not have the foggiest idea what is in that and neither does anybody else on the floor we have h r 3428 which brings several dairy authorization measures to this floor including the northeast compact that

have the superfund recycling equity act this bill reminds me of what churchill said about russia a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma we do not have any idea what that bill is really going to do in the fine print then we have the canyon ferry reservoir provisions and international debt relief again which i favor but i am concerned very very concerned about one section of that bill which i think may not in fact deliver what it appears to promise then we have a number of private bills which have been attached one of which i think i would favor and the other which i am concerned about because it only includes a few people out of a much broader class that ought to be included in the kind of relief contemplated by that bill that is going to be given in my view every time i make a motion which requires a rollcall before we can proceed to the next stage that gives members more time to find out what is in this bill before they actually cast the most important vote of the session that is why i intend to make numerous motions today and i most definitely would not count on being out of here by 4 or 5 or maybe even today"], [0.000532686710357666, 0.5005326867103577, 1, "mr

that event members departments and multipleuse groups voiced their frustration about the possible closing of the rocky mountain research center for great plains ecosystem research located in rapid city in response to the concerns raised at the land use summit i introduced h r 4226 the funds authorized by this bill would help preserve important research positions and allow the rocky mountain research center to continue studying and addressing a range of wildlife issues on the regions grasslands and woodlands the research station plays an important role in helping manage the black hills national forest and grasslands the station which focuses on managing prairies to sustain livestock and wildlife has been instrumental in decisions affecting wood production and stream flows and in providing forage for livestock and wildlife species additionally and perhaps most importantly in light of the devastating fires that raged in the black hills region this summer the research station provides vital fire ecology research this bill contains two major provisions that address these important forest management and health needs for south dakota first h r 4226 authorizes the secretary of agriculture to sell or exchange certain lands owned by the forest service and to use the funds to acquire land in order to construct two administrative sites for the black hills national forest by allowing the black hills national forest to construct two new administrative facilities the forest service will be able to eliminate two leased offices which have an annual cost of 150 000 thereby consolidating four administrative sites into two additionally by allowing the sale or exchange of these lands the black hills national forest can increase efficiency and communications decrease public confusion over the location of administrative sites and make the black hills more visible and available to the over four million people that visit the area each year furthermore according to the forest service this bill will save the taxpayers an additional 109 000 in annual maintenance costs and 880 000 in deferred maintenance costs h r 4226 also contains a provision to protect private property owners from being forced to sell their land for the project second this bill authorizes 2 1 million to build a new research laboratory for the rocky mountain research center to be colocated with one of the new forest service administrative buildings authorizing the funds to build the new research laboratory is essential because the forest service has indicated it may close the research station if it does not have a new facility currently the stations laboratory needs major repairs is not handicap accessible does not meet osha regulations and is inadequate to support the units

by the congressional research service which would tell us 13 people a day have lost their jobs since july 1 1997 or some of the more larger numbers that we have heard on this floor where up to 1 steel worker every hour about 3 steelworkers today since this debate started have lost and continue to lose their jobs that is the issue those people their jobs their families we have heard a lot today

arkansas i am worried about a river valley on that globe the monvalley in the state of pennsylvania and i am worried about a place on that globe gary indiana because they have all suffered not through any fault of their own but the failure of this government to enforce the law of the land against illegallytraded steel the gentleman from michigan mentioned names and i think it is important that we not use statistics but real people because sherry ferguson from the state of illinois is unemployed today because of illegallytraded steel she has six children in her household tell her the crisis is over joey bishop from alabama has a 7yearold daughter at home let us tell joey bishops daughter that the crisis is over we are here today because the president has not acted in a sufficient fashion he has arrived at the game late and he has certainly not carried the day others suggest that the crisis is now resolved one speaker indicated that steel traded from japan is down 96 percent in the last 3 months and i would not argue that point here is how bad the problem was and still is from july 1997 to january 1999 six weeks ago japanese steel imports are still up 74 percent someone indicated that steel exports from korea are down i would point out that from july 1997 until january 1999 six weeks ago korean imports are still up 77 percent and for the same period of time imports from indonesia are up 890 percent i ask my colleagues is that because they are playing by every last rule of international law and not violating our trade laws i would suggest that is not true why are we here to take a global approach to put all of the countries and all of the products on the table because while some steel exports to the united states from some countries and for some product lines have
