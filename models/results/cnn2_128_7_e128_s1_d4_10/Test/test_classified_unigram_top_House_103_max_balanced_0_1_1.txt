educational fund where he was in constant battle against entrenched tradition and archaic laws that validated segregation in america mr marshalls rich experience as a civil rights advocate was expanded by his subsequent service as a judge of the unitedstates court of appeals for the second circuit and as unitedstates solicitor general few of the 4istinguished judsts who have ever served as justices brought to the court the wide experience and brilliant achievements of the first africanamerican appointed to the unitedstates supreme court by the time of his appointment he held an unequaled record of victories in arguments before the supreme court specifically thurgood marshall won 29 of 32 cases he argued before the highest court in the land for the hopeless and the helpless masses of unrepresented and underrepresented american citizens this rock of justice became widely recognized and respected for his efforts in bringing about the landmark decision in 1954 in brown versus board of education which rendered separate but equal education unconstitutional however we are reminded by the honorable robert l carter senior judge in the unitedstates district court for the southern district of new york and a friend and former colleague of thurgood marshall at the naacp that mr marshalls contribution to civil rights jurisprudence far extended his nofeworthy efforts in

we treat taiwan as an international their opinions and justice is better pariah for outdated reasons served not so the fed far from making its opinions public in 1976 the fomc stopped releasing complete minutes of its meetings the then chairman of the federal reserve arthur burns went as far as to testify that no detailed minutes would be taken after this time this testimony was intended to block freedom of information act and other requests from the congress press and public for detailed accountability for fomc discussions i found out on october 26 1993 that this statement was untrue the federal reserve in fact has maintained a 17year treasure trove of transcripts of its fomc meetings it was not easy to elicit this admission from federal reserve officials i had asked specifically in my letter of invitation that each of the federal reserve bank presidents and governors slated to appear before my committee on october 19 1993 independently dis close what they knew about the records being kept of fomc meetings my colleagues on october 15 4 days before they were to testify before the committee the fomc held one of two conference phone calls where they discussed their strategy for this upcoming hearing on january 13 1994 after long negotiations my staff listened to a tape and read the transcript from this call during this call many of the fomc members found out perhaps for the first time that the federal reserve has maintained 17 years of transcripts dating back to 1976 the year the fomc erroneously claimed it had stopped taking minutes of its meetings during the conference call participants indicated they were worried how this embarrassing information would look when seen in the harsh light of day the federal reserve staff tried to calm their fears with one staff member indicating that the fed planned to try to hide the existence of the 17 years of transcripts from the banking committee he announced in the conference call that the chairman is not highlighting these transcripts were not waving red flags chairman greenspan then read his prepared testimony which conveniently left out any mention of 17 years of fomc transcripts during the call some of the fed officials despaired that they would not be able to hide the existence of the transcripts for long and that chairman greenspan should offer to release them in 5 years but settle for 3 years the general counsel of the federal reserve warned that in the event of foia requests he saw the chances of the fed holding on to these fomc transcripts for longer than 3 years as not good i urge the federal reserve not to stonewall and to make the full transcript of the conference call public there is no sensitive material involved no monetary policy was discussed rather the discussion is centered around a plan to mislead the congress when federal reserve witnesses were to appear before the banking committee 4 days later as dallas federal reserve bank president robert d mcteer jr said during the call the fed had better quit stonewalling federal reserve congressional liaison don winn said i dont have any sense that they have any knowledge whatever of what weve been talking about the plan to conceal the existence of these 17 years of fomc transcripts was actively carried out when all 16 fed witnesses failed to reveal to the banking committee at the october 19 1993 hearing that they knew about the transcripts when asked about a permanent record of fomc meetings by congressman maurice hinchey of new york chairman greenspan testified there is no permanent electronic record that is correct we obviously have rough notes but these are verbatim transcripts not rough notes chairman greenspan deliberately shaded the truth i pursued my inquiry and on october 26 1993 chairman greenspan admitted that there were 17 years of complete fomc transcripts the fomc agreed to edit them at a snails pace and to make them public with a 5year lag which means we will have to wait 5 years before we can read the transcript of this weeks fomc meeting this is wholly unacceptable the fed surely wont be harmed by letting the light shine in so we can all know what it is doing and why i think it is long past time for the fomc members to change their version of accountability to one that is compatible with full accountability of government officials in a democracy i therefore urge the fed to comply with my requests to give the banking committee the fomc transcripts to continue the practice begun on february 4 1994 of promptly announcing monetary policy changes and to make the transcripts of fomc meetings available on a timely schedule full accountability will enhance the credibility and stature of the federal reserve it cannot afford to do less and still earn any trust
