my colleague from georgia yielding me time to discuss this rule and the underlying issue i do want to report that it was 229 years ago that the virginia general assembly ratified the virginia statute for religious freedom this was authored by thomas jefferson the statute serves as the model for the free exercise clause in our first amendment this is what it said no man shall suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief but that all men shall be free to profess and by argument to maintain their opinions in matters of religion religious freedom is a fundamental human right protected by our first amendment it is essential to our free and flourishing society our nation was found in part by individuals seeking refuge from religious persecution from religious discrimination for these pioneers and for all to come after america was meant to be a permanent fortress of liberty and freedom for all who live within its walls at its essence the concept of religious freedom is about much more than religion it is much more than just showing up to worship service 1 day or 1 night a week it is about our fundamental human right to hold our own beliefs and to live out our lives according to these faiths religious freedom quite simply is about freedom itself this is why the very first part of the very first amendment to our constitution is about religious freedom it is our first and most cherished liberty however our ability to be free to live out the convictions of our faith not only in the public square but also in the privacy of our own homes in our churches in our businesses is in jeopardy right here in our nations capital the misleading name rhnda is nothing more than a legalized discrimination if allowed to go in effect the government would force prolife organizations

should be provided for you see when an individual today is not allowed to purchase a firearmthe seven eight nine classes of individualsthey are all post adjudication they have received a due process hearing and have been either convicted of a violent felony have been adjudicated through a court of mental incompetence or have been dishonorably discharged in each case there has been due process

so last night with some changes based on input from my colleagues i introduced h r 5544 it makes changes it accepts the proposal of no fly no buy it is common sense if you are on a watch list you shouldnt be able to purchase a firearm but under my legislation if you are denied you must be notified not at the point of sale but within 10 days by the government that you were denied because you are on a watch list you are then entitled to a due process hearing within 30 days by a judge not by a political appointee within the department of justice the government must then demonstrate by a

going to be out of this place at the end of the week where is the priority for american security where is the priority for us to spend our time what are the priorities of the majority if we are going to waste our time here we go again valuable time homeland security running out of money folks being laid off our borders are being compromised terrorists are going to have or could have a field day because we have not funded homeland security yet we are here wasting valuable time lets use this time to fund the department of homeland security and lets get off some of this nonsense that makes no sense at all i cannot believe that the american people have sent us here to work on behalf of transcanada and to ignore the department of homeland security i cant in my wildest imagination believe that they didnt even know that they didnt even imagine that they didnt even think that we are here with the department of homeland security on one side and the keystone xl on the other side go figure where are their priorities this bill is unnecessary this bill will be vetoed by president obama and it will be sent back here doa we have far more important work that we should be doing on behalf of the american people i urge all of my colleagues to turn down this unnecessary illtimed illconceived notion that we should be spending our valuable time on the keystone xl and ignoring the funding for the department of homeland security"], [0.0005310177803039551, 0.500531017780304, 0, "it is always an honor to be able to speak on this hallowed floor a report was made earlier today entitled house poised to declare isis committing genocide against christians other minorities and in fact this report says the house is poised monday to approve a resolution that declares the islamic state is committing genocide against christians and other religious minorities in the middle eastputting even more pressure on the obama administration to do the same ahead of a deadline later this week the resolution passed the house foreign affairs committee with unanimous support and is expected to pass the house with bipartisan backing the resolution comes to a vote monday evening just days after the release of a graphic new report by the knights of columbus and in defense of christians on isis atrocities the report made the case that the terror campaign against christians and other minorities in syria iraq and other parts of the middle east is in fact genocide when isis systematically targets christians yazidis and other ethnic and religious minorities for extermination this is not only a grave injusticeit is a threat to civilization itself representative jeff fortenberry republican nebraska said in a statement we must call the violence by its proper name genocide the resolution will be voted on ahead of the congressionally mandated march 17 deadline for the secretary of state john kerry and the white house to make a decision on whether to make such a declaration the measure is an effort to force the administrations hand on the issue as the administration has so far declined to take an official position christians yazidis and other beleaguered minority groups can find new hope in this transpartisan ecumenical alliance against isis barbaric onslaught fortenberry who is cochairman of the religious minorities of the middle east caucus and represents americas largest yazidi community said in the statement so the measure received the backing of the house republican leadership paul ryan calling on the obama administration to take action like recent attacks against christians the article goes on from foxnews com indicating it is rare for congress to make a genocide determination in addition to the genocide resolution the house is expected to vote on a measure to create an international tribunal to try isis members accused of atrocities it is pleasing to report that h con res 75 expressing the sense of congress that the atrocities perpetrated by isilthat is the islamic state and it has used different names isis isilagainst religious and ethnic minorities in iraq and syria include war crimes crimes against humanity and genocide that passed by 393 yeas and zero nays it is deeply troubling that although this house in a bipartisan way could vote 393 for this resolution and zero against that secretary of state john kerry and president barack obama are having trouble deciding what they should do gee is it possible they might just notice that in the house of representatives we came together unanimously and said what isis has been doing is genocide for heavens sake for the sake of the christians the yazidis the jews in the area is it too much to ask that this united states administration take notice that there is a genocide going on and though the administration is not doing much of anything about it is it too much to ask that this administration at least call it what it is that this house on both sides of the aisle unanimously said the same thing is it too much to ask even if you are not going to fight the genocide at least call it what it is then that will embolden others with courage to stand up and fight more fearlessly is that too much to ask i hope and pray not in the meantime what we find here at home while we are still having the administration struggle over whether to call genocide genocide we have a report from ice the immigration and customs enforcement ice it is revealed that 124 illegal immigrant criminals released from jail by the obama administration since 2010 have been subsequently charged with murder the center for immigration studies report on the data from ice to the senate judiciary committee added that the committee is not releasing the names of these masses of murder suspects the criminal aliens released by ice in these yearswho had already been convicted of thousands of crimesare responsible for a significant crime spree in american communities including 124 new homicides after the thousands of crimes they have already committed before ice released them inexplicably ice is choosing to release some criminal aliens multiple times said the report written by cis respected director of policy studies jessica m vaughan she added that 75 percent were released due to court orders or because their countries wouldnt take them back whats more her report said that in 2014 ice released 30 558 criminal aliens that is illegal immigrants in the united states who committed criminal atrocities who had been convicted already when they were released of 92 347 crimes wow as the world suffers as this administration cannot determine whether or not to call the genocide of christians and other minority groups genocide at the same time it has been hard at work out of those thousands tens of thousands of aliens who have committed over 92 000 criminal acts against americans here in this country the administration has been hard at work and deported 3 percent of the tens of thousands of aliens illegally here who have committed over 92 000 crimes and this administration has deported 3 percent 2130 so much for protecting americans against all enemies foreign and domestic this article from paul bedard says her analysis is the latest shocking review of obamas openborder immigration policy and despite the high number of illegal immigrants charged with murder the list doesnt include those released by over 300 socalled sanctuary cities and those ice declined to even take into custody she said that 124 criminal aliens released by ice between 2010 and 2015 were charged with murder during that period and associated with 250 different communities in the united states with the most clustered in california new york and texas i would assert parenthetically for those that are not california new york and texas you cannot think for a minute that this is not already in your state if you havent heard about it is coming this says in a memo about the subsequent crimes of released illegals to judiciary committee chairman senator chuck grassley ice said the aliens were charged with a total of 135 homiciderelated crimes subsequent for my liberal friends that means after to release from ice custody as of july 25 2015 a total of 39 convictions have resulted from these homiciderelated charges of the 121 total aliens 2 had homiciderelated convictions prior to release from ice custody ice released them knowing that they already had homiciderelated convictions and they were released to kill again upon the american public though they violated our laws to get here and they violate our laws to stay here this administration has seen to their release upon the american public further vaughan added that ice reported that there are 156 criminal aliens who were released at least twice by ice since 2013 between them these criminals had 1 776 convictions that kind of sounds patriotic since 2013 ice has released 1 776 criminals with 1 776 convictions before they are released in 2013 including burglary larceny you know those things that hurt america this article from cis org also says only a tiny percentage of the released criminals have been removedmost receive the most generous forms of due process available and are allowed to remain at large without supervision while they await drawnout immigration hearings they are permitted to take advantage of this inefficient processing even though they are more likely to reoffend than they are to be granted legal status further down it says some aliens had multiple zip codes associated with them in ices system so the records include more zip codes than the 121 individual criminal aliens charged with murder through 2014 three more were charged in 2015 ice did not provide their zip codes ice reported there are 156 criminal aliens who were released at least twice by ice since 2013 that of course was in the other article it goes on to say ice has previously disclosed that 75 percent of the homicidal criminal aliens were released due to court orders most of those would be immigration judges who sit at the discretion of the attorney general of the united states so perhaps people can let our attorney general know that they would like our attorney general to pick some immigration judges who might actually enforce our law instead of forgo the law so criminal aliens can commit more crimes against americans i know i understand there is so much going on it is difficult to deal with all these issues at the same time and that is why the administration is struggling so whether or not to officially say that the genocide going on in the middle east of christians and other minorities is actually genocide it is just taking so much brain power even though in here it was 3930 the administration right down on pennsylvania avenue here just cant decide if it really might be genocide or not in a separate communication ice provided a list of the countries that currently are uncooperative in accepting their deported citizens afghanistan algeria burundi cape verde china cuba eritrea gambia ghana guinea india iran iraq ivory coast liberia libya mali mauritania morocco sierra leone somalia south sudan and zimbabwe gee cuba it is a real shame that as this administration negotiated all the things that it was going to give to and do for cuba that they didnt apparently bring this issue up oh by the way the criminal aliens that you have had come into our country are coming back to your country because they are your citizens illegally in our country they are coming back to you like it or not apparently i guess maybe with all the concentration on whether genocide is genocide they werent able to remember to bring that up to cuba or to china in afghanistan one of my muslim friends who is a great leader there in afghanistan pointed out a few years ago when he was talking about the leverage that the united states has and should use to get afghanistan to do the right thing by its people and by the united states i said well why do you thinkthis was in a visit in afghanistan i said why do you think we have much leverage this is a few years ago he said do you know what our annual budget is for the government in afghanistan no i didnt know he said around 12 billion american dollars do you know how much of that the united states provides he said we provide about 11 2 billion of our 12 you provide most of the rest of it he said yes you have got plenty of leverage but apparently this administration maybe again they are so flustered in trying to decide if isis who has expressly indicated they want to wipe out all christians and they want to wipe israel off the map they are trying to decide if that means that is really a genocide so they havent had time to notice that we have massive leverage over the afghan government to get them to do the right thing and take back their criminal aliens that are in this country illegally and send them back and take them otherwise the 10 12 of your budget that we provide may not get provided anymore but again i know this administration doesnt want to offend people that are killing american citizens i get that it is special being that sensitive algeria china india iran i just cant help but wonder if before the president authorized 100 billion to 150 billion going to iran if maybe it occurred in someones mind do you know what i am going to save some american lives by forcing iran to take back the criminal aliens from iran that are not lawfully here in the united states i wonder if anybody in this administration maybe thought about that did they think about it and send the president the message and it just didnt get to the president or it didnt get to john kerry and they didnt think about it on their own gee do you know what we know iran has already said they are going to spend some of that 100 billion 150 billion on weapons systems on more terror groups like hamas and hezbollah yeah they have said that we are going to spend more money on all these things we knew that did it occur that that is bad enough that you are giving money that is going to be used to kill americans christians jews yazidis it is going to be used to terrorize the world maybe you could have helped american citizens out by saying and by the way before we release it you are goingand never mind that they violated the agreement over and overbut you iran are going to need to accept back the criminal aliens from your country that are killing and terrorizing americans in our country illegally did nobody think of that it is incredible just incredible americans are suffering then we get this report from cis org that 61 million immigrants and their children young children now live in the united states now most of those i think 43 million or so are here legally but it is worth noting that the number of immigrants and their children grew six times faster than our nations population between 1970 and 2015 from 1970 to 2015 our united states population has grown by 59 percent that is a good healthy growth in the meantime the percentage of immigration growth or the number of immigrants in the united statesfirst generation that is most all everybody here even native americans werent native probably at one time they have come across somewhere but firstgeneration immigrants who actually immigrated in with children that number has grown by 353 percent over that same period in many states the increase in the number of immigrants and their minor children from 1970 to 2015 has been nothing short of astonishing in georgia the population grew 3 058 percent whereas before that it grew from 55 000 immigrants to 1 75 million immigrants that is just in georgia so the immigrant level grew 20 times faster 25 times faster than the overall state population so thank god for immigration thank god for legal immigration that is but when we abandon the rule of law and dont give ourselves time to welcome legal immigrants into this country and educate themthere is a reason that they have to be educated and are supposed to learn our language and supposed to learn some history because there is a tremendous amount of responsibility that comes with the right to vote you need to understand how you say what ben franklin said was a republic madam if you can keep it you cannot keep a republic if you dont educate people that are coming in and who are foreign to the idea of the responsibilities of maintaining a republic you dont keep it you cant keep it on the wave of that came this editorial from dan hannan a member of the european parliament dated today apparently he spent part of last summer volunteering in a hostel for underage migrants in the south of italy he talks about the migrants that came in he says i have seen refugee columns before and they tend to be made up disproportionately of women and children of the boat people landed by the coast guard while i was in italy more than 80 percent were young men young men who i noticed took out smartphones when they disembarked and looked for wifi so as to tell their relatives how good it was he says official policy in europe is based on a misdiagnosis the migrants are treated as refugees and there is an implicit assumption that their displacement is somehow our fault in the weirdly narcissistic tradition of the left the west is simultaneously blamed for having intervened in libya and for not having intervened in syria but the lads i was working with in italy were from countries that we never bombedexcept with aid money it is time we look seriously at the oath every member of congress the senate the president the vice president everybody in elected federal office takes we are supposed to defend this constitution that means we are to provide for the common defense against all enemies foreign and domestic it is high time we took that more seriously i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0006238818168640137,

of speakers that the product before us is a bipartisan product that our committee works in a bipartisan way just to put a little bit of quantification on that over the course of our markup in committee 96 amendments sponsored by democratic members of the committee were adopted and prior to that at least 110 specific requests by democratic members of the committee were incorporated into the committee and subcommittee marks so it leaves one wondering if democratic members are forced to oppose the bill because of something the budget committee hasnt done how can this bipartisan tradition continue that is one of the things that concerns me because it is something that i think we are all very proud of that we worked together that we put the national defense interests ahead of these other differences that we have this makes it harder when we dont fix the budget or we dont fix health care or we dont fix the environment or we dont fix taxes there is no end if that is the way that this is going to go i think it is ironic i believe we need to find a better way to impose fiscal responsibility in our government than the budget control act and i am absolutely anxious to work with any member who wants to find a better way to go ahead but we cant do it on this bill it is impossible and so what we are doing for those who would oppose this bill is to hold the pay and benefits of our troops all of these decisions we are holding that hostage to something that we cant resolve here in this measure as the gentleman from washington said at some point this is not the end of the process this is a step in the process there are a lot of things to go with appropriation bills and conference reports and so forth before the president ever has an opportunity to veto a bill as a matter of fact this president has threatened to veto i think pretty much all the defense authorization bills at some point in the process that is not a reason for us not to take the next step i think we should build upon the bipartisan work that came out of committee i suspect there will be bipartisan work with amendments from republicans and democrats on the floor and that we should pass this measure go to conference with the senate and keep working towards the end of the process where hopefully we can have something better than the budget control act but to say i am not going to support our troops unless we do that first i dont think is the proper way to go this is a normal budget process we have a house and senate budget resolution for the first time in years"]]}
