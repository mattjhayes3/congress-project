30something working group for the boundless energy that you have expended the tremendous intellect and the great commitment to a new direction and a better future our 30something working group has been an inspiration to congress and invigoration to us all and i join as a mother of 30somethings and in thanking you for what you have done it is appropriate that the 30 omething group is advocating advancing in a new direction because this new direction is absolutely essential for young people in our country our 30somethings are committed to a better future for all americans so is our new direction a newdirection for all americans not just the privileged few we can begin with our six for 06 to make america safer we will begin by passing the 9 11 commission recommendations we have just observed the fifth anniversary of 9 11 here we are 5 years after 9 11 the commission is giving the federal government ds and fs and incompletes for implementation of their recommendations the first day of congress we will pass the 9 11 commission recommendations and make america safer we will make our economy fairer and we will begin by passing the minimum wage we can do it next week the bill is in the hopper to make our economy fair we can pass the minimum wage and certainly not have congress have any increase in its salary until there is an increase and unless there is an increase in the minimum wage we can also remove the incentives for companies to send jobs overseas imagine taxpayers are giving incentives for companies to send job overseas we will end that we will make colleges more affordable it is important to broaden the opportunity for a college education and we will begin by making college tuition tax deductible and cutting in half the interest on student loans we will make health care more affordable and we will begin by allowing the government to negotiate for lower prices for prescription drugs and we will promote stem cell research that is better for a healthy america we will move towards energy independence that our colleagues were talking about here we will begin by repealing the subsidies that have been given to big oil and big energy compa nies and instead use that 18 billion for research in alternative energy resources every day that we are here we will work for a dignified retirement by preserving social security protecting pensions and encouraging savings for americas seniors this we will do within the first 100 hours of a new congress given the opportunity but we could do it now even before congress leaves instead we have a donothing rubberstamp congress i see the rubber stamp here here we are just a few days from the end of the fiscal year and this congress has still not passed the budget for this fiscal year how could it be a week before the end of the fiscal year and this donothing congress has not even passed the budget in addition we have a crying need in our country for comprehensive bipartisan immigration reform we certainly are not moving in any direction to make that possible the list goes on we havent finished our appropriations bills we shouldnt leave here until we have an increase in the minimum wage but when we return and hopefully with a verdict from the american people we will get about the peoples business the issues that are relevant to the lives of the american people their jobs their health care their economic security the health care for their families the education of their children safe america safe neighborhoods and a secure america with energy independence we will do all of this from the very first day with integrity our first rule that members will vote on will be for integrity to sever the link between special interests and legislation so that we are here for the peoples interest instead with civility with bipartisan administration of the house so that every voice in the country is heard not only the voices of those who happen to have their member be in the majority and we will do it with fiscal discipline no more deficit spending pay as you go audit the books account for the money to the american people all of this is possible because of the energy and enthusiasm of our 30somethings mr ryan mr meek and ms debbie wasserman schultz and all of the other 30something members who have participated here on the floor of the house and throughout the country to talk about a new direction the american people are an optimistic confident hopeful lot and we build on that spirit american spirit as we go forth with an optimism into these elections an optimism about a better future we owe it to our troops who work to protect us we owe it to our founders and the vision they had for america and we owe it to our children with that i yield back with all of the compliments in the world to these two distinguished gentlemen for bringing the idea of a rubberstamp congress to the floor here it is a fact of life on the floor of congress and they are pointing that

drilling off the coast of florida california all around the coastline of our country he particularly focuses on natural gas and professes that natural gas is a cleanburning gas and that there would be little to no risk to expanding that drilling well when one is a representative from the state of florida and we have 77 million people who visited our state just last year alone and 56 5 billion in taxable sales is generated by tourism most of which is the result of our beautiful beaches and our pristine coastline one can clearly see why most floridians would have a significant problem with the possibility of there being oil rigs off our beaches within the eyesight of tourists or our residents and mr peterson of pennsylvania has continually represented that natural gas is a potential alternative energy source well just off the florida coastline the minerals management service which is a government agency under the department of the interior has documented that there is only about a 70day supply of natural gas off the coastline of florida in the gulf under current consumption rates in the united states that to me does not appear to take us into the rest of the century in terms of dealing with our energy needs what we should be doing is uniting as members of congress representing this country and dealing with our longterm energy crisis by exploring alternative energy sources not going to the same old energy sources and trying to drill our way out of this problem drilling is not the solution there is far too much environmental risk to drilling whether we are drilling for natural gas or drilling for oil and the proposal that we will be considering that is attached to the budget reconciliation bill the budgetcut document that we will be considering at the earliest next week includes a terrible proposal that would expand drilling off the coastline of florida and bring drilling within 125 miles of floridas coast on the gulf that is a totally inappropriate proposal it makes absolutely no sense it would jeopardize our environment and i am hopeful that my colleagues from florida and other colleagues who represent coastal communities which will also be in jeopardy if this provision passes will join us in opposing this budget reconciliation bill not the least of which because there are many other reasons why it should be opposed because of the dire cuts that are in the budget that are going to rain terror down on americans across this country but to add insult to injury it also has a terrible provision in it that would allow drilling off the coastline around our entire country so with that having been said i want to talk a little bit about what we talked about in the previous hour and turn the conversation back to the budget reconciliation bill there are a number of significant problems with the budget cuts that the republican leadership is proposing but one of the things that i wanted to turn to is what democrats think we should be doing in terms of the budget democrats want to bring the budget back into balance what we proposed in the budget committee today included a proposal that would bring the budget back into balance by 2012 the democratic budget also has a smaller deficit than the republican budget every year and would accumulate less debt and waste fewer resources on interest payments that are needed to service the national debt we would include budget enforcement measures to protect social security we would do more for education the democratic proposal provides 4 5 billion more for appropriated education and training programs than the republican budget for 2006 and 41 billion more over the next 5 years we also reject the 21 billion in cuts that the republican budget requires the education and workforce committee to make over the next 5 years those are cuts that could fall on students loans and school lunches these are not the same old tired complaints it is insulting to suggest that cutting school lunches and financial aid are tired complaints if one is struggling to be able to give their children breakfast and lunch on a daily basis and make sure that they are provided with nutrition and they do not financially have the ability to ensure that they can do it themselves staring down budget cuts that take that opportunity away from them is nothing short of cowardly this is a cowardly budget reconciliation bill it does not show any guts at all and it abandons the american people let us talk about housing in the previous hour we talked a little bit about the housing cuts that this budgetcut bill would hand down and i am joined by my good and close friend whom i had an opportunity to serve with in now three different chambers the gentlemanfrom florida his district and my district were hit badly by a category 3 storm last week hurricane wilma and we were talking in the last hour about housing and the issues related to affordable housing that our constituents were already facing i want to just point out this picture here over the weekend i had an opportunity to go door to door in my district because there are so many senior citizens trapped in their homes without power we still have half a million people who do not have power in south florida and unfortunately whether it is because of hurricane fatigue or just the fact that there was so much damage in the gulf coast region that it may be difficult to feel the pain that we are going through in south florida and understand it but there is not nearly as much attention as we need focused on what happened in south florida when i was going to door to door in my district to try to help some of the folks who have trouble getting out of their houses and i am talking about people who are in their 80s and 90s one of the apartments that the building captain in the condominium brought me into included this kind of damage this is the result of hurricane wilma and this is just one example there are hundreds and hundreds of condominium units and apartment buildings and homes and mobile homes that look just like this there is a perception whether it was created by the media or created by the lack of attention by the national media on what happened with hurricane wilma that everything is fine in south florida everything is not fine in south florida this is the third floor apartment and that is the ceiling of the apartment and as we can see we can look right through the ceiling at the sky this is this womans master bedroom and literally during the storm 1 minute after she walked out of that master bedroom the roof caved in on her bed a minute earlier and it would have caved in on her when we talk about the affordable housing problem that we already had now we have thousands of people in south florida whose homes have been condemned who are faced with nowhere to go because the average price of a house just in broward is 348 000 a year the rental units the monthly rent is sky high and

alltime high when a republican president cannot get a vote on his own proposal i offered an amendment to the rule this morning at 7 barely 3 hours ago that would have made the kolbeberman amendment in order but republicans on the rules committee except one rejected my amendment and blocked this amendment from being considered by the house i understand that the house leadership has told many in the majority that it intends to consider the presidents proposal on the floor sometime before the house recesses this week if that is in fact the case then why did the chairman of the rules committee specifically tell his assembled republican colleagues this morning to vote against making the presidents proposal in order perhaps it is because the majority do not want to consider what they cannot defeat or perhaps they have zero intention of ever considering the kolbeberman amendment whatever the reason if i had a dollar for every time the republican leadership promised a member something and failed to keep that promise since 1995 well i would be a republican words are cheap until they are backed up with action and if anybody thinks that this part a is getting ready to have the necessary

everybody in this house knows that our immigration laws are broken the current system is rife with double standards quota limit wet footdry foot air footboat foot student visas just to name a few the

floridabased district staff as i am speaking work every single day and today as i speak there are immigrants lined up throughout the halls of the office that i am privileged to serve lined sometimes as many as 30 or 40 people deep snake through the hallways of that office some came here legally others arrived illegally regardless all of them share the same american dream with one another and all of us our rich and diverse cultural backgrounds are our strength the underlying legislation however mocks that diversity and creates a system under which simply applying for citizenship would be risky arbitrary factors could deny naturalization on the basis of whether an alien is a person of good moral character if this bill becomes law anyone who has ever had an illegal presence in the united states will be arrested convicted of a felony and jailed even those who seek asylum from honor killings human trafficking and forced prostitution would immediately be branded as felons and thrown into american jails this wide net of prosecution is also cast upon american citizens accused of helping hiring or transporting potential immigrants we have a wonderful and rich history of churches and philanthropic groups who serve as a lifeline for newly arrived immigrants who diligently seek legal status business owners could also be fined and penalized for not verifying the citizenship of every worker through a new system of stringent checks that is an unfunded mandate at best these checks would require approximately 7 million american employers to screen almost 140 million workers these are the people who do not believe in big government we owe it to all who live here whether born on this soil or not the chance to contribute in a fair and meaningful way that protects our safety provides

the course of the committees five hearings on this agreement members closely scrutinized the relationship between india and iran and i think it is fair to say that our committee helped influence indias thinking on iran and i think we should all remember thatwe are getting indias cooperation on iran we got two iaea votes out of india including a critical vote to get the iran file to new york that is the fact about cooperation we share the gentlemans concern about iran but our point is that india is cooperating on iran and as we continue to engage india and this agreement is about indias growing energy needs as we engage india we move them away from states like iran rejection of the agreement itself frankly could push india theoretically back towards countries like iran also we have mr markeys theme in the bill itself the bill itself says to secure indias full and active participation in united states efforts to dissuade isolate and if necessary sanction and contain iran for its efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction including a nuclear weapons capability and the means to deliver weapons of mass destruction if india breaks this agreement then we the united states will break our agreement with india and i think also it is important to remember that india and the administration both say that they are cooperating on iran quietly behind the scenes why because this is the most effective way to do it and we have seen the positive results but diplomacy cannot be certified the purpose of this agreement is to help establish broad cooperation to establish a partnership between india and the united states you do not compel a partner to cooperate so this amendment is both unworkable and contrary to the spirit of the new relationship we are trying to establish with india how important is that relationship well we have had two administrations the clinton administration and the bush administration forge closer ties with india and overcoming what we remember only too well the chilly relations of the cold war and last julys joint statement committed each country to a global partnership which has accelerated our cooperation on many issues including counterterrorism including iran the international relations committee have given this agreement close and extensive review while nuclear energy is controversial in the united states it is not in india like in several other countries nuclear energy is widely viewed as a critical technology for their electricity one central to uplifting hundreds of millions of impoverished indians so india will develop its nuclear energy sector not as easily or as quickly without this deal but it will nonetheless so this deal needs to go forward with its growing economy india is consuming more and more oil it is competing on the world market competing with american consumers for limited hydrocarbon resources this gives americans an interest in helping india expand its nuclear power industry which this legislation does it also encourages india to move away from burning its highly polluting coal which is in our interest by passing this legislation we also take a step toward internationalizing indias nuclear industry which i believe would make it safer the agreement also is likely to increase indias cooperation with us in confronting countries seeking to break their npt commitment by developing nuclear weapons as it already has with iran india must take inore steps including developing a credible plan to separate its civilians and military nuclear facilities under the agreement congress must approve a nuclear cooperation agreement that the administration is negotiating with the indians before the technology is actually transferred and as i said should india break the conditions of the agreement the unitedstates breaks off the agreement itself so either we continue to try to box in india and hope for the best or we make this move we engage india and hope to use our influence to move this increasingly important country in our direction making india a true partner as we enter what will be a decadeslong struggle against islamist terrorism that is why i ask my colleagues to please

time this is a surreal debate because it is a debate that has consequences and yet it seems to almost be like a game when we passed campaign finance reform it passed primarily with democratic support and there wasnt any talk about free speech because democrats made the proper argument they made the argument that this was about letting people have their speech and not being drowned out by the wealthy that is what the democrats said dont let the wealthy drown out people who dont have a lot of resources so what the democrats are now arguing is that for instance 25 individual donors should be able to contribute 142 million or 56 percent of all of the individual contributions to 527 groups in the 2004 election that is what democrats are saying they are saying we want the wealthy to be able to dominate but that was not their argument when they voted for campaign finance reform and it was not my argument our argument was that we wanted to have a level playing field our argument was we wanted to enforce the 1907 law that banned corporate treasury money we wanted to enforce the 1947 tafthartley act that banned forced union dues money and we wanted to support the 1974 campaign finance law that said you could not rake unlimited contributions to federal campaigns that is what democrats argued for and supported and they blamed republicans for being against campaign finance reform the amazing thing is once the campaign finance reform bill passed democrats immediately started to break the law they were looking to get around the very law they voted for and when mr soros who helped fund the campaign finance movement argued that he should be able to contribute unlimited funds to 527s and that he should be able to bring his 20plus million to the table just this one individual democrats wanted to protect him and allow him to do that and republicans who were against the law said this is the law we are going to abide by it the amazing thing is the very people who did not vote for the law were willing to abide by it and the very people who voted for the law are trying to get around the law that is what i find so amazing about this debate so vhhat this amendment does is it just enforces the law that you my fellow colleagues on the other side of the aisle voted for it enforces the campaign finance act the mccainfeingold bill the bill you all supported now why do we have to pass this bill before us because unfortunately when we gave it to the federal elections commission the fec who does not believe in the law decided not to enforce the law they are happy to have loopholes they are the ones who introduped the whole soft money issue in the first place so whatdo we have we have a loophole that needs to be closed and the way you close it is to pass this bill that requires 527s to come under the campaign finance law this is because their primary activity in fact their only activity is campaigns and the law is clear mr meehan and i brought forward a case against the fec we threw out 14 of their regulations because they did not abide by the law and then we proceeded to take a court action against them on enforcing the law and put 527s under their jurisdiction the court made a decision that mr meehan and i were right that 527s should be under the law in fact the judge said not putting them under the law circumvented the law so what we are doing is simply making the law consistent and frankly this talk of c 3 s c 4 s and c 5 s is not on point their primary responsibility and activity is not campaigns and because of that you are not going to have the same problem that you have with 527s if in fact their primary activity becomes campaigns then they will come under it this bill is consistent to the law it is imperative it passes it is consistent with what my colleagues voted for and i applaud my side of the aisle for in spite of the fact of not voting for the law be willing to live by the law"], [0.0006147027015686035, 0.5006147027015686, 1,

rules committee for yielding me time and i thank you very much for allowing me the opportunity to cast this debate hopefully in as broad a light as it possibly can be cast i would like to suggest that members of the homeland security committee and committee on the judiciary all have participated in what we call the heavy lifting as a member of both committees i know that there are individuals well intentioned who had come together to try to construct if you will a reasonable response to this pending and ongoing concern that americans have expressed but let me tell you why this rule is fractured and why the underlying bill needs to be returned back to not only the rules committee but the committee in order to put together for america the real comprehensive immigration reform that i hope legislators will bring to the floor of the house as opposed to political sound bites it is well known that america is asking for the enforcement of our immigration laws but they are not asking for enforcement only they want a comprehensive reform package that provides a pathway to citizenship and legalization and enforcement as someone who comes from a border state and particularly texas i can assure you that there is no divide amongst many members on the needs for security and protection at the border it was our state that experienced the viciousness and the seriousness of the victoria deaths out of that particular tragedy i authored alien smuggling legislation which i am proud to say was included in the 9 11 legislation passed almost a year ago we are very serious about border security but this underlying bill does not speak to border security what it does do is it provides the enormous burden of unfunded mandates and it is impracticable it cannot work what it does and you will hear us say this over and over again today it criminalizes 11 million individuals as the number seems to be of undocumented individuals in this country that means that they may be here taxpayers children in school recognizing that they may have come to this particular place undocumented but it criminalizes them by their very presence that means they have to be mandatorily put in jail whether you are an elderly person whether you are a child you have to be mandatorily put in jail the socalled emplojer verification program was a pilot program there is no guarantee in this bill for full funding for that nor is there a guarantee that the data base is secure enough that the employers can rely upon it i believe employers should verify who they are employing but they cannot do it with a system that is fractured and is not funded the way it should be funded this bill requires a lot of work and the work is that we must combine comprehensive immigration reform we must also address the question very quickly of giving the right equipment to border patrol agents none of that is in there night goggles computers helicopters power boats in the homeland security committee mr thompson of mississippi the ranking member and myself offered an amendment that would equip the border patrol agents as they should be you ask one american do you want your border patrol agents to have the right uniforms the right id and the right equipment they cannot function without helicopters power boats night goggles computers and other technology to help them secure the border nor can they work without doubling or tripling the number of border patrol agents that is why this bill is fractured so i conclude by simply saying respond to what america is asking us to do comprehensive immigration reform earned access to legalization and as well strong strong enforcement"], [0.0008718967437744141, 0.5008718967437744, 1, "mr p speaker i yield myself such time as i p may consume r i rise today in support r of this committees funding resolution for the past 6 years the speaker and h the gentleman from ohio chairman ney have labored in the house service to the benefit of both the majority and the minority they have firmly established the fairness principle in the committee funding process by doing so they have benefited this great institution and have brought civility to the house regarding the fair allocation of committee resources while many others have also worked to bring this about including the gentleman from california and my predecessor ranking members especially the gentleman from maryland it is the gentleman from ohio chairman ney and the speaker who must be credited with greatly diminishing this source of continuing tension between the majority and the minority but the most important consequence of the application of the speaker and the gentleman from ohio chairman ney of the fairness principle today is that the principle is now firmly established as an operating standard within the house and i believe it will be applied from this point forward no matter which political party is in the majority the fairness principle simply stated is that the minority is entitled to a minimum of onethird of the staff and committee resources and control over those resources the fairness principle has been embedded in house rules for many decades under both republican and democratic majorities it is currently reflected in the house rule x clause 9 six committees unconditionally operate under the fairness principle today with the remainder operating on a version of the fairness principle agreeable to the respective chairmen and ranking members we must anticipate that as committee leaders positions change hands old compromises and accommodations will yield to the universal and unconditional application of the fairness principle only then will the gentleman from ohio chairman ney and the gentleman from illinois speaker hastert have fulfilled the worthy objective of securing civility between the majority and the minority regarding the division of committee resources we also would like to compliment the gentleman from ohio chairman ney on another matter of great importance to this institution it nvolves the selfinitiated mass mailings on behalf of committees which could have undermined public support or the franking privilege the committee on house administration has taken a very enlightened tpproach to these taxpayerfunded nailings the resolution before us larifies the existing rules regarding committeeinitiated mass mailings and rohibits the use of committee funds to prepare mass mailings once a comnittee has expended 5 000 in massnailing costs in a session mass mailings by committees would tave to be approved by the bipartisan franking commission and would be subject to the 90day cutoff that individual members are subjected to this clarifying language and the limitation provide guidance which will allow committees to strategically plan their franking use during each session of congress by a separate action of the committee on house administration we adopted a committee resolution setting an overall committee limit for all forms of franked mail including committeeinitiated frank mailings of 5 000 per session again this gives committees a planning tool and we recognize that a committee might find itself in crisis due to exigent circumstances during the markup of this resolution the gentleman from ohio chairman ney expressed clearly and unequivocally that any committee needing additional franking authorization above the 5 000 must return to the committee to request and justify the needed increase such an increase would be adopted by the full committee in the form of a committee supplemental resolution and the increased funding could not be used for mass mailings i insert a chart in the record at this point"], [0.0010804533958435059, 0.5010804533958435, 1, "madam chairman

double what it was in the early 1970s my experience as a school nurse taught me that we need to make a concerted effort all of us to increase physical fitness activity among our children and to encourage all americans to adopt a healthier diet that includes fruits and vegetables but there is more if we are going to be successful in designing healthy communities and raising healthy kids we
