great pleasure in support of h r 4861 the american conservation corps act of 1982 a bill on which i am an original cosponsor today the legislation has a bipartisan group of 101 cosponsors almost 50 years ago the congress sought to cope with the ravages of the depression era unemployment by enacting the emergency conservation act of 1933 which established the civilian conservation corps a bold stroke in a time of despair the ccc furnished employment and valued selfesteem for some 3 million unmarried males during the 9 years of its existence at the same time the nation reaped invaluable natural benefits in its heyday the ccc camps located throughout the 48 states and several territories numbered upward of 1 740 with almost 360 000 enrollees at work to protect and enhance the soil trees and streams of our nation more than 4 000 fire observation towers were constructed as a result of the ccc program furthermore conservation corps participants planted more than 3 billion trees and laid 85 000 miles of telephone lines they constructed over 150 000 miles of trails and roads and built approximately 45 000 bridges and buildings today by casting a vote in favor of h r 4861 the members of this body can also make a wise investment in the youth and the natural resources of our country in admittedly a different way but just as our predecessors in 1933 did when they approved the formation of the ccc the need today is great as it was in 1933 most recent statistics released by the department of labor on unemployment are shocking tragically the burden of joblessness falls most heavily on the youth although up to 9 percent of the total labor force presently may have no job 23 1 percent of the teens are without work each member of this body should be horrified to learn that 49 8 percent of the black youth of this nation are unemployed many if not most have lost hope for employment for 9 modest appropriation we can begin to provide gainful employment work experience and some measure of selfesteem again to thousands of disadvantaged youth at the same time vital restoration and conservation work on the public lands can move forward roads and trail maintenance work reclamation of strip mined lands recreational area development these are just some of the projects which have tapped the energy and talent of these young americans i would advise my colleagues that over the last 3 to 4 years i have visited with a variety of employees and managers of the unitedstates forest service and the national park service about their experience with the youth conservation corps and the young adult conservation corps some of them admitted they had reservations about these two programs at their inception consistently however these people told me that any doubts they had were prqven to be unfounded for the results have been very beneficial for those forest areas and for those national park units more importantly they were impressed by the benefits accruing to the individual young people involved the youth and the young adults involved made very important contributions to our parks and forests and they experienced great personal growth and an enlightened attitude as a result of these working and learning experiences i would say unequivocally that it is a mistake to phaseout the yacc and the ycc today partly i think the problems which have been pointed outand some of them may be validspring from a problem in this congress itself the jurisdiction on oversight for these programs has been split between committees in the house and perhaps in the other body as well i think with an earlier and a more concerted variety of oversight activity on the part of this congress some of those problem areas would have been corrected without damage to these vital youth employmenteducation programs to suggest that these kinds of activities have low priorities as far as the work accomplished is just absolutely inconsistent with the facts if it had not been for the work of these young adults and the youth involved in these conservation programs our parks and many of our national forests would be in desperate condition if we terminate these projects the national park service employees can tell you that people involved with resource management law enforcement and a wide variety of service activities will not be pursuing those ends responsibly as they should they will be doing the kind of labor intensive work that these youth and young adults have accomplished trails will not be maintained repairs will not be made and so forth i think in suggesting that these youth employment programs are inappropriate and fail to meet employment training objectives is to suggest only that the criteria on which they are judged are inappropriate these programs are both educational in nature and they are aimed at accomplishing necessary work you cannot suggest that they have not met their goals in providing adequate product for the work expended and ignore the fact that they also produce great educational training benefitsexactly what they are aimed at accomplishing the arguments advanced against this bill and the yacc and ycc are specious and

have heard a lot of this line recently so it was quite a surprise to receive the results of a business poll in the mall yesterday which indicates exactly the opposite the nationwide opinion survey conducted by touche ross tallied responses from 1 606 corporate leadersover 63 percent of whom were chief executive financial or operating officiera of their respective corporationsrepresenting a wide spectrum of the business comnmunity in terms of size type and geographic location when asked if they thought the next tax bill goes far enough in removing obstacles to investment and productivity more than 53 percent replied no whien asked if the new tax bill will benefit their companies over 85 percent said yes cohvetsely on whether it would hurt business 97 percent said no nearly 51 percent chose

incentive fight inflation or have some other positive psychological effect that does not sound like wailing and gnashing to me in fact it sounds pretty positive and true to form also true to farm was the day before yesterdays surge in the stock market following the decline in the prime rate to 19 percent i believe it ought to be apparent to everyone here that economic events will run their course if we simply allow them to that does not mean tampering with shortterm stopgap measures or raising taxes or revising the next tax law or artificially propping up sagging industries it means balancing the budget by trimming deficits so that interest rates can fall thereby promoting further and more longlasting economic surges this member has on previous days over the course of the past 2 weeks taken some time at the close of our session and read from a study prepared for the republican research committees economic task force budget study subcommittee this subcommittee produced a work product in the latter part of july wherein we identified 272 itqms where savings could be made in fiscal year 1982 these totaled some 52 billion we are not necessarily su~ggesting that these items should all be implemented we are saying that if the congress would assert the courage in this institution to make the cuts necessary to balance the budget these items among others certainly should be considered on previous days i have read very briefly through items relating to legislative 21 cuts judiciary 8 cuts executive office 4 cuts funds for the president 15 cuts agriculture 27 cuts commerce 8 cuts defense military 15 cuts defense civil 4 cuts education 9 cuts energy 13 cuts and health and human services 16 cuts today i would propose to read through a list of cuts for housing and urban development totaling 15 for some 3 304 249 600 and in the department of the interior 6 cuts totaling 297 557 300 the first item from hud is housing programs subsidized housing in this category we would allow 20 percent above fiscal year 1980 the proposal as it is in the present law would provide for a 51 4percent increase over the preceding year moreover the gao finds considerable overcommitment of funds due to inaccuracies in contracts we believe this is excessive and should not be tolerated if adopted this would save 1 421 941 800 in housing programs payments for operation of lowincome housing projects we would cut 10 percent from 1981 these projects have been illadvised illconceived and illmanaged we propose eliminating operation of september 24 1 981 rrentarks e 4437 the most wasteful portions of those projects and achieve savings of 215 080 000 housing programs congregate services would be eliminated funding authority for this program has already been deleted and remaining outlays should follow suit this would save if adopted 5 300 000 housing programs troubled project operation subsidy we would allow 20 percent above 1980 the additional funding of housing projects is redundant if the worst offenders would be deleted we could remove that redundancy this would save if adopted 57 399 200 housing programs lowrent housing loans and expenditures we would allow 20 percent above 1980 the current proposal is for an increase of 173 5percent increase from 1980 which is altogether in our judgment unnecessary and unreasonable if implemented this would save 51 473 400 government national mortgage association special assistance functions we would improve this by following the recommendations of the general accounting office for improving accounting procedures which if adopted for this program would save 22 700 000 onma emergency mortgage purchase assistance we would improve the servicing of multifamily mortgages and provide incentives for prompt payments this again is a recommendation of the general accounting office if adopted it is estimated to save 500 million community planning and development community development support assistance wve would cut 10 percent from proposed funding for block grants not including udag these grants have helped corporations and developers not the needy this would save 411 300 000 community planning and development community development support assistance we would eliminate udag funding to decaying inner cities which should be redeveloped under the concept of enterprise zones not out of subsidies from the public treasury if implemented and adopted this would save 500 million new community development corporation we would eliminate funding for this program because we feel it can be better financed in creation of enterprise zones if adopted this would save 37 117 000 neighborhoods voluntary associations and consumer protection interstate land sales we would eliminate this on the grounds that the federal government should never have gotten in to this area to begin with and n addition this regulatory body has expanded into the intrastate field as well which certainly is not justified if implemented this would save 300 000 fair housing and equal opportunity we would eliminate this on the grounds that it is unnecessary it should not be functioning as a separate program but rather as policy if adopted this would save 6 100 000 management and administration public assistance and income supplement we would allow a growth of 20 percent above 1980 currently proposed spending represents a 5 1 8percent increase from 1980 which we believe to be excessive if implemented this would save 19 572 800 management and administration law enforcement activities we would allow a 20percent growth above 1980 the proposed increase is unnecessary because of cutbacks in enforcement activities if implemented this would reduce spending by 1 570 400 finally for this category we would follow the recommendation of the general accounting office by correcting auditing procedures which if implemented would save 54 395 000 in the department of the interior the first item here of the six that are proposed departmentwide we would correct auditing procedures recommended by the general accounting office which if implemented would reduce spending for this category by 59 510 000 land and water resources elm range improvement we would cut 10 percent from 1981 by limiting further land acquisition if implemented this would save 1 350 000 land and water resources blm resource management we would cut 10 percent from 1981 by restricting regulation and management if implemented this would reduce spending by 24 482 500 land and water resources elm miscellaneous permanent appropriation general purpose fiscal assistance we would allow 20percent growth above what was spent in 1980 the current proposal allows a 74 4percent increase from 1980 which we perceive as unwarranted this if adopted would save 201 515 600 land and water resources water and power resource service general administration we would allow 20percent above 1980 the proposed 50 1percent increase from 1980 is in our judgment excessive and should not be tolerated this if implemented would reduce spending in fiscal year 1982 by 8 899 200 land and water resources office of water policy salaries and expenses we would eliminate this new agency on the grounds that it is not needed there is little justification for its existence in our opinion this if implemented would reduce spending by 1 800 000 to sum up this category of the department of interior these six items would result in spending 297 557 300 less in fiscal year 1982 for the department of housing and urban development the 15 items total 3 304 249 600 some members in this chamber may from time to time ask the question if it is so simple why do we not do it that is why do we not balance the budget why do we not assert the necessary independence to bring the discipline to bear to match the outgowith the income and remove one of the great obstacles to economic recovery of this country the answer to that question is puzzling but it is probably more political than anything else there is a drum beat that runs through these chambers which says that if the members exhibit the courage to cut the spending this will1 aggravate those people and organizations adversely affected and these same special interests who are cut down or cut off will retaliate against the offending members in the voting booth that philosophy has been driving this institution for almost a generation it still is the controlling philosophy in this chamber then you may ask what hope is there for the people of this country if we who have the stewardship of raising taxes and voting spending do not have the courage to match the outgo with the income i think one constructive way is to demonstrate that we can balance the budget of this nation in fiscal year 1982 while at the same time providing for the recognized needs of the downtrodden the poor the handicapped and the deprived in our society because when you analyze these items that i have been reading i challenge members to stand up and honestly say that we cannot do that because if we adopted this or that item we would be working against the genuine interests of the poor the downtrodden the handicapped and the deprived those who do not have the ability to fend for themselves i say to the members here look at these items carefully we have prepared them in all sincerity we as an institution cannot go on year after year spending more money then we take in in this fiscal year which will close in less than a week we will have probably gone into debt roughly 90 billion in the last 5 years we have added to our national debt over 300 billion notwithstanding the election of november 1980 the spending of the congress of the united states is today out of control the members of this institution do not have the discipline at least as they have exhibited it up to now to match the outgo with the income i think the constructive thing for us to do is to demonstrate with a work product of this type that we can cut spending we can cut our bureaucracy we can cut out waste fraud and abuse i think it is reasonable to undertake this effort in a bipartisan way and try to bring

course we may have met a few men who seemed devoid of a sense of humor but generally most people show wonderful humor some in an extraordinary fashion when i became ill with a disease that would render me immobile and without voice i decided that i had a choice of being angry grouchy irritated rebellious or just plain ornery another choice was to laugh at myself be cheerful and try to see

think how clumsy i was while still able to walk i began to fall one day i fell in my room and could not get up on my chair like a snake i crawled and wiggled slowly on the floor until i reached the phone i blindly knocked the receiver off the hook and dialed the operator when i heard a voice i asked her to send someone to pick me up shortly after i had to go to the nursing home of the franciscan sisters of the sacred heart many humorous events happened during my stay there for over a year one day nurses and aides were helping me from my bed to my reclining chair when suddenly my knees buckled and my helpers lost their grip i was falling when a aide pulled me to the chair where i sat down but to her surprise and mine on her lap in spite of my scary experience i laughed to relieve the distress of the nurses and especially to relieve the embarrassment of the young aide because of weak neck muscles my head used to bobble up and down and move sideways when my helpers moved me i would hit my head on them the wall or the towel rack as a joke i began to count the bumps the nurses and aides would ask me how many times does that make i stopped counting when i reached 120 during my two and onehalf years of helplessness in the nursing home and hospital there were many times my fingernails had to be cut it amused me to have someone cut my nails when her own nails were so long that a

after mass i with a smile spelled out the following comment in my case it seems that god touched me not only with a finger but used both hands many other things have happened which if written could

guarantees that are in effect extensions of our own national defense extensions into those parts of the world that are important to our in terests for example in the middle east and in southwest asia we are talking about countries like egypt and israel as the gentleman from maryland dr long mentioned we are also talk~ing about additi onal and new friends that we have developed in the area in somalia for example in oman kenya in jordan we have r think an obligation to rdcognize that the role they are willing to play in the quest for world peace is an important role and we certainly want to be good partners in that effort i think countries 111w portugal that experimented with communism and rejected cbmnw4nism and actually became apart of nato with the help that we gave then as i think of por december 10 1981 h9296 decemberi10 198 co tugal i have to think of the azores which are their islandd where our base at lajes was used for resupply of israel duringf the war in 1973 had it riot been for our ability to land in the6 azores we could not have gotten to israel with resupply because other nations had denied us overflight authority and had denied us landing rights when we talk about the questftrn of the security support funds and these middle east programs they become more important as the days go by because the threat in the middle east grows severely the threat from the soviet union the threat from other nations who would deny the flow of oil from countries like oman from saudi arabia fromother nations in the area i believe it is important that we do recognize the responsibility that we have in this regard and 1 think this bill does address that not as much as i would have had it be addressed but more than il has been in the past all in all we have a bill here that is a step in the right direction we have a long way to go to get one that many of us can support enthusiastically but at least those steps are being taken again i want to say that the gentleman from new york mr k=ip who will occupy this place in just a few moments has done an outstanding job in bringing together a new subcommittee on the minority side all new members except for himself and i think that chairman long would concede that they have done an excellent job in learning the issues learning about the world understanding just what our role is here and being willing to be involved in the educational process that takes so many hoursand so mnany days they have done an excellent job and i cannot compliment them highly enough i reserve the balance of my time"],

national guard yet this amendment would delete 155 1 million for 12 a7ks and instead procure an additional 13 f16s for the air national guard the congress mostly at the insistence of the house armed services committee previously procured 30 twoplace a7k trainer aircraft toward a total requirement of 42 aircraft for the air national guard the guard will have a total of 360 singleseat aid aircraft located at 15 separate bases in the united states and puerto rico the 42 twoplace trainers are needed to train the approximately 507 pilots who fly and will fight in these aircraft procuring additional f16 aircraft instead of the needed a7k aircraft surely would increase readiness in the f16 forcebut not in the a713 force to put it simply you cannot train an a713 pilot in an f16 aircraft these 12 a7k aircraft are needed and congress should proceed with the procurement i hope my colleagues will keep this in mind and defeat the amendment i yield back the balance of my time"],

it is very similar to one that i sponsored last year and i think the clarifications he has put in the bill in changing it are entirely appropriate the bill is an important part of a legislative package designed to facilitate the collection of at least a half a billion dollars annually which is owed to the federal government equally important this legislation will facilitate development of a federal management procedure to manage programs with as little waste and slippage as possible it is astonishing to me the sloppiness in the past of our handling of overdue debts owed the government in some cases they simply do not maintain accounts receivable and it is very difficult to find out how much was owed this legislation was developed as a result of a lengthy bipartisan project going back several years in 1978 a series of gao reports indicated that improvements were needed in recording billing and collecting accounts receivable the next year the senate appropriations committee held a special hearing to review ways federal agencies could improve their debt collection practices in response to the issues raised by the gao and the senate hearings in march 1979 omb required each agency to review its procedures for collecting accounts receivable later that year the omb financial priorities program was established and debt collection was targeted as one of the nine key financial improvement areas these omb reviews showed that the debt collection problems were both complex and serious and that an indepth thorough agencybyagency review of credit management and debt collection practices was needed this review was undertaken and a lengthy report on debt collection was issued by omb in january 1981 which called for a number of changes including legislation of the type before us today h r 4613 in its present form makes three modest changes in current law which will help federal agencies to do a better job in administering programs which involved potential indebtedness first the bill permits heads of federal agencies to screen applicants for federal loans to determine whether they have a tax delinquent account to determine whether the applicants are creditworthy second the bill would permit federal agencies that administer certain federal loan programs to require applicants to furnish their taxpayer identifying numbers these numbers usually are the applicants social security numbers this provision will enable agencies to verify applicants identities and will help later if it becomes necessary to locate individuals to deal with indebtedness under present law heads of agencies may get irs mailing addresses of taxpayers for use in collecting or compromising federal claims the bill would permit the agency heads to redisclose irs addresses to agents who have contracted to do the actual work of collecting delinquent accounts it is the committees understanding that when these addresses are disclosed to a consumer reporting agency the disclosure will be made only for the purpose of allowing the preparation of a commercial credit report on the taxpayer for use by the federal agency trying to collect the debt the bill provides that the stringent safeguards and penalties that now apply to the information contained on tax returns will also apply to irs mailing addresses at the end of last year over 200 billion in debt was outstanding i must say that i do not have any great confldence in our management when i hear the range was somewhere between 218 billion and 239 billion but there is agreement that there was at least 33 billion delinquent now just as all taxpayers are going to be interested in paying their taxes only if they are actually assured that their fellow taxpayers pay their taxes so nobody is going to want to pay back the federal government for a past due debt unless they are sure that we have a rigid and fair and enforcible process available under our procedures i must say that a lot of this benefit is going to be derived from management changes and not from this legislation however the legislation makes a modest addition to the opportunities for collection that the government needs to the extent that millions of dollars can be collected which are owed to the federal government amounts which are not in dispute some pressure on the budget can be relieved this bill will help accomplish that purpose and i urge its passage"], [0.000525742769241333, 0.49947425723075867, 0, "it is a distinct pleasure to rise in strong support of the grammlatta bipartisan substitute and i wish to commend mr gramm and mr latta for their outstanding efforts on the budget committee to bring the presidents program to fruition i believe our president when he states that we have to have both the budget and the tax reductions he has asked for to make his economic program work i think it is only sensible to give his prescription a fair try now i would urge the more thoughtful members of congress to throw their full support behind the entire reagan programnot just half of it the president has given us a remarkable 100 days in office he has managed to turn the pourse of thinking around on how the federal government should perform his administration has shown an extraordinary sense of mission that has been missing in washington for many years the basic tenets of the reagan bipartisan budget arecorrect our president was voted into office because his program seersied to make sense to a majority of american voters the fact remains that the american people have not changed their minds since the overwhelming victory of the reagan team on november 4 therefore the reagan economic program deserves a chance the bipartisan substitute is a petition for congress to act boldly and to act now on a combination of steep cutbacks in federal spending and taxes in order to help curb inflation and rejuvenate the sickly american economy our president has issued strong plainspoken support for the bipartisan plan of spending cutbacks over the budget committee plan offered by congressman jones the key difference between tht grammlatta bipartisan budget and the jonescommittee budget is not only the difference in numbers and economic assumptions but the difference in the economic and political principles underlying the two documents as well the jones budget is a busitiessasusual budget which perpetuates the same basic structure and direction of the federal government if only in slightly lesser degrees the jones budget does not accept the reagan administrations challenge as to the direction and scope of government over the past two decades it iraplies that the reagan mandate can be satisfied through cosmetic alterations in the way the government does business in every basic area the jones budget represents too little too late the jones budget provides 20 billion less in tax relief next year it delays proposed reductions in taxes a full 6 months it provides only one third the individual tax relief recommended by the president over the next 3 years the jones budget hampers the administrations ability to implement blockgrant programs that will restore the authority and effebtiveness of state and local governments the jones budget provides for 25 billion more in spending than the bipartisan budget and 132 billion more over the next 3 years making full economic recovery more difficult to achieve if president reagan is to succeed in restraining federal spending many social programs will have to be trimmed back to their original intent of helping only the needy par too many programs inow offer handouts to those with incomes of 125 percent of the poverty level at substantial cost to taxpayers the administration has pledged to halt the momentum of wild spending but is being misrepresented as being a hardhearted crusader against the poor the accusations that the presidents plan is not a compassionate one are particularly offensive to me considering the staggering inflation rate and the increased taxes which have wreaked havoc on families across our nation it is falsehood against the economic recovery program that promises by subduing infiation to restore lost buying power to americans at all income levels iagain i urge my colleagues in the house to give the reagan ecoiimic recovery program a chance to work let us not turn our backs on this opportunity for change and return to the same tired old policies that we know do not work whether it is called an antiinflation program a budget balancing program an economic recovery program or the grammlatta bipartisan substitutethe main objective is the sameto restore the american economy to its former positien of strength and soundness"]]}
