in introducing this measure it is worth noting that mr waxman and mr gradison were also original cosponsors of the optional hospice measure and their continuing support in this effort is especially appreciated as you know hospice is a compassionate costeffective system of caring for the terminally ill that helps them remain in their homes and communities among family and friends over the past decade we have seen enormous growth in the hospice movement and today there are estimated to be over 1 500 hospice programs in operation throughout the country hospice provides an innovative means of care and support in which a team of health care workers and others strives to make the remainder of the lives of the terminally ill and the lives of their families during this very difficult time to be as meaningful and comfortable as possible serious lllnes is difficult at any time and terminal illness is much more physically emotionally spiritually and economically hospice helps to significantly relieve the burden in all of these areas not only is hospice compassionate and emotionally supportive for the terminally ill and their families as importani in this time when the need for cost containment is crucial it is costeffective as well it is widely concluded that the substitution of hospice for acute care can save significant amounts of money the congressional budget office has estimated that hospice coverage under medicare could save more than 100 million over 3 years and a report on hospice demonstration programs also concluded that hospice in addition to its compassionate care offers a cost savings in the last year of life with specific regard to a medicaid benefit illinois for example would save at least 1 million per year by a conservative estimate if it had such a benefit based on d creasing medicaid costs by at least 27 percent through less use of inpatient care this would result in significant savings to the federal government and the states over time additional evidence of hospices costeffectiveness is provided by several studies that have shown hjspice care saving 20 to 40 percent lien compared with traditional acute care and by the fact that numerous major health insurers have included a hospice benefit with little or no change in increase in premiums we must continue to encourage the development and utilization of costeffective communitybased forms of care such as hospice as we struggle to reduce the deficit when the legislation making hospice an option under medicaid was first introduced it was with the aim of making this form of care for the terminally ill available to those with low incomes and their families while the medicare benefit makes hospice available to the elderly and disabled and these groups comprise a large proportion of those who could benefit from hospice a need was seen to enable medicaid beneficiaries to have access to the same services the ranks of these persons now include unfortunately many aids patients and will include many more over time as we all know aids is the greatest epidemic and the worst public health problem to strike this country in this century and possibly in our entire history as of january 25 1988 there was total of 51 916 reported aids cases and 28 965 deaths as a result of the disease the public health service projects that by the end of 1991 there will have been a cumulative total of more than 270 000 aids cases in the united states and 180 000 deaths with fully 54 000 of these occurring in 1991 alone clearly much needs to be done to care for the rapidly growing number of persons who are going to become terminally ill and die of aids and to do this in the most costeffective and compassionate manner possible while many aids patients prefer to be cared for only or mostly at home there are a large number for whom hospice provides the most appropriate means of care in particular there is a large and rapidly growing group of intravenous drug abusers among aids patients and these persons often are homeless or have unstable living situations and cannot be adequately cared for at home for these persons in particular as well as many other aids patients hospice probably provides the best possible care during the terminal stages of the disease fiscal year 1988 budget reconciliation legislation includes a provision that will reimburse hospices for inpatient care for medicaid patients with aids even if these patients must spend more than 20 percent of their time in such a setting this in combination with the expansion of the hospice medicaid benefit provided by this bill should enable many more aids patients to receive the care they need in hospice programs rather than having to spend all of their time in expensive inpatient settings or worse end up in the streets or bad home situations and even with the greater need of aids hospice patients for inpatient care hospice can save considerable sums in san francisco which makes extensive use of hospice and other community based care it costs about 25 000 to care for aids patients during their last year of life in atlanta it would cost approximately 66 000 and in new york city 120 000 neither of these cities has extensive hospice programs in spite of the growing number of persons who could benefit from hospice care under the medicaid program especially with the aids crisis only five statesnew york michigan florida kentucky and north dakotahave so far created a medicaid h3spice benefit since the enactment of the option while several other states including california and illinois are also moving to create a medicaid hospice benefit and this is encouraging the other cosponsors and i believe that the current need is great enough to warrant making the hospice medicaid benefit mandatory this would rapidly speed up the process by which hospice services will become accessible to medicaid beneficiaries throughout the country the bill would become effective for calendar quarters beginning on or after january 1 1989 states would be allowed additional time to enact enabling legislation if necessary as will obviously be true in many cases we urge our colleagues to give

would like to take a few minutes to briefly summarize these recommended changes the first amendment strikes paragraph 2 c of rule x and by doing so deletes the current requirement that at the beginning of each congress representatives of the committee on government operations meet with representatives of other standing committees of the house to discuss and assist in coordinating oversight activities for the new congress and for the committee on government operations to publish a report to the house about such oversight activities within 60 days after the congress convenes because this same oversight information is submitted to the committee on house administration as part of each committees annual budget justifications and is published by the committee on house administration with the omnibus committee funding resolution elimination of this requirement that the committee on government operations must publish this report will not result in any lessening of the responsibilities of the committees of the house to determine at the start of each new congress what oversight responsibilities they intend to undertake in the coming 2 years rather this amendment to the rules of the house eliminates duplicative publications while at the same time ensures that a published record is available to the public regardingthe intentions of the committees of the house in fulfilling their oversight responsibilities the second amendment eliminates grandfather language in clause l e 1 c of rule x which was incorporated in the rules for those members who began service on the budget committee when it was constituted in august 1974 this amendment is technical in nature and affects no sitting member of congress the third amendment merely changes the name of the committee on science and technology to the committee on science space and technology by amending clause l r of rule x the fourth rules change is to clause 4 c of rule xi this rule currently allows any member of the committee on rules to call up a rule joint rule or order of business resolution reported from the committee on rules that has not been called up for consideration within 7 legislative days since that rule attaches a privileged status to such reports the member of the rules committee calling it up for con sideration is required to be recognized by the speaker except when matters of equal or higher privilege might be pending this rules change would require any member of the committee on rules seeking toecall up a rule joint rule or order of business resolution under the provisions of clause 4 c ofrule xi to have notified the house of his intention on the preceding day by requiring this notice the minority will still be entitled to call up pending rules as will any other member of the committee but the house will have advance notice of such members intention and the leadership can schedule the business of the day around that members intended action the fifth rules change expands upon an amendment adopted by the house in the 99th congress two years ago the house amended clause 5 f of rule xi to provide for automatic funding for all standing and certain select committees for the first 3 months of the first session of a congress this proposed rules change will make that automatic funding mechanism applicable to the first 3 months of the second session of a congress as well this amendment retains the funding entitlement which allows committees to spend for each month of the interim funding period 9 percent of the total annualized amount made available to each committee under the expense resolution for the committees for the preceding session of congress however this amendment goes one step beyond the language adopted 2 years ago by allowing the committee on house administration to establish interim funding at a lower percentage without adoption of an expense resolution authorizing such a lower level of funding this authority would be exercised by the committee on house administration if in its determination sufficient funds were not available to support a 9 percent monthly entitlement this authority could be used by the committee on house administration in order to comply witha sequestration order issued under the balanced budget and emergency delicit control act of 1985 or if insufficient funds are available to fund the committees at the 9 percent level the sixth rules change is the only proposed change that will significantly alter the way we do business in the house of representatives this amendment to rule xiv modifies the practices of the house to allow direct reference to the senate during house debate as members are aware jeffersons manual prohibits the direct reference to the senate by a member of the house of representatives during debate because jeffersons stands in force in the house like a house rule this prohibition has led to some very artful attempts to refer to the other body in those cases when a member does not make reference to the senate in an artful and circumlocutious manner the chair has the responsibil ity to admonish that member to abide by the restrictions embodied in jeffersons manual the amendment before members alters the current practice in the house and will allow factual reference to the senate its actions as well as its inactions bills resolutions and amendments and their senate sponsors and to the status of those bills resolutions and amendments the amendment doesnot however allow characterizations of the senate or its members and it does not allow expression of personal opinion about the senate or its members this amendment preserves and protects the spirit of jeffersons by recognizing that it would serve no useful purpose in the maintenance of comity between the two houses to allow the membership of the house to characterize or express personal opinion either good or bad but at the same time the amendment does recognize that we live in a modem world where immediacy of information compels us to take note of the actions of our colleagues on the other side of the capitol i believe this amendment will allow members the freedom to make necessary reference to the senate but will not allow for namecalling which would lessen the dignity of debate in the house the seventh amendment to the rules of the house amends clause 4 of rule xliii to increase from 35 to 50 or less the fair market value of a gift not including personal hospitality of an individual which may be accepted by a member officer or employee of the house in any calendar year not to be counted toward the aggregate of 100 or more in value which may be accepted directly or indirectly from any personother than a relativehaving direct interest in legislation before the congress or who is a foreign national or agent of a foreign national the eighth rules change proposes to amend clause 9 rule xliii to prohibit discrimination in employment by any member officer or employee of the house on the basis of age as well as on the basis of race color religion sex or national origin which are currently expressly prohibited in the rules of the house in the 99th congress amendments were adopted to the age discrimination in employment act to prohibit any age discrimination in employment the provisions of that act do not apply to congress and as a matter of constitutional separation of powers the

well as he looks toward the future and rumor has it he will contiunue in his role in ensuring that very important line in the preamble of our constitution providing for the common defense and he will
