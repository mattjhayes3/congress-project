yielding and organizing tonights special order last week the house of representatives failed to pass a budget by the statutorily mandated date of april 15 this failure is unfortunate for our budget process but perhaps not unfortunate for the american people because no budget is better than the proposed republican budget that would have been brought to the floor our nations budget reflects priorities but the republican budget only highlights the wrong priorities the budget the house republicans wanted to bring to the floor would be even more devastating to students working families and seniors than their previous proposals the republican budget would end the medicare guarantee for seniors by converting medicare into a voucher payment that would not keep pace with medical inflation shifting billions of dollars in medical costs onto our senior citizens the republican budget would repeal the affordable care act and would jeopardize the health insurance for millions of americans even though the budget assumes all of the revenue collected by the affordable care act to pay for the affordable care act all of those taxes remain in the budget the republican budget includes a total of 6 5 trillion in spending cuts largely unspecified if this level of cuts were ever made it would devastate our investments and jobs education research and would essentially eliminate any new transportation projects on top of these devastating cuts to vital programs that support and uplift hardworking american families the republican budget calls for trillions of dollars in tax cuts that would primarily benefit millionaires and billionaires and then they claim the tax cuts would be revenue neutral suggesting that we are to believe that trillions of dollars in new taxes would be imposed to pay for those tax cuts for the wealthy but despite this the republican budget is not a credible plan are we really going to dismantle medicare are we really going to cut hundreds of billions of dollars out of education and job training and transportation are we really going to raise trillions of dollars in new taxes to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy i dont think so but the house leadership couldnt even secure enough votes for this budget proposal because a faction of their conference wanted even deeper unrealistic spending cuts budgeting is about making tough choices and the only choice the republicans seem to have made with the budget proposal is that we can only balance the budget on the backs of students workers seniors the disabled and vulnerable communities across the nation while cutting taxes for the wealthy the congressional black caucus knows that is not the right choice that is why as we have done for the last 30 years we have diligently prepared our own budget alternative to the republican budget which we would have offered as an amendment to the republican budget if they had brought up their proposal the cbc budget chooses to invest in programs that we know will grow our economy and ensure that every american family is able to prosper our budget proposes a comprehensive jobs program totaling 500 billion over 3 years that will accelerate our economic recovery and ensure that it reaches virtually every community in america while also investing in what will guarantee americas longterm economic competitiveness this jobs plan includes funding for direct jobs creation programs school modernization jobs for teachers and first responders immediate investments in our nations crumbling infrastructure assistance for neighborhoods and families still reeling from the housing crisis job training programs and summer jobs our budget calls for significant and sustained investmentsapproximately 300 billion over the next decadeabove the presidents request for programs that have been instrumental in lifting millions of americans out of poverty some of these proposals include restoration of cuts to the supplemental nutrition assistance program expanding access to affordable housing increasing access to quality and affordable education increasing funding for job training and trade adjustment assistance adjusting the earned income tax credit and child tax credit to inflation as well as decreasing the age where you can benefit for the earned income tax credit down to 21 years of age thanks to the leadership of congressman jim clyburn our budget also ensures that federal resources are targeted more efficiently toward eradicating poverty by targeting federal spending toward persistent areas of poverty through the 102030 formula our budget also includes more than 340 billion above the presidents request for education over the next decade this additional money will help make college more affordable by increasing the pell grant fully funding the presidents free community college program reducing interest rates on student loans and financing other proposals to ensure that no student graduates from college saddled with unmanageable debt the cbc budget also provides muchneeded funding for families of flint michigan to help address the shortterm and longterm cognitive and behavioral development of children exposed to high lead levels however the congressional black caucus appreciates unfortunately that flint is not the only community in america impacted by lead exposure this is why our budget includes funds to help not only flint but also other communities across the nation deal with the effects of lead exposure unlike the republican budget the cbc budget clearly shows how we pay for these additional investments our budget sets a new revenue target of 4 trillion over the next 10 years above the current revenue baseline to demonstrate how this is achievable and realistic our budget suggests several specific alternatives totaling 7 trillion that the house and senate committees can choose from to reach that target we ask for 4 trillion in new additional and specifically outline at least 7 trillion to choose from we do this by specifically talking about closing specific corporate loopholes treating capital gains and dividends as regular income a reasonable fee for financial transactions restoring the estate tax to levels paid over a few years ago specific items where you can choose from and in fact if we just cancel the bushera tax cuts we would have almost 4 trillion in new revenue right there at the end of the day our budget realistically reduces the deficit by approximately 3 2 trillion over the next decade compared to the congressional budget offices march 2016 baseline the cbc budget chooses investments in americas children and workers protects our most vulnerable communities and changes the wrong choices offered by the republican majority i hope that we will have an opportunity to debate these issues if the house republicans are ever able to bring their roadtoruin budget to a full house vote again i thank the gentleman from new york for yielding"],

we support each other in times of need i just would like to also congratulate and acknowledge congressman hakeem jeffries the gentleman from new york who is also host of this special order i appreciate the opportunity to discuss an issue that is very personal to me before i begin i just want to say that my heart goes out to the families and friends of the victims of the horrible tragedy in orlando and i can only imagine what they are going through the other thing that is illuminating to me is that as we came here and stood up for a moment of silence after that moment of silence i believe members were given a 1minute opportunity to speak on any topic that they would like to on the floor as is customary and not one person from the other side of the aisle mentioned what happened in orlando so not only was it a moment of silence for the leadership in this house but it appears that it is going to be a moment that remains silent or a topic that remains silent from the other side of the aisle eliminating racialbased health disparities depends on our ability to advance access to affordable health care for all even in the 21st century health disparities are stark especially in the african american communities where life expectancies are lower and infant mortality rates are higher than among whites today despite improvement in overall health in the united states african americans and other minority populations lag behind in numerous health areas including access to quality care timelines of care and health outcomes for years the congressional black caucus has called on republicans to join us and other house democrats in developing a plan to eliminate racial health disparities a plan that addresses the causes of health disparities such as inequities in environmental social and economic conditions in our communities instead we get from them proposals like their socalled a better way poverty proposal a stale repackaging of failed policies presented under the guise of concern about americans trapped in poverty cutting job training programs food assistance and head start will push lowincome americans further into poverty making it even more difficult for them to access the affordable and quality health care needed to secure their wellbeing and the wellbeing of their families we need to instead use the government as a source of good every american deserves to live in a safe and healthy environment yet lowincome and minority communities are much more exposed to high levels of pollution resulting in serious health problems such as asthma heart problems and cancer this is a very real problem across america a very real problem in my district thirteen million people including 3 5 million children are concentrated in the vicinity of transportation facilities and are exposed to unhealthy levels of air pollution my district is home to the port newarkelizabeth marine terminal part of the port of new york and new jersey the third largest port in the country according to the epa 25 percent of children in newark suffer from asthmathree times the state average what we need are additional federal actions to reduce harmful air pollution from ports and congested components of the national freight transportation system the issue is critical to the lowincome and minority community who suffer the disproportionately adverse health effects of these environmental hazards now since i am on the topic of environmental justice i just want to remind everyone that the republicans continue to block any action to help the thousands of children facing lifelong damage from drinking poisoned water in flint including a vote to block the families of flint act emergency supplemental their radical refusal to address this health issue will have tragic consequences for american families and i think it is representative of their overall inadequate approach to health disparities in minority communities the way to eliminate racial health disparities is neither to downplay them nor to cut programs that will assist the most vulnerable it is to address the environmental social and economic conditions that exacerbate those disparities it is to expand access to quality health care that could eliminate or reduce the onset of many of these chronic illnesses and disproportionate health outcomes it is to maintain and strengthen our investments in healthcare access and resources for disadvantaged populations in closing i also want to stress that health education must also be a focus in any efforts to eliminate racialbased health disparities african americans and other communities are disproportionately affected by poor providerpatient communication and health literacy issues consequently they often do not have access to information that enables them to make the appropriate health decisions we have a responsibility to work with our healthcare institutions and community health centers to make it easier for people to find understand and use the information and services as cochair of the congressional mens health caucus i have hosted and participated in a number of outreach events in my district to engage directly with constituents about the importance of making positive health decisions and staying proactive about their health and wellbeing so i encourage everyone watching at home to get the information you need to make smart health decisions to get the security you and your family deserve and to get the health care that we all need"], [0.0013436079025268555,

forward to tonights special order hour congressman jeffries and i along with our colleagues from the congressional black caucus will have scholarly debate on how our democracy is in crises because of the assault on the right to vote in america as we just heard from mr jeffries and we will hear from others voting is the voice of the people the voting rights act of 1965 passed with bipartisan support established strong federal protections for the freedom to vote banning or limiting many of the discriminatory election policies and practices of the jim crow south combined with subsequent legislation such as the national voter registration act which requires state agencies to provide opportunities for voter registration the voting rights act has helped our nation make significant progress in boosting voting for african americans and other historically marginalized groups but we find ourselves today facing our first presidential election in 50 years without the full protection of the voting rights act as mr jeffries referenced in shelby the supreme court decision reversed over 50 years of progress made to expand access to the voting booth and opened a pathway to new voting laws that discriminate against african american voters as a result of shelby new voting restrictions have been put in place in 22 states 18 of them republicanled since 2010 making it harder for millions of americans to exercise their right to vote the way states have been able to reduce the voting power of minority communities and put in place new voting restrictions in an effort to make it harder for millions of americans to vote is appalling our democracy is in crisis our right to vote is under assault why would we want to make it harder for americans to vote i believe we should be making it easier for americans to have access to the ballot box but apparently some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle do not agree we need to put forth a vote on the voting rights act now new laws range from strict photo id requirements to early voting cutbacks to registration restriction among these 16 states with new voting restrictions is my home state of ohio in ohio in 2014 lawmakers cut 6 days of early voting and eliminated the golden week during which voters could register and cast a ballot all in one trip of course ohio is not alone in its efforts to make it harder for americans to vote the freedom to vote is one of americas most constitutionally guaranteed rights and it should be easily accessible to those who want to exercise it that is why i am honored this congress to serve as the deputy vice chair of the newly created congressional voting rights caucus a caucus dedicated to protecting our democracy by ensuring the fundamental right to vote is safeguarded for all americans however after a longstanding tradition of bipartisanship on voting protections house republicans now refuse to bring either bill to the floor for a vote this is unthinkable the voting rights act of 1965 has been reauthorized with bipartisan support five times congress has a duty to ensure elections are free and transparent so that all eligible voters feel comfortable and welcome i would echo president obamas february 13 2013 statement on the voting rights act and let me quote we must all do our part to make sure our godgiven rights are protected that includes one of the most fundamental right of a democracy the right to vote when any american no matter where they live or what their party are denied that right we are betraying our ideals there are 168 days until the presidential election and our democracy still has far too many missing voices particularly among those who are already at a disadvantage due to deeply rooted racial and class barriers in our society we must ensure that voter suppression is not the new normal in order to have a truly vibrant democracy the united states must take steps to ensure inclusive voting by reducing barriers to voting efforts to suppress voting turnout undermine democracy and those efforts are on the wrong side of history as i close the time is now i am calling on all people including our community and national leaders to join me in working to eliminate voter suppression and to restore what so many people fought for marched for died for that is the voting rights act human rights organizations like the naacp and the leadership conference on civil and human rights have been at the forefront of these issues along with my colleagues members of the congressional black caucus

hakeem jeffries from the eighth district of new york he is a member of the house judiciary committee he continues to be a tireless advocate for social justice working to reform our criminal justice system and to eliminate the overcriminalization of the african american community we are here to discuss the current state of voting rights in america which unfortunately are under assault the freedom to vote is one of americas most fundamentally constitutionally guaranteed rights it was 51 years ago this month that over 600 peaceful orderly protesters set off to march from selma alabama to the state capitol in montgomery to demonstrate the need for voting rights in the state last week our congressional black caucus chair chairman butterfield stated at the first in a series of cbc hearings about the current state of voting rights in america and that the voting rights act of 1965 is probably one of the most significant pieces of legislation that was ever passed in the united states congress certainly as we know in 2013 the unitedstates supreme court struck down this crucial provision of the voting rights act in the shelby county v holder decision our work continues because by invalidating section 4 of the voting rights act the supreme court opened the doors for ways to reduce the voting power of minority communities and it put in place new voting restrictions in an effort to make it harder for millions of americans to vote our democracy has far too many missing voices particularly those who are already at a disadvantage due to deeprooted racial and class barriers in our society by exercising our right we can do great things we can hold this country accountable we can advocate for legislation that supports social and economic progress equality and fairness for all americans we can champion policies that create and sustain jobs and that protect against cuts to social and economic programs that are vital to our most atrisk populations we can move forward on efforts to address the schooltoprison pipeline and criminal justice reform we know that the inequalities in access to quality health care still exist between races and that more and more black children are victims of failing schools i am calling on all citizens including on our community and national leaders to join the congressional black caucus to work to eliminate voter suppression and to restore what so many people fought for marched and died foryes the voting rights act it is up to all of us to protect the most atrisk among us and to expand opportunity for all people that begins with passing a voting rights act our work still continues this week we are celebrating womens history month and i must note the powerful impact that african american women are having at the polls in the past two presidential elections black women led all demographic groups in voter turnout that is why voting matters to african american communities black women make up the most dynamic segment of the rising american voters a great civil rights leader said that women are among the greatest leaders of social reform and they are fighting literally fighting for their political rights this past saturday i had the opportunity to be with the mothers of the movement we know who they are they are the mothers of trayvon martin eric garner dontre hamilton jordan davis sandra bland and hadiya pendleton and we have all heard what happened to their children as a member of the congressional black caucus we are calling for action on gun control we need to do more than just stand up on this floor for a moment of silence we need to make sure that we are passing gun control legislation commonsense legislation that keeps the guns out of the hands of the most dangerous individuals it is time for us to protect our children i am going to give you some examples of what we should include in our call for action i go first to my good friend and colleague and classmate who brought it to my attention that we stand up for a moment and then we sit down then we come back to this floor and it is business as usual we talk about wanting to keep our families safe and we talk about the mental health issues that is all we do we talk about it congresswoman robin kelly of illinois second district has legislation h r 224 which would require the surgeon general of public health services to submit to congress an annual report on the effects of gun violence on public health this bill has 140 democrat cosponsors i am asking my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to step up and do more than just stand up for 30 seconds i am calling on congress to act on congressman james clyburn of the sixth district of south carolinas legislation h r 3051 the background check completion act which would guarantee that no gun is sold by a licensed dealer until a background check is completed i am very proud to say that i am a cosponsor of both of these bills i will go on and tell you about chairman butterfield the chair of our congressional black caucus he understands that our work continues because he has focused his efforts on promoting antipoverty programs and on expanding economic development and job creation there are a number of things that have happened in his state for example the moral mondays are protests in north carolina that are led by religious progressives these protests are in response to several actions by the government of north carolina which was elected into office in 2013 these events which spread throughout the south helped bring attention to voting rights criminal justice reform and workers rights i think it is very important for us to note that tonight my coanchor and i will talk about a number of issues that explain why our work continues we are going to talk about why in african american communities it is important for us to understand if we dont diversify those who are going to vote we dont represent the diversity of this great america that we are here to protect and to serve 2030 it is not just members of the congressional black caucus who value and understand the importance of us coming together the importance of us celebrating our rich history all tied to the voting rights act all tied to the movements that we have had of the past let me give you a great example because i am so proud that i am going to have the privilege to

thank my colleagues congressman donald payne and congresswoman robin kelly for leading this evenings critical discussion on the state of black health a congressional black caucus assessment during national minority health month it is no surprise that we are here today because certainly we have had many firsthand experiences to know the disparities that exist across all americans but more specifically across african american communities to you mr payne thank you for having the foresight to come tonight and to you congresswoman kelly thank you for taking a leadership position in helping us share with the nation the value and the importance of protecting all lives but giving information to the nation about the state of black health it is imperative that we continue to address health disparities that affect racial minorities and work together on the efforts to advance health equity since july 1971 the congressional black caucus has sponsored national conferences and held brain trusts on black health it is so timely that we have this discussion as we observe national minority health month tonight is a call to action a charge for all of us to unite towards a common goal of improving the health of our communities everyone in america should be able to live a healthy life regardless of the color of their skin the good news is the overall health of an american has improved over the past few decades this is in part due to the increased focus on preventive medicine and dynamic new advances in medical technology however not all americans have benefited equally from healthcare improvements since the enactment of the affordable care act millions of americans now have access to quality affordable coverage according to the american medical association recent studies have shown that despite the steady improvement in overall health of the united states racial and ethnic minorities experience a lower quality of health services and are less likely to receive routine medical procedures and have higher rates of morbidity and mortality than nonminorities disparities in health care exist even when controlling for gender condition age and socioeconomic status for example cardiovascular diseases account for the largest proportion of inequality in life expectancy between african americans and nonhispanic whites according to the american cancer society african american women have a 44 percent higher death rate from breast cancer despite having a mammography screening rate that is nearly the same rate for white women according to the centers for disease control the cdc the infant death rate among african americans is still more than double that of whites tonight you are going to hear my colleagues and i discuss much data and statistics because i am from the great state of ohio and ohio ranks 47th in the nation in infant mortality with black infants dying at twice the rate of white infants according to a 2015 study conducted by the kaiser family foundation in ohio on average 14 5 black infants die per every 1 000 live births while 6 3 white infants die ohio community leaders and the greater columbus infant mortality task force are working hard to lower franklin countys infant mortality rate and the infant mortality rate in all of ohio tonight i salute them for their research for their education and for their consistency to save lives the statistics are staggering and we can and must do more to lower and eliminate them the societal burden of healthcare disparities in america manifest in multiple and major ways for example a 2014 study by the joint center for political and economic studies concluded that the combined costs of health inequalities and premature death in the united states were 1 24 trillion that 1 24 trillion is the cost between 2003 and 2006 that is why on march 23 2010 when president barack obama signed the affordable care act it was a monumental step that has helped us address the overwhelming statistics and health disparities within our community i proudly supported the affordable care act because lives matter all lives matter black lives matter now we have comprehensive healthcare reform that improves access to affordable health coverage and guarantees that the most vulnerable in our communities have access to care by improving access to quality health care for all americans the affordable care act helps reduce health disparities how does the affordable care act do this this law invests in prevention and wellness gives individuals more control over their care and expands initiatives to increase racial and ethnic diversity in healthcare professions by strengthening cultural competency training for all healthcare providers and improving communications between providers and patients the affordable care act represents the most significant federal effort to reduce disparities in this countrys history congressman payne and congresswoman kelly again i salute you i am going to repeat that because it is so important for us to let the nation know that the affordable care act represents the most significant federal effort to reduce disparities in this countrys history the affordable care act also increases funding for community health centers which serve an estimated one in three lowincome people and one in four lowincome minority residents there are over 43 community health centers in ohio including many in my district columbus neighborhood health centers heart of ohio family health centers and lower lights christian health centers these community health centers provide outstanding primary care dental behavioral health and pharmacy services in our most underserved areas in 2013 community health centers provided care to over 550 000 ohioans and recorded over 2 million patient visits we have come a long way but there is still much more for us to do all people should have the opportunity to reach their fullest potential for health we must continue to move forward to combat health disparities build healthier communities and create a stronger country in order to have a successful nation i believe we must have a healthy nation let me leave you with something a national figure once said if you neglect to recharge a battery it dies if you run full speed ahead without stopping for water you lose momentum to finish the race let us make sure that all americans can finish the race"], [0.0013514161109924316, 0.9986485838890076, 1, "there is no doubt how much i appreciate the congressional black caucus and congresswoman beatty and congressman jeffries for always being timely in allowing us to give a message to our colleagues we hope maybe the american people will hear us but we accept that this body is the body to which and to whom we speak so i am thankful for that i want to pay tribute overall to the congressional black caucus because we are actually here speaking of health disparities because it was the caucus that triggered this debate through the years that we have been trying to get universal access to health care and was the moving force in the 2009 2008 and 2010 passage ultimately of the affordable care act where the work that we did joining congresswoman donna christianchristiansen at that time and frank pallone on the congressional health caucus but on the cbc we had the health disparities task to ensure that the language in the affordable care act addressed the issue of health disparities there was a large section on that that built on some of the work that some of us had already done creating the office of minority health that i had worked on in years past so it was the lightning bolt of the caucus and then working with the congressional asian pacific american caucus and then the congressional hispanic caucus that we raised the issue that no one was talking about i remember debating on the floor of the house on the issues of dealing with senior citizen african american men and how they access health care how do women access health care and how do women impacted by diabetes access health care these are some of the diseases that have a proclivity to the african american population we were finding out that we even had an issue where medical professionals didnt know how to ask the questions how do you address someone who needs to be diagnosed for prostate cancer or may be diagnosed for prostate cancer and is an african american male a senior citizen my father ultimately died from cancer that metastasized from the prostate to the lungs and the brain so we knew we had a serious issue so today i want to mention four points but i am going to focus on the last one obesitya question of access to health care and physical fitness many times we live in areas where there is no access to a pool or a tennis court mental healthif you lived your life in a segregated america if you were called boy and girl it is a different mental health situation than maybe others may have faced if you live in a situation of poverty of a single household maybethis is not across the boardthese issues will be impacted if you lived around gun violence if you saw your 15yearold friend being shot dead in the street there is a question of mental health that we need access to that care for us to be able to reach out or maybe counselors to be able to provide for children hiv aids is something that we have lived through i remember going to funerals of friends in the 1980s and into the 1990s particularly with hiv aids so we have worked in the congressional black caucus to massively talk about testing let me get to this point that i want to dwell just for a moment on and that is gun violence i was here on the floor earlier with my head held down and my heart heavy as my district today had a memorial they had one yesterday we will have one tomorrow and have one on wednesday i mourn with congresswoman corinne brown of florida we are offering legislation dealing with the assault weapons and to complement legislation already passed or already in place but it is important to note that this is a health issue because the centers for disease control can assess and study every health issue that faces america today but they are legislatively by law prohibited by my friends on other side of the aisle by republicans disallowed every year to give them permission to study gun violence gun violence is killing our children and killing our families in orlando it killed latinos who happened to be the attendees at the pulse club the lgbtq community was the dominant community and a hateful terroristic act using ar15s and glock guns killed them the incident was the deadliest mass shooting the next deadliest incidents in recent history were april 16 2007 virginia tech 32 killed 17 injured december 14 2012 sandy hook 26 killed 1 injured october 16 1991 killeen texas 23 killed 27 injured according to everytown index of mass shootings where four or more people are shot and killed the incident was the ninth mass shooting in the united states in 2016 and the 150th mass shooting in united states since january 1 2009 the mass shooting with guns impacts both the mental health the sanctity and the minority community it is shameful that we are not allowed to engage in the kind of research that a harvard professor talked about and that is the assessing of violence and the assessing of violence with guns the materials i have before me make it very clear that most of these violent acts are done with gunsdone with guns san bernardino chattanooga charleston garland oak creek and fort hood were all done with guns so i stand here today to challenge this issue of health disparities to say that the heavy brunt of killings singular killings are impacted by poverty lack of access to health care the proliferation of guns in our inner city communities and the failure of the united states congress to put real gun safety legislation closing the loophole the jim clyburn rule that says that if you dont get the review and approval by atf you do not get the gun you have to wait until you get the approval from atf which may be trying to determine whether this person with multiple problems mental health or background issues doesnt need to get a gun and then ultimately go kill their spouse their children their neighbors their family members or strangers so it is my belief today that this health disparities debate is crucial and we should come away from here recognizing that obesity the issues of mental health and hiv aids can be with great investment researched for cures or cancer that proliferates in our community triple negative breast cancer legislation that i have put forward and have gotten passed about that impact but it is the gun violence that we are doing absolutely nothing about the disparities and the impact on minority communities is atrocious i want to close simply by saying the word or the acronym lgbtq community i want to say it over and over again because i think it is shameful that in our debate in our recognition of the tragedy of orlando that we dont acknowledge the horrific hate crime and the hatefulness against that community as i stand here that community is diverse and there are african americans who are lgbtq so i would ask that as we move forward this week we will be reminded of this hatefulness and we will have a cure we will be reminded of this violence and we will have a cure that cure first of all will be to restrain the use of assault weapons and these weapons of wartype bullets that men and women in the united states military say have no business on the streets of america i believe congresswoman that health disparities are an important wall and division to overcome i thank the gentlewoman for having this special order to ensure that we will confront these issues and try to save lives racial disparities refer to the variation in rates of disease occurrence and disabilities between socioeconomic and or geographically defined population groups i want to focus on four areas of racial disparities in health that impact african americans that we can do something about 1 obesity 2 mental health 3 hiv aids and 4 gun violence african americans based on 2015 census data comprise 13 2 percent of the unitedstates population or about 42 million people socioeconomic status in turn is linked to mental health people who are impoverished homeless incarcerated or have substance abuse problems are at higher risk for poor mental health as the founder and chair of the congressional childrens caucus i am especially concerned about the childhood obesity epidemic among africanamerican youth more than 40 percent of african american teenagers are overweight and nearly 25 percent are obese the percentage of children aged 611 years in the united states who were obese increased from 7 percent in 1980 to nearly 18 percent in 2012 african american youth are consuming less nutritious foods such as fruits and vegetables and are not getting enough physical exercise this combination has led to an epidemic of obesity which directly contributes to numerous deadly or lifethreatening diseases or conditions including the following hypertension dyslipidemia high cholesterol or high triglyceride levels type 2 diabetes coronary heart disease stroke gallbladder disease osteoarthritis asthma bronchitis sleep apnea and other respiratory problems cancer breast colon and endometrial when ethnicity and income are considered the picture is even more troubling african american youngsters from lowincome families have a higher risk for obesity than those from higherincome families efforts such as the lets move campaign by the first lady are pivotal to ensuring that communities are able to provide healthy snacks and food and encourage healthier decisions since the mid1970s the prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased sharply for both adults and children nonhispanic blacks have the highest ageadjusted rates of obesity at 47 8 percent according to the cdc 37 6 percent of men and 56 9 percent of women twenty years and over are obese every year more than 40 million americans struggle with mental illness african american men are as likely as anyone else to have mental illness but they are less likely to get help racism continues to have an impact on the mental health of african americans negative stereotypes and attitudes of rejection have decreased but continue to occur with measurable adverse consequences historical and contemporary instances of negative treatment have led to a mistrust of authorities many of whom are not seen as having the best interests of african americans in mind according to the department of health and human services office of minority health adult blacks are 20 percent more likely to report serious psychological distress than adult whites adult blacks living below poverty are two to three times more likely to report serious psychological distress than those living above poverty adult blacks are more likely to have feelings of sadness hopelessness and worthlessness than are adult whites how african americans view mental health over generations is a major barrier to accessing mental health services and treatment in 1996 mha commissioned a national survey on clinical depression the survey explored the barriers preventing americans seeking treatment and gauged overall knowledge of and attitudes toward depression this survey revealed that 63 percent of african americans believe that depression is a personal weakness this is significantly higher than the overall survey average of 54 percent only 31 percent of african americans believed that depression was a health problem african americans were more likely to believe that depression was normal than the overall survey average 56 percent believed that depression was a normal part of aging 45 percent believed it was normal for a mother to feel depressed for at least two weeks after giving birth 40 percent believed it was normal for a husband or wife to feel depressed for more than a year after the death of a spouse many of these problems persist to this day as doctor william lawson of howard university and mhas district of columbia affiliate pointed out in an npr interview in 2012 many africanamericans have a lot of negative feelings about or not even aware of mental health services the mental health culture race and ethnicity supplement to the 1999 unitedstates surgeon generals report on mental health states the following africanamerican physicians are five times more likely than white physicians to treat africanamerican patients africanamerican patients who see africanamerican physicians rate their physicians styles of interaction as more participatory african americans seeking help for a mental health problem would have trouble finding african american mental health professionals in 1998 only 2 percent of psychiatrists 2 percent of psychologists and 4 percent of social workers said they were african americans the public mental health safety net of hospitals community health centers and local health departments are vital to many african americans especially to those in highneed populations african americans of all ages are underrepresented in outpatient treatment but overrepresented in inpatient treatment few africanamerican children receive treatment in privately funded psychiatric hospitals but many receive treatment in publicly funded residential treatment centers for emotionally disturbed youth in 2012 there were an estimated 356 268 inmates with severe mental illnesses in unitedstates prisons and jails there were only 35 000 mentally ill individuals in state psychiatric hospitals the report the treatment of persons with mental illness in prisons and jails jails in 44 of the 50 states and the district of columbia a prison or jail in that state holds more individuals with serious mental illness than the largest remaining state psychiatric hospital the report said african americans today are overrepresented in our jails and prisons people of color account for 60 percent of the prison population the stanford law school three strikes projects report stated that over the past 15 years the number of mentally ill people in prison in california has almost doubled in california 45 percent of state prison inmates have been treated for severe mental illness within the past year african americans also account for 14 percent of regular drug users but for 37 percent of drug arrests illicit drug use is frequently associated with selfmedication among people with mental illnesses in january 2014 the texas observer reported that of the 9 000 inmates in harris county jail more than 25 percent take medication for mental illness which means that the jail treats more psychiatric patients than all 10 of texas staterun public mental hospitals combined the passage of the affordable care act created access to health care for those who purchase health insurance and for the poor living in states that are participating in the medicaid component of the aca disparities can occur if physicians do not refer patients with signs of mental illness for proper treatment or if referred patients do not seek out treatment disparities in access to care and treatment for mental illnesses have also persisted over time as noted by the office of minority health only 8 7 percent of adult blacks versus 16 percent of adult whites received treatment for mental health concerns in 20072008 only 6 2 percent of adult blacks versus 13 9 percent of adult whites received medications for mental health concerns during 2008 while 68 7 percent of adult whites with a major depressive episode in 2009 received treatment only 53 2 percent of adult blacks did the affordable care act will have an impact on this gap by 2016 depression and other mental illness can be deadly if left untreated suicide is the third

hiv aids texas has the 10th highest number of hiv diagnoses in 2013 and ranks 18th for deaths from hiv currently 14 percent of the people living with hiv are undiagnosed and only 30 percent of the people with hiv are virally suppressed which means that 70 percent of the people who are ill are not on medication that can help limit their ability to infect others hiv is an unnecessarily disproportionate burden on the african american and latino community there is a wall of misinformation about the illness and an uncomfortable silence regarding the need to speak about the illness not only to the young but also the older persons when treatments were first developed in the 1990s they had lots of side effects that made patients very ill few talk about the advances in hiv treatment that now involve taking 2 small pills a day with the result leaving patients feeling healthy and able to engage in lifes normal activities the virus count for those who take their medication is so low that it often does not register in tests this does not mean that people are cured but it does mean that there is no reason not to get tested so that you know if you are in need of treatment anyone can become infectedso it is up to all of us to educate our families neighbors coworkers and friends about getting tested there are some insurance company practices that have a detrimental impact on the ability of people with hiv to enroll in qualified health insurance plans in states like texas that are not fully participating in the affordable care acts medicaid expansion this is especially problematic for hiv patients who are poor some states allow insurance carriers to post misleading or intentionally vague formularies on market place websites or excluding essential hiv medications from drug formularies and impressing high cost sharing out of pocket medication cost each month should be capped"], [0.0013578534126281738, 0.9986421465873718, 1, "i thank the gentlewoman for yielding

for those in poverty but it will also be good for all the rest of us they will help build a better economy they will help grow jobs and they will help america be stronger i am honored to join my friend chairwoman barbara lee of the democratic whips task force on poverty income inequality and opportunity for this special order i also want to thank chairman cleaver of the cbcs poverty and economy task force for the work that it has done in this area poverty is bad for your health poverty is bad for your mental health poverty is bad for children poverty is bad for families more than 50 years after president johnson declared unconditional war on poverty 46 million americans are still struggling in poverty that is not to say we havent made some progress there are programs we have adopted frankly medicare is a tremendous poverty program our seniors are better off and far less of them are in poverty because of medicare medicaid is a critical program to make sure that those who cannot afford it are nevertheless given health care which is important for all of us to have healthy citizens with whom we deal on a daily basis ours may be the wealthiest nation on earth but we can best measure americas economic success not by how many are at the very top but how few are stuck at the bottom of the economic ladder by that measure we have a long way to go to fulfill americas promise as a land of equal opportunity and of success even in 2015 the lines between rich and poor trace the old divides of race and background with 29 percent of native americans 26 percent of african americans and 23 percent of latinos living in poverty poverty also strikes of course our rural communities in fact in many respects there is more poverty in our rural communities than in our cities and urban communities it is more visible in our cities because they are aggregated although we ought not to forget that literallyas i just mentioned about minoritiesmillions and millions of nonminorities struggle in poverty every day poverty strikes children at a higher rate unfortunately one in five children in america as our leader says the task force we launched and which barbara lee chairs has been working hard to raise awareness in congress of these very real and very difficult challenges of poverty in america and to provoke policies that help alleviate suffering in the short term while working to eradicate poverty over the long term speaker ryan has raised poverty as an issue on which he is focused and he has visited areas of poverty in our country we could recognize poverty we can visit those in poverty but what it is important to do and what barbara lee is leading us to do is to adopt policies that almost eliminate reduce and empower those in poverty the number one rule on the war on poverty of course ought to be first do no harm this means making sure that we refrain from disinvesting in the critical programs that serve the poor and help millions stave off hunger homelessness and disease we ought to have those criteria in mind when we consider the appropriations bills tax bills and other policies that affect our people thankfully the recent bipartisan budget deal prevented the return of sequestrations severe and painful automatic cuts which would have disproportionately harmed the most vulnerable in our economy now congress has a responsibility to follow that up by passing an omnibus and avert a shutdown however not doing further harm is not enough congress has a responsibility first and foremost to help create jobs that put americans back to work and enable them to rise out of poverty and as congressman coleman watson indicated to make sure that when we ask people and give people the opportunity to work we value that work and pay them a living wage we cannot enable people to rise out of poverty if it keeps lurching from one manufactured crisiswhen i say it our policies here in congress on budgets on debt on investment and on taxesto the next if we lurch from one crisis to another we will not be able to succeed in enabling and empowering those currently in poverty we need to work together to invest in education workforce training and innovation to make our workforce more competitive and open doors of opportunity for those looking to get hired we also need to expand assistance for housing and nutrition as well as access to health care especially for children poverty need not be a cycle and should not be a cycle from generation to generation that is debilitating certainly for them but we ought to all recognize it is debilitating for us our communities and our country the promise of america has always been that this cycle can be broken that is what we think about america even if you are born in circumstances that are tough if you work hard and play by the rules you can rise above it we need to make sure that we give them that opportunity we need to take steps to make sure that hard work pays off that those who have jobs can earn enough not only to get by but to get ahead this means making child care more affordable for working parents enacting paid leave to care for sick loved ones and raising the minimum wage the new speaker mr ryan has indicated he takes very seriously the issue of poverty as i said i hope we can work together to address that problem in a serious responsible and effective manner not to do so would be a grave disservice to the future of our country and its people one area he has suggested we might find agreement is in expanding the earned income tax credit to childless adults which could lift an additional half a million americans out of poverty in addition to that we ought to index the itc we ought to index the child tax credit and we ought to index the opportunity tax credit so that we can empower and enable those who are working those who have children that we want wellcared for and safe to be more productive citizens i thank again chairwoman barbara lee and all

"thank you congressman payne i did want to say to i appreciate you participating in the diversity dinners last week i cant have congressman payne have a oneup on me so thank you so much i really appreciate it as we continue our conversation on accountability equality and diversity i would like to offer some statistics on our economy 50 years ago and today with respect to the african american community and women in 1965 african american jobseekers could be denied employment based on the color of their skin and when they could find jobs they were disproportionately paid less than white males in the same position in fact in 1965 the black unemployment rate was 8 1 percent almost twice the national unemployment rate which stood at 4 5 percent fifty years later we have made great strides and our nations workforce is more diverse than ever but we have much more work to do today at 10 4 percent the black unemployment rate is still almost double the national unemployment rate of 5 6 percent while it is significantly smaller there is still a racial wage gap the median african american household has less than twothirds the income of the average white median household in the past year we have seen the greatest economic growth in decades more and more women have been able to enter the workforce reducing the employment rate among women to a 6year low unfortunately black women have yet to reap the benefits of the economic rebound in fact while the overall unemployment rate for women declined the black female unemployment rate has increased over the past 2 months according to a recent analysis by the national womens law center the black womens unemployment rate is more than twice the unemployment rate of white women despite having comparable levels of education black women have had the highest unemployment rate of any other group a possible factor in the stubborn unemployment rate for black women is that we are disproportionately employed in the public sector which is experiencing a much slower recovery than the private sector nwlc said the stagnant job situation for black women is a red flag in the employment landscape and urged lawmakers to act to promote a stronger more widely shared recovery i couldnt agree more we need to invest more in job training and retraining programs that help black women adapt to the changing workforce and prepare for the careers of tomorrow we must work to promote diversity in hiring and encourage employers to model their workforces on the communities in which they operate as we look for ways to help increase diversity in the workplace and help women succeed we must be mindful of the unique challenges black women face and develop targeted policies that help level the playing field for all women these facts i have just covered point to the systemic problems we need to address them today it should be our mission today to see to it that in 50 years when lawmakers stand here they will proudly be touting the progress our nation has made because all americans are paid equally and no is discriminated against in the workplace as chair of the congressional black caucus health braintrust i am working to address our nations health equity gap by exploring legislative and policy initiatives to reduce minority health disparities and promote better health outcomes for all americans with respect to the african american community the health disparity gap is particularly wide as blacks have high rates of many adverse health conditions across the medical spectrumfrom cancer to diabetes from hypertension to strokeblacks are overrepresented and often undertreated a major barrier to african americans getting the medical care they need is the lack of african american doctors in their communities studies show that african americans are more comfortable seeking treatment from doctors who look like them and are much more likely to adhere to courses of treatment prescribed by black doctors yet while african americans comprise 13 percent of the unitedstates population we represent only 4 percent of the physician workforce according to the association of american medical colleges 2014 diversity in the physician workforce report the infamous tuskegee study fostered an enduring legacy of mistrust of the medical establishment in the african american community that makes diversity in medicine vital to closing the health disparities gap in order to achieve health equity we must work to create a physician workforce that reflects our nation one key way to do that is to encourage more african americans to pursue education and training in science technology engineering and math congress must do more to support investments in stem education and to create avenues of access for african american students to enter the stem fields in my district i launched the second congressional district stem academy to expose students to stem fields in hopes of encouraging them to pursue stemrelated careers also a stem workforce made up of diverse ranks is crucial to future innovation to help in that mission folks across the country and in silicon valley have taken note i know facebook has sought to change the face of innovation through efforts like their facebook academy and facebook university which target high school and college students from underrepresented groups similar to my stem academy it is good to see them making an effort to build a pipeline and introduce women and people of color to jobs in stemwhich of course could be it engineeringand hopefully more young people decide to become doctors and they can work in african american communities or underserved communities a medical student population that reflects our countrys population will create a pipeline of diverse doctors to our communities which will in turn put all americans on track to live a healthier life i turn back to my colleague from new jersey congressman donald payne"],

you so much hopefully our amendment will hold in the conference report but if it doesnt it is certainly not because you havent worked hard and have not been committed to reducing and eliminating childhood poverty i am pretty confident that we are going to win this one thank you again for being here with us tonight and for your leadership i would like to come down and put some charts up in the well and speak so that the statistics will be very visible before the public as it relates to the poverty rates in the united states first let me just say mr hoyer our whip talked about the 50th anniversary this year of president johnsons war on poverty now this war on poverty included such initiatives as medicare medicaid head start the higher education act and the department of housing and urban development there was a very important immigration billyou name its0 years ago this legislation the war on poverty really has helped to reduce our poverty rates in the united states poverty has fallen from 26 percent in 1967 to 15 percent in 2015 yet we have a long way to go it is not time to end this war on poverty actually it is time to increase our efforts to make sure that the 47 million people living in poverty have access to all of these initiatives that were begun 50 years ago that really have lifted families out of poverty and have prevented families from moving into poverty that is very important to remember about this 50th year anniversary the supplemental nutrition assistance program for example snap that has kept nearly 5 million americans including 2 2 million children out of poverty in 2014 that is why we do not want to see any more cuts to this program social security benefits kept 1 2 million children out of poverty in 2013 medicaid kept nearly 3 million people out of poverty in 2014 programs beyond the war on poverty like the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit which congresswoman delauro and whip hoyer spoke about these two initiatives these two policies and programs have kept nearly 10 million americans including 5 million children out of poverty in 2014 alone these programs strengthen our economy increase opportunity for families and provide millions of americans with pathways out of poverty we have tried to make sure that our republican colleagues understand these facts and not gut these critical programs because they are extremely important we do not need to continue to fund tax breaks and giveaways to corporations and the wellconnected while so many people are still living below the poverty line stealing aid to the poor and handing more to the rich is really shameful and utterly unacceptable we need to come together to really begin to recognize that we have got to lift people out of poverty and create a level playing field so that everyone can have the opportunity to live the american dream cuts to these programs not only cost our government more moneythe taxpayers in the long runbut it is really morally wrong to cut these programs now as a former food stamp recipient myself and public assistance recipient i know firsthand just how important these safety net programs are i would not be here today if it were not for that lifeline that bridge over troubled waters that these types of programs extended to me when i was a single mother on welfare raising two amazing sons trying to get my life together so that i could move on and take care of my family and live the american dream believe me i know no one wants to be on food stamps no one everyone wants a goodpaying job that allows them to provide for their family and contribute to society they want to take care of their kids there are bumps in the road yes and now the economy has turned around for many but not for all that bridge over troubled waters is needed now more than ever i hope that in the negotiations in this omnibus bill we are going to make sure we remember these people and not raid the programs that keep people out of poverty and provide a safety net as mr hoyer said lets do no harm in this bill and lets help people move into the middle class we must recommit ourselves to combating poverty and inequality once and for all it really is a disgrace when you look at these charts when you see the percentage of people living below the poverty line and this is in the wealthiest and most powerful country in the world it is a challenge to all communities communities of color of course are disproportionately impacted and affected but american indians alaska natives african americans latinos asian americans asian pacific islanders whites living below the poverty line in appalachia and rural america there are people living in poverty all over the country i come from california close to 17 percent of the population of california mind you is living in poverty that is almost 2 percentage points higher than the national average and that is in california while many people believe that poverty only touches cities and urban communities as our whip indicated our rural communities continue to be plagued with persistent poverty while lacking many of the resources found in cities such as public transit food banks and access to critical workforce training according to the united states census bureau 85 percent of our nations persistent poverty counties defined as 20 percent or more of a population living in poverty

justice system it is well established in fact that students of color face harsher punishments in schools than their white peers leading to a higher number of youth of color in detention suspension and yes expelled african american students are arrested far more often than their white classmates black and hispanic students represent more than 70 percent of those involved in schoolrelated arrests or referrals to law enforcement currently african americans make up twofifths and hispanics onefifth of confined youth today disparities are found not only in how we punish behavior in schools but also how we fund education this is true in k12 it is also true in higher education and we know that a college degree is a path to a middle class life as african american students graduate with more debt than their white classmates the cuts to pell grants are threatening african american access to a better education without the pell grant program hundreds of thousands of young african americans would not be able to afford college the disparities in access to health coverage are startling the infant mortality rate among african americans is 2 3 times that of nonhispanic whites and african american infants are four times more likely than nonhispanic white infants to die mostly due to complications related to birth weight we must confront these prejudices and these injustices in our nation headon

attorney general bringing her confirmation to the full senate for consideration i remember it all too well a couple weeks before that when we were in that hearing room it looked like a sea of red as deltas marched in and lined up one after another wearing our colors crimson and cream deltas lined the outside of the hearing room we did that because prior to entering that room media and some of my colleagues on the other side had tried to make it a bad thing that she organized and was a founder of her college chapter of delta sigma theta sorority what we were able to do was to show them when we work together whether that is democrats and republicans or sorority members or nonsorority members when it is the right thing to do we can make a difference i was so proud last week to sit there on the front row with my other colleagueswith our chairman of the congressional black caucus congressman g k butterfield with the 100th woman sworn into the united states congress congresswoman alma adams to be there with the 21st national president of delta sigma theta sorority congresswoman marcia fudge we sat there next to loretta lynchs father reverend lorenzo lynch of north carolina while the judiciary committee favorably reported the nomination on a vote that was closer than it needed to be ms lynchs nomination is well deserved and historic ms lynch testified before the senate judiciary committee for nearly 8 hours and she responded to nearly 900 written questions which is unprecedented many of the written questions were from senators who had already declared their opposition to her nomination ms lynchs nomination has now been pending far longer than any recent attorney generals nomination which in my opinion is shameful she deserves to be voted our next attorney general if senators have a reason to vote against her nomination they should make their case public yes hiding behind procedural tactics does not help our nation as the senate has an opportunity to unite behind a wellqualified nominee for a critical position congress members will have an opportunity to be united this weekend when democrats and republicans will travel to alabama to march to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the selma marches fifty years ago people marched for equal voting rights out of those marches we got the voting rights act however disparities remain and the

speaker race you made two representations about immigration that stood out they are 1 it is unwise or unproductive to bring up any immigration legislation so long as barack obama is president 2 as speaker you will not allow any immigration bill to reach the house floor for a vote unless the immigration bill is supported by a majority of the majority of republican house members although you talk faster than i can write your words down i believe the above statements properly reflect what you said i send this letter to confirm that i accurately portray your remarks and that i may rely on them when the house floor vote for speaker occurs next week if my portrayal of your words errs in any respect please deliver to me before the gop conference meeting next week in which we are to conduct speaker elections a written communication correcting my errors if i do not receive such a communication from you then i will infer that you concur that my portrayal of your remarks is accurate and that i and the rest of the gop conference and the american people may rely on your words as i have written them i need your assurance that you will not use the speakers position to advance your immigration policies except when in accord with the two above statements because there is a huge gap between your immigration position and the wishes of the american citizens i represent your words yesterday constitute the needed assurance if your assurances as i have portrayed them are accurate then i am much more comfortable voting for you for speaker on the house floor and will do so absent something startling coming to my attention between now and the election which i dont anticipate if however you would use the speakers chair to advance an immigration belief system that is unacceptable to the americans i represent it will be very difficult for me to vote for you for speaker on the house floor to be clear i intend to publicly share this letter and your responding letter if any to help explain to my constituents why i voted as i did on the house floor in the speakers election thank you for considering the contents of this letter at roughly 5 20 paul ryan called me and stated that my letter accurately portrayed his immigration representations paul ryan confirmed that he meant what he said and would keep his word based on paul ryans representations and my trust that paul ryan is a man of his word i will vote for paul ryan for house speaker on the house floor if he is the republican nominee i submit this letter for the record"], [0.9944589138031006, 0.9944589138031006,

of 4100 in 2008 it passed in the house of representatives by 4030 in 2009 by 4240 in 2010 by 4210 in 2010 of course and thereafter we stopped passing resolutions on the floor of the house although we may still present them and talk about them on the floor of the house so tonight this is what we will do i would like to mention the mission of the naacp which is to ensure the political educational social and economic equality of all personsnot just of black people not just of people of color but of all people the naacp also desires to eliminate racial hatred and racial discrimination these are lofty and noble goals because we understand that we have had much racial hatred and much racial discrimination in this country and the naacp took it upon itself to eliminate as much of it as possible it has done a good job i might add lets look at a little bit of the history of the naacp back on february 12 1909 a group of people decided that it was going to do something about the lynchings that were taking place in this country literally in this country between 1889 and 1918 thousands of african americans were lynchedthousands lynching was done with mob violence people were taken to trees and they were lynched it was done a good many times with impunity no one was ever prosecuted it was a grave injustice and there were people in this country who decided that they were going to do something about this injustice among the people who met initially were mary white ovington oswald garrison villard william english walling and ida wellsbarnett these persons met and issued a clarion call some 60 persons answered that call hence the naacp was born the naacp did not have its first african american as an executive secretary until 1920 it is important for us to note that many of the founders of the naacpin fact most of themwere not of african ancestry the first executive secretaries of the organization were all persons who were of european ancestry in fact the first five executive secretaries were white they were not black in 1934 the naacp had its first black board chairpersonlouis t wright dr wright became chairperson after the naacp had had a good number of white chairpersons so the naacp has never been and is not now an organization for blacks only the naacp has always stood for an integrated society and has been an integrated organization since its inception in 1954 the naacp under the leadership and counsel of the honorable thurgood marshall who became a justice of the supreme court won the lawsuit of brown v board of education this was a giant leap forward for us because this lawsuit integrated to a certain extent schools throughout the country the word that was appropriately used at the time was desegregated these schools were ordered to be desegregated with all deliberate speed and all deliberate speed can sometimes take a lot longer than one might expect a good many years later there are still those who would contend that we have not fully integrated our school systems across the length and breadth of the country in 1955 an naacp member the honorable rosa parks an african american lady decided that she was going to take a stand and she took that stand by taking a seat she took a seat on a bus in so doing she ignited a spark that started a civil rights movement by the way there are many people who contend that she did this because she was tired well she may have been tired but she did it because she wanted to take a stand she was tired of societys relegating her to the back of the bus and she took a stand against it hence we had the montgomery bus boycott which lasted more than a year at the end of that boycott the bus linethe transportation systemwas integrated in alabama and of course later on throughout the country an interesting note on this point about the integration and desegregation of bus lines there was a threejudge panel that actually heard the litigation associated with this transportation issue on that threejudge panel there were judges who had a great debate about this but there was one frank m johnson a federal district court judge who took the position that we could apply the brown decision to public transportation this was the very first time it was done was under the leadership of that threejudge panel and by the honorable frank m johnson again i point these things out because it is important to note that there were others who were there with the naacp to help us along the way frank m johnson by the way was a republican appointee who was appointed by president eisenhower and he went on to help us to integrate schools throughout the south and integrate the department of public safety he went on to help us with the facilitation of voting rights acts and with the implementation of laws that prohibited persons from discriminating against persons in workplace environments he really played a significant role as did many other persons who were associated with the naacp in a vicarious way because i dont have evidence of his having been a member i want to move forward if i may next to 2008 i move forward to 2008 because this is when the naacp supported the passage of the emmett till unsolved civil rights crime act of 2007 there are many unsolved cases in the history of this country with reference to things that happened to african americans the naacp pushed for and supported legislation such that we can have the opportunity to bring some of the dastards to justice who have caused great harm to people who were doing no harm to anyone the naacp has fought for this in 2009 the naacp celebrated its centennial anniversary and the theme at that time was bold dreams and big victories obviously a good theme because the naacp has won many big victories in 2012 the naacp supported the smart and safe campaign which brought attention to the overpopulated prisons and mass incarceration in this country people who study these issues are well aware that in this country we have an overpopulation of persons who are incarcerated much of this has to do with mandatory sentencing laws much of it has to do with laws that allow persons who are convicted of one type of offense with drugs to receive a harsher penaltycocaine for example then if you have crack cocaine you will get a stiffer penalty as opposed to its being some other type of cocaine the point is that these harsh sentencing laws have caused a good many people to be incarcerated who quite frankly should not be incarcerated for as long as they are incarcerated some of these three strikes and you are out laws have also caused persons to go to prison for a minor offense because it happened to be the third offense so the naacp is fighting against this"], [0.9922782182693481, 0.9922782182693481,

in this house have indicated that my question to you is with respect to the issues that i think we have all discussed and that the speaker has discussed such as jobs and economic growth health care

harmful auto enrollment mandate of the aca this provision which would apply to companies with 200 or more employees would otherwise move employees into a preapproved governmentmanaged health insurance plan creating more red tape and mandates was never the solution to curb rising healthcare costs and to increase access to insurance markets i was a freshman member in congress in 2009 when many of the
