and to remind my colleagues that it is not only possible for our country to rise to greatness it is necessary to do so lyndon johnson never believed in a diminishing future he believed in growth in dynamism in progress he never believed that this country must live by some sort of economic fatalism he believed that we could control our own destiny he never believed that this nation could or should abide the waste of unemployment the scourge of poverty the numbing blight of ignorance nor the casual inhumanity of injustice lyndon johnson had a vision for his country he believed we could conquer our problems that we could alleviate poverty and indeed his programs did open whole new worlds of opportunity through the vision and unparalleled political skills he commanded president johnson brought decent medical care to the old and the poor he demanded that we no longer tolerate hunger among the people of this the greatest food producing nation in the world he established vast new programs to improve the nations schools to insure that every child got a sound education and to make available a university education to all who could benefit from it he insisted that the poor even the longterm unemployed could be placed into useful jobs through all these and many other efforts he was responsible for a vast reduction in the incidence of poverty in our country where there was no hope he opened hope and where there was hope he insisted that there be genuine opportunity compare that to the experience of today under our present leadership we have not progress but retreat there are millions of newly unemployed there are millions of newly poor no longer do we seek to insure that the poor are decently housed and fed far from it our leadership demands that the hungry should go more hungry our leadership is not one with a vision of what our country could be but one that sees a diminishing futurea world with shrinking hopes not one of growing possibilities lyndon johnson was excoriated as a free spender but the leadership of today the current administration will incur deficits that are 60 times as great as any that johnson would even dream of he was called a radical ex perimenter but he never abandoned the basic principle of sticking with programs that were practical that were proven whose results could be measured compare that to the pie in the sky claims that we heard for supplyside economics nonsense that we are paying dearly for today the present administration likes to say that there is no need to produce new housing for the poor or for anybody else because the marketplace will take care of everything but lyndon johnson knew that this was not so and could not be so if there are millions of people who cannot even get into the marketplace the market serves only people who bnve the means it does not serve those who have no means johnson would have wanted to know how many were without housing what could be done to get them into housing and how to get it done compare that to the breezy callousness of todays antihousing administration there is no way for me or for anyone else to describe the whole complex dazzling being who was lyndon johnson it might be said that he never believed that there was a problem that could not be licked whatever it was he would argue threaten worry demand plead work and pester anyone and anything in his considerable reach until he was satisfied that the matter had been disposed of it might be civil rights it might be interest rates which today are treated as given from godly writbut which he knew were made and broken by men just like him it might be education or any one of a thousand things whatever it was he believed the problem could be solved and he intended to do it compare that to the casual callousness of today when human needs and human miseries are ignored and when not only is no positive action taken every effort is taken to destroy what little help people have available he would never understand would be terribly grieved to see the sorry spectacle that we have today in which misery is compounded in which inequity is heaped upon unfairness in which shameless dishonor is dismissed as practical politics he would be horrified by policies that are nothing more than warmed over 19th century darwinism nothing less than callous disregard of even so basic a thing as providing for economic growthfar from it policies that destroy even that possibility lyndon johnson reached farther than he could grasp but he drove this country to its greatest heights his programs were the most comprehensive humane and effective domestic efforts ever attempted they were also the most effective there is no way to describe the kind of new dreams that were not only made possible but that were achieved thanks to president johnsons efforts he could not understand and would not tolerate a government that was indifferent it is a mercy that he never lived to see the inlifference the outright emptiness that characterizes the present occupant of the white house a man who was a doer could never understand one whose sole mission seems to be to undo do nothing do deliberate and calculated harm i salute the memory and legacy of lyndon johnson no man ever cared so much dared so much or did so much for his country may his spirit endure and may someday this country be blessed with another leader as bold as caring as great and as determined as he was e"], [0.00975126028060913, 0.9902487397193909, 1, "i am refer the purchase in the united states of two

devastating toll it is taking on small business the subcommittee invited leading experts from the academic business and bankruptcy worlds to testify to find out why so many businesses are failing and what it means for our economy the hearings were held against the backdrop of the gravest crisis faced by american business since the great depression this is what we see capital investment by companies is off sharply data resources inc forecasts that business investment will be off 8 percent this year over last year despite the massive tax incentives to invest enacted last year aftertax profits of corporations in the first quarter of 1982 were almost onethird lower than a year earlier the sharpest drop in the postwar period the new york times reported earlier this week that corporate profits have reached the lowest levels in perhaps 5 years many companies are saddled with heavy shortterm debt the ratio of shortterm debt to total debt is at a new high business balance sheets and corporate liquidity are more fragile than at any other time in postwar history since the first quarter of 1981 industrial output has dropped more than 7 percent our nations factories ran at a dismal 69 8 percent of capacity in june of this year 15 percentage points below the rate at which capital goods makers start getting orders for equipment to add capacity small business proprietorship income is expected to be nearly 15 percent lower this year than in 1980 according to data resources inc and businesses are failing at a rate not seen since the great depression todays figures as reported by dun bradstreet the business information concern are truly alarming the failure rate today is almost 90 per 10 000 listed companies just short of the failure rate of 100 per 10 000 companies recorded in the great depression year of 1933 put another way 11 businesses are failing right now for every hour of the business day business failures have only become a serious problem since 1981 looking back over the postwar period we find that business failures ranged between 1946 and 1980 from a low of 5 per 10 000 listed companies in 1946 to a high of 64 per 10 000 in 1961 the business failure rate average for those 35 years was 40 3 per 10 000 listed companies beginning in 1981 however business failures began to shoot up in 1980 l11742 companies or 42 per 10 000 companies failed in 1981 the figures jumped to 16 800 or 62 per 10 000 companies for 1982 the prediction is 25 000 or 88 per 10 000 listed companies the average for 1981 and the first half of 1982 is 75 per 10 000 companies an 86 percent increase over the 194680 average in the past 2 years the business failure rate has jumped 110 percent the second largest 2year jump since 1920 the only time it was higher was in the 2 years immediately after world war ii when business failures returned from the depressed war level to normal todays figures are indeed grim we should remember that the dun bradstreet figures cover only failures which involve losses to creditcs the number of business failures today is really much higher since thousands of businessmen simply decide to close their businesses because they see only an unprofitable future these business closings which are really failures reflect a lack of confidence in the business environment and are not reflected in dun bradstreets statistics as president reagans recently released report on the state of small business tells us the dun bradstreet figures are a valuable indicator of business distress the hearings looked at this distress not only in numerical terms but in human terms what we are seeing today is a great human tragedy we must not forget that business failures mean lost jobs ruined lives and dashed dreams they mean lost pensions lost life savings and lost tax revenues they also take a human toll in the lost selfesteem felt by those directly affected they mean an end to the american dream of opportunity and owning ones own business that has been such a powerful art of this nations dynamism last march when it was becoming clear that 1982 would see a record number of business failures i wrote to 2 dozen unitedstates bankruptcy judges and trustees to find out why this was happening i wanted to hear directly from them because they are seeing every day what is happening why it is happening and what needs to be done to end this terrible spiral of failure i received 19 replies from throughout the nation which i included in the hearing record this is the picture that emerged from the letter business are failing in all sections of the country and in every economic sector large and small businesses and young and old businesses are failing business are failing in record numbers and the failure rate continues to rise the business failures experienced today are much worse than those experienced during the last severe recession of 19741975 business are failing today because of high interest rates and the deep recession the revised federal bankruptcy code is not a cause of the increased number of business bankruptcy filings let me read a few of the responses unitedstates bankruptcy judge peter m elliott of los angeles wrote i would say that the major cause of small business failures is high interest rates unitedstates trustee william p westphal sr of minneapolis wrote the two primary causes for the increase in bankruptcies generally as well as for small business in particular are the extremely high interest rates and the length of the current recession unitedstates trustee scott h bush of dallas wrote the tentacles of the current recession reach to all communities at all locations even the glorious sunbelt has not been insulated the current recession is much more severe than the 19741975 recession unitedstates bankruptcy judge charles b mccormick of chicago wrote the increase in small business bankruptcy filings must i feel be blamed on the common elements of high interest tight money inflation the loss of jobs due to plant closings and the farming out of work to foreign countries and the other ills that greet one in the media every day unitedstates bankruptcy judge william l norton jr of atlanta wrote i do not see incompetency or mismanagement or dishonest actions in individuals or businessmen which some credit grantors or others ascribe to debtors in the bankruptcy court as being the cause of prevalence in bankruptcies i see the overwhelming number of individual and business debtors in this court who sincerely and honestly want to pay their debts and have been and are attempting to pay such debts i see many businesses and persons in my court who i feel there but for the grace of god go i as the letters i received show high interest rates and the prolonged and deep recession are placing an extraordinarily heavy burden on all businesses and small budinesses in particular this is the same message we heard from our academic witness at the hearing according to edward i altman a professor of finance at new york university and a leading expert on predicting business failures the devastating effects of reduced profits and high interest rates that have remained around 20 percent or more for several years are continuing to reduce the ranks of our smaller firm population because of high interest rates pro fessor altman continued businesses today pay more than 40 cents of each dollar of cash flow for interest charges up from 20 cents of 4 years ago no wonder so many marginal firms are succumbing to the economic reality of bankruptcy he said this is unfair small business relies almost exclusively on banks for financing they cannot shop around or bargain for the best interest rates as can large corporations many small businesses are paying at least prime rate or above prime for their loans that means close to 20 percent interest what makes these rates even more crushing is that the real interest rate is at least 10 percent the highest in recent memory the impact can be seen everywhere joseph w duncan the chief statistician for dun bradstreet presented to the subcommittee his firms latest business failure figures they showed continuing and sharp increases throughout the nation and in all industries the sun belt and mountain states are as hard hit as the farm states midwest and midatlantic region the failures touch not only the weak manufacturing wholesale retail and construction sectors but also the previously strong service industries what does the future hold only more grim numbers and more tragedy the subcommittee was tdid unless the economy improves and interest rates decline significantly i am afraid that the already staggering number of business failures will swell to levels comparable to the early 1930s the normally cautious professor altman predicted in 1932 the nadir of the great depression 31 822 businesses failed for a catastrophic failure rate of 154 per 10 000 listed companies the risk he added is that increased business failures will lead banks to tighten credit further and thus accelerate the business failure spiral if banks ration credit to only the most creditworthy firms professor altman said the marginal firm will stand little chance of surviving it is also probably true that the marginal firm is oftentimes also a small firm todays problem goes beyond high interest rates the problem stems from the mix of economic and fiscal policies currently being followed that have driven our nations economy into the worse recession since world war ii and created the severest liquidity crisis for business since the great depression as professor altman warned the real risk is not whether the economy will turn around and stage a recovery but how long the recovery will last if the turnaround is relatively short like the one we experienced in late 1980 then thousands of firms particularly smaller ones will not have sufficient time to get back on a positive cash flow basis the consequences are obvious and ominous we will see a ripple effect throughout the economy as failing large companies topple small firms doing business with them thousands of people will lose their jobs this is happening right now unitedstates trustee james eichstaedt of los angeles told the subcommittee that the bankruptcy last april of the wickes cos the large retail chain has cost several thousands jobs and seriously squeezed the small firms that did business with wickes with so many large unitedstates companies in such desperate financial straits we can count on it happening again and again and again if new economic and fiscal policies are not adopted that will bring interest rates down to affordable and stable levels and encourage the economy to grow e"], [0.010345757007598877, 0.9896542429924011,

we of her analysis should be spending more of our federin these unhappy al dollars than ever on these programs days of reaganinduced inflation and instead of at best just holding the outrageously high interest rates we line without further cuts as some of are here for the purpose of debating the better budget alternatives do i the budget for the fiscal year 1983 cannot fathom how naive we must be more americans than ever need the to try to convince ourselves that thos help that the federal governments programs cut so drastically by last unemployment benefits program and years budget can be expected to hold other programs and services designed up again this year even without furto aid the poor and the unemployed ther cuts in view of even higher uncan give yet the budget resolution employment and inflation than last and the substitutes being offered show year in my view just holding the a continued zeal for government line at last years spending as a cospending for guns over people or promise to further cuts is simply unresimply do not go far enough in the alistic and shortsighted effort to restore humanity to a feder however i rise in support of the al budget that has ravaged the social fauntroy substitute to house concurprograms so desperately needed by so rent resolution 345 because when many millions of americans compared to the house or senate were it not for the ruthlessness of budget resolutions and other proposed the reagan administration budget substitutes the fauntroy substitute policies of last year perhaps this constitutes the only equitable and years budget resolution and some of rational approach to balancing the the substitutes that are being offered federal budget to reducing inflation to it might be acceptablebut with in and most importantly to creating jobs creasing unemployment nd while we and revitalizing our economy by are faced with social programs emas changing our national priorities from culated byv iast years budget none of killing to living the budgets or substitutes go far indeed it is the only budget proposenough al before us which cuts the socalled defense budget authority below its present level and it is the only one which does not reduce medicare in addition it reduces the 1983 fiscal year deficit to 97 8 billion while properly increasing more than any other proposal the budget authority for health education job training employment and other needed social services when i stood here in the well last year while we were debating the budget resolution i made reference to the fact that the congressional black caucus was the first among the reagan nonnonbelievers to accept the reagan challenge to come up with a better budget than the one that he had proposed the caucus not only accepted that challenge but met it fashloning an alternative that was designed to put the 1982 budget in balance while still providing equitable tax relief and without compromising the integrity of essential social programs today we are again debating the budgetthis time for fiscal year 1983 again i believe that it is the fauntroy substitute that stands out as the best alternative to the substitutes that are being offered it is a substitute that will create new jobs and jobcreating programs for highways mass transit and for rebuilding the infrastructures of urban areas it is a substitute which creates hope for millions of poor and unemployed americans by extending and expanding benefits for unemployment and restoring benefits for medicaid food stamps and welfare programs to rational levels it is a substitute which preserves vital social educational job training and medical assistance programs for the millions of americans who are poor and unemployed the fauntroy substitute accomplishes these things while managing to shrink the federal deficit for 1983 and for years beyond but briefly let me deal in particular with two areas covered by the fauntroy substitute which have not been fully highlighted here as a member of the committee on public works and transportation and as a representative for a district whose residents rely heavily on public mass transpnrtation i believe that this countrys long history and commitment to transportation has been a key factor in our nations economic growth and development with skyrocketing interest rates unprecedented high unemployment and increasing deterioration of existing mass transit systems state and local governments cannot possibly now bear an even greater portion of the costs of transportation and mass transit than they have shouldered in the past if federal support for transportation is not continued soon some of our nations citizens will not be able to pay the cost of a bus ride in fact without aid to deteriorating mass transit systems eventually there may be no buses at all now in the area of public worksand economic development specifically as was true last year this year it is only the fauntroy substitute that adequately addresses our nations needs it does this by offering grants loan guarantees and technical assistance to states and localities all of which help create new jobs and improve the quality of life only the pauntroy substitute recognizes that programs such as these serve vital functions of revitalizing areas in which many poor and minority people live and stimulate investments that lead to new jobs the fauntroy substitute retains the 1983 authorization in existing law of 3 7 billion which is a 21 million increase over the administrations request to merely maintain the 1982 level the fauntroy substitute retains the 1983 authorization in existing law of 500 million representing a 70 million increase over the administrations request to merely fund this program at the 1982 level the fauntroy substitute also continues to fund programs such as section 312 of the rehabilitation loan program at the 1982 funding level of 69 million while the administration proposes to eliminate this program altogether furthermore the fauntroy substitute recognizes the wisdom of and necessity for retaining funding at the present level for the economic development administration the governments disaster relief program and the appalachian regional commission it is only the fauntroy substitute that recognizes for a complete economic recovery there must be a strong commitment to funding for housing highways mass transit and other infrastructure programs to create jobs and finally it proposes an 8 billion jobs vocational education and training package essential to the welfare of all americans the fauntroy substitute supports continuation of the federal role in transportation by proposing a 5centagallon increase in the federal gasoline excise tax to be used to provide jobs to rebuild transportation systems all across the country by improving roads highways and bridgesso many of which are badly in need of repairand to expand and upgrade and help to operate mass transit systems in urban areass stems which provide the only means of transportation for millions of americans the fauntroy substitute maintains funding levels for amtrak northeast corridor improvements and for other essential rail systems at congressional budget office current service levels realizing that rail transportation is a vital adjunct to the nations transportation system which needs federal help to become profitable in its own right furthermore the fauntroy subsitute provides rational and fair reductions for several transportation programs to meet the requirements of a balanced budget without compromising the quality of these programs i am certain that each subsitute that is being offered to the fiscal year 1983 budget resolution is being offered in good faith and with the conviction of its sponsors that it is a better alternative nevertheless the fact remains that the fauntroy substitute is the only one being offered today that demonstrates a clear understanding and appreciation for those americans most dependent on the services and programs that the republican substitute and other substitutcm seek to cut once again this year rendering them virtually useless to the millions of americans they were originally designed to aid the fauntroy substitute is the only alternative that heeds the cries of our constituents nationwide to restore these vital social programs and services to serve our economic and transportation needs while still retaining fiscal responsibility therefore i urge all my colleagues to give the fauntroy substitute their support thank

will give them that chance under the congressional black caucus proposal your middle income constituents will fare far better in tax relief than under the kemprothreagan second and third year tax measures under our tax proposal the 96 percent of the people of this country who make 50 000 a year or less will have much more money in their pockets and in their pocketbooks gone in our proposal are last years windfall profits tax exemptions of 1 billion gone are the tax loopholes that gave excessive benefits to oil companies and to people who invested only in chinese and antiques and gold coins those features of the fauntroy substitute measured alone save us 10 billion in deficit spending a vote for the congressional black caucus is a vote to reduce taxes for 96 percent of the people of this country this is the peoples house and we ask you to give them a chance to receive what they want and what they need meaningful real tax relief the people of this country want relief from the enormous budget deficit that has resulted from last years tax giveaway to the rich and the gigantic increase in military spending of last year the people o this country now know that those large deficits mean continued high interest rates and thus continued small business and small farmer failures and continued high unemployment at record levels such as we have achieved in this past year the people of this countryand remember this is the peoples housewant a strong national defense but they do not want domination of the world they want an end to nuclear proliferation and your vote for the fauntroy substitute will give them that they know with former secretary of the defense ielvin laird thatand i quote him our true strategic military needs have little to do with military weapons except to deter their use against us he points out that we must be able to keep open the sea and air links that bind us to our allies and that we need to be able to hold ground on the borders of europe and elsewhere and to protect and sustain power at great distance none of these objectives as i continue to quote former secretary of defense melvin laird none of these objectives requires nuclear weapons your vote for the fauntroy substitute will acknowledge that fact ii12689 the caucus budget also anwers a number of concerns raised by amendments offered for consideration under the rule today for those of you who have offered amendments to raise the cola caps in the jones budget for federal employees and retirees and to all of my colleagues who intend to support those amendments i say that a vote for the caucus amendment does just what you want the fauntroy substitute does not require such amendments since it incorporates the cbo baseline levels which preserve current service costofliving adjustments for federal pay and pensions a number of members have offered amendments to increase funding for function 500 education above the level recommended by the house budget committee the fauntroy substitute also as proposed raises funding for education above the house budget committee level and indeed it includes funding to restore programs to the present fiscal year 1982 reductions as passed in grammlatta let me now briefly outline the details of the congressional black caucus substitute before concluding my remarks you first ought to understand that the cbc budget reduces the deficit substantially in fact the congressional budget office has estimated that our budget will produce a 92 8 billion deficit in fiscal year 1983 which is lower by at least 10 billion than the deficit estimated by cbo for any other substitute and half the 183 billion deficit that will exist if nothing is done to rectify the errors of last years budget moreover our budget will lead to steadily shrinking deficits of 60 billion in fiscal year 1984 and a 18 billion surplus in fiscal year 1985 bringing interest rates down and providing the basis for genuine economic recovery in our country second you ought to know that the fauntroy substitute is fair and humane we not only prevent that many additional cuts in human needs programs as proposed by the president we return funds to social programs that were lost by the enactment of the reagan fiscal year 1982 budget reductions these programs must remain federal priorities if we value human potential and care to meet human needs because of savings generated by our alternative tax and defense policies several education health housing and urban programs can be restored to fiscal year 1981 funding levels adjusted for inflation for example the fauntroy substitute adds 3 3 billion to title i 600 million to pell grants for disadvantaged college students increasing funding for health care programs it adds 600 million in social services funding including child welfare programs and 1 billion more tlan reagan for pollution control it retains eda and the legal services corporation and lowincome energy and other conservation programs the third thing that this budget does is that it stimulates and creates jobs a centerpiece of our budget proposal is the creation of a major 6 billion to 8 billion federal jobs vocational education and training package this is a response to both the nations unemployment rate generally and to the catastrophic unempioyment in the black community specifically the fauntroy substitute also includes a 4 billion urban infrastructure proposal which will create 50 000 to 80 000 jobs directly and more indirectly a 4 billion expansion in mass transit and highway construction programs which will create an equal number of jobs in this country it also includes home ownership assistance and rental housing construction programs that will stimulate employment in residential construction finally the budget insures adequate social security and other support for the nations poor both the elderly and the nonelderly this budget maintains the costofliving adjustment for elderly on fixed incomes and expands unemployment compensation benefits at a time when we have 10 3 million people out of work the program triggers in the caucus budget increase eligibility for the unemployed to 52 weeks in our view this restoration of benefits is necessary at a time when we are experiencing the levels of unemployment which have not been endured since the depression our budget also provides increased funding for other programs to assist the poor including 3 2 billion more than reagan for aid to families with dependent children 5 billion more for food stamps 3 billion more for medicaid and medicare 1 2 billion more for six health programs and 400 million more for supplemental social insurance as my colleagues in the congressional black caucus follow me they will give you more details about the caucus budget resolution i simply want to remind you again that this is the peoples house and we ought to give the people the life support programs that will cushion them through these difficult times we need to give 96 percent of the people of this country the kird of tax relief that we have pr45mised in the generalized language about tax relief for all of the people we need to give the people relief from the enormous deficits and the high interest rates that have robbed the people of this country of homes and farms small businesses and 2 5 million jobs just since july of last year a vote for the fauntroy substitute the economic recovery program of the congressional black caucus will do just that at this time i would like to add the congressional budget offices

modified form the firsttime homeowners opportunity act originally introduced by me last week i the modification has to do with the income eligibility limitations under the program rather than basing the limit on the area family median income the revised version of the bill would utilize the statewide family median income a statistic which is already kept by the department of housing and urban development i believe the use of the statewide figure would be more equitable lnd would eliminate the possibility that families with identical incomes in neighboring communities in the same state would or would not qualify for the program based upon the statistical area in which they happened to reside this concept continues to recognize however that incomes around the country vary from state to state and takes that into account in determining the proper income limitations as in the prior bill eligibility would be for those at or below 130 percent of the family median income but as i have said the statewide not area median would be employed there are no other changes to the legislation high interest rates are making it virtually impossible for firsttime homebuyers even those with very reason able incomes who have saved diligently to afford a home besides the dev astation caused to these families by their inability to participate in the american dream of homeownership construction and building trades persons homebuilders realtors building suppliers and those in financial institutions have suffered greatly as millions of the postwar babyboom generation have reached adulthood the problem has only gotten worse and the administration unable or unwilling to propose concrete solutions has done nothing unacceptably high interest rates show no sign of significantly decreasing any time soon the firsttime homeowners opportunity act would provide mortgage assistance in fiscal year 1983 to more than 100 000 firsttime home purchasers whose family incomes are no more than 130 percent of statewide median this assistance would be utilized to reduce the cost of an phainsured mortgageby direct payments by the federal government to the mortgage holderto as low as 9v percent but would be limited to no more than the amount necessary to reduce monthly payments for the mortgage insurance and real estate taxes to 30 percent of the homeowners income the limitations requiring the homeowner to expend 30 percent of income on housing costs means that the mortgage will not necessarily be subsidized to as low as 9 percent thus saving federal expenditures and allowing us to serve a greater number of firsttime buyers payments would continue for 10 yearsunless the homeowner sold the homebut could be continued after 10 years if the secretary of hud determined that the family was still financially unable to assume the full cost of the mortgage assistance would be recaptured upon sale of the home but would be limited to 50 percent of the net appreciation of the value of the property purchasers of new and existing singlefamily homes and individual condominium and cooperative unitswhich do not result in the displacement of a tenantcould utilize the program the maximum sales price would be 110 percent of the maximum pha mortgage which will mean a price limit of 74 000 in most parts of the country the minimum downpayment would be 5 percent of the purchase price to illustrate the dramatic effect this program can have on the lives of firsttime homeowners take the following example to purchase a 60 000 hme a modestly priced dwelling by todays standards and to carry a 57 000 mortgage at 15v percentthe current fha interest rate limitfor 30 years cost 767 including mortgage insurance adding real estate taxes and hazard insurance means the monthly housing cost is likely to be over 900 a family earning 35 000 applying 30 percent of its income to housing could not afford such a mortgage without the assistance this program would provide on the other hand with the help the firsttime homeowners opportunity act would offer a family with an income of approximately 25 000 applying 30 percent of its income could afford the same mortgage and home and could therefore have a chance to participate in the american dream the 400 million appropriation authorized in this legislation would help alleviate the most serious and widespread crisis we have witnessed

economic plan stated as the gentleman just indicated in a speech in denver that those of us who have had economic concerns from the beginning about this plan are chicken littles afraid that the sky is falling the message the president ought to understand is that what we areworried about is not that the sky is falling but that the debt ceiling is rising it is the deficit that is caused by a 1 0 trillion military arms buildup coupled with a 750 billion outlay in tax cuts that are indexed against inflation for all time as long as that deficit is there as long as there is this gap between budget cuts and tax cuts the deficit is going to be there the market is going to respond in precisely the way it is september 23 1 981 and frankly it is fraudulent economic advice for any political figure to suggest to any investor in this country that he should invest in any other way than the market is investing today based on the economic plan that has been laid down on this country i just want to add another thought on this question it is clear to me that all the sermons we have heard for years that we need to get the budget in balance have been forgotten and rejected by the highest economic priests of this administration the american people have come to realize that we cannot have extremely expensive outlays for military spending or domestic spending if we do not have the money in the till to pay for it i think that the people understand if the town meetings i have conducted across my district are any indicatorand i think they arethat before we cut taxes in massive ways we ought to get the budget in balance first the people are not naive the people when they get a tax cut want real dollars not deficit dollars it seems to me that the administration ought to understand this and i hope the president when he makes his address to the country tomorrow night will come clean with the american people and admit that there is this flaw in his economic plan and will admit that just as in the case of lbj when we tried to have guns and butter in the 1960s which really caused the massive dose of inflation that we are still trying to cope with today that this economic plan is inflationary just as guns and butter in those days was economically unsound guns and butter today will be equally inflationary the members might ask well what do you mean guns and butter today well there is butter there it may not be there for the poor man that is the difference between the great society and what we have today the butter is not for the poor the butter is there for the people who are far better off than the poor ever thought of being or ever will hope to be under current social policies the administrations guns and butter approach calls for a 1 6 trillion arms buildup no salt treaty no real commitment to negotiating an end to strategic arms production but rather ain unrestrained arms race and at the same time passing out the butter in massive tax cuts in the thought that somehow that is going to provide a sound prescription for the united states of america well it is not sound it simply is not sound and this exposes the basic flaw in the administrations plan swe

combined with what we have already done it does redistribute wealth upward from the bottom to the top it amounts to a long leap into the past it is not a new beginning the policies of mr stockman mr reagan and mr volcker are not new policies these are the threadbare remnants of the twenties warmed over they are the trickledown policies invoked by coolidge and mellon and hoover scarcely distiguishable it is said that the president admires more than any of his predecessors former president calvin coolidge because of the tax cuts for the wealthy that were enacted during the coolidge administration and because of the 5 years of bubble prosperity over which mr coolidge presided before the bubble burst those were years of the rich getting richer at least on paper they were years in which worker productivity increased by 43 percent but wages increased by only 8 percent can anybody seriously doubt the reason for the ultimate collapse people simply were not able to buy those things that business was turning out for their consumption hence the glut of goods on the market frantic lastminute price fluctuations nobody able to get out of debt panic on wall street and a final capitulation of the economic structure that was the blind samson of dogma that strained against the pillars of the philistine temples of the twenties and those that it slew in its death were more than it slew in its life that is the dogma of david stockman you can call it supply side if you want to its real name is trickle down it is the belief of george gilder that regressive taxes help the poor and that only the rich have sense enough to invest in things that are good for america that is what is behind kemproth that is not the basic american doctrine it is not consistent with our economic history it is not even sound conservative doctrine respectable conservative economists have denounced it george bush called it voodoo economics it did not work for coolidge and hooever it is not working for margaret thatcher what makes us think it will work for us already with grammlatta ii we have repealed a lot of the carefully constructed work of the new deal the fair deal the new frontier and the great society much of that which we have put in place during the last 50 years to help people now at mr stockmans and mr reagans insistance we have cut social security we have cut job training we have cut meals on wheels we have cut medicare school lunches will cost more bus fares will be higher student loans will be harder to get and harder to repay day care centers and nursing homes will be harder to find home loans if not impossible to get are impossible to pay even the clean water program has been reduced to a trickle i say to my friends that this is not an economic recovery program it is an economic retrenchment program let us be sure that we understand its effect in connection with this proposed tax cut the kemproth cut is not across the board equally it is not an equal percentage cut in taxes paid and nobody can say it is it is a percentage cut in tax rates think what a profound difference that makes coupled with indexing the clear effect is to reduce taxes paid by the wealthy not by 25 percent but probably by more like 40 percent and then to immunize them forever from increases so any future increase in defense needs or education will have to come from payroll taxes or sales taxesin other words from the pockets of the middleincome and the working poor that is what we are sealing into place if we pass this substitute the republican plan could easily wind up with a deficit by 1984 of 70 billion but of course the president has recommended that we cut social security payments over the next 5 years by 70 billion is that how we are to make things come out

a lot of pandering that in the long run proves to be harmful to our future this was the case recently on a vote regarding a concurrent resolution expressing the sense of congress that funding appropriated for title v of the older americans act the senior community service employment project should be maintained in future years at the level necessary to insure that its current jobs and other services be maintained or expanded on the surface this resolution sounded magnanimous and full of compassion for our fine elderly citizens as could have been expected it passed by an overwhelming margin in the house i voted against it for several reasons first i do not dispute the intrinsic worth of a senior community service program i am well aware that our older citizens have much to offer their communities and nation and that too often they are shunted aside by the now generation my concern centers around which segment of government should finance such a program with a budget deficit of more than 100 billion this year it should be obvious that the federal government does not have the money i have absolutely no objection to programs of this nature and local and state governments and perhaps private enterprise might wish to consider maintaining and expanding this program state and local governments generally have to operate within balanced budgets lack the massive moneyabsorbing bureaucracy of the federal government and allow local people to have more control over their own programs second it is pure hypocrisy for congress to decry massive budget deficits and overspending by the federal government and to sponsor balanced budget amendmentswhile at the same time playing to the grandstand with proposals that add to the federal deficit third it is wildly inaccurate to claim that federal progrpms pay for themselves and do not end up costing the taxpayers if overspending by the federal government paid for itself as is claimed for virtually every domestic program contained within the budget we would not have 100 billion deficits or trillion dollar national debts today fourth such resolutions are in themselves meaningless because congress will either appropriate the funds or it will not therefore one must assume that the purpose of such proposals is simply another liberal ploy to encourage partisan and philosophical demagoguery prior to the november general elections liberalsand many conservatives are quite aware that they will be painted as ogres haters of the elderly and uncompassionate individuals if they vote against such grand sounding proposals fifth spending on the federal level for this and similar programs actually worsens the lot of those it is designed ostensibly to help federal overspending robs the elderly and forces their backs against the wall by creating inflation inflation destroys the purchasing power of the elderly more than any other group because so many are dependent on fixed incomes so while the seen hand of federal largesse may have the public relations image of helping the elderly the unseen hand of federal deficits debt and inflation soon destroys any positive effects that earlier help may have had sixth such resolutions actually make prostitutes of many politicians becaue they in effect sell their votes for the programs in return for the votes of specific groups on election day in other words the unspoken agreement is that the various lobbing groups will urge their member to vote for congressman x because he voted for the program pushed by that lobbying group the problem is that the money of current taxpayersand future taxpayers considering the national debtis being used to buy the votes finally this process and the lack of courage on the part of many politicians are the reasons why our nation is in such an awful economic mess today we must realize the federal government cannot give something to anyone or any group that it has not first taken away from someone else this is especially true where deficit spending is concerned because it obligates money from future taxpayers with our national defenses desperately in need of rapid rebuildingit has been postponed for

pretty clear if you listen to the people who have spoken here today and i predict it will be true for those who speak here tomorrow and during the debate on the amendments that we all agree that something has got to be done about the deficit something has got to be done to reduce the amount of national income being absorbed by government something has go to be done to reduce interest rates by reducing the amount of money that the federal government borrows but i also assert that when you get beyond that basic agreement fundamental differences that divide this house and divide this country become very clear in the major budget substitutes that will be voted on next week there are clear differences as to how we achieve those goals i would like very briefly to take the budget which was reported by the house budget committee and compare it to the bipartisan recovery budget which will be offered by the gentleman from ohio on behalf of the republicans and the conservative democrats who seek to control the deficit by controling spending i would like also to compare based on tentative data the budget that will be offered by the gentleman from ohio on behalf of himself and conservative democrats to the socalled coalition budget which will be offered by the gentleman from wisconsin i think when you look at these comparisons you will see very clearly what the choices are before the house if you take the data contained in the vehicle reported by the house budget committee you can break the basic policy changes into five different areas what we do about nondefense discretionary what we do about targeted entitlements what we do about other spending reductions what we do about defense and what we do about taxes we are going to hear a lot of discussion in this budget debate about economic assumptions as we did in the last but what is relevant is not what we assume about the world but what we do about the realitics that we face i think in looking at what we do in these five functional categories you will clearly see the difference in the area of nondefense discretionary the bipartisan recovery budget cuts nondefense discretionary spending 72 percent more than the jones house budget committee vehicle over the period 1983 to 1985 in the area of targeted entitlements the only section other than revenues that will be reconciled that committees will be forced to make changes in under the reconciliation process the bipartisan recovery budget cuts targeted entitlements 139 percent more than the jones house budget committee budget over the 3year period in the area of other spending reductions the bipartisan recovery budget reduces other spending 489 percent more than the house budget committee in the area of defense the jones house budget committee budget cuts defense 69 percent more than the bipartisan recovery budget in the area of taxes the jones house budget committee budget raises taxes by 55 percent more than the bipartisan recovery budget and in the end achieves the same bottom line basically these differences are repeated when you compare the aspin coalition budget and the bipartisan recovery budget that will be offered here if we look at nondefense discretionary and other spending reductions the bipartisan recovery budget cuts nondefense discretionary spending 62 percent more than the aspin coalition budget over the 3 years that the budget is in force in targeted entitlements the bipartisan recovery budget cuts targeted entitlements 119 percent more than the aspin coalition substitute in defense excluding pay the aspin coalition budget cuts defense 83 percent more than the bipartisan recovery budget in the area of taxes the aspin coalition budget raises taxes by 42 percent more than the bipartisan recovery budget over 3 years o 1640 my point in making these comparisons is this the house next week is going to have to choose between two real options one option is embodied in the budget presented by the house budget committee and slightly modified in the coalition aspin substitute that option says let us raise taxes and slash defense so that we can continue spending as usual in washington the real alternative is the bipartisan recovery budget which says let us focus our attention on spend ing so that we can meet our legitimate defense needs and so that we can let the american people keep more of what they earn those are the options that we must choose between do we want to raise taxes and slash de fense to continue spending or do we want to control spending so that we can meet our legitimate defense needs and let the american people keep more money in their pockets to provide positive incentive for people to work save and invest those who have talked about how much trouble the economy is in would have ns deal with those economic problems be raising taxes and by increasing spendng i believe that those are the policies that brought us to this sorry state and i do not believe that going back to the policies of the 1960s and 1970s will solve our problems i think it is important that we pass a budget that gains control of spending and gains control of the deficit that puts strong downward pressure on interest rates but i think the focus has got to be on the problem and the problem is spending taxes were doubled over the last 6 years and yet the deficit grew every year our problem is not inadequate taxes our problem is excessive spending in the bipartisan recovery budget we have an opportunity to do something about that excessive spending so i hope that we will have a good debate in which everyone will look at the issues what do we do about domestic nondefense spending what do we do about meeting the legitimate defense needs of our nation how much burden do we place on the shoulders of the working men and women in america in those three areas the differences among these budgets will be very clear i would like to make one additional point and that is that we have heard and we will hear a lot of talk about equity are cuts fair do we treat entitlement and discretionary programs fairly in terms of choosing where to make reductions but i would submit to my colleagues that there is another issue of fairness and that issue has to do with taxes how much burden are we going to put on those who are pulling the wagon as well as the burden that we are going to put on those who are riding in the wagon and in the ultimate fairness test by controlling the growth of taxes and focusing revenue increases on reducing the deficit rather than increasing taxes to go on spending i believe the ultimate fairness issue is going to be settled on the side of the bipartisan recovery budget may 2l 1982 so i look forward to the debate and i believe when the american people look at the three choices when our colleagues look at these three areas of difference in defense in nondefense domestic spending and in taxes i believe the bipartisan recovery budget is going to be

in this house i dont think i ever heard him say something unkind about anyone yet i also knew him to be a shrewd judge of human character he had that unique ability to look on the bright side of things and people all the while telling it like it is tenny was also the luckiest of men for he had as best friend and helpmate his wife mae guyer in this tenxqy shared his luck with his constituents

unanimously these are particularly hard times for small businesses with more small businesses going down the drain than any time since the depression this bill alone will not turn the tide but it will make sure that the small business administration is doing its full share in assisting the sector of the economy that needs help desperately the impetus for this bill came from the administration which asked for higher funding levels for programs aimed at the economically and socially disadvantaged this bill accomplishes that the administration asked that all direct loans except handicapped loans and mesbic loans be ended this bill accomplishes that also in place of direct loans the distinguished rankiig member of the committee joe mcdade proposed a distressed area loan program to provide leveraged funds to areas of high unemployment i cosponsored that proposal and i commend my good friend for such a constructive approach to this countrys severe unemployment problem this proposal puts money where it is needed in high unemployment areas and uses it for what is most needed to create jobs it is a proposal we can all support this bill also remedies an administrative problem that has arisen with the pollution control bond guarantee program the language in this bill combines provisions introduced by the chairman of the committee mr mitche l with the provisions of a bill h r 6189 that i introduced on behalf of myself the chairman of the subcommittee on energy environment and safety mr bedel and the entire subcommittee as a result of an arbitrary order made by the office of management and budget which the small business administration followed reluctantly the pollution control program has been shut down cold zero guarantees have been made since january 1 and this is in a 250 million program that is so successful that it actually makes money for the governmentabout 29 million a yearfor guarantee fees and interest on reserves small businesses which congress mandated must comply with stringent and expensive pollution control laws are going begging for financing and going out of business for lack of a source of that financing this bill restores the only pollution financing program available to small businesses to the way congress intended when the program was enacted in 1976 and to the way it has been administered up until this year it is a program that makes money for the government and does not cost a nickel i would like to have a colloquy with my good friend the gentleman from maryland the chairman of the committee"]], "top_unsure":

rate of interest likewise when our taxes come due next month we can either pay them promptly or pay interest and a penalty for our tardiness the government often has another methodnot available to you and meof settling its accounts too often the government says we will not pay our bills on time and we will not pay a penalty and interest for our late payment either while the government is usually a reliable customer ther are still too many late payments which can be attributed to governmental inefficiency according to the general accounting office oftentimes these late payments place no major hardships upon larger companies which can afford to carry tardy payments but the small business communitya cornerstone of our free enterprise systemdoes not always fare so well many a businessmans largest customer is some agency or branch of the government but the governmentat all levelsis often slow and sometimes unreasonably so in paying its debts and small business is very vulnerable to this interruption in its cash flow frequently it does not have the working capital to carry delinquent accounts so it must borrow moneyand borrow at a high rate of interest when the government is extremely late in paying what it owes for goods received the businessman may really find himself between a rock and a hard place as one business writer recently pointed out the businessman in this position may be forced to choose between paying his employees or remitting to the government the taxes he withheld from his employees paychecks and if he chooses to pay his employeeswhich he must do to keep his business goingthe same government which caused the trouble in the first place by not paying its bills on time turns around and fines and penalizes the businessman for not remitting the taxes this presents an untenable situation coming from abuse of power by someone or downright negligence in this time of economic crisis we just must improve government billpaying procedures one estimate finds
