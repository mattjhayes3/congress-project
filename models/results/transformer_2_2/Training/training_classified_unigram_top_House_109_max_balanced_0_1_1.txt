unsustainable and automatic growth of mandatory spending programs and extending tax relief to families and small businesses we have successfully accomplished the first two now this rule will provide for consideration of our final commitment to american taxpayers extending numerous important tax relief provisions in 2001 2003 and 2004 congress enacted responsible tax relief to help create new jobs grow americas economy and put more money in the hands of workers families small businesses farms and ranches following this tax relief unemployment dropped a full percentage point to 5 percent and we have experienced 10 uninterrupted quarters of real growth in our economy above 3 percent the longest stretch since the 1980s as was proven by the tax cuts during the kennedy and reagan administrations federal revenues actually increase after taxes are lowered our expanding economy is led by consumer spending job growth and business investment this is a result of allowing workers to keep more of their hardearned money decreasing the tax burden on small businesses so they can expand and hire more workers and providing incentives for families to save and invest unless we take action today many of the important tax provisions that have helped our economy grow strong will expire without passage of this legislation workers families and small businesses will have less of their paycheck to take home each week h r 4297 the tax relief extension reconciliation act not the most eloquent of names but an important one will continue to build on the economic progress we have already made a key part of the american jobs creation act of 2004 was a return to fairness for those who live work and raise families in states with no state income tax the state and local sales tax deduction is particularly important to those in my home state of florida and nine other states because it gives every taxpayer the opportunity to deduct state sales tax from his federal tax bill something that other highertax states have enjoyed for some time this provision is set to expire in 3 weeks while i will continue to work to make the state and local sales tax deduction permanent this bill extends the provision for an additional year which is an important step forward for fairness the bill also extends several tax incentives to enhance the affordability of higher education including taxdeferred education savings accounts and tax credits for postsecondary education it allows all taxpayers to deduct up to 4 000 of higher education expenses which will help more students go to college for teachers the tax bill extends an important abovetheline deduction to help them contain the costs of outofpocket classroom expenses such as books supplies and computer equipment we all know that our hardworking educators are covering for some of our neediest students and this bill lets them keep the tax deductibility of their generosity in an effort to encourage savings and stable retirement security this tax bill allows lowerincome families that contribute to individual retirement accounts and pension plans to continue receiving a federal match in the form of an income tax credit for the first 2 000 of annual contributions this encourages families to save and plan for their own retirement while we were unable as a body to settle on a social security reform plan surely we can all agree that encouraging lowincome families to save for retirement and giving them the tools to do so is a sound economic policy our bill freezes the rate on capital gains and dividends and prevents an increase of the tax burden on 24 million families it is imperative that we extend this tax relief so our economy will continue on its upward track new data released at the start of december show that our economy continues to strengthen and grow the labor department reported that employers added 215 000 jobs in november after adding 44 000 in october and 17 000 in september in the wake of devastating hurricanes the jobless rate remains unchanged at 5 percent the economy grew at an annual rate of 4 3 percent in the third quarter much stronger than expected forecasters outlooks for coming months are upbeat as well novembers increase in payroll the largest since july was broadbased construction employment rose by 37 000 employment in professional and technical services rose by 22 000 health care employment rose by 20 000 jobs manufacturers added 11 000 jobs last month following an increase of 15 000 in october the most recent commerce department report shows overall consumer spending increased at a 4 2 percent annual rate exceeding expectations purchases of nondurable goods surged 3 6 percent exceeding expectations housing spending came in at 8 4 percent business investment spending rose at 8 8 percent exceeding expectations obviously the current tax policy of this congress has encouraged economic growth and to raise taxes now would close the door of opportunity that is open for so many today this rule provides for consideration of a substitute bill while we often hear democrats decry tax relief they have decided to offer a substitute that extends many of the same tax provisions as this underlying bill does but let us look at who they left out the democratic substitute does not extend an income tax credit for lowincome families who contribute toindividual retirement accounts iras and pension plans this hurts lowincome families who are struggling to save for retirement people who are doing the right things to prepare for their future rather than solely depending on the government to do it for them the democratic substitute does not extend enhanced small business depreciation expensing so it increases taxes on small businesses the very engines of innovation and growth and employment in this country the democratic substitute does not include an extension of the reduced rates on capital gains and dividends without this extension 24 million families will see a tax increase including 7 million seniors who have benefited an average of 1 200 annually from that change at a time when concern is growing about foreign investment in the united states the democratic substitute throws up barriers to americans investing in america the democratic substitute does include a tax increase on families and small businesses to pay for the bill many of these individuals are small businesses who do much of the hiring and buying in this economy the democratic substitute bill leaves behind small businesses omits lowincome savers and hurts families and seniors at a time when home heating bills are rising and local property taxes are growing why would the democratic substitute take even more from the wallets and purses and piggy banks of the american taxpayer the republican tax reforms of 2001 2003 and 2004 have created jobs strengthened our economy and increased federal revenues in the process they quantifiably aided in shortening and curtailing the severity of the recession of 2000 and 2001 they buoyed the economy through major terrorist attacks devastating natural disasters and a global war on terrorism now is not the time to increase taxes on the ameriqan people failure to pass this bill would result in higher taxes on seniors savers small businesses and farmers we must continue the policies that grow our economy and keep our tax bills from rising i urge my colleagues to support this resolution and the underlying bill the tax relief extension reconciliation act i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.0007174138445407152,

our nation and way of lifeit is imperative that we begin our discussionat the beginning and that beginning wasnt on 911 weve been under attack for at least 30 years we did not want this fightwe did not invite this fightwe did not wish to engage in this battle however once our enemy crossed over the line confirmed for us and the worldthat they were unwilling to respect international law respect individual liberty respect sovereignty of nationsand that they were willing and desirous of engaging in mortal battleno other option was left to us or the civilized world abu musab alzarqawi on january 23 2005 said we have declared a fierce war on this evil principle of democracy and those who follow this wrong ideology so this discussion today comes down to a fundamental questionwhat is the appropriate strategy and tactic to adopt to win the war on terror will we withdraw and simply defenda policy of isolation and containment or will we aggressively combat terrorismand take the battle to our enemy this war is unlike any other in historywithout a doubt our enemy has no single home it recruits and trains its army from nations around the world the only unifying element is hatehate for the westhate for democracyhate for freedom of religionhate for liberty the only message our enemy understands is force period terrorists dont negotiateterrorists dont compromiseterrorists are not interested in peace to them thats weakness thankfully weve stayed the course thankfully weve persevered in both iraq and afghanistan the greatest threat to terrorism is freedom liberty and democracy in the middle east and beyond today the terrorists are truly on the run last week unitedstates and iraqi forces eliminated a qaeda in iraqs top terroristabu musab al zarqawi this was accomplished with excellent intelligenceknowing where the bad guys were and when and this information came from iraqi civiliansthat is a very positive sign this important step demonstrates many things we will hunt down terrorists and eliminate them wherever they are hiding the shackles of decades long terrorism are being removed from the middle east iraqi security forces are stepping up to the challenge iraqi citizens want to be free of terrorists and they are not going to sit idly by success breeds success never has that been more evident than this past week while zarqawi was eliminatedfinding him brought a treasure trove of information allowing unitedstates and iraqi forces to dismantle many more pieces of al qaedas puzzle success breeds success iraq just this past week selected 3 more officialscabinet ministersto serve in its standing government success breeds success it is also important for us to recall and reiterate why we are engaged in this war it is imperative during this debate that we reexamine the conditions that required the united states to take military action in afghan istan and iraq in the aftermath of the attacks of september 11 2001 just a short look at

a reminder of the dangers we face as a nation in a post9 11 world we can no longer expect oceans between us and our enemies to keep us safe policy of containment has been proven to be a dismal failure just as the battle in afghanistan was not simply to remove the taliban the battle in iraq was not simply to remove saddam hussein and his murderous regime one has to look no further than the action of our enemy to see that we are fighting those who want to bring their brand of terror and fear to our shores we must not forget those threats that have been disrupted here at home and on our allies the west coast airliner plot the heathrow airport plot and the jose padilla plot the campaign against the united states and its allies is ambitious simple and clear terrorists will stop at nothing to achieve their distorted sense of reality now we could have easily stayed out of this conflict however giving terrorists free reign would not make us any saferhistory has proven that the price would be more innocent lives lostmore bombingsand not an ounce of peace we must not be held hostage by terrorismthat is not living in liberty and freedom there are defining moments every generation must face for this generation that defining moment is how we engage in this war on terrorhighlighted by a very different post 911 world when we came to that defining momentthat tragic daywe as a nation with our

purpose of debate only i yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from new york pending which i yi eld myself such time as i may consume during consideration of this resolution all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only today we are considering a very important reform that is a bipartisan reform it is bipartisan because it is an issue that i am happy to say as we have moved down the road towards reform has enjoyed strong bipartisan support in fact it was a key provision in the housepassed lobbying accountability and transparency act which did enjoy bipartisan support not as strong as i would have liked but it did enjoy bipartisan support specifically with this new rule memberdirected spending to projects in their district or earmarks will no longer be anonymous it is very simple we all know as it stands now there are no disclosure requirements in appropriations tax bills or authorizing legislation earmarks can be buried in the text of bills that often number into the thousands of pages there is no easy way to account for how many earmarks are in a bill or who is sponsoring them this new rule requires sponsors of earmarks to be listed in committee reports conference reports must also have a list of earmarks that are airdropped or brought into an agreement in the conference report itself it is just that simple we are blowing away the fog of anonymity so the public can have a clear picture of what the projects are how much they cost and who is sponsoring them it is just a very simple case of transparency this is a victory for fiscal responsibility and a victory for spending taxpayer dollars more wisely as an enforcement mechanism this new rule also provides for a question of consideration when a bill or conference report does not contain a list of earmarks the question of consideration is debatable for 30 minutes 15 minutes equally divided if a member feels strongly enough about a proposed earmark they will have to attach their name to it that is all we are asking and they need to be prepared to make their case in full view of their colleagues their constituents and the american people as a whole the earmark reform bill will build on the reforms that have already been implemented by the appropriations committee and i take my hat off to the appropriations committee for the very bold and dynamic reforms that they have made they have reduced the number of earmarks already by 37 percent overall spending on member projects was reduced by 7 8 billion below last years level over the last 2 years member project spending has decreased by over 10 million and i want to especially express my appreciation to my very dear friend jerry lewis who has so ably chaired the appropriations committee and has stepped up to the plate and taken on this issue of reform and done it with great success because of the fact that he has been able to rein in federal spending it doesnt get a lot of attention but he has been very successful in doing that i also want to make very clear that our focus is not solely on appropriations this was one of the requests that chairman lewis made of us as we were proceeding with this work for this reform to be effective itmust be comprehensive and that was the commitment that the speaker of the house and our leadership team made to our members so let me point out that this earmark reform applies across the board it doesnt just apply to some committees it covers kll committees allappropriations all tax all authorizing legislation anything that moves through this house through regular order we have taken great care to clearly and precisely state what constitutes a tax an appropriation or an authorizing earmark and the good news is that there is more agreement than disagreement on those definitions yet clearly there is no magic bullet there is not going to be one definition that will be perfect and please everybody but at the end of the day we have to come together we have to come together and move this process forward if there is an earmark in a bill it belongs on a list it is just that simple if there is an earmark we need to see it now is this new disclosure going to completely end the practice of earmarking i certainly hope not i dont want it to because i believe that earmarking is part of our constitutional responsibility but it will shine a spotlight on earmarks without grinding the legislative process to a halt let me make very clear that the larger goal of this new rule is to make a profound and lasting change in how this institution handles earmarks and spends taxpayer dollars the goal is to increase transparency disclosure and accountability and the goal is to pull back the curtain on earmarks for the public because i believe that they have a right to know for this earmark reform to be both meaningful and lasting everyone from committee chairmen on down must make a goodfaith effort to comply with the spirit of the new rule our leadership and certainly the rules committee has made such a commitment and we are determined to make this work i would also like to point out that while this is an important milestone in the path toward reform we have not reached the gohl line in fact i dont believe that we will ever reach the absolute goal line because reform is a continuous process it gains momentum from members who never let up and never settle for the status quo i urge my colleagues to vote yes for reforming earmarks and yes to setting the stage for more reforms that we will face down the road i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.000769004924222827,

experience from our members that bring that experience to bear here as we look at how we grow the economy how we exercise economic opportunity how we make certain that free enterprise stays free just as the gentleman from georgia has mentioned it is no secret everybody knows that this economy this wonderful unitedstates economy truly is our nations our worlds economic engine it is the envy of all of the world it is i guess something that is really a little bit uniquely american there is something about us we strive to do things a little bit better maybe it is that yankee ingenuity maybe it is that we are out here with that good old commonsense knowhow but we are always trying to do things faster better more efficiently more effectively and one of the things we certainly want to do is to build a strong economy so that our children know that they are going to have hope and opportunity and the ability to dream big dreams and create a really exciting life for themselves and for their families i guess that is just kind of the american way of doing things we try to improve it give us something and we are going to build a better mousetrap then we are going to figure out how to get that mousetrap into the marketplace in todays economy we look at it and we say how do we get that into a global marketplace we know in order to do that it means you have to stay competitive we know that as you look at policies creating the right environment so that job growth can take place so that economic growth can take place that when we see that right environment created then free enterprise and the private sector take over and they do what they do well the gentleman has shown us the charts which tell this story you go back and you look at 2003 and look at when those tax reforms were implemented and what we saw was an economy that took off what we are seeing is consistent economic growth every single month we are reaping the benefits from that we see that our gdp growth continues to be very consistent it was 4 1 percent last quarter there are some really wonderful benefits that come from this as the gentleman mentioned 4 460 000 new jobs those are new jobs many of those jobs are jobs that are basically in new sectors technology sectors sectors of the economy that will lead to an economic renaissance and lead to an economic renaissance in this country it works out to be 194 000 jobs a month that we have been creating over the past several months and i find it so interesting that the unemployment rate is near alltime lows when we look at the charts on that we see that as these tax reforms have been put in place and i applaud the senate i applaud the administration and i certainly applaud the leadership in this house for pushing forward these tax reforms in 2003 and as we see those going into place and we see the gdp growth and we see the jobs creation and we watch the unemployment level fall to near historic lows there is also afother benefit from this our colleagues who are joining us here on the floor this evening certainly are watching this one with us and it is that we are seeing the deficit reduced through two ways we have talked so many times on this floor about there being two ways that we work through reducing the deficit and reducing the size of government and rightsizing the federal government and that is we reduce spending and continue to work to root out waste fraud and abuse focusing on that spending column but at the same time we put the focus on economic growth that is where our focus rightfully should be this is an aggressive economy and it is therefore a reason and tomorrow this house is going to move forward and take some excellent steps to pass a bill that is going to continue these tax reforms at this time i am going to yield back to the gentleman from georgia so that he can yield to another of our colleagues and we can continue with our discussion this evening on the benefits that lie ahead by extending

american unit of the legacy unitedstates customs service that were created by an act of congress in 1972 to patrol the unitedstates mexican land border within the tohono oodham indian nation in southern arizona if you kind of visualize the southwest border california arizona new mexico and texas and then think of phoenix and tucson coming straight down nogales and then go towards california going west that area would be the tohono oodham reservation it is an artificially definedborder with mexico there because in fact the tohono oodham are on both sides of that and congressman hayworth here in congress has a bill to try to address how they can move inside their reservation particularly as we tighten our border but it is a different challenge because quite frankly they were there before mexico and the united states were there so it is a different type of a challenge on the southwest border as to how we are going to provide security from terrorism security from narcotics from other types of items moving through as well as illegal immigration now many people dont necessarily know tohono oodham as a name right off the bat it is the papago indian tribe is what we historically called them both in the north up more towards phoenix and down in the southwest but the tohono oodham view themselves as that name and now the federal government has recognized them by that it is a relatively recent change just like on our north border up by where the mohawk reservation was now they are called the akwesasne indian reservation but we have a similar challenge on that side of the border now the reason the shadow wolves were created is when you have a separate nation inside your nation one of the hardest things for our drug agents for our historic ins agents and others to penetrate is inside an indian nation they are very closed societies they know who is going to be where inside that nation it is not easy to penetrate and here we had one of the most successful tracking organizations the shadow wolves have been featured in people magazine on television all sorts of newspapers around the country for years because they combine modern technology with ancient tracking techniques combined with being members inside that nation to provide law and order inside that nation they arrested and pursued and identified narcotics smugglers along their 76 miles of border and 2 8 million acres and they would seize roughly i4928 100 000 pounds of illegal narcotics every year but when we created the department of homeland security we did something very unwise we decided by splitting the cbp the customs and border protection from the ice agents we left several agencies in the lurch one is the air and marine division that didnt either picket fence on the border or do investigations inside so we are trying to work that out which has been easier to do over in the water border on the gulf of mexico in the caribbean sea but has been much tougher on the mexican land border with the united states but the other is what do you do with a group like the shadow wolves they dont fit in an ice box they have a border which is where we try to protect the border but they also do investigations inside andthe department of homeland security in trying to figure out how to deal with things that dont quite fit square pegs in a round hole jammed them in under cbp and that meant several things one is the shadow wolves a distinct entity disappeared because they scattered them along with cbp agents all over the country because it did not fit the organization structure to say oh this is a unique thing on the southwest border lets create a unique thing so now inside the tohono oodham reservation we have cbp agents that do not belong to that nation we have ice agents that are not part of that nation and we have got tohono oodham native americans scattered all over the united states it makes no sense needless to say it is not working that great as we look at nogales and the traffic pouring through in arizona and as it moves over to douglas as we build more fences as we put more agents on the border guess what happens they move over to the open areas the barry goldwater air force range tohono oodham indian reservation and the fish and wildlife area to the western part of arizona they are overrun now just in one hearing we had several years ago during the time of the hearing they had had 1 500 pounds of drugs moved through in the previous 3 months then 1 500 pounds the previous month during our hearing with all of the different agents around they snared something like 1 800 pounds five different carloads another group with seven suvs going through they put a blackhawk on them this has become a nomans zone you cannot break organizations if you do not have investigations within rather than breaking up the shadow wolves we should have been doing a similar thing up in new york state we need to be looking at similar things in montana where the black feet are not quite on the reservation but how to work with the tribal groups to create tracking organizations that can do both border and investigations now this bill is an imperfect solution it puts them over in ice they basically need to do both things but since the government continues to stick with they have got to be either a or b better be b than a because making them scattered along like a picket fence and working with cbp wherever they assign them makes no sense we need them back together we need them as a tracking unit more like a historic customs ice organization what this bill does is transfers them in fact back to ice it moves their pay scale to be like ice special agents it grants the chief officer of the shadow wolves a rank equivalent to the resident agent in charge of the ice investigations and authorizes similar units in areas sach in the akwesasne reservation in upstate new york that is the basic thrust of the bill we know we need to work with the appropriations committee we addressed this in the homeland security appropriations bill but we just moved the dollars over in fact we will have to work out some kind of transition because ice agents make more than cbp these people were trained trackers then all of a sudden we put them back on the border it makes no sense and we in congress who created this need to make sure that we stand behind this great ide before all of them retire many already took early retirement or quit because they saw no commitment to ke6ping them together as a native american organization i rise in strong support of h r 5589 which directs the secretary of homeland security to transfer to united states immigration and customs enforcement all functions of the customs patrol officers unit operating on the tohono oodham indian reservation this legislation responds to an urgent national priority regaining control of our borders and stopping the crossborder smuggling of people narcotics and other contraband id like to thank majority leader boehner mr shadegg and mr king of iowa for their leadership in bringing this joint legislation to the floor the shadow wolves are one of the last remaining customs patrol officer cpo units in the country created by congress in 1972 the shadow wolves operate on the tohono oodham indian reservation in southern arizona which has 76 miles of the unitedstates mexican border running through it that reservation has historically been a major conduit for drug smuggling and the shadow wolvesall of them native americans who combine modem technology with traditional indian tracking techniquesare responsible for stopping the smuggling of drugs illegal aliens and other contraband between the ports of entry within the 2 8 million acres of the tohono oodham nation just since january of this year the shadow wolves have interdicted over 15 000 pounds of illegal drugs that otherwise would have been sold on the streets the shadow wolves have also assisted numerous federal law enforcement agencies with enforcement issues on the reservation despite being one of our most successful antismuggling investigative units however the shadow wolves are about to disappear altogether after the formation of the department of homeland security the shadow wolves were taken out of their historic location at the customs office of investigations and arbitrarily assigned to the tucson sector of the border patrol this arrangement has been unworkable because the mission and tactics of the shadow wolves who are more like investigators than patrolmen simply do not fit the organizational model of the border patrol the shadow wolves have already lost nearly a quarter of their personnel due to attrition and to date there have been no qualified replacements h r 5589 fixes this problem by transferring the shadow wolves back to the office of investigations now located within ice once again the shadow wolves will be able to do what they do best

very much and as our colleagues have expressed to you before we thank you for organizing these meetings and helping to get the truth squad out here many of us have been concerned for the past several months that there is a lot of disinformation out there and that the time has come for us to set the record straight and i think that it is very important that we do so just saying things will not make them so but if they are not responded to then people will believe that they are so i thought that our colleague the gentlewoman from the state of virginia mrs drake was doing a great job of talking about several of the issues that i think are important and talking about ireland as a great success story is important to do e 1500 our economy is doing great and talking it down does not help our situation and our country i think we do need to be positive and talk about how things are going great i speak to a lot of school groups and they will often ask me what is the difference between democrats and republicans and i generally give them several things to think about but as my colleague pointed out the biggest difference between democrats and republicans is we believe that the public knows how to spend its money better than the government knows how to spend their money that is sort of a short definition if we left it up to the democrats they would basically be taking all the money from everybody and giving it to government bureaucrats to spend i think the whole issue of family friendly taxes is very important too we are not a party of extremely wealthy people as we are portrayed to be in fact there is a lot more wealth on the other side than there is on our side but they do a pretty good job of trying to hide that i want to talk about some specific numbers also in addition to talking about in general terms some things that may have already been said by some of my colleagu~s i have been out meeting with constituents so i am not sure of allthe things that were said and i hope i do not repeat too many of the same things i think it is important to talk about the fact that our unemployment rate right now is 4 7 percent the lowest monthly rate since 2001 and lower than the averages of the 1970s 1980s and 1990s just today i was talking to a man with a very large business down in north carolina in the fifth district and he was saying they could grow their business by 300 or 400 people if they could get the skilled workers that they need to grow that business that is a very significant point for us our economy could be doing even better but we do lack skilled folks i talked with him and i will be working with the community college system down there to try to help him get the programs established that he needs so that they can get peoplewith the backgrounds that they need i am not sure if congresswoman drake mentioned this but real household net worth right now is 51 1 trillion an alltime high in this country our gdp of course is growing at a much higher rate than anybody thought it was going to grow the fourth quarter grew at 1 6 percent and the estimate had been 1 1 percent this encouraging economic news is proof that lower taxes plus restrained federal spending equals economic growth that is a math equation that the democrats just cannot seem to grasp maybe it is because they keep trying to substitute new variables and it just does not work taxing plus spending will never equal economic growth and prosperity but the republican formula of lower taxes and restrained federal spending will always come out in favor of thi american taxpayer and his checkbook and that is what we need to be concentrating on i am going to throw out a few more facts to go along with what we are trying to do through the truth squad we have got high consumer confidence these days too it rose to 106 3 in january the highest level in over 3 years so we are doing our best to make sure people know the economy is doing well and to raise consumer confidence we know that incomes rose in december and we are up 1 4 percent in 2005 again very very good news retail sales rose in december we are up 6 4 percent in 2005 over 2004 our manufacturing continues to expand manufacturing activity grew for the 32nd consecutive month in january there is tremendous expansion out there so we want that to continue to grow construction spending is at an alltime high construction spending rose 1 percent in the month of december alone for 2005 spending reached a record 1 120 trillion an increase of 8 9 percent over the previous record set in 2004 housing starts continue to go up so our economy is doing very well and again it is based on the fact that republicans believe in lower taxes and leaving more money in the pockets of american families that is the way we can grow the economy i hate hearing the words government inveftment the government never invests it spends we have to get people to understand the language as my colleagues know language is a very important thing to us how we use words is important because it gets peoples minds set about what those words mean we need to stop government spending and we need to leave as much money as possible in the hands of the american taxpayers we need to keep this economy growing vitally and the way to do that is to keep republicans in charge with that i will yield back to the gentleman from georgia"], [0.0007744542672298849, 0.0007744542672298849, 0, "i thank the gentleman very much not only do these snowflake babies speak to us the snowflake babies are the babies that were produced by the parents of the excess embryos giving these embryos to a mother who could not have a baby they were implanted in her womb and we now have more than 100 of those they were here by the way a year or so ago a number of snowflake babies were here in the congress and in the white house but i think there is something else that speaks to us too and that is that before you would harvest the cells from one of these embryos by destroying the embryo you would want to know that it was a healthy embryo and you would have it under the microscope and you are looking at it you want to make sure it is a healthy embryo because you want to have stem cell lines that will be really healthy when you are looking at that embryo under there it ought to occur to you that that could be the next albert einstein or the next beethoven and you are not now looking at 400 000 surplus embryos in the fertility clinics you are looking at that one embryo under your microscope that embryo ought to speak to you it could be the next albert einstein it could be the next beethoven and how could you kill the next albert einstein or the next beethoven fortunately as dr gingrey said there is a way of getting embryonic stem cells without destroying embryos the president was not unmindful of the potential for embryonic stem cell research and he really wanted the medical community to benefit from embryonic stem cell research so quite immediately after he issued his executive order saying that they could use federal money only for research on those stem cell lines that had already been established those stem cell lines now are running out as we knew they would and a few weeks months ago there were 21 22 or so left maybe fewer than that left now we started out with maybe 60 very shortly after the president issued his executive order he set up a council on bioethics and they issued a report i have here a copy of that report and they detailed and discussed at quite some length it is very interesting reading and i think even the layman could appreciate most of it they discussed four different potential ways of getting embryonic stem cells as the equivalent of an embryonic stem cell without destroying or hurting an embryo the second one of those that they talked about you will see a little asterisk there and you go to the bottom of the page and you will see the notation that congressman bartlett suggested this technique before the bioethics committee met a little later i will indicate to you how i came to have my first discussion with the president on this and how we now made that 5year journey from then to now what i have here in this slide is a depiction of the reproductive tract of the female and what we will be talking about is what goes on in a dish in the laboratory that i think is a whole lot easier to understand what is going on if we look at this process in this depiction of the mothers reproductive tract here in the corner here we see the total reproductive tract which has the vagina and the cervix and the uterus and the two fallopian tubes and each fallopian tube ending in a funnellike structure called infundibulum and there is the ovary and the blowup here is only onehalf of this reproductive tract so there is a mirror image on the other half of it this shows what happens in the fertilization and the early development of the embryo once a month ordinarily an ovum ripens and is released from the ovary and if sperm had been deposited in the reproductive tract they then travel up the reproductive tract the egg is fertilized very quickly very soon after it is released from the ovary now sometimes the egg is not picked up by the infundibulum and it floats out into the body many of these sperm will make it clear through the reproductive tract and go out into the body where they will simply be absorbed later but they may find the ovum out there and fertilize the ovum then the ovum will do what it does in the reproductive tract it will divide again and again and we will look at that in a moment at the appropriate time it will find someplace to implant and since it is out here in the body cavity it will implant on one of the body tissues and we call this an ectopic pregnancy and that pregnancy will threaten the life of the mother the baby cannot develop fully there and the baby will die and the mother too if this is not interrupted at other times as the egg fertilized egg goes down the reproductive track here it may implant along the tube here and we call that a tubal pregnancy and that tube is nowhere near big enough to accommodate a baby growing so the baby will die and the mother possibly too if we do not interrupt that pregnancy but most of the time and nature is really quite a marvel most of the time the egg is fertilized here high up in the fallopian tube and then it begins a several day journey and here we have the days marked day 4 day 5 and day 6 and 7 and day 8 and 9 it is a bit more than a week after it is released from the ovum and fertilized and day zero here begins the fertilization it makes its way down the reproductive track no motility of its own it is moved along by little cilia little hairlike projections on the wall of the oviduct which move in wavelike fashion and move the ovum down as it moves down it divides first into two cells then four cells and then into 8 cells and we will come back to that 8cell stage because that is an important one then it goes on to divide further to a number of cells and finally to the inner sell mass that we found on that first slide and then it implants in the uterus and the mothers uterus produces some tissue and the little embryo produces some tissues we call these the decidua and they develop the placenta and the amnion they are filled with fluids and support the baby and protect it during its development when eggs are taken from the laboratory and all of this by the way can happen in the laboratory in a petri dish they simply take the egg from the mother generally produced by hormone treatment that causes multiple ovulations so that there are a number of eggs there may be 6 8 10 eggs are produced by the mother they will fertilize those in a dish in the laboratory a petri dish in vitro that means in glass this is in vivo that means in life the in vitro fertilization they then will divide and the doctors watch them divide and if they are going to harvest these for stem cells they generally wait to the inner cell mass stage down here and take them out and the reason for that is that these cells do not like to be alone and you have to be clever to get one of them to divide so they take them when they have lots of company after there is a number of cells in the inner cell mass they take these cells and destroy the embryo in the process there is a technique used first in laboratories in england and then in this country and i spent more than a half hour on the phone with two of the physicians in the one here in virginia where they go to the 8cell stage and this is all in a petri dish in a laboratory now and they take a cell and sometimes they get 2 cells from the 8cell stage and they do a preimplantation genetic diagnosis on that to make sure that the baby is not going to have some genetic deficiencies like trisomy 21 you generally know it as mongolism and that is when just one of the chromosomes there are three of them there and if there are three of those chromosomes there there are various degrees of trisomy 21 but the baby then will be affected by that and you would like to have most parents would like to have a normal baby so they can do a preimplementation genetic diagnosis and then they implant the remaining seven and sometimes six cells and more than 2 000 times now what appears to be a perfectly normal baby has been produced from that i will have a slide a little later to show this but i would just like to note for now that that is no big surprise in fact the big surprise to me would be that the baby was not normal because nature for as long as we have had people here and happens in animals too but nature has been doing exactly this but they take not just one or two cells away nature takes half the cells away and from each half nature grows a perfectly normal baby and we call them identical twins so if nature can take half of the cells away and each half develops into a perfectly normal baby it ought to be that you can take a cell or two away and the embryo would not even know it if it does not know that half of the cells are gone if it goes on and develops into a perfectly normal baby each half does why should it be affected at all if you take only one or two cells so the big surprise to me would have been if there was any effect of this on the baby and it is that technique which had occurred to me earlier but to kind of put this in perspective i would like to look at the next slide and this next slide this next chart up depicts some of things that we have been talking about and some additional ones this is the fertilization process we saw that in that former slide but we did not see there the early development of the gametes or the sex cells and they develop in the seminiferous tubules in the male and in the ova of the female those cells divide and divide again and most of these divisions are what we call mitotic divisions that the chromosomes split so that the same number of chromosomes remain in the daughter cells but in one of these processes there is a meiotic division called meiosis where the chromosomes do not divide so that when the cells split each daughter cell has only half as many chromosomes you see that is necessary because the chromosomes are going to be joined from the female and from the male and you now need to end up with the right number of chromosomes not twice as many chromosomes because if that happened the embryo would certainly die by the way it is really interesting that in plants when you have what is called polyploidy that is what this is called when you have polyploidy which is more than the diploid which is the double and there is a haploid number here and there is a diploid number when the two haploids come together in plants it just makes them bigger and prettier and the flowers brighter colored and so forth that works well for plants but for humans and all other animals by the way it is fatal so this depicts the fertilization process and they combine to form the embryo and then the embryo divides again and again and we see there the same types of depictions that we saw previously the second little sequence here shows cloning and dolly the sheep was the first clone that the public knew about anyway that was produced in cloning what happens is that you take an egg cell and you take the nucleus from the egg cell you remove the nucleus so now you have an egg cell with no nucleus there and then you take a nucleus from a donor cell this is a general somatic by soma that means body somatic cell you take the nucleus from that cell and you put it inside the egg cell now all of the genetic material is not in the nucleus most of the genetic material that determines who you are whether you are male or female tall or short blond or brunette going to be tall and thin or short and stout most of that is in the nucleus but in the cytoplasm here are a lot of control factors ribonucleic acid so called rna and then messages are sent back and forth between the cytoplasm and the nucleus and so there are a lot of control factors here in the cytoplasm that when this nucleus from a skin cell or whatever is put inside this egg cell it is controlled by these control factors in the cytoplasm under appropriate circumstances so that it now behaves as if it were an embryonic cell and that is because of the control factors here of course what the offspring is going to look like now is what the individual looked like from which the donor cell was taken i was privileged to go to a little dairy in my district that is probably unique in all of the world he happened to have the best holstein cow in america which probably means the best holstein cow in the world because we have some of the best cattle in the world her name was zena and a cloning company wanted to work with him and so he cloned two daughters of zena and then zena broke her back and she had to be put down but he had zenas daughters it was very interesting the daughters did not look exactly like zena why shouldnt they and that is because of the black and white pigment the general distribution whether they are mostly white or mostly black is controlled by the genes but the actual pattern is kind of an accident of development and so the two daughters had exactly the same genetic composition as their mother looked somewhat different they both had roughly the same amount of black and white but it was distributed a little differently and so you could see there the effects of the factors at work during the development of the embryo the third little sequence down here shows us parthogenesis parthogenesis is when an offspring develops just from the ova that can only happen if this meiotic division does not occur because the ovum has to and it says that here induce the egg to keep all of its chromosomes this is kind of easy to do with salamanders and frogs and so forth there is a lot of parthenogenic embryonic studies that are done with these with these animals but now of course it is going to have exactly the same genetic makeup as the mother i do not know if we ever have a documented case of this happening in humans but you can certainly induce it in some of the lower animals the next chart now shows us the four processes the potential sources of stem cells that were described here in the white paper produced by the presidents council on bioethics called alternative sources of human pluripotent stem cells dr gingrey used the term pluripotent i would like to note just for a moment what that means the embryo itself when it is first fertilized is totipotent it can produce any and all cells including the decidua these are the cells that will produce the amnion and corion to support the embryo by the time it gets to several divisions even the eightcell stage it has now become only pluripotent a single cell will not be able to produce all of the tissues of the body if it could produce everything maybe produce all of the issues of the body but not the decidua if it could produce all of those it would simply as dr gingrey mentioned be another embryo and the ethical argument would start all over but it is my understanding and i was pleased to learn this because i did not know before i got involved in this i do not think that we knew until very recently with research when the embryo went from totipotent to pluripotent but you do not want totipotent cells you want only pluripotent cells that is why the name of this article there are several different techniques four of them and three of them are shown here the last one will be on the next slide altered nuclear transfer this is an interesting one you will see that it looks very much like the cloning but what they do before they put the donor cell is they turn out turn off some of the genes in the donor cell generally they are the genes that would produce the decidua so you do not end up with an embryo you end up with a mass of dividing cells that have all of the cell types the embryo would have but they are not organized as an embryo so the argument is made that since it is not an embryo you can take the cells from it and then you turn the gene back on because in your stem cell line you want to have a normal cell so you turn the gene back on there is another variant of this which is interesting and might have less ethical arguments because the ethical argument here might be that you are simply producing a deformed fetus if a fetus is born deformed you do not take it and kill it so why should you kill this you have intentionally deformed it now the proponents of this will argue that it is really not a fetus because it has no chance of ever developing into a baby but that argument kind of goes away if you use this technique because what they do here is to enhance the cells that produce the embryonic stem cell growth so that it cannot produce the whole baby 0l 2015 you havent disrupted changed the embryonic makeup you simply enhanced the activity of some of the cells so this altered nuclear transfer oocyteassisted reprogramming is what it is called and obviously we need a lot of animal experimentation which is what the bill provides for this is the technique that i had suggested to the president i met him at an event shortly after i went to nih and i talked to some of the doctors there they had an open laboratory there and invited the staff out and members out i think i was probably the only member that was there but they were talking about the potential of embryonic stem cell research they didnt know what position the president was going to take and of course you cant get inside their head but my feeling was that they believed that the president was going to pbrmit the use of surplus embryos and use federal money for that he of course did not do that but i asked them during this discussion if in the development of identical twins you can take half the cells away and each half produces a perfectly normal baby why shouldnt you be able to take one or two cells away to produce a stem cell line from and then the rest of the embryo would produce a perfectly normal baby and they said yes that ought to be possible and this is just depicted here you have taken a cell away and you developed it into an embryonic stem cell line that is easier said than done because these cells dont like to be alone and now two doctors say they have done it verlinksy and lanza both say that they have successfully developed a stem cell line from a single cell but both of them did it creatively by giving this cell some company and after developing a sufficient number of like cells they then could take the company cells away and they had a pure embryonic stem cell line the last one here is a really interesting one and that is the idea that you could take cells from an embryo which was clinically dead like a person could be clinically dead but their organs are still good that is how we do organ transplants so maybe there is a time when an embryo is clinically dead but the cells are still alive it does not have the organizational capacity to produce an embryo but yet the cells are still alive there has been a lot of research on this and yes that is a possibility the argument might be gee what kind of confidence could you have you have got a good stem cell line from an embryo that was dead but the counterargument would be and one of our colleagues has a lung transplant here in the house and one of my very good friends here had a double lung transplant and lived with it for a long number of years and both of those came from people who were clinically dead the next chart shows a really interesting one and if this could be made to work it is better than any of the others because you now would end up with embryonic stem cells that were a genetic match for the person that you were going to treat and we wont take the time to go through these but these are all techniques of trying to convince the donor cell this is the donor this is the guy with parkinsons disease or the child with diabetes you take the donor cell now and you use embryonic stem cell the cytoplasm of the embryonic stem cell to confuse the donor cell nucleus so that it thinks it is an embryonic stem cell and if you can do that it is called dedifferentiation you have now taken the dedifferentiated state if you could do that this would be the best of all worlds because not only do you have a stem cell you have a stem cell that is generically identical to the person you are going to treat so you dont have any rejection now we dont know if this is going to work or not and what this bill does is to authorize the nih to expend federal funds to explore all of these techniques the next slide shows a phenomenon and i would like to ask dr gingrey to make a brief comment we will be closing here in about 7 minutes but this is what led me to believe that you could take cells from an early embryo without hurting it because nature does this all the time it is called identical twinning sometimes they divide at the twocell stage and sometimes as late as the innercell mass stage and my understanding is that you can tell when the division occurred by how they present if they present at birth in a common amnion the division probably occurred at the twocell stage if they present in the uterus with two different amnions the division probably occurred at the innercell mass stage and i would like to ask dr gingrey in his many deliveries if he has had a chance to verify if this was true"], [0.0007958542555570602, 0.0007958542555570602, 0, "i thank the gentleman from georgia who is doing such an extraordinarily wonderful job as he represents the positions that our party holds on so many issues that are important to the american people i am going to be heading to my district for the weekend as most members are spending some time there having the opportunity to talk with them but as the gentleman from georgia was saying we wanted the opportunity to just address and maybe do a little bit of correcting on some of the points that our colleagues from across the aisle have been saying and stating sometimes i think that they are just sadly misinformed on some of these issues they saidthat republicans are not looking to cut spending i just find that extraordinary they said that democrats are the ones that are wanting to cut spending the level of hypocrisy in that statement is absolutely astounding we have a democratic party in this house whose message and i honestly believe many days is the only message that they have that message is spend more whatever it is spend more whatever they are wanting to do if they do not think the outcome is right go spend more and for years they have held this thought that if you just put more money in the pot then the outcome is going to be what they want spend more spend more and what holds them together i think that is something that is a curiosity to many people because they are not united on foreign policy they are not united on winning in iraq they are not united on border control issues they are not united behind working families who tell us repeatedly that what they want is lower taxes lighter regulation preserving individual freedom and having their shot at hope and opportunity our colleagues across the aisle are not united on that the one thing that they repeatedly seem to be united on is spending more of the taxpayers money spending more of your hardearned money and it is amazing to me government never gets enough of the taxpayer money government has this huge voracious appetite for the taxpayers money they just cannot get enough of it there is always another program many of them are great programs but one of the truths that we all see here in this body if government moves in to solve a problem generally neither the private nor notforprofit sector will move in and address that problem 1415 so you have additional costs that come about every time we talk about winning in iraq our friends across the aisle seem to say let us get out regardless of the sacrifices that are made every time we talk about controlling the border they are over there saying no way yesterday i was on a cnbc program and a democrat member of the house said that their party had never been invited to offer spending cuts there are 435 members of this body and they are waiting for an invitation to come in and participate in how to reduce the size of government this morning i was on the floor and i said please consider this the invitation come on everybody needs to work on this it should be a bipartisan effort it should involve every single member of this house how we go about reducing what the federal government spends i have three bills that would enact acrosstheboard cuts 1 percent 2 percent and 5 percent cuts and for all of their talk today about how they want to cut spending not one single democrat is on those bills not one we have got 14 republicans who are on those bills and not one democrat has signed on to commit to finding 1 2 or 5 percent of waste fraud and abuse in government spending i ask my colleagues who is really leading on this issue i hear plenty of accusations from the left i hear plenty of complaining and i see zero action a lot of talk no action they controlled this body for 40 years and in that 40 years they built layer after layer after layer after layer of government they cooked them a big old government cake layer upon layer we have got programs out there that do nothing but waste our money we have got 342 different economic development programs there is a lot of work that we can do everyone is invited to come in and work on these issues and anytime we even try to restrain spending look at the rhetoric that we hear it is our party in this house it is our leader the gentleman from illinois speaker hastert who truly is leading on this issue not the minority leader it is our leaders who are pushing this it is our party who would like to reduce government spending by billions of ddllars billions more in next years budget it is our party that would like to see acrosstheboard spending reductions their solution that they offer is repealingtax relief that is well deserved by hardworking american families repealing that reliefand raising taxes period that is the only thing that unites their party i hope that they will work with us on reducing the spending of the federal government i thank the

working group myself along with kendrick meek mr meek from florida and also ms wasserman schultz from florida we have been coming here now for a couple of years talking about the condition of the united states our fiscal situation our investment situation or lack of investment in the united states of america and also what we believe is the democraticf caucus and leader peloij and steny hoyer and the issues that we are trying to put forward it has been a very interesting week here for the democratic caucus we had a wonderful guest george lucas the famous writer director producer of the great star wars movies and he was here to talk about the innovation agenda that the democratiq party is beginning to put forward and we have an innovation agenda to keep america competitive in the 21st century as we look at what has been happening here in the united states this kind of breaks down into two or three separate categories one if we want to be a strong country we have got to start here at home and we got to start making the investments here in the united statep research and development education health care alternative energy technologies must start here and we must begin to grow our economy here if we are going to be of any good to anyone else here in the world unfortunately our friends across the aisle on the republican side have failed miserably in their attempt to try to balance the budget here in the united states of america we have as citizens of this country regardless of what political party you belong to we have as a country an 8 2 trillion national debt 8 2 trillion dollars each citizen in this country owes 27 000 to our national debt if a baby is born today that baby owes 27 000 to the united states government to help us pay our debt if you are a senior citizen you owe 27 000 to the united states government and if we keep going down the path that we have been on and here it is 8 2 trillion as of valentines day 2006 and your share of the national debt is 27 500 we have a real situation in the united states of america so not only do we owe this not only does each person owe that what do we do so if we are running a 400 billion annual deficit or 300 billion what do we do to fund business in the united states of america we have got to go out and borrow the money and this president in the first 4 years of his term borrowed more money from foreign interests than every single administration prior to his in the last 224 years this president borrowed 1 05 trillion from foreign interests in 4 years more than every other president before him is that making america stronger mr speaker i do not think it is i think it weakens our country and here it is this president in a republican house and a republican senate has borrowed 1 05 trillion from 2001 to 2005 and all of these presidents did not borrow as much from foreign interests as this one has and that puts us that puts us at a position of weakness because guess who we are borrowing the money from to pay the bills we borrow some from unitedstates interests but this is a chart that outlines who else we are borrowing this money from 682 billion we have borrowed from japan 249 billion we have borrowed from china 67 8 billion from opec are you kidding me we are borrowing money from opec to help fund and plug the hole in our annual deficits here meanwhile they are making money hand over fist this is a very dangerous situation that we are in because here is the end result here is where the rubber meets the road as we all take out loans to pay for our homes or our cars or our kids education unfortunately you cannot just borrow the money at zero percent interest you have got to pay interest on the money you borrow so the interest on 8 2 trillion is a lot of money so what does that mean for our annual payments that we have to make just on the interest this chart is the 2007 budget in billions of dollars this big red bar that gets up to 230 billion is what we are going to pay in the 2007 budget projected on interest on the debt just the interest we are not paying it down we are just paying the interest on it and this nice lavender bar that barely gets up over 50 billion is what we are going to spend on education and then homeland security and then veterans the irresponsible policies of this administration put our fiscal house in disorder because we are spending so much money on just paying the interest on the money we owe the chinese and the japanese and the opec countries that is a great deal for those countries great deal for them but what about us a stronger america starts here at home so until we fix this problem there is no issue we can go on addressing because it straps our hands behind our back because we want to make investments in education research and development pell grants to lower the cost of college tuition put research money into figuring out an alternatie energy source so we are not dependent on some of these opec countries but check this out this is the interest on the debt that i just showed this is what we could spend every day in this country if we did not have to pay all this interest on the debt we could invest 1 million a day into every congressional district i represent a district in northeast ohio youngstown ohio akron ohio niles ohio warren ohio portage county kent state university is in my district this is an older area in the northeast of the great state of ohio the great buckeye state 365 million i could have to go back to this area and invest in the schools head start all kinds of other different things just from my district and every other member in here would get 365 million a tremendous difference give it to the chinese banks the chiinese government give it to the japanese banks the japanese government give it to opec or give it to the kids who are trying to go to school in youngstown ohio of which 80 percentlive in poverty that go to youngstown city schools i know what i would like to choose some other things here we could provide health care to 79 925 more veterans if we would not have to pay the interest on the debt like in the late 1990s when we made the very difficult decision here and i am glad the gentleman from florida is joining us for this point a very difficult decision in 1993 when president clinton got into office we were running budget deficit after budget deficit every year and our democratic house and a democratic senate with a democratic president balanced the budget in 1993 without one republican vote i am hot saying some republicans would not vote for it now but at that time when the heat was on without one republican vote and it led to balanced budgets surpluses as far as the eye could see investments into education hope scholarship the whole nine yards and the greatest 6conomic expansion in the history of this country more important the private sector because interest rates were low the private sector was able to go out and create over 20 million new jobs we cannot create jobs here in government that is not our duty that is not our responsibility this is the chart reagan reagan reagan bush bush bush all in the red and clinton in the late 1990s after the 1993 budget was im plemented we started having surpluses in the late 1990s projected out as far as the eye could see because of fiscal discipline that is what our job is here balance the budget keep interest rates low invest in the education and research like this country has always done and the private sector will join and take over some other things if we did not have to pay the interest on the debt we could enroll 60 000 kids into head start you want to talk about being compassionate you want to talk about if you practice the christian faith being a christian i think somewhere that means making sure we can invest into those poor districts those poor children and i am so glad that mr meek is joining us because we started out here and that we being me talking about the impact of the budget deficit and the fiscal situation that we are in right now and the damage that it is causing to the american economy and the lack of investment because we are paying the interest on the debt to many of these countries overseas so thank you very much fot joining us i know you were busy in a homeland security committee hearing and i appreciate you coming up to support the 30somethings"],

this metaphor of a shell game because that is exactly what the democrats are trying to do with the american people because again the spending that it is going to take to relieve the human suffering on the gulf coast can only come from one of three places either we are going to pass debt on to our children we are going to engage in massive tax increases on the american people or we are going to ask the federal budget not to grow quite as fast to get rid of some of the fraud to get rid of some of the waste to get rid of the lowerpriority spending what they want to make sure in their shell game is that they never show the american people the massive tax increases they are planning they have planted seeds in our socalled entitlement spending that american people are not going to be able to afford their tax plan just grows and grows and grows again what is going to happen for the next generation for the democrats to fund all of their programs when they refuse to work with us and we have invited them to work with us to help reform some of this entitlement spending if they do not work with us this is the future our children and grandchildren are facing massive and massive tax increases we will be on the verge of being perhaps the first generation to leave our children a lower standard of living we are going to have to double taxes on the american people just to balance the budget in

budget has outpaced the family budget by over a full third is there any reason why we should have the federal budget outpace the family budget by over a third ultimately all of this sp~ndifig has to be paid for all this spending is not created equal i mean too often we hear from those on the other side of the aisle that any time we try to restrain the growth of spending that somehow we are hurting the poor well i am here to tell you compassion for the poor is not measured by the number of government checks you send out it is measured by the number of jobs you create so that the american people can go out and re alize their american dream and when we have had tax relief not only not only have we received greater tax revenues the deficit has come down but what we have also seen is millions and millions of americans 4 million new jobs created from tax relief now when we look at the federal budget and we look at this spending sometimes many good things come from it kevlar vests for our brave men and women fighting in the war on terror student loans for many needy folks who otherwise might not have an opportunity to go to college but all too often we also see a medicare who will pay five times as much for a wheelchair as the va did simply because one would competitively bid and the other would not we see 800 spent on an outhouse in a national park and the toilet does not even flush 800 000 we see millions and millions of dollars spent for an indoor rain forest in the state of iowa and the list goes on and on and on the american people just do not believe there is not waste fraud abuse and duplication in the federal budget for example we have 342 economic development programs we have 130 programs serving the disabled 90 early childhood early development programs the list goes on and on how much duplication do we need and yet the democrats want to raise taxes to pay for more of this the federal government made at least 20 billion in overpayments in 2001 the department of housing and urban development spent 3 3 billion 10 percent of their budget in q001 on overpayments yet democrats want to raise our taxes to pay for more of this the advanced technology programs spends 150 million annually subsidizing private businesses 40 percent of which goes to fortune 500 companies and yet democrats want to raise our taxes to pay for more of this and there are so many reforms that we can institute in this body that could for example brings us greater health care at a cheaper cost if we would pass meaningful medical liability reform we would bring down the cost of health care 5 to 10 percent in america medicaid could save 1 5 billion a year if they would base their drug payments on actual acqiuisition costs they could save 2 to 3 billion a year if they would stop improper payments to states that use that money for purposes other than medicaid and the list goes on and on we can find the reforms but we must start this process of reconciliation which again when we look at 62 billion of savings we are trying to find in a 5year 13 9 trillion budget that is a half a cent that is one half of one penny that we are trying to find so that our children do not face massive tax increases as far as the eye can see guaranteeing to lower their standard of living this really comes down to two visions for america one helping empower people helpiig them realize their american dream about them going out starting new jobs it is really about a vision of less government and more freedom yet our friends on the other side on the aisle who will not work with us on reconciliation who will not work with us to root out this waste and this fraud and abuse who only want to continue with more spending and more spending and more spending they believe nothing good happens in america unless it comes from the federal government well a lot of good things come from the american family a lot of good things come from the free enterprise system that is what we need to strengthen in the days to come that is what this debate is all about those who want to restrain the growth of the federal budget so the family budget can expand and those who only want to grow government and impose massive tax increases on our children and grandchildren as far as the eye can see there is no doubt that when the american people will look at this ultimately they will chose less government and more freedom"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.9983847141265869, 0.9983847141265869, 0, "says you are now being fiscally responsible because you have a rainy day fund you are the only family in america that went out and borrowed money to put into a rainy day fund because you do not have any money the american people do not have any money in this government all they have is debt and you want a bill to help you to keep from spending again what you need is a 12step program on spending it is called intestinal fortitude it is called having a spine it is called having some guts to do what is necessary but the first thing you did was get rid of the discipline and payasyougo so now you are stuck but more importantly the nation is stuck and so we see this little plea on the morning that we are going to give away almost 1 trillion to the richest people in the nation you have a plea here that maybe the president will stop the bridge to nowhere how about congress stopping the bridge to nowhere how about doing what you were elected to do you dont need a line item veto this isnt about statutes this isnt about vetoes this is about what the congress is to do you walked in here fresh newly elected and you got handed 5 trillion and now you cant stop yourself you cant stop yourself you can stop yourself from giving the people an increase in the minimum wage that hasnt increased since 1997 you cant give those people 70 cents more an hour but you give it away to the richest estates and then you can plead that but for the line item veto we would somehow get to a balanced budget every dollar you are going to spend today tomorrow and every dollar you spent yesterday and the day before came out of the social security trust fund i am sure that america while you are putting away a rainy day fund on borrowed money i am sure america is delighted that you are putting away the estate tax on their social security earnings on their trust fund you are taking their trust fund that belongs to all americans called the social security trust fund and you are raiding it for the trust fund of the heirs of the richest estates in america what a wonderful example today what a wonderful example for young people to learn about our obligations to future generations this is a theater of the absurd you have run the country into the ditch financially you got a 1 trillion war going that you cant figure out how to stop you have stolen most of the money from social security trust fund every year we have a deficit we have a 8 trillion debt and you want to talk about the line item veto you know the government is spending money like a drunken sailor andronald reagan said well at least the sailor was spending his own money you are spending the publics money at a rapid illegal unconscionable immoral rate and you ought to stop but the line item veto wont do it lots of things have changed since 1997 but the value of the minimum wage isnt one of them because of congress failure to act on behalf of the lowest paid workers in america the minimum wage is still just 5 15 per hour 5 15 per hour think about that at 5 15 per hour you would have to work 11 day just to fill a tank of gas at todays gas prices at 5 15 per hour you would have to work for at least 30 minutes just to afford a single gallon of milk democrats have a simple and reasonable proposal we want to raise the minimum wage to 7 25 per hour over the next two years doing so would directly benefit 6 6 million american workers the vast majority of those workers are adults hundreds of thousands of them are parents with children under the age of 18 we have all heard the wellworn economic arguments against raising the minimum wage and we all know they simply arent true the truth is that raising the minimum wage wont hurt the economy and can even help it but forget about economics thats not what this issue is about this issue is about doing whats right and it is just wrong that in the wealthiest and most advanced country in the history of the world millions of adults work fulltime all year and yet still earn an income that leaves them deep in poverty it is just wrong for the republican leaders of this congress to refuse to allow even a vote on raising the minimum wage but what makes all of this far worse is that today once again as it has done so many times during the past several years the leaders of this house are going to push tax breaks for the wealthiest people in this country you know starting in 2009 only the largest and wealthiest 7 500 estates nationwide will pay the estate tax the republican plan to gut the tax on these 7 500 estates will add three quarters of a trillion dollars to the federal budget deficit over the next decade thats trillion with a t lee raymond the former ceo of exxon mobil stands to save as much as 160 million if this estate tax repeal goes through this is the same lee raymond who left his job with a 400 million retirement package why is the republican leadership so worred about people like lee raymond why is the republican leadership constantly looking for new ways to help the absolute richest people in the country when is the leadership of this house going to do something for the lowestpaid families in america if you are born with a silver spoon in your mouth and you stand to inherit millions or even billions of dollars that you did not work to earn then this congress wants to serve you but if you get up every day and go to work to earn a living then dont expect any help from this congress the message all of this sends could not be clearer the republicans value wealth not work if you hold up your end of the bargain and contribute to your community and our econ omy by working hard every day then you should not have to live in poverty it is well past time for this congress to treat americas working families with the respect and dignity they have earned the choice to provide hundreds of billions more in tax breaks for the ultrawealthy is shameful its even more shameful to do it while steadfastly refusing to raise the minimum wage"], [0.9972256144974381, 0.002774385502561927, 1, "i am deeply

it is a growth that hag not gotten out of hanhd mr speaker it is a growth that grows frbm 3 to 4 7 percent quarter afi 6ei quarter with an inflation rate that is 2 percent or less and unemployment rates that are in the 5 percent and less range that is where we want not too hot and not too cold a nice steady accountable growth and i would point out this that growth that we have in our economy is growing in spite of the fact that 3 5 percent perhaps of our gdp is going off the top to the litigation that goes on in this country we have to overcome that and still grow at a rate of about 3 to 3 5 percent to match a targeted growth rate that will deal with population growth and to deal with inflation and help us develop our infrastructure in this country to accommodate the future as our infrastructure depreciates that is what it is going to take to grow and what it is going to take to balance the budget should we have the will to do that would be to go into the nondefense discretionary spending recognizing that we have three large entitlements in our budget and those are the spending that just goes on year after year that is growing at a rate of about 6 2 percent a year and that is aggregate and that is social security medicare and medicaid those three entitlements are essentially unless we change some of the larameters are the right now the un touchable budget items and eventually this congress will have to look at them but those three entitlements will grow at about 6 2 percent of their aggregate the interest rate will grow perhaps even faster than that in the outyears you add all those things up and if you recognize that to make changes in that for this year is very difficult to do and also recognizing that we have defense spending that is critical to our national security and we need to take that off the table from a cut perspective and what is left is the nondefense discretionary spending that is the items of all everything else that we spend that i have not identified as being an entitlement of social security medicare medicaid defense spending that nondefense discretionary spending we will call that other to balance the budget we would need to simply cut the nondefense discretionary spending by 5 percent areal 5 percent cut and that would be 0 95 on the dollar that would be asking americans to get along with 0 95 out of every dollar that they have right now today not grow in relation to inflation and not grow with any kind of a cola now if i were looking at this from a business perspective i would advocate that we just simply balance our budget in that fashion but i am also aware that the votes on the floor of this congress will rot accommodate for that so i will be seeking to put together a budget that looks at some of the other components and gets us to the point where we can reasonably practically and in fact part of the equation here is politically balance this budget it cannot and should not be done by simply raising taxes by doing so it would stifle growth and it would get a reverse effect beyond in the opposite direction that my colleagues who just got finished speaking would say i am just going to go backwards through some of the remarks that i heard made over this past hour and address some of them i certainly cannot address them all but the argument that all of the money that was spent all this is a quote all that money is wasted meaning the money that was spent for reconstruction in iraq all wasted with no oversight no oversight mr speaker i take exception to a statement such as that i went over to iraq with three of my colleagues last august and returned here about august 20 with the very mission in mind to take a look at where the 18 5 billion that we allocated out of this congress had been spent where the practices were where the projects were how the money was being spent and what was the return on that investment and i brought a chart along with me coincidentally not knowing that would be the subject matter that was brought up here on the other side of the aisle this evening a chart that illustrates where these project dollars have gone i would point out that these red dots on this map of iraq represent 2 200 more than 2 200 completed projects in iraq and these projects will be road projects they will be sewer projects water drinking water potable water projects they will also be some bridge projects and some pipeline work for the oil pipe lines that are there you will see along on this border with iran the red dots along there many of those are border defense stations and what you will not see are the 250 planned border defense stations that are under construction or in planning around these othei borders that we have there is another 1 100 projects that are either in planning or under construction that do not show up yet on this chart i will have a chart that reflects the projects that are planned the projects that are started then this one reflects just the projects that are completed over 2 200 and i visited a number of these of course it would not be possible to visit them in their entirety but i stopped up here in this region around kirkuk and there went to the mother of all generators i forget just how many kilowatts that generator does put out but i remember what it weighed 750 000 pounds brought in on two large loads and then the other loads would be the rest of the generating plant across about 10 7 kilometers excuse me it was more than that it was a long stretch at least across the northern part of iraq with that kind of a long trail ofa convoy to deliver the generator and the turbine that drives that generator down to this location just south of kirkuk and that being one of two huge generation plants that are now in a position where they are up and running in iraq this one is fed by a natural gas pipeline some of them are using different types of fuel but up in this area around kirkuk there is so much oil that it actually seeps to the top of the ground in some places where i come from the area we call it the prairie pothole region where we have these potholes of water that are collected because of the dips that are cut out in the prairie from the last glacier well the water that collects there reminds me of the oil and certainly the oil is in smaller quantities that collects in the depressiois within the desert up there around kirkuk i and that is not the largest oil location up around kirkuk but down here in the southern part in the basra region there is far more oil and i look at the system of collection the well system the collection system the refinery system distribution system all of it is old tired dilapidated has not been reconstructed or modernized in at least 35 years and yet the oil production out of iraq is greater than it was we keep hearing no they are not producing as much oil now as they were then not true the royalties that iraq was receiving prior to the war were 5 billion a year the royaltiesthat are coming from the oil that is pumping today are 26 billion a year that does not necessarily reflect that they are pumping five times as much oil but it reflects that they are selling perhaps more oil than they did then and pumping more oil than they did the electricity that is being generated in iraq is anumber that is close to twice as much electricity at their peak days as it was on a standard day in iraq at the beginning of the liberation back in march of 2003 and as i measure project after project benefit after benefit it cannot be said that and i will quote again all that money is wasted how could all that money be wasted when we have 2 200 completed projects 3 300 projects altogether people that have potable water that never had it before people that have flush toilets that did not flush before they did not have water to flush in them looking at the infrastructure that is there in places in baghdad where they had the sanitary sewer and i would point out for the lay person listening that a sanitary sewer is not really all that sanitary that is what you run your sewage through and yet that sewer was an easy place for some people to pull a waterline through in those days before the ltberation of baghdad so their drinking water in many areas was delivered through a black piece of plastic pipe that was pulled through the sewer itself and they would pull it through and then the distribution runs out to the locations where it was being used and that is all fine as long as you keep your waterline in condition and it does not ever get a leak in it and you do not ever let the pressure go down but both of those things invariably happen and when that happens the pressure goes down in your drinking waterline and the sewage then is drawn into that drinking waterline and it then pollutes the drinking water that has happened in a number of areas in baghdad we are reconstructing that we are providing them with clean new sanitary sewer systems and sewer plants to be able to handle their systems in a modern fashion and an environmentally friendly fashion so the iraqi people that were living without services now have services i will say that the electrical service that was up to 10 11 perhaps even 12 hours a day in baghdad at the beginning of the liberation is down to less than that now perhaps even as low as 4 to 6 hours a day but the rest of iraq was getting 2 to 4 hours a day and now they are up to 10 11 12 hours of electricity a day the next wave is to increase the generation capacity and the distribution so that baghdad can get back up again to a level that they were before but overall there is more electricity being provided into iraq today than there ever was the demand is perhaps twice as great as it was because you know what happens when people get electricity they figure out a way that they can put another appliance to work and plug it into a wall and use it like air conditioners that did not exist in any significant numbers now they are there in significant numbers tapped into that electricity we also know that satellite televisions were against the law in march of 2003 and today iraq is replete with satellite dishes onrooftop after rooftop in fact i did a survey from the air by helicopter over the top of a region up in kirkuk where many homes were built in about the same style and i had done so over the rooftops of mosul in the fall of 2003 and there my survey showed that about twothirds of the homes then already had satellite tvs and now iam seeing that in some of the neighborhoods in kirkuk there actually are more satellite dishes than there are roofs so you will see sometimes two or even three satellite dishes on a single roof that look like they are singlefamily dwellings from the air everyone in iraq has access to satellite tv which means access to the outside world there is access to internet cell phones those things have grown dramatically landline telephones have grown dramatically the number of newspapers are up to over 175 newspapers in iraq television stations up and running communication is flowing free enterprise is robust in the streets of baghdad people that are running shops out there making furniture out alongside the streets set it out on the side of the street and sell it and yes a bomb goes off once in a while and it is sad and it is tragic but the people of iraq clean things up and they grieve and they go back to work because they are optimistic about the future of iraq they are more optimistic about the future of iraq than the surveys show people are in the united states of america what went wrong her6 where people that we say do not have hope have more hope than those of us folks that have the great blessing of living in the united states of america with all of this hope that we take for granted and cannot apparently appreciate so the effort that has been put forth there it is not all that money that is being wasted not by a long shot mr speaker 3 300 projects all of them worthy and worthwhile and no they were not all cheap there was money that was spent for security and there were some projects that were sabotaged that had to be reconstructed again there is a project over here on the tigris river south of kirkuk where there were nine pipelines that went across the tigris river and those pipelines were cut in the liberation operations with the unitedstates air force and we went back to patch those pipelines together did so they were sabotaged again they were put across the river on a bridge and so we undertook the effort to put them all underneath the bottom of the tigris river they are backfilling that now and it is nearly completed and those lines will be opened up and running by i believe the target date is february 28 so another big day to turn those valves on and get that oil flowing south into parts where it can be converted back to cash and be able to help the funding in the great country of iraq this emerging free arab country that has now at least brought forth the name of a prime minister and i do not think formally has elected him yet but on that day that that happens and they seek this duly elected parliament iraq becomes the most representative arab nation in the world when they sit down at the united nations and their representative speaks on behalf of the iraqi people it will truly be a voice of the iraqi people quite unlike the voice of much of the rest of the arab world where the voicethat speaks for the countries that represent those parts of the arab world in the united nations often is the voice of a tyrant that would cut the tongues out of its oin citizens if they spoke up in criticism of the regime that is there in many of those countries but this country can become the lodestar of a free arab people an inspiration to the rest of the arab world an that is a chilling concept but it also inspiration that can cause the rest of should tell us that there is no negothem to see what iraq is stepping into tiated settlement we must defend ourwhat they are earning along with the selves the israelis have had to guard coalition forces efforts and sacrifice to every theater every bus stop every be able to be that inspiration for the hospital every school every synarest of the arab world and if that day gogue and still the infiltrators come in comes and i pray it comes mr speak and detonate their bombs and blow er we may well see freedom echo their women and children to pieces across the arab world in the same fash that happens out of a deep hatred ion that it echoed across eastern eu that we dont understand in this counrope when the wall went down in ber try and i dont claim to understand it lin november 9 1989 on that glorious but i know that hatred is directed at day that symbolized the end of the us we saw it september 11 we saw it cold war a victory for the united on 18 to 20 other attacks including the states and the forces of freedom uss cole we saw it in the unitedstates emand the forces of freedom could not bassy bombings in africa we have seen be stopped almost the first attack also on the twin towbloodlessly they echoed across eastern ers in other efforts shut off by good ineurope and we saw country after coun telligence work in this country try be liberated we cannot rest our choices though are guard every theater every bus 0 2320 stop every school every hospital since that time we have noticed every church every synagogue and pull that those who knew freeddm the least back into the shores of the united hungered for it the most the people on states and somehow think that we can the east side of the wall stepped up to protect every center in this country help all of our efforts our coalition and we wont be able to and we will see forces in iraq in greater numbers than the attacks come and we will see our the people on the west side of the wall women and children and our men blown the people on the west side of the into pieces wall had the privilege of living with or we can take this battle to them freedom since the end of world war 11 we can fight this war where they are the people on the east side of the wall but going out just to kill the enemy remember the days they werent free mr speaker isnt enough it is not a they remember the day of november 9 solution it is something that has to be 1989 when they had that opportunity done in certain areas of the world and to grasp their own freedom and within under those circumstances where there a couple of years that freedom did echo are training camps and active leaders across eastern europe and it needs to that are plotting and planning to atecho across the arab world tack and kill americans that must be so i submit that there done is a vision and mission in this overall but to go out and think that we war on terror and we need to do a far could kill all of our enemies is the better job of articulating why we are in equivalent of realizing that we had a this war i would point out that the lot of flies on our porch and in our loss of americans on september 11 was kitchen and then go out to the barn right at 3 000 americans that is more with the fly swatter and think we are americans lost there than was lost de going to take care of all those flies in cember 7 1941 in that day that would the barn with the fly swatter no you live in infamy can swat flies in the barn all day every we cannot forget september 11 we day and you will never accomplish the cannot forget that we were attacked task you have got to change the habiwithout cause we didnt provoke any tat that breeds that many flies you one who attacked us they attacked us have to clean the barn because they hate our way of life they and you need to leave an environment attacked the very center of western in there that doesnt breed those flies civilization and then they will leave you alone on and no amount of negotiation un the porch and in your kitchen as well derstanding no amount of sitting so i submit that the plan of the around and talking is ever going to re united states and the mission that has solve this disagreement these people been laid out by our commanderinwant us dead they have demonstrated chief president bush is to create a new that and we saw the celebrations in habitat to promote a new habitat in the streets in other parts of the world the region this is a habitat called as the twin towers fell that should freedom we happen to know that tell us that they will give us no quar where there is freedom there isnt a ter habitat that breeds terrorists we have if anyone doubts that take a look at never gone to war against another free israel take a look and see the cir people it has never happened in the cumstanoes there when the israelis history of this country and i dont thought they could trade land for think it has actually happened in the peace and yet they are still attacked history of the world hamas won the election there that so to the extent that freedom can be means the terrorists the people who promoted and we give people that opare sworn to annihilate the land of portunity to reach out and grasp and israel are running the government of earn their own freedom is also the exthe region that may or may not be a tent to which we can be safer as a peonation called palestine ple western civilization can be safer and the people in that part of the world can learn some tolerance for christianity for judaism for capitalism for free enterprise for this whole idea of western civilization that they seem to take such exception to there are good people in that part of the world and those good people need to be empowered and we need to be supportive bf them the allegations that were made here on the other side of the aisle about corruption in iraq with millions of unitedstates dollars we dont know that and i wont tell you that you can go into an environment with a 18 5 billion mission and spend every

done because who would go into that environment and do that work but that work was necessary and to the extent that anyone hag defrauded this government yes we need to search that out we need to have oversight but democrats in this congress are not absolved from that responsibility i did not hear a single solution come out here on the other side of the aisle not one all i saw was complaints lamentations objections because all things that go wrong are all republican responsibility according to the other side of the aisle and of course if they were just in power then everything would be all fine but we dont know what they would do because they havent proposed a solution not a single specific solution they are absolutely without an agenda but they have enough energy they have enough air velocity in their lungs to every night come down here and beat up on the people that are out here trying to move america ahead one statement was said that i will agree with made by the gentleman from florida he said i am so glad that i am not a member of the majority well to the gentleman from florida i want to say i am so glad you are not a member of the majority as well and so are the majority of the american people who have seen to it that there is majority in charge in this congress we do have our work to do i wont shirk that responsibility i step up to it gladly but we need to have our eyes wide open we need to promote a responsible budget and i will be promoting a balanced budget and a path we can get to a balanced budget in a way that we can get the votes in this congress to get it done if we do that we can ensure financial security for our children and our grandchildren but that financial security that can come with fiscal responsibility here in this congress and a

continued to bravely wage the war on terror in iraq and afghanistan the house of representatives passed a defense appropriations bill containing a nongermane provision language that would open up the arctic national wildlife refuge to exploration the agreement to include anwr in the defense appropriation turned what was essentially a bipartisan bill into a fight on the floor of both legislative bodies placing at risk the timely funding of our troops defense appropriations bills are historically the most protected type of legislation considered by the united states congress the defense bill is usually the first piece of appropriations legislation passed by the house and senate and its language is kept clean from unnecessary and nongermane addons and amendments that is why the addition of anwr was so surprising to so many members prior to the vote earlier this week i wrote a letter to the rules committee chairman expressing in the strongest terms possible my opposition and disappointment at the decision to place anwr in the bill before the house mr speaker i was not alone in my concern prior to senate debate on the houseapproved defense bill a group of highranking officers including general anthony zinni united states marine corps sent a letter stating their concern over anwrs inclusion in the legislation they wrote and i quote with 160 000 troops fighting in iraq another 18 000 in afghanistan and tens of thousands more around the world defending this country congress must finish its work and provide them the resources they need to do their job we believe that any effort to attach controversial legislative language authorizing drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge to the defense appropriations conferenee report will jeopardize congresss ability to provide our troops and their families the resources they need in a timely fashion they continued saying that the passion and energy of the debate about drilling in anwr is well known and a testament to vibrant debate in our democracy but it is not helpful to attach such a controversial nondefense legislative issue to a defense appropriations bill it only invites delay for our troops as congress debates an important but controversial nondefense issue on a vital bill providing critical funding for our nations security as i speak our brave men and women in the armed forces are serving in every corner of the globe the work our servicemen and women do each day will create a safer world a world where liberty and democracy will take root in regions of the world untouched by freedom and choice our military deserves our support and the best equipment training armament and reward our government can offer them that is why i am here today to lend my strong support to the legislation the senate made the right choice yesterday to strip this bill of unnecessary ornaments anwr does not belong in the defense bill and i am proud to support the senate version without it the defense appropriation bill being considered by the house today is a good bill it will enable our troops to stand down as iraqi security forces stand up this legislation provides 403 5 billion for our troops during this transition equipping them with 8 billion to replace damaged equipment 1 2 billion for force protection and 500 million to train new security forces in iraq and in afghanistan also this legislation provides an essential 3 1 percent military pay increase for our soldiers effective january 1 2006 this legislation honors our military and is deserving of all of our support as good as this legislation is congress must remain vigilant in our responsibility to support our troops the associated press recently ran an article questioning the amount of money needed to address emergency combat operations in iraq and afghanistan the article reported that the military informally indicated to the house armed services committee that they would need an additional 80 to 100 billion to fund operations in iraq and afghanistan this request is made in addition to the 50 billion appropriated through the defense bill this request is still being drafted by the department of defense and will most likely come to the floor as an additional spending package after we return next year i call on my colleagues to support this additional funding when it arrives in the house we cannot afford to leave our military unprotected and underfunded especially at this important time in our nations history next week i will travel to iraq to see the progress the iraqi security forces are making to take the fight to the insurgents and to take their nations future into their own hands i will also visit our troops to give them our thanks from a grateful nation for the work that they are doing to fight the terrorists to secure the nation and pave the way for a new and vibraftt democracy in iraq our troops must have a clear understanding that our support for them is unwavering the american people
