the leadership that she has taken on this issue especially urging and demanding an accurate count on the 2000 census this is not about political wedges this is about improving the quality of life that is what this issue is about it is not about political wedges it is about improving the quality of life this issue affects all americans this issue affects every man in america this issue affects every woman in america this issue affects every child in america during the census of 1990 nearly 18 000 residents of my congressional district were not couited i state 18 000 residents of my congressional district were not counted the undercount resulted in a loss of federal dollars and funds that would have benefited nearly 50 million in revenue that would have gone over the past 10 years because we failed to do an accurate count we lost 50 million over the last 10 years 50 million could have gone a long ways in providing much needed resources to my congressional district 50 million would have brought the inland empire roads and infrastructure 50 million could have brought the inland empire housing programs and projects and educational services law enforcement for cities parks and recreation senior citizen services youth centers educational services overall the state of california has lost out on more than 2 2 billion federal dollars and i state overall the state of california has lost out on more than 2 2 billion federal dollars due to the 1990 census undercount last week the lieutenant governor of california cruz bustamante warned that our state could lose 5 billion and i state 5 billion in federal funding if the undercount this year is similar to the 1990 undercount that is why i commend our colleague from new york for urging for an accurate count and demanding an accurate count not only what it means to my state but what it means to many other states across the nation as lieutenant governor cruz bustamante said we will have less than we deserve and i state we will have less than what we deserve this is not just a matter of loss of federal dollars people are being overlooked millions of americans are being overlooked it is a shame that california will not get its fair share of dollars if we do not do an accurate count that is why it is important that we do an accurate count not only for california but for others ten years ago millions of americans were not included in the census count a count that would have placed them equally alongside each and every other american in 1990 2 7 percent of people of california were not counted 2 7 percent 2 7 percent that means one out of every 37 people in california were not counted yet our population continues to grow we have 34 million people or more in the state of california it would be a shame if california did not have an accurate count and it did not receive its fair share of dollars back into our state the census undercount does not affect all americans in the same way again during the 1990 census 7 6 percent of the black population was overlooked in that counting i state 7 6 percent that means one out of every 13 black residents of california were not being counted also during the 1990 census 4 9 percent of hispanic residents of california were not counted that is 4 9 percent that means 4 9 roughly one out of every 20 latinos in california were not being counted imagine what it is going to be like this year if we do not do an accurate count it is a shame if we do not do that it is a shame that the leadership on the other side does not want to do an accurate count i am appalled that governor bush does not want to do an accurate count i think it is important that we all do it in the state of california that we do it in every state i am truly appalled 4 9 percent equals nearly 400 000 latinos in california not counted the last 10 years 400 000 is more than the population of fresno california 400 000 is more than the population of sacramento it is more than the population of oakland 400 000 people not being counted is 400 000 too many however it is not just a matter of blacks and latinos not being counted millions of children also were overlooked over the last 10 years nationwide more than 2 million children were not counted 10 years ago in california alone 342 000 children were not counted in the 1990 census that is 342 000 children imagine the services that could have gone back to our schools to our communities to our state this represents 4 2 percent of the children of california not being counted in 1990 this represents nearly one of every 24 children in california not being counted i join my colleagues here on the floor this evening in urging all americans to stand up and be counted this year i join with those who have been undercounted in the past in stressing the importance of being counted during the year 2000 census all americans should be counted this year if we do not do an accurate count the federal dollars do not come in and the taxpayers will have to pay for the services that we want and deserve i urge all of us to stand up and be counted whether we are white or whether we are american indians african americans hispanic asian americans we should all stand up together and be counted we are one nation a great nation and we are one people together unified and inclusive and i state inclusive and that is important that we are all included in this process and that every one of us is counted filling out the forms and mailing them back is important as the chair indicated that april 1 everyone has received it we urge everyone to return those back and to participate in the process it is the responsibility of a partnership between all of us it is not just the legislatures responsibility it is a partnership for the total community for busineses for schools for churches for our communities to come together and do what is necessary for our states if we come together collectively we will put our political wedges aside and we will do what is good for america we will do what is good for our country we will do what is good for our state i thank my colleague for providing me the opportunity to speak on this important issue and i yield the balance of my time back to the gentlewoman from new york who has done an outstanding job who is a true fighter and a true leader leading us in this important issue that is affecting all americans"], [0.0012720227241516113, 0.9987279772758484, 1, "i appreciate and commend the gentleman from illinois my colleague and alpha brother for scheduling this special order this afternoon i am delighted that we have an opportunity through this special order to talk about the proud history of alpha phi alpha and its ongoing nationwide efforts to meet some of the critical needs of the africanamerican community we have already heard men of alpha phi alpha have had a strong positive impact on our society in every profession and in every field of endeavor i am fortunate to serve with many of our alpha colleagues the gentleman from the 15th congressional district of new york the gentleman from the 32nd congressional district of california the gentleman from the 7th congressional district of alabama the gentleman from the 2nd congressional district of pennsylvania the gentleman from the 6th congressional district of new york we follow the proud footsteps of adam clayton powell who was elected in congress in the late 1940s and many other alpha brothers who have served in congress and prepared the pathway for numerous other alpha brothers who serve in public office at the local state and federal levels alphas can also claim three of the big four civil rights movements so when one considers the members of this distinguished fraternity it should come at no surprise that alpha brothers would be in the leadership of addressing some of our most serious social problems whitney young martin luther king floyd mckessick were also in the forefront as alpha brothers in the civil rights movement they focused on the right to vote as has already been indicated one of the early slogans of the fraternity was a voteless people is a hopeless people because of this focus the martin luther king memorial is so appropriate and we are proud to have an alpha member so honored we also must not forget the late thurgoqd marshall who argued the supreme court case brown v board of education which desegregated public schools and led to the fall of jim crow laws everywhere that is important to note because education has been such a critical issue in the alpha history go to high school go to college was andther early slogan an early program in alpha phi alpha project alpha is another one of those important projects young africanamerican males today face many challenges truancy illiteracy drugs violence and teen fatherhood and those needs need to be addressed that is why the week of october 7 through october 14 will be project alpha week focusing on project alpha for some 20 years now alpha phi alpha fraternity has worked with the march of dimes in an effort to respond to the challenges facing young black males project alpha is a result of this project and its mission has been to create a national program to prepare young men for the roles that they will be expected to assume in their adulthood in communities throughout this country project alpha has created safe havens for young men to learn about and explore ways to develop protective factors to minimize the impact of the social hazards which are present today project alpha provides education on sexuality fatherhood and the role of men in responsible relationships it motivates young men to make smart decisions about their future and to take an active role in achieving their desired goals it is a daunting task that project alpha has taken on young black men today face many obstacles on their road to adulthood africanamerican males continue to lag behind their female counterparts in most measures of academic progress it is particularly unfortunate to note that 25 percent of all black men can expect to have some contact with the criminal justice system we know already that nationally 3 out of every 10 young black males are in jail prison on probation or otherwise involved in the criminal justice system while unemployment levels for african americans are at an alltime low the rate continues to be unacceptable in many urban communities and this presents yet another risk factor for young african american males by focusing on those 12 to 15 project alpha lays the groundwork early for developing the protective factors that reduces the likelihood of teen fatherhood and the associated risks that result from teen pregnancy by providing positive role models from the community project alpha teaches the participants about the social economic and personal consequences of early fatherhood and by reducing the rate of teen pregnancy we are improving thq likelihood that these young men will stay in school stay away from drug use and other negative behaviors that is why we congratulate the alpha phi alpha in designating october 7 through 14 as project alpha week i want to thank the gentleman from illinois my brother alpha member for holding this special order this afternoon i applaud the members of alpha phi alpha and the march of dimes for their continued commitment to improving the lives of young african american males in the african american community and again congratulate the gentleman on holding this special order"],

that we have in a year when we expect to be reauthorizing the elementary and secondary education assistance act we have been denied that opportunity but pieces of the elementary and secondary education assistance act have been put forward the edflex act is a piece of it and now this piece on teacher empowerment act h r 1995 which was considered today the consideration of this bill today which was kind of rushed to the floor and it was hoped that they would get enough votes to send a message to the white house that it cannot be successfully vetoed but of course they failed in that effort the president has promised to veto this bill because at the heart of the bill is an attempt to derail the presidents initiative on more teachers for the classroom especially in grades 1 through 3 where there is a need for smaller class sizes we did get a bill approved an appropriation approved last year which would permit the beginning of the process of hiring more teachers for the classroom virtually 100 000 teachers would be hired under this legislation and 30 000 the process has started as of this month so in order to derail that for some reason the republican majority is against smaller class sizes and they want to take away that priority take away the targeting and they came up with this teacher empowerment act which is not a bad idea the thrust of the bill is to provide a special initiative for the training and professional development of teachers to improve the quality of teachers by itself that is a lofty goal and who could not subscribe to having better prepared teachers in our classroom we want quality teachers but for some reason to get quality teachers the republican majority chose to sacrifice the more teachers for the classroom the act that is designed to lower the class sizes in the first three grades has to be sacrificed put on the chopping block in order to take care of meeting teachers professional development needs and training needs i think that for the republican majority it was more important to derail the initiative to have smaller class sizes than it is really to train teachers the training of the teachers and the opportunities for professional development is secondary for them they are pursuing an agenda and this bill was a part of that agenda to reach a point where all of the influence and direction from the federal government is wiped from the education sphere they want to abolish the education role of the federal government and this of course takes them one step closer if they can take the presidents initiative on class sizes and get rid of that it is one more step toward reducing the federal governments role in education so that bill was on the floor today the republican majority had the greatest number of votes because they are the majority they passed the bill but the number of defections by democrats was not as great as they expected and the presidents threat to veto the bill certainly can hold the bill can be vetoed until something more reasonable is done about the class size initiative of the president there were a lot of good things in the teacher empowerment act by the way it is called teacher empowerment act but all the teacher organizations the n~tional education association the american federation of teachers the grade schools group all of the various education groups opposed it because they saw it as a sabotage operation designed to wipe out the reduction of the classroom size initiative now that bill was on the floor today tomorrow the major bill on the floor will be the tax cut bill and i want to talk about the importance of dealing with the education initiative the education investments should come before big spending tax cuts education investments should dome before big spending tax cuts and it is very important to note that during the whole discussion of the socalled teacher empowerment act today the one thing that the republican majority refused to allow any discussion of was additional funding no new money is involved in their initiative they want to take the money that has already been appropriated for the class size reduction and the money that already exists in various other teacher training and professional development programs and use that in a different way mainly throw it out there to the states let the governors decide how they want to spend that money on education that is the thrust of what the republicans want to do it takes us one step closer to their longterm objective and that is to block grant all funds available for education to the states by block grant i mean take away the federal guidelines take away the federal priorities take away the longterm federal commitment to the poorest districts and the poorest schools out there the federal thrust in education since 1965 since the first elementary and secondary education assistance act in the era of lyndon johnson has been to focus on those areas of greatest need to target the federal money to help with the problem that the states were not able to deal with and chose not to deal with and that is provide a decent education for the poorest students in the poorest schools in the poorest districts so that initiative by the federal government is targeted by the republicans they want to take it away their longterm goal is to wipe out the federal government involvement in education in 1995 my colleagues will recall the newt gingrich program went head on in a direct attack on the department of education they called for the abolishment of the department of education they pursued that for a while it turned out that the american people did not think that was a good idea the voters did not think it was a good idea they retreated and now we have no more talk about abolishing the department of education what we have is instead of the direct assault we have a great deal of warfare going on where they slfip away at the powers they attack at small beachheads that they establish and they find every way to cut into the power of the department of education and into the federal role in education the federal role in education of course is already limited they make it appear that the federal government is responsible for all that is wrong in education it is a very limited role already less than 8 percent of the education funding in this country that is including higher education funding less than 8 percent of that is provided for by the federal government at this point but that is what we had on the floor today another assault on that small role that lessthan8percent role fiscally if one got 8 percent of the funds involved across the country then i think that the influence of the federal government is probably no more also than about 8 percent control is vested in states and local education agencies for education already but that is targeted first they wanted to get rid of it all together now they want to block grant it and turn it over to the governments that is what was on the floor today no item which talked about additional funding was received in an amicable spirit by the republican majority in fact the only amendment that called for fresh funds new money new initiative with new money was the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from hawaii the gentlewoman wanted to offer grants some help for sabbaticals for teachers if one is talking about training then in order to hold certain people into the career path in order to make certain that they have an opportunity for growth somewhere they ought to encourage and help to finance the sabbaticals which already are offered in many local education systems it is an area that was not new but the gentlewoman from hawaii wanted to give more help and called for more money for that that of course was voted down by a large margin and condemned by the chairman and the republican majority no new money is the credo of the leadership of the committee on education and the workforce the republican majority insists that we never discuss authorizing new funding but tomorrow we will be discussing on the floor an expenditure of 864 billion over a 10year period for tax cuts we cannot talk about money when we are talking about education no new money the government is broke we cannot make investments in education but we can have big spending tax cuts that is obvious it is a huge monstrous piece of big spending 864 billion and there is no room anywhere for an investment in education i think my colleagues have heard the previous speaker tonight and they heard the previous set of speakers from the democratic side talk about this tax cut while i am not prepared and do not intend to go into it with great deal i associate myself with most of the remarks made by the gentleman from maryland and his associates their plea was that we not go forward with this monstrous 864 billion tax cut that we look at other kinds of things that ought to be considered at the same time we cannot separate in my opinion the discussion of the tax cut however from the discussion of education they did not do it neither the democrats nor the republicans that talked tonight really placed education on the table for discussion within the parameters of the conventional wisdom here in washington and that sometimes includes the white house when we talk about large amounts of money they do not want to talk about education it is a direct insult to the voters we have poll after poll which shows that education ranks as one of the number one priorities over the last 5 years and recently moved to the very top before social security before defense spending before all of the other priorities which are usually considered education ranked as number one why are the voters being ignored i do not know they can ask their congressman why is it that when my colleagues discuss education they insist that they cannot discuss new money additional resources why is it that theamerican public repeatedly says we would like to see more federal assistance for education but they are only answered with rhetoric about new kinds of changes in the reform programs but none of those new changes have any resources behind them with the acknowledgment of the existence of a huge budget surplus and i do not want to get into an argument about how much the surplus is or what it is going to be over the next 10 years i just know that it is foolish for us laymen who are not involved directly in the calculation process to sit still and watch our leaders talk about huge sums of money that they are going to negotiate on and we question whether it really exists i have some friends who went to a meeting today to hear someone lecture about the fact that there really is no budget surplus and we should stop discussing it i heard that in 1996 when we were on the eve of an election and we had gone through 2 years of the republican majority insisting not only that there was no money for an increase in funding for education but that education should be cut and we had proposals in 1995 that education be cut by almost 4 billion but in 1996 something miraculous happened both parties agreed in the negotiations at the white house that there was additional money available somewhere and instead of cutting education by 4 billion because we were approaching an election where the polls showed that the public wanted more federal assistance for education and the party that stood in the way might suffer and might lose seats suddenly there was agreement the republican majority agreed to an increase in education funding of 4 billion instead of a 4 billion cut we got a 4 billion increase they found the money somewhere now i remember the argument at the time was that we would get the money from sales of the spectrum the spectrum auctioning the auctioning of the spectrum was going to create that money it was not in hand but since both parties of the negotiation agreed it suddenly became a reality the 4 billion that was appropriated it has been spent since 1996 they have been spending the money so i assume that whatever assumptions they made they lived up to those assumptions one way or the other i have not checked to see if we have auctioned off enough of the spectrum to add up to 4 billion but when it came time to make the decision the reality was what the two parties agreed upon if both the white house and the republican majority leaders are saying now that we have a huge surplus that could accommodate over the next 10 years an 864 billion republican tax cut and the president has said well he will entertain some kind of tax cut not that much i assume the surplus is real and the tax cut possibilities are real and they are going to go forward it would be ridiculous for us to sit out the process and not get involved education ought to be put on the table so that it becomes a part of the discussion the doors of opportunity are open for education to be discussed in terms of new resources and new appropriations if the blind men who arein charge here insist that they do not see that as a possibility some of us who are not in charge must sound the alarm we must tell the american people do not sit stilland accept a big spending tax cut while there isno new investment ineducation i hope that my party will rally behind me soon and that they will see the folly of allowing a huge amount of surplus over the next 10 years to get committed to something and it is going to happen there are going to be some commitments of that surplus over the next 10 years we sit still and we let education be left out at this point the forecast for edu cation being included is quite dismal we have a bill which has been set forth by the administration for the reauthor ization of the elementary and secondary education assistance act in their reauthorization proposals they do not propose any great increases in the funding for the ongoing programs in fact there is sort of an understanding that we are going to live within certain budget guidelines there are ceilings that have been set the budget caps as they call them will not be taken off that may all be true in conventional wisdom but if the surplus exists it is folly to assume that they will not in the final analysis be negotiations of some part of the surplus being committed to programs certainly it would be folly to sit still and not commit any part of the surplus to programs and let it all be used for big spending tax cuts the forecast for education right now may be dismal but if we put on our thinking caps if we sound the alarm for the general public the people who in poll after poll show that they think education is important if we let common sense enter into this matter then we can go forward beyond the republican plot to have edflex and teacher empowerment and other kinds of block granting drain off the funds and we would not make any progress in terms of new resources for education there have been some dramatic changes now in the fiscal environment those people who said there was no money available 2 months ago cannot insist that there is no money available now in light of the facts that have been revealed even the budget agencies the congressional budget office they all admit there is a surplus there is an argument about how much of the surplus is from social security funds and ought to be reserved only for social security the lock box theory there is an argument that there are certain amounts of money available and will be available beyond the social security surplus and that that should be budgeted either way either set of assumptions that are accepted there is an acceptance of the fact there is going to be additional money available why not put education on the table why must we accept what the republican majority has offered us on the committee on education and the workforce and on the floor today what they offered us today was a perverted robin hood operation they were going to take only existing funds and scramble them and use them for other purposes instead of having any new funding when they do that what they are doing is taking money away from the traditionally targeted programs which are designed to help the poorest students in our poorest schools and redirect that money away from the poorest schools stealing pilfering from the poor to take care of other sectors and making that the hallmark of their education reform program going to the public and saying this is our answer to their request or their demand for more federal assistance we give them the same money in new forms and we hope that they will be fooled by it but i hope that common sense will not allow us to be fooled that we will insist that education appropriations be put on the table alongside any tax cut spending alongside any spending for shoring up social security alongside spending for health care probably there is going to be a package which contains all of those elements now on may 26 i introduced a bill which deals with one aspect of education which i think is critical in the light of the large amounts of money that were being made available in the surplus now is the timeto discuss it not all the problems of education will be solved by new construction and modernization of our schools although that was on the agenda today we did discuss the need for more technology in our schools and the need for teachers to be trained to utilize technology and how important that was it the modernization process requires that we have money to repair the schools and take care of the old wiring and make certain that they can be wired in some cases some schools cannot be rewired they are going to have to build new schools so construction and modernization ought to be a part of this agenda it was totally ruled out before because of the budget caps and if we take the ongoing budget as it is common sense and conventional wisdom says there is just no money but if we accept the fact that there is going to be a surplus and we talk about large amounts of money like 864 billion for a tax cut then we can also talk about taking this opportunity to plan to spend over the next 10 years or 5 or 10 years money that is necessary to provide adequate schools safe schools schools where there are no health hazards as well as schools that can be modernized to the point where they can make use of modern technology schools can take advantage of the fact that we have an erate which provides a reduced rate for people who make use of technology on an ongoing basis the online services the telephone services 90 percent of that in the poorest of schools would be paid through this erate fund provided by the federal communications commission a lot of things are happening that we need to catch up with by providing more funds for construction and for modernization now on may 26 i called on my colleagues to join me in the cosponsorship of h r 1820 which is an amendment to the elementary and secondary assistance act and this amendment would be germane certainly because there is already a provision title 12 under the elementary and secondary assistance act which calls for money for repairs and construction so we can add if we ever get around to reauthorizing the elementary and secondary assistance act we can certainly add that to the package or if we do not get around to reauthorizing the entire act it is in the law it is the law right now we can amend it to provide for this injection of necessary funding for school construction i am just going to read from my own letter to my colleagues and i have a big heading on top which says that in the year 2000 we launch the march towards a new cybercivilization we are spending 218 billion on highways and roads in 6 years let us invest half this amount 110 billion in 5 years to build repair and modernize schools let me repeat that in the year 2000 we launch the march toward a new cybercivilization a cybercivilization meaning the digital world is taking over the computers are taking over they are everywhere infused in our life and they are probably going to have a greater influence and a greater presence in our lives as we move on recently there was a lot of discussion of the fact that one individual now his net worth is 100 billion this tops all the millionaires and billionaires throughout american history the name of that individual is bill gates now bill gates is worth they say at least 100 billion and his company is worth far more now bill gates does not own any gold mines he does not own any oil wells he does not own any uranium mines all the kinds of things that used to make pe6ple rich are not associated at all with bill gates what does bill gates have that allows him to accumulate 100 billion as an individual and a company worth far more than that microsoft well bill gates is where he is and has the kind of gigantic assets that he has through the application of brainpower it is all about the brains that were used to develop the software in harmony with the computers and then to capitalize on the internet he has been accused of some unscrupulous actions and so forth but that is irrelevant in terms of the basic thrust of what happened here what happened here is that brainpower marshaled repeatedly directed concentrated on certain objectives produced results and the same thing is happening over and over again in numerous hightech companies we are ahead of the rest of the world because we did not have any central committees making rules which said that we can only focus our brainpower on natural resources we are only going to concentrate on mining and oil wells and so forth people who had the knowhow to launch the cyberrevolution went ahead and launched it very young people who are in charge the guys who used to be called nerds or probably similar people are still called nerds in high school and college the nerds triumphed with brainpower it is all about very educated people concentrating their resources and being able to generate wealth so there is a direct association between brainpower and wealth we are definitely moving into a cybercivilization and it is ridiculous for us not to recognize that and to shape our public policy in a way which accommodates the fact that we are moving into a cybercivilization there are some nations like india who recognize this and public policy has produced in india large amounts of people personnel who are in the computer programming arena who are in various stages as computer programmers and document technologists out of proportion to other similarly situated nations india is producing people in the area of information technology with information technology expertise but let me just get back to the appeal to my colleagues that i sent out on may 26 in the year 2000 we launch the march toward a new cybercivilization we are spending 218 billion on highways and roads in 6 years let us invest half this amount 110 billion in 5 years to build repair and modernize schools please join me as a cosponsor for h r 1820 an amendment to the elementary and secondary assistance act which mandates a worthy federal investment in education for the children of america public opinion polls consistently show that our voters consider federal aid to education as the nations number one priority we must now move beyondpaltry pilot projects in our response to this longterm public outcry h r 1820 commits the federal government to make the contribution most suitable to its role through direct appropriations we must make capital investments in school infrastructures offer leadership in the building of schools and then leave the details of the daytoday operations to local and state authorities i have no problem with local and state authorities bding in charge of the implementation but the resources need to come from the federal government because most states and local governmerrts cannot commit the kind of resources necessary to modernize our school systems the way they should be h r 1820 proposes to help all schools by authorizing on the basis of schoolaged children a per capita distribution of the allocations for the purposes of modernization security by the way should be added repair technology and renovations as well as new school construction h r 1820 deserves national priority consideration for the following reasons one the best protection for social security is an educated workforce able to qualify for hightech jobs and steadily pay dollars into the social security trust fund two the effective performance of our military in action utilizing hightech weaponry requires an educated pool of recruits three the unitedstates economy will continue to be the pace setter for the globe only if we maintain a steady flow of qualified brainpower and updated knowhow at all performance levels theoretical scientific technical and mechanical invest in education and all other national goals become reachable invest in education and all other national goals become reachable invest in education and we have a great possibility a greater possibility i do not think social security is about to go bankrupt there are a lot of scare tactics applied to discussions of where social security funds are now and where they will be 50 years from now but one way to assure that social security funding will be there is to have a workforce out there paying into the social security fund whatever else we do and i do not rule out having general appropriations for social security but whatever else we do we should keep the payment of funds into the social security treasury from working people people who are working and if we do not have people who can qualify for the jobs that are going to be available 20 30 40 years from now if we do not have people that have the knowhow to do the hightech jobs the likelihood is that we are going to contract out a lot of our work to other countries that do have the population and the workforce with the knowhow and they are going to pay money into their social security fund and we will have our social security fund deprived of the payment by workers into the fund that is the first source so the best protection for social security is an educated workforce we ought to have a discussion of education on the table when we consider what to do with the huge surplus that is anticipated over the next 10 years instead of being a projected 864 billion in tax expenditures we should say some portion of that money should go for education in this particular piece of legislation the bill i have introduced i only want 110 billion out of the total that is projected even if we have to take the 110 billion away from the tax expenditures that is 110 billion from 864 billion the parameters for the discussion have been set by the majority party they have said we can talk big money we can talk in billions we can talk 864 billion so let us use that as a reference point and say why spend on tax cuts the full 864 billion let us negotiate at least 110 billion over a 5year period to build schools and to modernize schools invest in education there may be additional money we will want to invest in whole school reform which despite the fact that the authorizing committee on education and the workforce did not come up with the program for whole school reform we get high praise for some of the whole school reform efforts that are going forward there are many other places where we may need some investment in education but a large capital expenditure is needed for school construction and modernization and a capital expenditure of this kind is only a onetime expenditure it is not something we would saddle the budget with forever it would not be ongoing we would take care of the problem we would invest in building schools and then we will have a result from that investment a return on that investment later on i think any businessman if he had a surplus and there was clearly identified needs in the area of capital investments would make those investments in order to be able to realize that return in the future the general accounting office told us in 1995 that we needed 112 billion at that time that was 4 years ago we needed 112 billion just to keep the infrastructure at a level which would accommodate the amount of schoolchildren attending school at that time we now have many more children attending school i think we have close to 53 million children out there in schools and what i have just projected an expenditure of 110 billion over a 5year period would be only an expenditure of 416 per year per schoolaged child an expenditure of 416 per child per year over a 5year period so we are talking about a relatively small amount of money to invest in education and guaranty the workforce that we need for tomorrow and that is an appeal i made to my colleagues on may 26 to cosponsor and i recently developed another appeal in light of the changed circumstances that we now know that there definitely is additional money available i projected it before and i said we should get ready for it and we should put on the table a reasonable package which includes school construction i am all for the presidents call for an expenditure of a part of the surplus on medicare i am all for his call of an expenditure of the bulk of the surplus on shoring up social security i am not against that but i think it is a great mistake a great blunder by both democrats and republicans not to put education on the table and make it part of the package but circumstances recently have changed so favorably until i do not see how we can ignore the great window of opportunity that is now open so i prepared another letter which i have not sent out yet i will send it out tomorrow i start with the following heading democrats must respond to the overwhelming change in the fiscal surplus negotiating environment i repeat democrats must respond to the overwhelming change in the fiscal surplus negotiating environment republicans have now ratcheted up their demands for a megabilliondollar tax cut the democratic president has now indicated that he will entertain a tax cut at some level so it is definitely on the table missing from the end game negotiating table is a democratic scenario for school construction and moderniza tion at this moment that is not on the table none of the speakers tonight have talked about education being part of the mix i heard discussions of defense additional expenditures for defense that ought to come out of the surplus and a few other items but no one talked about education although education if you want to consider the national security of the country as being important the first item you ought to look at is the quality of our education including such practical and immediate problems as the workforce required by the military the military requires recruits that are highly educated people who must have had enough prerequisite education in order to be able to go into the military and learn how to deal with a hightech military hightech equipment procedures et cetera youneed welltrained people in the military as much as you need them in the area of information technology so the first step toward shoring up our military should not be new expenditures for equipment like aircraft carriers and b2 bombers and smart bombs but to make certain that the people who guide those smart bombs and who prepare the maps and the intelligence before you drop the bombs do not make a mistake of the kind we made with the chinese embassy in yugoslavia or you have people who are smart enough with their hightech equipment not to be fooled the way we were fooled with the yugoslav dummy equipment wooden weapons and all kinds of things that made us believe that we were bombing their military into ineffectiveness when actually we were hitting very little of their military equipment i do not know why we fell for that trick because we pulled that on hitler when we were projecting openly exposing equipment in the south of france to make it appear that we were going to launch an invasion of the mainland of europe from the south toward the south of france instead of at normandy and the germans fell for that and we are proud of the fact that we pulled that off why we would let yugoslavia pull the same kind of trick on us with respect to equipment that we thought we were bombing i do not know but it points up the need to have better training and a better educated military set of military personnel from the bottom to the top let me continue as i said before missing from the end game negotiating table is a democratic scenario for school construction and modernization h r 1820 an amendment to the elementary and secondary education assistance act authorizes a direct appropriation which is only onehalf the amount authorized and appropriated for transportation not 218 billion but 110 billion or 416 per child per year for 5 years all of the democratic proposals for school reform and education are worthy but nothing proposed is equal to the number one priority ranking that the voters have assigned to education a construction and modernization initiative of this kind fills the vacuum this kind of initiative is a response worthy of what the voters have demanded in poll after poll you have said education should get more assistance from the federal government you do not want to hear an answer that we are going to have a teacher empowerment act which takes old funds away from poor schools and redirects thern spreading them out over the whole country to train teachers better but no new funds are going to be allocated you do not want to hear that kind of response to an overwhelming demand that the federal government play a greater role in providing assistance to education here is a response worthy of it lay these responses alongside of the 218 billion that we approved for highway and transportation last year 218 billion over a 6year period that is about 50 some billion dollars a year for the next 6 years we approved that the authorization committee came forward with it it was not the appropriations committee the appropriations committee was driven by the energy of the authorizing committee today we had the authorizing committee education and the workforce refusing to even ask for additional funding and take to the appropriations committee the priorities that have been set by the american people so we are asking for a worthy response 110 billion over 5 years lay that aside the highway and transportation bill of 218 billion over 6 years and then lay that aside of the new request from the republican majority for 864 billion over 10 years if you get dizzy considering billions of dollars i can understand but at least let us look at the comparisons and understand the framework in which we are operating i have had people say to me when you talk about 22 billion a year for school construction over a 5year period which all adds up to 110 billion over 5 years that is mindboggling it may be mindboggling but we live in a mindboggling era and we are a country of more than 250 million people there are more than 16 000 school districts out there and there are 53 million children out there when you look at the number of children and you look at the amount spent per child we are talking about 416 per child per year maybe that can help you understand the mindboggling figure of 22 billion per year over a 5year period which adds up to 110 billion and then lay the 110 billion alongside 218 billion for highways lay that alongside 864 billion for a tax cut and you are able to comprehend maybe what is going on in washington do you want to stand by and let your government leaders make the blunder of a tax cut expenditure of 864 billion while schools receive zero from a surplus that does exist or we assume exists democrats risk also being upstaged on this because i do not think the majority party is as dumb as some people consider it to be and i do not think this whole process is going to go forward without the majority party waking up to the fact that the people out there are still demanding that the federal government do more for education between now and the next election in the year 2000 i expect some movement on the part of the majority party and i hope the democrats are not going to be victimized by an october surprise like the one we had in october of 1996 when the republicans agreed to an increase in education funding of 4 billion after the republicans had gone for a period from 1994 to the fall of 1996 calling for the abolishment of the department of education wanting to cut school lunches they attacked education vigorously they cut head start they cut title i they went into 1995 and shut down the government because the president would not agree to those kinds of cuts after all that had happened in the fall of 1996 they decided to appropriate 4 billion more for education and they went out and told the public we are the party which supports education and they had enough people to believe that to win back the majority i am convinced that that was a major item a major part of their winning in 1996 democratic refusal to support a meaningful dollar investment in school construction and modernization could weaken our ties to our labor allies and leave open an opportunity for republicans to capture more labor union support i have talked before about the way we treat the working people in this country people look at requests for new money for education for items like school construction or items like whole school reform or any items related to education they look at it and say well thats for minorities thats for people in the inner cities but most of the working families in this country cannot afford to send their children to private schools so we are talking about the public school system and a refusal to direct funding into school building repair and modernization is an abandonment of the public school system and working families are out there who are going to suffer as a result we cannot emphasize too much the fact that the fiscal negotiating environment has undergone a rapid almost revolutionary seachange since the announcement of the longterm multitrillion dollar surplus to adapt to this change and at the same time respond to the number one priority of the voters we urge you to review your position on h r 1820 and sign up for cosponsorship now i am trying to get this new letter out i have some sponsors that we did not have before the minority whip the gentleman from michigan now is a cosponsor of this bill the gentlewoman from california on the appropriations committee is a cosponsor we hope that we can have new momentum that will be generated among those skeptical democrats who did not want to be associated with an appropriation figure which seemed unreal it is not unreal anymore i hope i do not have to repeat why it is not unreal i think that every one of my colleagues republican or democrat can see that 110 billion alongside 864 billion is not an unreal projection of what should be available for school construction now one final specific item about this particular bill h r 1820 we propose to appropriate the money on the basis of the number of school aged children in each state this is a bill that would not be targeted meanstested and that the utilization of it would have great flexibility for security purposes for repair for modernization for technology for construction for renovation there would be great flexibility and it would be appropriated according to the number of school aged children if you look at it in terms of the blanket call for 110 billion it may seem kind of irrelevant to you but let us look at what each state will get if you take the number of school aged children projected for that state for this year and you apply that to the formula alabama would receive 341 million for school construction per year this is the first year each year for 5 years alabama would receive 340 million california would receive 2 7 billion a year for 5 years florida would receive 1 1 billion hawaii 92 million iowa 233 million it would be money which is real enough to deal with the problem that the general accounting office has cited we are talking about expenditures which would make a big difference in terms of school construction and school modernization and repair et cetera we are talking about an investment in education which would be a capital investment the value over 30 40 50 years versus the 864 billion projected for a tax cut expenditure over a 10year period i include for the record these two items my dear colleague letter of may 26 1999 and my dear colleague letter of july 14 1999 in their entirety"], [0.0012766718864440918, 0.9987233281135559, 1, "i originally voted for this bill but only very reluctantly i will not vote to override the presidents veto i am not voting to sustain the veto because i oppose estatetax relief for familyowned ranches and farms or other small businesses in fact i definitely think we should act to make it easier for their owners to pass them on to future generations this is important for the whole country or course but it is particularly important for coloradans who want to help keep ranch lands in open undeveloped condition by reducing the pressure to sell them to pay estate taxes but there is a better way to do it than by enacting this republican bill that is why i voted for the democratic alternative when the house originally considered this bill that democratic alternative bill would have provided real effective relief without the excesses of the republican bill it would have raised the estate taxs special exclusion to 4 million for a couple owning a farm or small business so under that alternative a married couple owning a family farm or ranch or a small business worth up to 4 million could pass it on intact with no estate tax whatsoever also the democratic alternative actually would have provided more immediate relief to small business and farm owners unlike the republican billwhich is phased in over 10 yearsthe democratic alternative would have taken effect immediately that means a couple passing on their farm or small business in the near future would avoid more tax under the democratic plan than under the republican bill they would not have to hope to live long enough to see the benefits in addition by increasing the general exclusion from 675 000 to 1 1 million next year the democratic alternative would have allowed parents to pass on millionaire status to their children without a penny of estate tax burden and the democratic alternative also would have lowered estate tax rates by 20 across the board so the democratic alternativewhich i voted for which deserved adoption and which would not have been vetoedwould have provided important relief from the estate tax and would have done so in a real effective and prompt way furthermore the democratic alternative would have provided this relief in a fiscally responsible way that would not jeopardize our ability to do what is needed to maintain and strengthen social security and medicare provide a prescription drug benefit for seniors and pay down the public debt by contrast it is precisely the fiscal overkill of the republican bill that made me most reluctant to vote for it and that leads me to vote to sustain the presidents veto as the rocky mountain news put it in a september 3rd editorial the republican tax cut is a gamble that the present economic boom isnt going to slow and is fiscally irre mr lantos i will vote today sponsible to uphold the presidents veto of the estate once fully phased in the republican bill tax elimination act would forgo nearly 50 billion a year in rev when this legislation was first considered in enue with no guarantee that this revenue loss the house in june i strongly supported and will not harm social security and medicare in voted for the democratic alternative which was future years presented by congressman rangel of new the bills sponsors say it will cost 28 2 bil york that proposal called for a significant relion over 5 years and 104 5 billion over 10 duction in the rate of taxation of estates and years but that is far from the whole story be a 50 percent increase in the small business cause of the way the bill is phased in its true exclusion the rangel proposal was a cost is cleverly hidden and does not show up thoughtful and reasonable effort to deal with until after the 10year budget window the legitimate concerns of small businesses that means the full effects of the repub and family farms but it did not have the problican bill will come just at the time when we lems of the legislation which was being urged will have to face budget pressures because by the republican majority my own baby boom generation is starting to when the rangel substitute was defeated retire and if we feel we need to phase in by the house i nevertheless voted for the h r 8 because we cannot afford the full re adoption of h r 8 in order to continue the legpeal now how are we ever going to afford it islative process initial senate action was 10 years from now much closer to the rangel substitute and i we do not need to engage in this fiscal expected a housesenate conference comoverkill mittee to produce a bill that i could support according to the treasury department unfortunately the senate simunder current law only 2 of all decedents ply accepted the flawed version of the bill as have enough wealth to be subject to the es adopted by the house and did not make those tate tax at all changes that would improve the legislation to be more specific the treasury depart president clinton was right to veto this bill ment tells me that in 1997 estatetax returns and i will vote to sustain that veto were filed for only 297 coloradans i urge my colleagues in the furthermore according to the treasury de republican leadership of this house to work partment of those estates that are affected by with the democratic leadership and with the the estate tax only 30 that is only 6 in president to craft legislation that deals with the 10 000 american estateswere comprised legitimate problems of estate taxation and that primarily of familyowned small businesses provides the relief small businesses need we ranches or farms need to deal with legitimate problems with the looking just at our state that

on the judiciary i would like to respond to the issue of the latino immigration fairness act and the authorizing committee we made every effort to respond to this issue in the authorizing committee but we were denied by the republican majority i would like to support this legislation it is an important piece of legislation but i think it is important to reunite families the same as we did for eastern european families a few years ago this legislation now is the only vehicle to be able to answer the concerns of haitians hondurans and guatemalans and others who were left out we need parity in addition this is the only vehicle that we can support the hate crimes legislation that has been denied to many states in this country i think james byrd jr s heinous murderous deceased condition obviously warrants us passing both the hate crimes legislation and as well this legislation with the immigration fairness act included i ask for my colleagues to vote against this legislation i rise to express my outrage that this house has brought forth the important commercejusticestate conference report to be voted on yet the republican leadership has not felt the need or importance to include language to address the dreadful acts of hate crimes this move by the republican leadership is a slap in the face to the many people here in the united states who have historically been subjected to hateful acts resulting in death bodily harm as well as mental and physical anguish only due to a persons race ethnicity gender age or sexual orientation how can we as elected representatives for the american people ignore our duty to ensure that all people are treated equally how can we ignore our moral oath to protect people from hateful acts that arise because of a person race ethnicity gender age or sexual orientation how can we allow hateful skeletons of this countrys past to be revived and allowed to infect our society today this chambers silence on the need for hate crimes legislation would do just that and the absence of hate crimes language in the cjs conference report sends the message that this countrys stance on crimes of hate is not a top priority this issue is very dear to me and i am ashamed that after two years from the date of james bryd juniors vicious murder on a paved road in my home state of texas that a bipartisan hate crimes prevention act has not become law time and time again i have come to the floor and asked the republican leadership to support meaningful hate crimes legislation i have introduced my own hate crimes legislation and have supported legislation and resolutions introduced by my colleagues in both the house and the senate yet i find myself coming before the american people once again to compel the republican leadership to include hate crimes language in the cjs conference report in order to increase penalties on perpetrators of hate crimes before the 106th congress comes to a close the same tactics that have been used in the texas state legislature to run out the time in the legislative session to defeat the passage of hate crimes legislation have been used here in the united states congress as well when the james byrd jr hate crimes act was introduced in my home state of texas in january 1999 it was hastily defeated in the state senate and when state democrats attempted to negotiate with republicans in the state senate and the governors administration to get a bipartisan hate crimes bill passed political games were played to extend the process until the end of the state legislative session as i have stated this political ploy was not only used in my home state of texas but it has been used here in both chambers of the united states congress as well we have attempted to negotiate with members of the republican party to get hate crimes legislation passed within the 106th congress however political games and wizardry have been used to delay the process until the congressional session comes to an end i therefore call on the republican leadership with the american people as my witnesses to once again ask for the passage of hate crimes legislation to address senseless killings and crimes of hate and to make a statement that the united states will no longer tolerate these acts since james byrd juniors death our nation has experienced an alarming increase in hate violence directed at men women and even children of all races creeds and colors ronald taylor traveled to the eastside of pittsburgh in what has been characterized as an act of hate violence to kill three and wound two in a fast food restaurant eight weeks later in pittsburgh richard baumhammers armed with a 357caliber pistol traveled 20 miles across the west side of pittsburgh where he killed five people his shooting victims included a jewish women an indian vietnamese chinese and several black men the decade of the 1990s saw an unprecedented rise in the number of hate groups preaching violence and intolerance with more than 50 000 hate crimes reported during the years 1991 through 1997 the summer of 1999 was dubbed the summer of hate as each month brought forth another appalling incident commencing with a threeday shooting spree aimed at minorities in the midwest and culminating with an attack on mere children in california from 1995 through 1999 there has been 206 different arson or bomb attacks on churches and synagogues throughout the united statesan average of one house of worship attacked every week like the rest of the nation some in congress have been tempted to dismiss these atrocities as the anomalous acts of lunatics but news accounts of this homicidal fringe are merely the tip of the iceberg the beliefs they act on are held by a far larger though less visible segment of our society these atrocities illustrate the need for continued vigilance and the passage of the hate crimes prevention act it is long past the time for congress to pass a comprehensive law banning such atrocities it is a federal crime to hijack an automobile or to possess cocaine and it ought to be a federal crime to drag a man to death becauseof his race or to hang a person because of his or her sexual orientation these are crimes that shock and shame our national conscience and they should be subject to federal law enforcement assistance and prosecution therefore i would urge my fellow members of the united states congress and the american people to be counted among those who will stand for justice in this country for all americans and nothing else we must address the problem of hate crimes

workforce development and safety investments and cuts more than 1 billion from critical health programs and next week we will be forced to vote on this bill that undermines so many of our nations priorities why because the republican house leadership passed a bad budget resolution that puts tax cuts for the wealthiest americans above investments to promote americas education workforce and health services their 175 billion tax cut exceeds the projected budget surplus and requires deep cuts in nondefense discretionary appropriations and here we are again voting on a measure that would

to the majority of americans who want a good education a strong work force and a healthy future this bill will cost 50 billion per year when fully phased in this monstrous hole in the federal budget will undoubtedly translate into cuts from areas that the american people care about just as the proposed 175 billion republican tax cut translated into cuts in yesterdays proposed labor hhs education

reliable prescription drug benefit under medicare the republican leadership has reluctantly been forced to put forward what they call a plan because of the overwhelming public outcry created by rapidly escalating outrageously profitable prescription drug prices charged by manufacturers being forced to develop a plan the best republican leaders have been able to do is to listen to their friends in the pharmaceutical industry if they had traveled with any of us over august and listened to the stories that we heard every one of us heard and they are heartbreaking these are people that worked hard played by the rules and thought they had made the right decisions to provide for their senior years they would know that we have got to do something about this problem and it is time to have a prescription drug benefit for medicare the democratic plan will use the purchasing power of our seniors covered by medicare to negotiate large discounts from drug makers i believe governor bush said yesterday that that would be a dangerous thing to do it might actually reduce by a little bit the outrageous profits of these drug companies they might actually even have to cut back on some of the tremendous salaries that they pay the people that run these companies and that would be too bad to cut some of those folks back under maybe 100 million a year the republican plan is a cynical game being played with our seniors health a shameful attempt to deceive our seniors they have proposed a large first step toward privatizing medicare and forcing our seniors to deal with private insurance companies to get the care and the prescription drugs that they need the insurance companies say they do not want it they do not want anything to do with it that is why we have to have medicare medicare is a success you can ask the republicans what does it cover and they will tell you well we dont know then you can say how much does it pay and they will say we dont know then you can say what are the premiums and they will say we dont know they do not want to see drug companies exorbitant profits damaged that is what the interest is in the plan that governor bush put forward yesterday that and continuing to try to destroy medicare as we know it their plan only provides subsidies to their insurance companies the donors and the pharmaceutical companies profits rather than giving any direct assistance to our seniors it does nothing to see that americans can buy prescription medicine at the same price as every other country in the world and we pay two to three times as much in this country their plan is based on the discredited theory that private insurers will offer affordable prescription insurance if they are given enough government subsidies but the hmos and the insurance companies just simply say this will not work it is also unlikely that the country will be able to pay for prescription drug coverage under medicare because the republicans are continuing their attempts to squander any available moneys on tax cuts that are disproportionately benefitting the wealthy the american people want a prescription drug benefit for our seniors and it is time for this congress and the next president to recognize the tremendous need that our seniors have and do the right thing and pass a legitimate prescription drug benefit for medicare"], [0.0013759136199951172,

fact i definitely think we should act to make it easier for their owners to pass them on to future generations this is important for the whole country of course but it is particularly important for coloradans who want to help keep ranch lands in open undeveloped condition by reducing the pressure to sell them to pay estate taxes but we do not need to do all that this republican bill would do in order to make sure the estate tax is no longer too heavy a burden on the small business and farm owners the democratic alternativethe substitute for which i votedwould have provided real effective relief without the excesses of the republican bill that alternative would have raised the estate taxs special exclusion to 4 million for a couple owning a farm or small business so under that alternative a married couple owning a family farm or ranch or a small business worth up to 4 million could pass it on intact with no estate tax whatsoever also the democratic alternative actually would have provided more immediate relief to small business and farm owners unlike the republican billwhich is phased in over ten yearsthe democratic alternative would have taken effect immediately that means a couple passing on their farm or small business in the near future would avoid more tax under the democratic plan than under the republican bill they would not have to hope to live long enough t6 see the benefits in addition by increasing the general exclusion now at 675 000 to 1 1 million next year the democratic alternative would allow for any person to pass on millionaire status to their children without a penny of estate tax burden and the democratic alternative also would lower estate tax rates by 20 across the board so the democratic alternativewhich i voted for and which deserved adoptionwould provide important relief from the estate tax and would have done so in a real effective and prompt way furthermore the democratic alternative would have provided this relief in a fiscally responsible way that would not jeopardize our ability to do what is needed to maintain and strengthen social security and medicare provide a prescription drug benefit for seniors and pay down the public debt by contrast it is precisely the fiscal overkill of the republican bill that makes me most reluctant to vote for it once fully phased in the republican bill would forgo nearly 50 billion a year in revenue with no guarantee that this revenue loss will not harm social security and medicare in future years the bills sponsors say it will cost 28 2 billion over 5 years and 104 5 billion over 10 years but that is far from the whole story because of the way the bill is phased in its true cost is cleverly hidden and does not show up until after the 10year budget window that means the full effects of the republican bill will come just at the time when we will have to face budget pressures because my own baby boom generation is starting to retire and if we feel we need to phase in h r 8 because we cannot afford the full repeal now how are we ever going to afford it 10 years from now we do not need to engage in this fiscal overkill according to the treasury department under current law only 2 of all decedents have enough wealth to be subject to the estate tax at all to be more specific the treasury department tells me that in 1997 estatetax returns were filed for only 297 coloradans furthermore according to the treasury department of those estates that are affected by the estate tax only 30 that is only 6 in 10 000 american estateswere comprised primarily of familyowned small businesses ranches or farms looking just at our state that means that in 1997 fewer than a dozen estatetax returns were comprised primarily of small businesses ranches or farms of course those numbers only relate to the cases in which an estate tax was actually paid clearly in many other cases families have taken actions to forestall the estate tax i understand that and do think that in appropriate cases we should lessen the pressure that prompted some of those actions as i said the democratic alternative would have provided real effective and immediate estatetax relief to the owners of small businesses including farms and ranches and would have done so in a fiscally responsible way that is why i voted for it in contrast the biggest beneficiaries of the republican legislation are not those middleclass families who own small ranches or farms or other small businesses but instead are very wealthy families with very large assets over the past two decades income and wealth disparities have increased the republican bill while it does have some positive aspects would increase those wealth disparities i find this troubling and it adds to my reluctance to support the bill however i will vote for the bill because the republican leadership has made it clear that it is this bill or no estatetax relief bill at least for now here in the house that being the case i have decided that the republican billalthough very flawed and excessive is just acceptable enough for me to vote for today i do so in the hope and expectation that the bills faults can be corrected as it proceeds through the legislative process and that ultimately it can be refined into a bill that deserves to be enacted into law if that does not occur if that hope and expectation prove unfoundedi

been a tireless advocate on behalf of the hightech industry i do not know of anyone who has worked harder invested more time and energy or is more responsible for the bill that we are considering tonight being on the house floor and i would like to congratulate him in advance on the expected passage of this bill second of all the gentleman from utah who just yielded me the time is an active member of the subcommittee on immigration and claims and he too has been a steadfast advocate of the hightech industry the gentleman from utah himself is an entrepreneur and he understands firsthand the needs of the hightech industry although there is still no objective credible study that documents the shortage of american hightech workers the ins said recently that the demand for highly skilled foreign workers is running at least 50 000 ahead of last year such a demand can indicate an actual shortage of american workers a spot shortage a preference for cheap labor or replacement workers or something else but because of the importance of the hightech industry to our economy i think we should give the industry the benefit of the doubt but giving hightech companies the benefit of the doubt is not without risk unless we safeguard american workers we need to recognize the opposition of the american people to an hlb visa increase two major polls demonstrate that the vast majority of americans do not want to see the number of hightech visas increased so much and worry that it will hurt american workers a peter hart poll conducted in march found that 73 percent of americans do not want to see immigration law changed to allow the entry of more foreign hightech workers only 20 percent wanted more foreign workers a harris poll released in september 1998 found that 82 percent of americans do not want to see the hlb quota increased the poll found that 77 percent of americans believe that an increase in hlb visas reduces employment opportunities for american workers and 86 percent of americans believe that unitedstates companies should train unitedstates workers to perform jobs in technical fields even if it is faster and less expensive to fill the jobs with foreign workers to satisfy the concerns of the american people we need to protect american workers from being undercut by foreign workers in the hlb program s 2045 contains no significant provisions to protect these american workers it does not require most companies to make a goodfaith effort to recruit unitedstates workers before hiring foreign workers it allows all but a small handful of firms to lay off american workers and replace the american workers with foreign workers why would anyone oppose these common sense safeguards what amazes me is that in all the discussions i have had with representatives of hightech companies not a single one has expressed any concern about the impact of this legislation on american workers how could anyone oppose a safeguard that says american workers could not be fired and replaced by a foreign worker how could anyone not agree to advertise for american workers before hiring from abroad how could anyone oppose paying foreign workers what the average beginning salary is for american college graduates unless they want to undercut american wages the committee on the judiciary passed a bill h r 4227 that contains an additional crucial safeguard for american workers the committee on the judiciary passed a bill that set a floor on wages for these workers 40 000 per year this wage is a good starting point for any hightech professional it is a salary that american students fresh out of college are making this crucial safeguard would prevent unitedstates companies from hiring foreign workers to undercut the wages of american workers strong antifraud measures are also necessary to address known abuses an article in last thursdays san francisco chronicle says it all federal authorities have started nationwide investigations into the hiring of foreign hightech workers including charges of visa fraud and allegations that the practice is riddled with abuse the chronicle quotes bill yates of the ins as stating but are we catching most of the fraud the truthful answer is that we are not if it is the intention of the employee or the employer to defraud the government you may not be able to ferret it out a justreleased government accounting office report states there is not sufficient assurance that ins reviews are adequate for detecting program noncompliance or abuse the program is vulnerable to abuse both by employers who do not have bona fide jobs to fill or do not meet required labor conditions and by potential workers who present false credentials the goals of preventing abuse of the program and providing efficient services to employers and workers are not being achieved evidence suggests that program noncompliance or abuse by employers may be more prevalent than under other laws any hlb bill should contain effective antifraud measures as are contained in the committee on the judiciarypassed h r 4227 s 2045 contains no such antifraud measures in return for giving hightech companies hundreds of thousands of more foreign workers all we ask on behalf of american workers is some minimal basic common sense safeguards to ensure that businesses do not want to hire cheap foreign workers at the expense of american workers while this bill has taken significant steps to alleviate the presumed shortage with more training for american workers such provisions will not yield benefits for many years supplying

americorps generates l66 in benefits to the community every fulltime americorps members generates an average of 12 additional volunteers americorps is one of the most successful experiments in state and local controls the federal government has embarked upon twothirds of americorps funding goes directly to the governorappointed state commissions which then make grants to local nonprofits since 1994 more than 150 000 americans have served as americorps members in all 50 states they have taught tutored or mentored more than 2 5 million students recruited supervised or trained more than 1 6 million volunteers built or rehabilitated more than 25 000 homes provided living assistance to more than 208 000 senior citizens and planted more than more than 52 million trees americorps members are not only helping meet the immediate needs in our communities they are also teaching through their example the importance of serving and helping others as a former peace corps volunteer i know the significance of this longlasting lesson our youth want so desperately to take hold of their destiny and work to ensure a brighter and more prosperous future there is so much they can do all they need

a 417 to 8 vote by this house on h r 1776 to increase this programs authorization to 4 9 billion cdbg is the largest source of federal community development assistance to state and local governments it is one of the most flexible most successful programs the federal government administers the cdbg program puts development funds where they can most effectively be allocated in local communities communities may use cdbg money for a variety of community development activities including housing community development economic development and public service activities the bottom line for me in closing is i believe strongly in americorps i regret it is not in the bill i understand why it was not placed in the bill because some members on either side of the aisle will decide to fund veterans programs or some other program and offset it with the national service programs and republicans and democrats alike will vote for a veterans program over this but this program like veterans programs

today to support the education flexibility act a bill sponsored by the gentleman from indiana and the gentleman from delaware it is a bipartisan bill aimed at giving greater flexibility to local schools to do their job the important job they do of educating our children during the past couple of months i have visited 10 or 12 schools in my district and visited the school districts there to sort of find out what they think of the federal role in education the federal role in education usually accounts for about 4 to 8 percent of the budgets of the average school district and i wanted to know if they thought that was helping the answer i got back was yes the money helps but there is too much red tape and there is too much regulation they want greater freedom so that they can exercise their skills and use the teachers and principals and parents and everybody involved in education on the local level there is too much federal red tape and the education flexibility act would target that red tape right now we have a pilot project that allows some 12 states in the country to take advantage of education flexibility this bill would expand it to all 50 states and what it would do is give local school districts the ability to get waivers from those federal regulations but the important thing about education flexibility is that it combines flexibility with accountability which is the way it ought to be done you can get the waiver the local school districts can get the waiver from the federal requirements but only if they have local standards that they can demonstrate that they are meeting the key word in there is local not national standards they can have their own standards but they have to have that accountability flexibility mix the education flexibility act that is being proposed and introduced this week offers that mix and is a key to helping our schools move forward with the important job they do of reforming the education system and educating our children i think it is very important that we go further than the education flexibility act right now there is far too much red tape and far too many regulations in hundreds of different areas generated from the federal government that does not really help our local schools but only ties them in knots i do not want the people working in the schools in my community to spend all of their time filling out forms

going on in states and school districts they are making the reforms necessary they are moving towards accountability and right now the federal government is too big of a noose stopping them from making progress on that we need to make changes like the education flexibility act as a democrat i have always been a strong supporter of education and i support my fellow democrats in supporting spending the money necessary to help with education and supporting public education public education is responsible for over 90 percent of the children in this country getting educated it needs our support but we cannot simply spend money on it we must show that we are willing to move in two other critical directions one is accountability and the other is flexibility which means local control giving the power back to the individual school districts and the individual schools and ultimately to the teachers and parents who are closest to the product closest to our children and closest to educating them and who know best how to do it we need to make those changes so that we can have the world class public education system we need the education flexibility act that we introduce this

as we go into the 21st century that we look to the institutions who educated and trained the october 3 2000 cc women beginning in my home state of mississippi in 1884 if we look at the subset of the universities that we picked out why should they receive priority they are the oldest public womens colleges in the country we may talk about the 78 other womens colleges but these are the oldest of the womens colleges in the country they happen to reside in my region but if we are looking at his toric preservation it seems to me that we look at the oldest first and that should receive the priority if we are looking at continuing their mission into the 21st century mississippi university for women has a great legacy not only going back into the late 1800s the 1900s but today in 2000 they received unitedstates news and world reports ranking of the best in the south as a liberal arts college they are educating not only women today and minorities but also male students if we are to continue the rich history and the legacy of what they have done over their history over their time and to continue the mission into the 21st century then the buildings that house their students where the teachers train the students of tomorrow we must preserve those buildings that house the places where we are now providing the education for women and minorities across the south i introduced h r 4503 to advance what i think is the most important priority for funding in this congress and that is education the bipartisan cosponsorship and support for this effort affirms the principle that if we are to continue to progress as a society if we are to continue to lead the world in science medicine law and many other fields we must educate all americans the historically womens public institutions which are the subject of this bill were founded in the united states between 1836 and 190g this was a time when women particularly poor women were unable to attain a higher education in public schools the opportunity simply did not exist in recognition of this injustice and unfair circumstance for women there was introduced into the united states senate a resolution in the late 1800s which sought the establishment and endowment of schools of science and technics for the education of females in appropriate branches of science and the useful arts upon a plan similar in its principles to that upon which agricultural and mechanical colleges have been aided by the united states this need expressed in this resolution introduced over 100 years ago continues today as i mentioned earlier in my home state of mississippi the state legislature worked and established the mississippi industrial institute and college of girls to provide for women particularly those without the means a public education which would empower them to lift themselves out of their circumstance over 100 years later i know that the w and the other colleges prioritized in this bill continue to be crucial educational institutions for women minorities and all students with buildings in some of these colleges and universities well over 150 years old still in use their disrepair now endangers their ability to continue their critical role in educating women and minorities due to advanced age of these buildings the upkeep costs are more than most budgets can allow since most of these universities were built in the early 1900s most of todays basic needs are not provided for in their facilities this congress can and should reaffirm its commitment to the education of women the underprivileged and minorities education cannot take place without adequate facilities we must therefore contribute to the rehabilitation of these facilities funding for restoration of these historic buildings much as we did for the historically black colleges across our region is and should be a sound investment i want to thank again the gentleman from utah the subcommittee chairman and all those who have cosponsored

am introducing the gun trafficking act of 1999 this legislation will place a licensed manufacturer or dealer between the seller and buyer as a middle man this licensed dealer will facilitate the gun
