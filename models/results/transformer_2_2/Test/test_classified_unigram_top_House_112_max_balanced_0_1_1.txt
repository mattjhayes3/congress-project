individuals i have heard my republican colleagues mention cost throughout this day well make no mistake there would also be a cost in leaving tens of millions of americans uninsured according to a recent study published by the american journal of public health uninsured working age americans have a 40 percent higher risk of death than their privately insured counterparts the study estimates that lack of health insurance causes over 44 000 excess deaths annually that works out to about one death every 12 minutes from lack of health insurance my colleagues let us not forget to count those lives as a very real and continuing cost over 44 000 deaths a year one every 12 minutes i urge my colleagues to support the democratic plan lifesaving legislation and vote against the republican repeal of health care it is wrong for america i urge a no vote i rise in strong opposition to this harmful illconceived bill when the republican majority said it was going to make the deficit their defining issue this congress most of us did not realize it was to make the deficit bigger but according to the congressional budget office their first act to repeal health care would do just thatadd 230 billion to the deficit while making americans pay more for health care instead of focusing on job creation republicans are running up our deficit jeopardizing the health of millions of americans and threatening the creation of new jobs under the republican repeal effort insurance companies will once again be able to drop people when they get sickexactly when coverage is needed most children with preexisting conditions will be denied coverage while insurance companies would again impose devastating annual and lifetime caps young people will not be able to stay on their parents plans until age 26 pregnant women and breast cancer survivors can be denied coverage seniors will face an increase in their prescription drug costsmillions thrown back into the medicare part d donut hole repeal would deny seniors a 50 percent discount on prescription drugs recreating the devastating coverage gap each of these things will disappear if republicans are able to repeal the historic health reform law in my home state of new york repealing the affordable care act would be devastating new york residents providers small businesses and other employers would be denied critical new benefits of the law from protections against insurance industry abuses to new coverage options and millions of dollars in support so states like new york can deliver quality affordable health care options to all of its residents without the affordable care act new york will suffer 77 800 young adults would lose their insurance coverage through their parents health plans sometimes just after they finish school and as they are looking for a job families across new york would lose the peace of mind the affordable care act provides by making sure that young adults can stay on their parents plan to age 26 if they do not have coverage of their own more than 10 million residents of new york with private insurance coverage would suddenly find themselves vulnerable again to having lifetime limits placed on how much insurance companies will spend on their health care insurance companies would once again be allowed to cut off someones coverage unexpectedly when they are in an accident or become sick because of a simple mistake on an application this would leave 734 000 people in new york at risk of losing their insurance at the moment they need it most as one of the worst abuses of the insurance industry would become legal again new insurance plans would no longer be required to cover recommended preventive services like mammograms and flu shots without cost sharing nor would they have to guarantee enrollees the right to choose any available primary care provider in the network or see an obgyn without a referral nearly 2 9 million seniors in new york who have medicare coverage would be forced to pay a copay to receive important preventive services like mammograms and colonoscopies medicare would no longer pay for an annual checkup visit so nearly 2 9 million seniors in new york who have medicare coverage would have to pay extra if they want to stay healthy by getting checkups regularly 192 596 on medicare would see significantly higher prescription drug costs in new york 192 596 medicare beneficiaries received a onetime taxfree 250 rebate to help pay for prescription drugs in the donut hole coverage gap in 2010 medicare beneficiaries who fall into the donut hole in 2011 will be eligible for 50 percent discounts on covered brand name prescription drugs without the law the burden of high prescription drug costs would hurt millions of medicare beneficiaries across the country for the sake of argument if we remove the moral obligation of providing health care to 32 million americans who would lose coverage with this repeal we are still left with a compelling fiscal reason for opposing the repeal of this law repeal adds 230 billion to the deficit over the first 10 years and more than 1 2 trillion in the second decade around onehalf percent of gdp americans

lifeline for older americans providing quality and affordable health care for all seniors but this week house republicans are proposing to strip seniors of this guaranteed benefit the republican budget proposal dismantles medicare as we know it telling seniors they are going to be on their own to find insurance no matter what the cost or how sick they are and it slashes medicaid coverage for seniors who need longterm care threatening our sickest most frail elderly in nursing homes with no care at all this is absolutely the wrong approach to solving our nations budget problems every day 48 million elderly and disabled americans across this country count on medicare for their lifesaving medications doctor visits and hospital care sixtynine percent of people over the age of 65 and they are both democrats and republicans oppose medicare becoming a voucher program seniors know that changing medicare to a voucher program means that they will no longer have access to a guaranteed set of health benefits that the value of a limited voucher wont keep up with rising health care costs that the voucher would become insufficient over time and the care they need could become unaffordable that too many taxpayer dollars will be spent on advertising campaigns and administrative costs instead of actual medical expenses and seniors know that privatizing medicare means limits on benefits obstacles to care uncertain reimbursements copayments for primary care or specialty care exclusions for certain services discrimination based on income illness or age and more uncertainty if a serious illness or need for longterm care occurs seniors know that privatizing or voucherizing medicare will mean that they pay more in premiums or do without and it doesnt end there in addition to medicare cuts republicans also want to take away medicaid for the nearly 6 million seniors who depend on it for nursing home or longterm care they say proudly that they will cut funding to states by 1 trillion this means that disabled and frail elderly americans will be placed on waiting lists for services or have no access to care at all in pennsylvania my home state nearly 40 percent of funds spent on longterm care would be at risk this includes 62 percent of nursing home residents and 25 000 pennsylvanian seniors who receive home health services and yet when republicans had the opportunity to reduce costs while maintaining and strengthening care for our seniors they demonized the plan voting time and again to stop important improvements in medicare and they still want to repeal the law that eliminates copayments for preventive care services that makes prescription drug benefits more affordable and improves coordination of care and health outcomes reduces errors and reduces costs for seniors they want to repeal the law that curbs the growth in medicare spending saves taxpayers almost 500 billion by ending overpayments to insurance companies and extends the life of the medicare trust fund for 12 years instead the republicans here in washington want to end medicare as we know it and put health care for american seniors at great risk as a senior member of the budget committee i know how important it is to find solutions to reducing the deficit to do this right the solution must include spending cuts tax policy reform and economic growth we should not fix our budget problems by failing to meet our obligations to our seniors every day we hear how determined republicans are to slash billions of dollars from the central programs because we simply cant afford it they say we cant afford to make investments in the future we cant afford to educate our children or fix our roads or fuel innovation or cover health care costs for seniors yet in the same proposal to slash medicare and medicaid for millions of seniors republicans make permanent tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of americans in the very same budget proposal where republicans take away guaranteed benefits for seniors they protect billions of tax subsidies to the oil and gas industry in the very same budget proposal where republicans give seniors a limited voucher to pay for higher insurance premiums they protect the pentagon from spending cuts on unnecessary weapon systems one trillion dollars in tax expenditures 700 billion in tax cuts for the wealthy few 40 billion in tax breaks for oil companies and billions of dollars to continue inefficiencies at the pentagonall of this spending is protected by the republican budget and instead they choose to slash benefits to our seniors and our disabled americans budgets are about priorities and theyre about our values yes we should get serious about our nations deficit but lets be sure that our priorities are right and we do not threaten our obligations to our seniors to our children or to americas future"], [0.0010096430778503418, 0.9989903569221497, 1, "for a great number of hours today in this chamber there has been a great debate on whether or not to repeal the affordable care act when we know fully that the chances are slim to move forward and the measure would not be signed into law is it political posturing i believe it is of a grand style theres a pattern being established here theres been an attackoutright attackon social security attempts to privatize the system its been under attack for the last 76 years its been the underpinning that provides stability for working families across this great nation it has been a security piece that has enabled many to have at least assurances that there would be some support in family budgets as they move month to month we know that that measure social security has been dealing with its enemies for a long timesince before it was made a law likewise medicare which came to us in the midsixties enabled our senior community to have its health care needs met provided predictability and stability for retired households enabled people to enjoy a quality of life a better quality of health care we know that before medicare many of those who had retired expected to see their economic security dip south because of the expected cost of providing health care when they perhaps could not get that coverage in an insurance context so medicare as we know it today would be undone by the republican majority in this house they would prefer to privatize social security allow us to reach to the financial sector to perhaps see a repeat of what happened to so many individuals and families out there with this past recession where they saw their lifetime savings wiped away trillions lost in the american economy pain and suffering endured by families across this land theyd rather see a voucher system for medicare handing it over to the insurance companies to leave seniors digging deeper into their pockets so the pattern has been established here and now a repeal of the affordable care act before its full implementation before given a chance as we arrive as the last industrialized nation in the world to provide a universal health care coverage program unacceptable progress is struck a decision is rendered by the highest court in the land a conservativeleaning court before the ink is dry on that decision a move to repeal the court spoke it has spoken to america and said the litmus test for constitutionality was debated and a decision rendered that said yes in fact it meets the constitutionality test and so this evening on the eve of the attempts to repeal the affordable care act as it stands is a very telling moment it is one that suggests to us that there is this outright attempt to undo programs that serve our middle class so very well and without a thriving middle class our nation is not prosperous without that thriving middle class theres not purchasing power strong enough to provide the recovery of our economy without a strengthening of our middle class there is not a confidence in the economy a confidence that is needed so as to grow more customers for our business base and so the affordable care act is offering promise and hope to millions tens of millions of americans across this land whether youre insured underinsured uninsured all categories will see strengthening because of this measure think of it i represent a large proportion of senior citizens who are concerned about their pharmaceutical costs many dealing with that doughnut hole have reached that threshold that requires them to dig into their pockets we close that doughnut hole we make more affordable the prescriptions that are required for people to stay well and in some cases to have the medications that keep them alive we deny that opportunity to our nations seniors we deny the respect that we offer we deny the dignity in the equation that speaks to affordable outcomes for the pharmaceuticals that our senior community requires that doughnut hole would have been closed by 2020 further at the other end of the age spectrum many young adults finding it difficult in this recessionand now the recovery periodto gain a job as they perhaps leave high school or college are given the opportunity with the affordable care act to remain on their familys policy until the age of 26 therein lies a strong benefit for some 6 6 million young adults denied with the repeal measure denying access and affordability to health care situations how many cases of young adults impacted by catastrophic illness or accidents will it require to turn the hearts and the minds in a positive direction that would not forego this opportunity for our nations young adults a strong benefit associated with this package what about those who have a preexisting condition some 17 million children in that category and thats not to account for the many adults who would be denied because of preexisting conditions asthma in children diabetes in our senior community being a woman utilized as a preexisting condition an opportunity to deny coverage and the basic core need that we should consider to be truly american another benefit lost to the greedy notion of repealing success that was achieved in this house and the united states senate and signed into law by this president what about the efforts to deny lifetime benefits as a threshold cutting people off of an insurance coverage at perhaps a very demanding time in their lives games played with people and their lives and their recovery hope pulled from working families across this nation because of an insensitivity of this congress a deplorable situation assistance to our small business community now if we profess our small business community to be the economic engine that is part and parcel of our economic comeback our economic springboard then would we not want to provide assistance in that basic core need area would we not want to allow tax credits to come the way of our small business community many a majority of those businesses will remind all of us as representatives that they want to provide for their employees they want a productive workforce that means a strong and well workforce and so they see it as a strong investment one however that they could not afford in recent years because of the escalating costs 18 percent larger bill than industry and perhaps weaker coverage they wanted that turned around they wanted a smart approach a businesslike approach a sensitive response they got it with the affordable care act progress denied the small business engine weakened by this sort of neglect that could be advanced in this cited pattern of undoing social security privatizing social security changing medicare as we know it forever now repealing the affordable care act we see the pattern we see the gross neglect the disrespect for americas middle class her working families so we go forward and we understand that with the opportunities of an exchange small employers our small business community understands that if theyre unable to enter into an exchange where all the private sector participants agree to play by the rules to sharpen their pencils roll up their sleeves provide the service live within the parameters and allow for the many to enter into a common exchange to provide corresponding benefits think of it if 1 of 10 in that employee firm of 20 were to be impacted with catastrophic illness its devastating an actuarial impact that hits that small business owner hard in the pocketbook because of the premium increase for that 1 person of the 10 you employ if those same 10 employees were allowed to enter the exchange a better outcome a different outcome a stronger outcome for the economic recovery of this nation because the gross majority of jobs being produced in this comeback are being done by our small business community and so you know the formula is quite obvious we want a comeback we want that strongest response here from washington for that kick that we endured from a recession that drained us of 8 2 million jobs the best way to do it first of three principles small business provide for the strengthening of small business which the affordable care act does because that small business community has forever been the pulse of american enterprise secondly invest in that entrepreneur the dreamer the mover the shaker it always stretched us since our days of pioneer spirit with the industrial revolution and the westward movement very familiar to the district i represent which is the donor area to the erie canal in upstate new york in the capital region mohawk valley that pioneer spirit exists in our fabric today its our dna invest in the entrepreneur to be the ideas economy kingpin we rely on these wizards to build us sustain us stretch us empower us and then finally invest in a thriving middle class which the affordable care act does it enables us as a middle class community to be bolstered by the confidence the security the stability that has come with this success story in guaranteeing access and affordability to quality health care that will underscore the value of wellness and not just deal with illness that will put together efforts to cost contain that will bring people into a structured program so that we can monitor their activities and connect them to a system you know youll hear from some on the floor we dont want to pay for this its going to cost us too much were paying today for the neglect for the consequences of a notsoperfect system status quo will not cut it and so we need to go forward with progressive policies with the soundness of reform with the boldness of transition with the confidence we can instill with the progressiveness of policies that we can draft and so it is a sad note here echoed in this chamber that would attempt to unravel dilute destroy deny the promise we can make to america as i look at this effort for a comeback the containment of health care costs is just one of those areas that we need to help control create that better environment in which to grow jobs cultivate a prosperity its important its important for us to understand that it is part of an economic recovery equation but theres also the wisdom of investing in education in higher education again under attack by a system that does not always profess the strength of research and education and patents and discovery we understand that we are in the midst of a global race on innovation clean energy and ideas and high tech to be outstanding competitors to arrive at that race ready to conquer we will need to be strong and fit in order to be the winning agent on that global scene we saw that order of passion we saw that order of investment in the global race on space just decades ago this nation impacted by a sputnik moment dusted off its backside and said never again never again and what was the result together a nation grew in its commitment to winning the global race on space we are going to be that agent that nation that proud people that would stake the american flag on the moon and we won that race because of a commitment because of investment in the soundness of the people of this great country and her business community we embraced research we embraced science we believed in our strength as a people and the confidence exuded was the elixir that brought us to the victory where is that like passion today where is that leadership a rather youthful president that led us in the sixties and challenged us in almost replication today finds us interestingly to be challenged by a rather youthful president asking us to enter into the global sweepstakes committing with passion to the cause and so we need that investment in education in higher education and research just today in schenectady new york in the 21st congressional district of new york that im proud to represent we announced formally the creation of the advanced battery manufacturing center at that facility of ge ceo jeff immelt traveled for the celebration came to town to announce this wonderful wonderful addition that is america at work with her genius activity thats america determined to win the global race on ideas advanced battery manufacturing the battery the linchpin to so much potential out there to grow domestic supplies of energy to grow jobs as we grow our energy future to reduce the gluttonous dependency on fossilbased fuels oftentimes imported from some of the most unfriendly nations to the united states sending hundreds of billions of dollars annually to those foreign treasuries that are then used to train troops to fight against our own daughters and sons on the battlefield unacceptable there is a better way and this congress knows it we invest in jobs we invest in health care we invest in education we invest in research we do it in a way that promises our best attempt as a nation to generations yet unborn someone was there for us and we need to be there for future generations of americans to provide the sort of cuttingedge opportunity that will spell america at her best i look at that opportunity for not only battery manufacturing but nanotechnology and semiconductor signs chip manufacturing the newly designed 20th congressional district in new york that comprises a good portion of the now existing 21st district that i represent is probably one of the most technology investedin congressional districts in the country it is happening because there is this belief in the worker a belief in the entrepreneur a belief in the small business community a belief in the industrial context of the district and knowing full well that americas needsbe they for the environment or energys sake or business creation job creation business opportunityare inspiring this remarkable progress it requires our moving forward with a plan it requires our moving forward academically with the soundness of policy and with the corresponding resource advocacy that will yield lucrative dividends i see it all the time i see it in energyefficiency programs that produce jobs that enable us to capture waste heat that is part of the energy process enabling us to be much more efficient efforts that enable us to create more and more patents in a world that has grown much more competitive much more sophisticated we can ill afford to weaken in our attempts to be the kingmakers of the international economy the old american spirit the history of this nation replete with those rags to riches scenarios that became the reason and the inspiration for the compilation of journeys made by our ancestors to these shores because the opportunity called the american dream became the prize for which they searched i see it in my own roots the proudest label i carry in life is as the grandson of immigrants their journey gave me great opportunity and it gave my family great opportunity those journeys chased after the american dream we need beginning in this house chamber to reignite the american dream to go back to the core essence of who we are as a people to reach into that american heart and soul that has forever relied on its passion that we can achieve because we have opportunity and that we will not deny that opportunity that we will strengthen the boldness of those dreams and enable us to respond to the needs of the moments and the future and to write our legacy as a generation of americans let us not fail in that attempt let us continue to reach deep into that american spirit at a time when we were challenged and our economy was brought to its knees by failed policies that did not manage well that did not provide for the stewardship of our resources and when we tripped and fell let it be known that in the recovery we were stronger than ever before because of that belief that our best days lay ahead of us the belief that those best days were in the future we moved forward and we dug deep into that american spirit to respond with the respect for americas middle class our middle classall of us in that middle classhave always understood if you play hard if you abide by the rules if you roll up your sleeves and do your best you could rightfully anticipate the taste of success that is america in her most shining moments and that is an economy that we can produce it begins with the soundness of a strong and productive workforce that went through training and retraining that got to taste the potential for success by that self discovery that comes with education and to then understand our gifts so that we could share them in the most profound way and then to provide for the wellness of that workforce so it could be most productive so that the conditioning that came with that sort of commitment and that order of respect and that potion of dignity could then allow for us to speak to a nation that was humbled by its own beginnings where the rightful stories of so many who made it their journey were written by a nation that believed in her people so tonight on this eve of an attempt to repeal the affordable care act let us understand that our budget here in washington our actions with legislation our responsiveness to the needs of the american people are an establishment of our prioritiesa prescription of what we see our future to bea reaching into the heart to say that we are a truly caring lot thats what separates us from other nations it is the uniqueness of america and her greatness the affordable care act is a measurement of not only sound policy it is a statement of a compassionate society that understands its not about oneself that its about neighbors that its about community that its about the great society it has been the history through the decades through the vintages of time that has enabled us to reach to the greatness of our government to reach to the soundness of ideas and innovation to respond to the challenges that have enabled us to build upon those who preceded us always anticipating that the next generation would be made stronger we owe it to our children and grandchildren and generations yet unborn let them look at this moment in history american history knowing that america was challenged that she stepped up to the plate and said yes to her people and truly made a difference and allowed people to understand full well that the best days of this great nation lie ahead of us with that i

too many americans the recession is actually a depression yesterday the out of poverty caucus held a press conference with organizations working on the front lines with lowincome and poor people we

recognize linda lee and geraldine matthew these two extraordinary women are among a group of farmworkers who spent their lives working in the swampy fields bordering lake apopka in florida their backbreaking work helped to provide the bulk of the winter season produce on the eastern seaboard in the early 1990s a settlement was negotiated with the large farming corporations where 20 000 acres of land were sold for roughly 100 million a negligible amount of 200 000 was allocated for the 2 500 farmworkers and most were simply given pink slips despite decades of service on the farm for years these workers were exposed to a chemical mixture of carcinogens and other contaminants as planes cropdusted the fields now these workers are suffering from an array of diseases that have been linked to longterm pesticide exposure their children suffer from defects cause by prenatal exposure to harmful contaminants these women have worked for over a decade to bring attention to their cause while many of their former colleagues unfortunately have passed away although these women are desperately seeking some relief and good health what they ask for more than anything else is their dignity dignity is the contribution of their community to feeding this nation and the sacrifices they made in doing so i would therefore offer my profound and earnest gratitude to these incredible women to their community and to farmworkers across the country for theirs truly are the hands that feed us now more than ever we need to redouble our efforts to reward hard work we must work to be sure that

unemployment benefits thrown off kicked off the rolls some of them may be lucky enough to find work but far too many will be suddenly cut off with nearly nothing nothing to keep them from falling behind into poverty they will have been left out and left behind we may disagree on how to help families in need and workers who are struggling find work access needed health services or feed their children but we can all agree that leaving struggling families completely cut off of unemployment insurance with nowhere to turn for help is not the american way when republican politicians protect tax cuts for millionaires we must be very adamant about protecting the working poor when tea party republicans fight to protect tax writeoffs for corporations and big oil we must fight to protect hardworking americans when republican tea party members continued to expend their energy protecting the dividend gains on investments we must fight to protect linda lee and geraldine matthew women who have worked their entire lives and are left with nothing to show for it unfortunately there are some who continue to support policies for the 1 percent where profits rather than people matter we need

crisis at the root of all of this is a system of misguided priorities my republican colleagues have determined that in order to balance the budget we should prioritize cutting medicare medicaid and social security benefits instead of addressing what got us into this current deficita porous lopsided tax code designed to make the rich richer and two unnecessary wars one of which we continue to wage this bill does nothing to end the tax breaks we currently provide for millionaires and billionaires hedge fund managers and oil companies nor does it address runaway pentagon spending based on

little amnesia in this chamber today in january of 2009 we were losing 775 000 jobs a month then the obama administration and the democratic congress enacted remedial legislation and we stopped losing 775 000 jobs a month we started gaining we have gained a million and a half jobs in the private sector in the last year and a half not enough with a million and a half jobs but unfortunately state and local government had to lay off 1 2 million people because we didnt give them enough to prevent that but we did reverse the results of the bush policy of 8 years which was 775 000 jobs a month being lost dont forget in 2000 in the presidential election the great debate was what should we do about the 5 6 trillion surplus over the next 10 years bush got elected they enacted the bush tax cuts which they said would stimulate the economy and pay for themselves what happened we had the slowest economic recovery of any economic recovery after any recession in the history of the united states the only 8year period in which we did not gain one net new job even before the 2008 recession from which we are now recovering albeit too slowly the american people did not vote to kill remedial programs

effort to cut funding for the special supplemental nutritional program for women infants and children known as wic this program provides food for low and moderateincome mothers babies and children under 5 wic provides the food pregnant women need to help their babies grow after the baby is born wic provides the breast feeding support or infant formula to make sure the babies continue to develop and to grow and for young children wic provides staples like milk eggs bread fresh fruits and vegetables nearly 50 percent of the babies born in the united states each year rely on wic to get a healthy start to life but in this time of rampant unemployment the republicans opposethey oppose extended unemployment benefits and now want to ensure that the wives and children of the unemployed who dont get unemployment benefits cant get food and baby formula this bill says let them starve this bill will mean that 200 000 to 350 000 pregnant women and children will be denied food knocking these families out of the wic program is an aboutface on a 15year bipartisan commitment to ensure wic funds cover all eligible women infants and children who apply shockingly at the same time that the republicans are demanding that pregnant women and children starve they continue to promote tax holidays for millionaires and billionaires if we suspended the bush tax breaks to the wealthiest 1 percent of americans for just 1 week we could cover the cost of the republicans latest cut of 833 million to the wic program the debate over wic funding specifically and the federal budget generally is about priorities by supporting the republican proposal to slash wic funding forcing thousands of women and children from the rolls the republicans are saying that america prioritizes tax holidays for those who need it the least over providing food to pregnant women infants and small children mr chair make no mistake about it this is about literally taking food out of the mouths of babies this

their constitutional right to abortion services the unprecedented restrictions included in this bill would effectively end coverage of abortionrelated services beginning in 2014 women and their families receiving federal subsidies would be prohibited from purchasing a health plan that includes abortion coverage within the health exchanges this provision would leave millions of women without

since the republican caucus has taken over the majority they havent put one jobs bill on i mean they havent done a poor jobthey havent done anything it is as if they are not in favor of americans having jobs we know they are but they havent demonstrated it in anything they have done which is the important thing instead as part of the republican no jobs agenda they bring up a bill to cut 1 million jobs cut 1 million jobs from the american middle class these cuts are republican answers for the job crisis that they created cutting 1 million jobs if you are a nurse no jobs if you are a teacher no jobs if you are a firefighter or police officer no jobs if your jobs are from american manufacturing no jobs and if you are a small business person who is going to have any money to even go into your store no jobs for them either the list goes on and on if you want to know how we cut the deficit it is by putting america to work not by cutting social security make no mistake when the republicans say they are cutting costs they are cutting social security they are cutting medicare they are cutting medicaid until they cease to exist republicans want working americans to shoulder the whole burden the burden of a taxpayerfunded spending spree for the rich while protecting millionaires and billionaires who refuse to pay their fair share the republican answer to the crisis they created is you pay american people they must make you pay for big oils billion dollar subsidies they want to make you pay for higher drug prices they want to make you pay for taxes to start a small business they want to make you pay for ceo bonuses they want main street to take the hit while wall street gets a bonus while democrats work to create jobs reduce the deficit and rebuild america

an economic meltdown brought on by greed corruption and a total lack of regulation in the wall street derivatives market we are still dealing with the economic ramifications of that collapse today millions of jobs disappeared millions of homes foreclosed on millions of families are struggling every day to get by if that were not burdensome enough the same families are paying excessive prices at the pump right now because of dangerous oil speculation goldman sachs has found that unregulated speculation adds over 20 per barrel to the price of oil even exxons top executive recently conceded that the price of gas has been surging due to speculators who now make up nearly 70 percent of the market because of all the bad behavior by wall street we passed the doddfrank financial reform bill in the congress last year which would reintroduce transparency and accountability in commodities markets and protect the public from future malfeasance among these reforms was the strengthening of the commodities futures trading commission their ability to regulate derivatives and to prevent speculation in oil yet in this appropriations bill the majority is now trying to starve the cftc of the resources that it needs to do the job the decision helps wall street firms and big oil companies if it passes wall street can continue the risky manipulation of derivatives that brought on the last collapse big oil can continue to enjoy inflated profits every year due to artificially swollen oil prices the losers are americans families forced to pay more at the pump with this decision or worse eviscerating the cftc here the majority is setting up taxpayers to pay for yet another costly bailout of wall street the choices made in this legislation are reckless and disturbing more to do with ideology than basic economics yet it is part of a pattern by this majority under their watch gas prices reached an average of around 4 a gallon across the country up dramatically from the 2 78 national average in 2010 and yet they still rush to protect billions in oil company subsidies even as they cut the budget of the agency we know can do something about this speculation cftc has already made a difference earlier this year they charged five oil speculators with manipulating the price of crude netting them more 50 million even as oil prices climbed towards record highs of 147 a barrel

has perhaps eclipsed every other issue that has come before us in this halfyear period of time that related to our national debt and the anticipated expiration of our debt limit which will hit in just a couple weeks many americans are understandably concerned and have articulated the concern that if we pass the debt limit deadline of august 2 without raising the debt limit there could be catastrophic financial consequences in light of that i along with a number of my republican colleagues both in the senate and in the house have introduced legislation called the cut cap and balance act to address the debt limit to address it head on it says we will raise the debt limit if three conditions are met first that we make significant cuts to domestic discretionary spending for the fiscal year 2012 budget second we need statutory spending caps to put us on a smooth but steady glidepath toward balancing our budget sometime within the next decade third we need a balanced budget amendment passed out of congress and submitted to the states for ratification we think all three of these steps are necessarily required before we take the significant additional step of raising the debt limit because of the fact that it took us a long time to get to this point the point where by the end of the year we will have accumulated 15 trillion in debtabout 50 000 for every man woman and child in america between 120 000 and 150 000 for every wage earner in america this is a lot of moneybefore we extend that debt limit again by an additional 2 4 trillion we have to solve the problem we have to address the problem that led to its creation in a real lasting binding fundamental way that is why the most critical part of this legislation while each part is important happens to be found in that which rests upon the idea of a balanced budget amendment to the constitution we as members of congress could decide right now that over the next 10 years or 15 years it might be a good idea to cut spending by 2 trillion 3 trillion 4 trillion 5 trillion 6 trillion perhaps morebut if we made that promise today as a downpayment to the american people in exchange for the permission of the people to raise the debt limit it is a promise we cannot make good on because we cannot bind a future congress this congress was sworn in in january of 2011 elections will be held in november of 2012 and a new congress will be sworn in based on those elections in january 2013 the same thing will happen again in january 2015 and every 2 years after that for the duration of our republic the decisions we make right here right now can affect the here and now and can be binding for the here and now but we cannot reasonably expect and we cannot ask the american people when making a decision so longlasting and precedentsetting as this one to simply trust us that future congresses will see things the same way we do the only way we can bind a future congress is by amending our law of laws that 224yearold document painstakingly ironed out by some of the brightest men of the last several centuries in philadelphia 224 years ago when we amend the constitution we make it possible to bind a future congress that is what we need to do we have had some interesting debate and discussion surrounding this proposal last friday i listened with surprise and dismay as our president said we dont need to amend the constitution to require a balanced budget but we do need to balance our budget in the opinion of the president congress just needs to do its job not amend the constitution i think i understand his point i think he is suggesting that for congress to do its job it needs to balance its budget but i have to ask the question how has that worked out for us have past congresses balanced their budgets has the current congress balanced its budget overwhelmingly the answer is no it happens every now and then some would describe those instances where it has balanced in the last two or three decades as an accident others a momentary blip still others would suggest it was the product of accounting gimmickry rather than an actual act of budget balancing when that occurred regardless we know that balanced federal budgets are newsworthy indeed because they are very rare i look forward to the day when they are no longer newsworthy when they are customary and the only way to make them customary based on our experience as americans throughout most of our nations history is by amending the constitution to require it to make this a binding and permanent law i was shocked and dismayed again to learn that our senate majority leader senator reid from nevada stated just a few hours ago that he does not like this legislation he made some very disparaging comments about it notwithstanding the fact and completely ignoring the fact that this is not just the best legislation to address the debt limit issue right now it is the only legislation it is the only legislation that addresses this issue that is moving through congress and that has been reduced to legislative language it is certainly the only one that has been passed by one body of congress and is now moving over to the senate he is criticizing something when he himself has not offered anything this is the only show in town given how close we now are to the august 2 deadline and in part because we punted this so long and in part because we have not been having the debate and discussion in congress we should have been having for months this is it this is the only proposal if senator reid has suggestions on how we might change this proposal i am all ears i would love to hear what they are if he has his own proposal i would love to see what that is but simply to stand from that desk over there and disparage this legislation is inexcusable absolutely inexcusable given the fact that he has offered nothing let me read some of his words he said the american people should understand that this this meaning the cut cap and balance act is a bad piece of legislation perhaps some of the worst legislation in the history of this country i dont know what he is referring to he didnt give specifics nor has he given any specifics on what he would like to see in its place or how it could be improved my suggestion to our senate majority leader is if he has ideas please put them on the table because as we approach this debt limit deadline we are running out of time the clock has been ticking for 6 months we have known this was going to happen this is not news to us why then has there been so little debate and discussion in this body why is it that we spent weeks and weeks and weeks often dealing with legislation that paled in comparison to the importance of this issue the clock kept ticking and we kept debating and discussing other legislation far less important this in my opinion was a gross dereliction of duty but we still have a few weeks we can still deal with it we can still address it i suggest strongly that we address it by starting with that legislation that has actually been proposed and that we have full debate and discussion but no we are told even after the house of representatives earlier this week passed the cut cap and balance act passed it with bipartisan support by the wayno fewer than five members of the democratic caucus in the house of representatives voted to support this that was passed tuesday night we were told later we would be having a vote on saturday or perhaps monday then just a little while ago we were informed by the senate majority leader that the vote would be tomorrow giving us little or no time for actual debate and discussion on the floor of what is still to this moment the only legislation moving through to address this issue this is not an appropriate moment for demagoguery demagoguery on an issue this important can result in a lot of unnecessary pain no one disputes that there could be significant negative economic consequences associated with not raising the debt limit i do not dispute that not for a moment that is exactly why i put my neck on the line in order to file this legislation because nothing else was moving forward i didnt want to do it but when i was sworn in as a senator just a few months ago i understood it was my obligation to do what i could to make things better to make our constitutional system work so i filed it it is an insult not only to me and to my colleagues but to all americans when addressing an issue this important to have so little debate and discussion over this issue i find it appalling i find it reprehensible i demand an explanation and i demand an alternative solution if the senate majority leader is going to pick this apart and say he will not do it moreover i will remind the senate majority leader that just a few short years ago in 2006 when we had a different president belonging to a different party and this body was in control of another party if my memory serves me correctly not only did thensenator barack obama vote against raising the debt limit calling the need to do so the product of a failure of leadership that he was not willing to condone and perpetuate but every single one of his democratic colleagues joined him in that vote not one of them voted to raise the debt limit here we are again approaching the debt limit here we are again with only republicans stepping to the plate and offering a solution only this time the solution is a permanent one unfortunately in 2006 and prior and in subsequent debt limit extension votes there was no serious debate attached to it as to a permanent solution we have to amend the governing document the law of laws the only kind of law that can bind future congresses in order to solve this problem we have to do it now this is part of what it means to be an american we as americans crave liberty and we eschew tyranny to any degree every single time we authorize deficit spending we fuel the unfettered expansion of the federal government and all its power we commit ourselves and our posterity to a future that will include working more and more hours and days and weeks and even months just to pay their federal tax bills every single year that is time they will not get back that is time we will not get back that erodes our individual liberty it also erodes our liberty when the same regulatory structure that exists today grows bigger and bigger every year because we are borrowing now more than 1 5 trillion every single yearnot because of some aberrational condition some unusual development that requires an unusual expenditure of borrowed money but just to cover our basic daytoday operations this is what fuels the perpetual expansion of government and when government expands perpetually our individual liberty is diminished unfortunately and to a corresponding degree this is unacceptable but there is a way home the way home is found in limiting the role of government we can limit the role of government most effectively at this point in time i believe by limiting the pool of money to which congress has access the only way to do that is through a constitutional amendment i wish to close by addressing one final argument that sometimes has been used in response to and against the cut cap and balance act many of its detractors are making the claim that i find extraordinary a claim that says why are you even supporting this because it cant pass it is a little bit akin to saying why do we even play the super bowl when it is expected that one team is going to beat the other team we have to play but this one is not a game this one is for real when we vote after debating and discussing members of this body can and will be held accountable to our constituents so it will be up to me and each of my colleagues in this body to decide how to vote on this issue for those who make the unfortunate decision to vote against this notwithstanding the fact that 75 percent of the american people strongly support the idea of a balanced budget amendment notwithstanding the fact that 66 percent of americansboth of these figures according to a cnn poll todaysupport the principles underlying cut cap and balance notwithstanding the fact that this is the only permanent way of solving our debt problem if members of congress and members of this body choose to vote against this legislation they will do so i believe at their own peril they will have to face their constituents and explain why a handful of them were unwilling to raise the debt limit unwilling to address this problem unwilling to fix the perpetual deficit spending habit of congress simply because they did not want a balanced budget amendment to the constitution i think that is a tall order i think that is difficult to explain i think those who try to make that explanation to their constituents will do so at their own political peril but more importantly the vote they cast will be at the peril of the people of the united states of america of their liberty of their economic stability and of their ability to prosper now and in the future we can turn this ship around but in order do it we need robust debate and discussion and our constituents deserve more the american people deserve more than to have the kind of sleightofhand scheduling and the kind of dismissive cavalier attitude toward what is being characterized correctly by many as the fight of an entire generation we need to pass the cut cap and balance act it is not only the

congress appropriates vast amounts of money within broad funding categories and gives the executive branch the freedom to spend it with little oversight the constitutional obligation to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely lies with congress my legislation would require that all federal spending and loan guarantees over 100 million be explicitly approved by congress had my bill been law a year ago congress would have had to approve the 500 million loan guarantee to the now bankrupt solyndra and perhaps we could have stopped that from happening today however the only real vetting of programs like the solyndra loan happens after things have gone wrong and the money has been lost congress needs to reassert itself and ensure that all programs are properly vetted the old carpenters

regret the gentlemans amendment goes far beyond the point of balance and thus i must oppose it deficit reduction is the bills top priority and our bill already significantly reduces the energy efficiency and renewable energy account as written our bill cuts that account to 35 percent below current levels and 38 percent or nearly 900 million below the fiscal year 2000 budget request our bill cuts the excess and provides only enough funding to continue past commitments leaving little room left to cut while i support the intent of the gentlemans amendment as it aims to reduce further

california it says the emergency mortgage relief program which would have provided unemployed homeowners with low interest rate loans to assist them in paying their mortgage has been terminated if you are unemployed and concerned about not being able to pay your mortgage please contact your member of congress you see thats what is so confusing about the arguments by my colleagues on the other side they cant decide if this is a loan or a grantone time its a loan one time its a grantbut in fact the program says its a loan in fact hud the department of housing and urban development the title of their rule is emergency homeowners loan program the other reason i rise in opposition to this is that were terminating a program that has had zero customers so it seems ambiguous here to have the federal government go through a process here where were going to notify homeowners of a program that never was instituted never was used that it does not exist anymore that seems a little wasteful and i think in many ways could be misleading obviously when you look at the way that the program is structured it becomes a grant program and so were misrepresenting that in the sense that well it says its a loan but its really not a loan its a grant and so i think this is something that is one of the things that the american taxpayers are really kind of tired of is the government out there misrepresenting or creating confusion to homeowners that may be seeking assistance so i would just say that at this particular time this is not necessary and that we should not put a confusing piece

act of 2012 the house passed this legislation by voice vote in august and the senate recently passed a bill with amendment by unanimous consent h r 6029 will increase the maximum fines that may be imposed for engaging in the federal offense of economic espionage the crime of economic espionage consists of knowingly misappropriating trade secrets with the intent or knowledge that the offense will benefit a foreign government as reported by the unitedstates intellectual property enforcement coordinator economic espionage is a serious threat to american businesses by foreign governments economic espionage represents a significant cost to victim companies and threatens the economic security of the united states this crime inflicts costs on companies such as the loss of unique intellectual property the loss of expenditures related to research and development and the loss of future revenues and profits many companies are unaware when their sensitive data is pilfered and those that find out are often reluctant to report the losses fearing potential damage to their reputations with investors customers and employees the pace of the foreign collection of economic information and industrial espionage activities against major united states corporations is accelerating for example in fiscal year 2011 the justice department and the fbi saw an increase of 29 percent in economic espionage and trade secret theft investigations compared to those in fiscal year 2010 details related to recent federal investigations and prosecutions suggest that economic espionage and trade secret theft on behalf of companies located in china is an emerging trend for example at least 34 companies were reportedly victimized by a set of attacks originating in china in 2010 in the attacks computer viruses were spread via emails to corporate employees allowing the attackers to have access to emails and sensitive documents foreign hackers constantly target unitedstates companies in such ways in order to get every piece of competitive intelligence information they can we simply cannot allow this to continue to happen in response to this growing threat in
