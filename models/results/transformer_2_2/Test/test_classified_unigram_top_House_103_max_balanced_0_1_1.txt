patients full range of contraception and pregnancy options women who receive these vital services under title x are just as entitledto complete and accurate information about their health care options as are beneficiaries in private health plans passage of this bill will guarantee the end of the previous administrations attempts to impose censorship on poor womens medical care options threatening the health of lowincome women and their families in addition to reproductive health services and family planning counseling title x clinics also often provide access for many women to preventive health care services such as screening for breast and cervical cancer diabetes and high blood pressure these comprehensive medical services are costeffective investments to preserve our nations health

around the observation of the 1965 voting rights act and to associate myself with the remarks that have been made i want to speak very briefly but no less sincere than those who have gone to great length the 1965 voting rights act is 29 years old this week this landmark legislation upheld the right for every american to vote regardless of their race a very fundamental right that all americans will have a right to participate in this great democracy and that participation meant that they could participate as a part of the electorate and they also could participate as an elected leader representation representative government that would allow anyone in america without regard to race to also be an elected official it is harder to be understood than the right to vote the question needs to be asked again today was the 1965 voting rights act needed then is it needed in 1994 one can say now that most people vote without any violation of their voting rights perhaps there are still some instances where individuals are still harassed or go to undue lengths before they can vote let me just remind you however that the 1965 voting rights act gave two rights the right for an individual to participate as a part of the electorate and also the right to be elected as an elected leader representative government the 1965 voting rights act does indeed have authority and it has authority in my own district i have 20 different counties within my district the largest congressional district in north carolina and of those 28 counties 22 of them 22 of them are covered by section 5 of the 1965 voting rights act simply because there is a prior history of voting rights violations yet the voting rights act indeed has meant the difference for my citizens in my district to insure them that they have every opportunity to participate and vote their constitutional rights as anyone else has but i am also very very troubled by the fact that we do not seem to understand that representative government is also a provision under this particular act the majority minority districts are now under a lot of judicial and equitable scrutiny socalled under the fair doctrine this must stop not because fair doctrine and judicial process should not go on but the disguise the disguise that we pretend that we are wantfng an equitable system it is fair and only fair that all the citizens be able to be a part of the leadership as much as part of the electorate it is equally as fair for blacks to elect other members as it is for all citizens to elect a black member fair representation simply means choosing the best person to represent you in my district i am happy to say that as of tuesday of this week the 1965 act was reaffirmed the new york times in their editorial this morning i think made a great statement they said only a year ago the supreme court seemed ready to nullify or at least cripple the voting rights act of 1965 the court found that two oddly shaped congressional districts in north carolina drawn to give blacks a fair chance not a guarantee they said a fair chance to elect representatives of their choice smacked of apartheid however it said that the districts could stand only if the states justified them under district scrutiny in a fullscale trial well that fullscale trial did occur for four consecutive months and as a result of that scrutiny they found that the 1965 voting rights act did apply and they upheld those districts now i am particularly interested in seeing that the supreme court clarify clarify without ambiguity that indeed the 1965 voting rights act guarantees individuals the opportunity to participate as an electorate and also guarantees the opportunity for any american to be a participant as an elected official this process must be clarified yet there are 5 states now that are challenged but tomorrow there indeed may be 15 there are 40 minority representatives in this congres however only three of them come from nonmajority minority districts so if this challenge is not put into the perspective of the guarantees that are given for the opportunity all americans may find that democracy is really a fleeting ambition and a goal it was george white who said in 1901 that i may go but there will be those who will come after me phoenixlike well in 1992 phoenixlike afroamercans came from all over the country

state to my colleagues once again my belief that the foreign policy activities of this nation taken by our government on behalf of its citizens should and is for the most part done in the open i believe it is wrong however that an arm of our government is given the authority to conduct operations other than intelligence gathering in support of foreign policy goals that are unknown to our citizens the people of the united states have a right to be engaged in the debate which yields our foreign policy activities i do not here refer to the important maintenance of operational secrecy but rather to the need to debate in the open whether and when we would engage in hostile operations against another country in this context my concern lies not specifically the overall budget level for intelligence although i believe that prudent savings in the intelligence budget can be realized with careful planning and a recognition of the many new and open ways in which information flows to policymakers additionally it is the right of the people of our country to know the funding level of its intelligence agencies i will continue to support legislative efforts that would bring these aspects into the sunshine my second objection to the report is concemed more with what has become ablurred relationship between the national foreign intelligence or nfip programs and tactical intelligence and related activities or tiara programs i think it is time we substantially change this arrangement i am disappointed and concerned that the conferees have increased the authorization for nfip above the budget request while authorizing a corresponding decrease in tiara programs this action is contrary to actions taken by the conferees on the fiscal year 1995 defense authorization and appropriations acts and contrary to agreements reached between the secretary of defense and the director of central intelligence resulting from their joint review of nfip and tiara programs we should be focusing on the interoperability of capabilities in support of military operations ensuring essential improvements for imagery support as well as developing a new unitedstates intelligence program and budget structure to better reflect user needs and priorities consistent with our changed strategic environment the blurring of national versus tactical intelligence was highlighted last year when the committee raised concern in its report on the fiscal year 1994 defense authorization bill the committee then observed that over the years the boundaries between tiara and nfip components of the intelligence budgets have become a source of confusion and contention the committee was and continues to be concerned that the lack of clearly established definitions for nfip and tiara have led to the sometimes arbitrary assignment of intelligence programs and functions within these categories as a consequence the armed services committee called on the secretary of defense and the director of central intelligence to review intelligence programs and activities and provide to congress a report identifying those programs which support first primarily national purposes second primarily defensewide theater activities and the unified command or three primarily a single service or agency the report was also to have identified those programs and activities that should no longer be included in the intelligence budget although we have seen fragments and or bits and pieces of what appears to be a concerted effort to address this matter a formal comprehensive report has yet to be provided an important review was undertaken by the department earlier this year to determine what if any programs or activities should be removed from tiara this effort was undertaken in response to the fiscal year 1994 house armed services committee language asking the department to identify programs and activities that should no longer be included in the intelligence budget as a result the department determined that indeed there were certain programs that fell outside the definition of tiara used by the congress and has subsequently proposed to delete these activities from the fiscal year 1996 tiara congressional justification book these programs include for example ballistic missile defense the defense meteorological support program tanker support to reconnaissance and the navys mapping charting and geodesy to name a few when added up funding for these programs totaled more than a half a billion dollars in each of fiscal year 1994 and further earlier this year

amendment the gentleman from maryland has made the money argument for why this amendment should not pass as was mentioned the cut would take us even below what we were at last year i think there is another aspect of this argument we need to consider as well we are reaching a point in our history that our streets are becoming very very dangerous i think we need to take a look at the role that atf plays in making it a safer place for all of us to live the atf itself is a very laborintensive agency in fact about 75 percent of its resources goes to salary and other personnelrelated accounts so a cut in atfs appropriation means a cut in people that means people come off the street whol are out there to protect our citizens the atf also has the best ratio of dollars collected to dollars expended in the federal government at atp we spend about 38 cents and we collect about 100 in revenue that is a pretty decent return on our federal investment also we find that atf is on the front line in the fight against violent crime and terrorism as members recall an atf agent cracked the bomb case at the world trade center in new york we also lost four agents lives in the shootout at waco atf goes after the most vicious and the most violent criminals in our society they work extremely close with state and local offices where we have what is known as the achilles task force which was established by the subcommittee and it is the most successful antigang and drug task force in law enforcement history again i appreciate the efforts of our colleagues in trying to find some areas to save some dollars but i think in this particular case we are in essence shooting ourselves in the foot because the money that goes into atf as i mentioned results in added collections and hopefully it

in rockville md is a national pioneer in developing and applying early intervention techniques to diagnose and treat emotional and developmental problems in young children from birth to 8 years of age the centers emphasis on early intervention focuses on identifying and treating emotional and developmental problems in the earliest years of life before such problems become entrenched more difficult for the families and more costly to treat this approach is an important model to consider as we wrestle with health care reform legislation this year as the lourie center celebrates its 10th anniversary it already has been recognized as a leader in its field tipper gore has praised the center for its innovative role in the treatment of children with emotional and developmental difficulties mrs gore who was the recipient of a special award from the center for her work on childrens mental health issues stated that the center has enormous import for the mental health of this nations children and families in addition distinguished opera star beverly sills a mother of two children with birth defects has praised the lourie center for easing the burden of children and their families through early intervention in diagnosis and treatment ms sills was the featured speaker at the centers 10th anniversary dinner the lourie center serves families from all income levels and without regard to their ability to pay the centers clients include young children who have withdrawn from the world around them children in foster care who are insecure in their setting children who have been abused and neglected children who are angry anxious or fearful and who cant get along in day care or primary school the center also serves as a link between such children and parents who are often depressed and despairing parents who need support and education in order to be better parents the center is named for the late dr reginald lourie a distinguished child psychiatrist who cofounded the agency in the early 1980s he and his colleagues won a grant from the national institute of mental health to test the proposition that it is feasible to diagnose and to treat emotional and developmental problems in very young children even infants the lourie center evolved from that 6year nimh clinical research project which demonstrated the value of early intervention services in helping young children and their families get an emotionally healthy start in life now 10 years later the center has an interdisciplinary staff of 40 professionals and serves 400 washington area children and their familiesevery year in addition the centers staff engages in a wide variety of research activities and provides early intervention training for hundreds of health and mental health

having this special order this evening i am so pleased to join the gentleman from michigan mr boniori who has taken a leadership position on tbi issue and my colleague from xasaohusetts mr meehmj who has spoken eloquently tonight on the diffloulties of our health care system our nation as we talked about and have talked about for several weeks does have a national health care crisis there is no question every individual knows that is the case one of the facts that in my view cannot be repeated often enough is that amenicans spend more than 800 billion on health care that is what they spent last year and it is going to be more this year with that we see health care costs that are continually rising and the numbers of uninsured continue to grow i think that we need to applaud the president for taking on the health crisis and making health care a central focus and a central project of his presidency the final details are now being hammered onut in his proposal several weeks ago in this body and i will repeat it has been mentioned here tonight that there are six principles on which this health care proposal is founded security of coverage simplicity of administration savings in costs choice among health care plans and physicians qualty of care and individual and corporate responsibility for making that system work it has been what 50 or 60 years since anyone has had the courage any president has had the courage to take on the issue others have tried they have started it and let it go because in fact it is complicated it i complex but that should not deter us and it clearly has not deterred president clinton i would like to address a couple of these principles tonight if i might one is savings in costs and the second is security of coverage childbirth braces for children and operations to remove a ruptured appendiz these are not unusual medical procedures families face these kinds of issues every single day but these every day kinds of medical bis like those that i have mentioned become a crippling financial burden for too many american families if yau ae not adequately covered even nonemergency procedures can be a family crisis even worne millions of

working diligently to eliminate those schools since 1989 over 20 percent of those flybynightschools have been closed can we do it better i think even the chairman would agree yes we can all we are asking for is to wait until the end of this year when the gentleman from michigan retires to resolve the situation the formula the means in which to calculate this is so monumental that we are going to close a lot of good schools i do not have the primary schools in my district they are down in south bay but i have been to 11 of those that are performing very very well what are those schools a couple of them are beautician schools and cosmetology schools i wanted to tell you they are very effective by law they are required to spend extra time in service at the school for practical application and who do they help they help the very very poor because they practice on someone that cannot afford to get a haircut the gentlewoman would know this i would invite the gentlewoman to

you take a look at those that drop out that do not finish a college education with a skill that they can use in later life it is a much higher percentage than those that finish college so we need to educate and provide basic education for schools without some of these schools that will not happen we need schools and trade schools for women this fills that there is very little of those in existence today the department regulationis applied retroactively and includes language which prohibits institutions from counting all viable revenue in the formula itself it is monumental we are going to close a great majority of our good schools that is going to equate to 1 2 million children that will not have vocational education training that is why i oppose the amendment if the current regulation is implemented over 50 percent of these quality proprietary institutions of higher education ip the nation will be forced to close their doors i take a look at what we need to do in
