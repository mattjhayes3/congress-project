district showed a definitive difference in the amount of monies paid by senior citizens for prescription drugs it was higher in the 18th congressional district in houston than in canada and in mexico we find that those who are 85 years old 40 percent of them do not even have the ability to pay for any drugs they have no benefit whatsoever and we must realize that seniors are living longer we also find that seniors are paying twice as much for their prescription drugs if they are medicare beneficiaries and they do not have that provision and so they are buying onethird less drugs what does that mean it means sicker seniors that is what it means these are individuals who have worked hard in our communities then we find the cost of our prescription drugs the amount of money our seniors pay is far more than any other health need that they have and this i would say to my colleagues begs for us to have a prescription drug benefit under the medicare provisions i do not know why it is so difficult this is something we should support i cannot go home and tell my seniors in the 18th congressional district that in the united states of america they cannot have a drug benefit but yet in mexico and canada prescription drugs are cheaper i would say it is time now to support this motion to instruct today i rise in support of the spratt motion to instruct the conferees on the budget resolution the spraft motion sets the stage for enacting a medicare prescription drug benefit or other legislation to improve medicare before the reporting date for a tax cut reconciliation bill by setting september 22 as the date for reporting a tax cut bill protected by reconciliation furthermore the spratt motion recedes to the senates slightly smaller tax cut and also recede to the senate by dropping the reserve fund language in the housepassed resolution that provides for an additional 50 billion in tax cuts while the republicans propose large tax cuts over the next 5 years and reconcile the finance and ways and means committees to report legislation republicans do not show the 10year cost of this tax cut which could be as large as the 792 billion that the republicans proposed and the american people rejected in 1999 moreover the republicans do not intend to strengthen or support medicare due to the fact that there are no reconciliation instructions to require legislation that would actually use the 40 billion reserve earmarked in the budget resolution in addition the republicans have cut nondefense appropriations while defense significantly increased for the third consecutive year republicans have chosen to provide large tax breaks for the wealthy this budget resolution provides at least 200 billion in tax breaks over the next 5 years for the financial elite of america furthermore this resolution is a major down payment for george w bushs proposed trilliondollar tax scheme i will not stand by while our childrens future is bankrupted to fund this irresponsible budget resolution this budget contains deep cuts in domestic spending by 114 billion over the next 5 years fails to provide anything to strengthen social security or medicare cuts nondefense discretionary spending by 19 7 billion in 2001 and 138 billion over the next 5 years below the level needed to maintain purchasing power after adjusting for inflation and pretends to reserve 40 billion for a medicare prescription drug benefit contingent upon essentially turning medicare into a voucher program republicans have used slight of hand to hide the facts of their irresponsible budget by showing the effects of proposed tax cuts for only the first 5 years and not the full 10year projections commonly used during the last 4 years i am disappointed in the budget resolution because i do not believe that it provides adequate investment in our nations future americas future depends on that of her young people in providing them adequate resources and opportunities to become our future leaders including providing them education and ac cess to adequate health care the budget resolution provides inadequate resources for the education of our young people i firmly believe that we must focus our attention and our energy on one of the most important challenges facing our country todayrevitalizing our education system strengthening education must be a top priority to raise the standard of living among american families and to prolong this era of american economic expansion education will prepare our nation for the challenges of the 21st century and i will fight to ensure that the necessary programs are adequately funded to ensure our childrens success we must provide our children access to superior education at all ages from kindergarten to graduate school recent studies emphasize the importance of quality education early in a childs future development and yet despite these studies the budget resolution still inadequately funds programs that would provide for programs targeting children in their younger years in addition we need to open the door of educational opportunity to all american children it is well known that increases in income are related to educational attainment the democratic budget alternative rejects the republican freeze on education funding and allocates 4 8 billion more for education for fiscal year 2001 than the republican budget over 5 years the democratic party demonstrates its commitment to education by proposing 21 billion more than the republican budget resolution the congressional black caucus offered an amendnient in the nature of a substitute that promised to invest for the future of our nation the cbc substitute is a budget that maximizes investment and opportunity for the poor africanamericans and other minorities this budget for maximum investment and opportunity supports a moderate plan to pay down the national debt protects social security and makes significant investments in education and training the cbc budget requests 88 8 billion in fiscal year 2001 for education training and development this is 32 billion more than the republican budget provides the cbc substitute proposed a 10 billion increase over the presidents budget for school construction other projected increases include additional funding for head start summer youth employment trio programs historically black colleges and universities and community technology centers in an age of unprecedented wealth the cbc has the vision to invest in the american family and not squander opportunities afforded by a budget surplus i will not support the failed policies of the past senator mccain has best characterized this budget resolution as one that is fiscally irresponsible i support a budget that invest strengthening social security provides an affordable prescription drug benefit for all seniors helps communities improve public education with quality teachers smaller

percent are latinos or hispanics of all children under the age of 13 years old 60 8 percent are african americans and 19 5 percent are hispanic you can see this very devastating disease has impacted the minority women and children tremendously with this being the leading cause of death among african american women ages 25 to 44 right in those reproductive years we can ill afford to let this

population these percentages signal an alarming and inhumane quandary for all americans we the members of congress are in a position to impact the lives of americas families struggling to lead healthy

need to obtain hiv testing and the clarification of rampant myths associated with the disease that for so long has been exclusively associated with homosexual white males now hiv as i have just read to you is devastating domestically but this disease is also devastating africa by large numbers presently there are nearly 23 million adults and children living with hiv aids on that great continent according to unesco aids is now africas leading cause of death please hear me and those in the outer communities it is the leading cause of death here domestically among african american women ages 25 to 44 and it is the leading cause of death on the continent of africa with prevalence rates reaching 25 percent of all adults in some countries the epidemic is decimating the pool of skilled workers

opportunity to work with them on a number of pieces of legislation even though i do not sit on the committee and both the full and subcommittee chair and ranking members have always been helpful if a

restore all of our national estuaries including galveston bay which borders my district in texas galveston bay produces twothirds of texas oyster harvest onethird of texas bay shrimp catch and onequarter of texas blue crab catch galveston bays watershed is heavily industrialized and densely populated since the 1950s 30 000 acres of wetlands have been lost in this estuary wastewater discharges into galveston bay account for half of texas total wastewater discharges every year like many of americas beloved bays and estuaries the productivity of galveston bay has declined local community response however which is necessary is facilitated by this act the report authorizes 275 million over 5 years in a matching grant for locally developed estuary habitat restoration projects the goal of this money is the restoration of a million acres of estuary over the next 10 years only with our help will estuaries continue producing food water quality employment and recreation benefits along americas coastlines i am also pleased that the conference report authorizes an additional 175 million for the national estuary program these funds will be used to develop and implement comprehensive programs in estuaries of national significance including galveston bay as proof of the ability of local communities and organizations to take on estuary restoration i would like to share this about galveston bay the galveston bay foundation was created under the national estuary program and they have undertaken the ambitious program of restoring 24 000 of the 30 000 estuary acres lost habitat acres lost in galveston bay assisted by the national estuary program the foundation also monitors water quality by training volunteers in distributing monitoring equipment in addition i would add that the galveston bay foundation has been the catalyst for developing an environmentally sensitive approach to the deepening and widening of the houston ship channel which was authorized under wrda 1996 bill so i think from galveston bay and this is true with the other bays around the nation the galveston bay foundation has proved that the national estuary program works and that the

considerations went into this bill this is a bad bill compared to the presidents budget it would cut 2 9 billion from education services cut 1 7 billion from labor with cuts to workforce development and safety investments and cut more than 1 billion from critical health programs this is a bad bill also because it eliminates and cuts services for americas senior citizens and their families and why

above investments to promote americas education workforce and health services their 175 billion tax cut exceeds the projected budget surplus and requires deep cuts in nondefense discretionary appropriations the result was a republicandesigned budget resolution that was so bad that even the republican chairman of this subcommittee opposed it and soon we will be voting on a measure to repeal the estate tax within 24 hours we will be cutting education and we will be repealing the estate tax how could that be a proper statement of our national priorities repealing the estate tax will

buildings service which really has the control over the law enforcement did not take that with great regard as evidenced by the statement of my friend from that which occurred up there in cleveland so

repeat numbers facts and figures but truly what we are trying to emphasize that these are just not facts and figures but real people the 2000 census is just around the corner and if we do not stop the partisan rhetoric which has clouded this issue for far too long we will once again keep millions of americans from having a voice as chair of the census and civil rights task force for the hispanic caucus and cochair of the census task force for the democratic caucus i am committed to achieving a fair and accurate census the impact of a fair and accurate census will be felt across the nation in every community and in the lives of every american the information gathered in the census is utilized in many ways it is used by states and local governments to plan schools and highways by the federal government to distribute funds for health care and countless other programs it is used by businesses in creating their own economic plans our last census in 1990 was the first time in history that the count was less accurate than the one before in 1990 more than 8 million americans were not counted and more than 4 million were counted twice in texas as already indicated over 500 000 were not counted in my own home city of san antonio as referredto earlier 40 000 were not counted in a report released by the general accounting office this past week it is reported that 22 of the 25 large formula grant programs use census data as part of their allocation formula those 25 formula grant programs distribute approximately 166 billion in federal funds to the states the 22 formula grant programs that utilize census data account for 97 percent of the total that is 161 billion these are federal tax dollars that citizens across the nation have paid federal dollars that should come back to the community in the form of improved infrastructure better neighborhood schools health care for the poor and the elderly local economic development and much more in my state of texas where over 500 000 were not counted it is estimated that we lost close to 1 billion in federal funding over the past 10 years we were second only to california in the harm caused by an inaccurate count this astronomical loss of funding breaks down to 1 992 per missed person it is estimated that if we utilize the same inaccurate enumeration methods for the 2000 census texas will stand to lose 2 18 billion in federal funds we must realize that this is not a political issue this is an economic issue it is an education issue it is an infrastructure issue and most importantly it is about fairness it is about time that we stop the partisan rhetoric and choose people over party politics every person in this nation counts and every american deserves to be counted it is important to point out exactly who was missed in the 1990 census it is really no surprise because the very people who were not counted in the last census are those communities who are typically overlooked of the 8 million americans not counted minorities children and the poor were disproportionately represented nationally 5 percent of hispanics 4 4 percent of african americans 2 3 percent of asian and pacific islanders and over 12 percent of native americans living on reservations were undercounted in texas the net undercount from the 1990 census was 2 8 percent almost twice as high than the national average of 1 6 percent the percentage of hispanics and children missed in texas were all greater than the national average of the 500 000 texans missed over half were of hispanic origin statewide 3 9 percent of african americans 2 6 percent of asian and pacific islanders and 2 8 percent of native americans were undercounted while missing or miscounting people is a problem for the census the fact that particular groups children the poor people of color city dwellers and renters were missed more often than others produced census data that underrepresented these particular groups each of us should be outraged by these types of inaccuracies the census bureau and other experts have told us that the most accurate census can be obtained by utilizing modern and proven scientific statistical methods these are proven methods proven to be the most accurate system to obtain the census now we know that the constitution calls for an enumeration i agree we should try to count as many people as we possibly can i also realize the obstacles that face us if we rely on this head count alone today society is highly mobile most households are twoincome families there are language barriers and there are people who have a distrust of government these are just some of the obstacles facing us if we choose to continue to employ a head count system alone proven scientific statistical methods can overcome these obstacles and will give us the more accurate count over and above the accuracy we know that this system is cheaper than the actual head count the supreme court recently ruled that these scientific methods can only be used for redistricting and distribution of federal funds and that a head count must be done for the purpose of apportionment if we know we can get the most accurate census through these methods and that they will save us money we must utilize them the gentlewoman from new york who just preceded me has introduced legislation that will amend the census act so that scientifically proven statistical methods can be used for every purpose of the census apportionment redistricting and distribution of federal dollars i believe in this bill and urge all of my colleagues to support

give respect and credence to a collective group of individuals who have sought only to see a return on their tax dollars and to match the work that has gone on in washington d c that has moved people

of a 200 billion budget surplus that is the wrong message to send to the american people about the importance of civil rights this amendment can fix this by fully funding the division with an additional 11 8 million now in the past few years the civil rights division has been more important than ever in pursuing criminal civil rights abuses the nation has experienced the horrors of the torture and deaths of matthew shepard and james byrd and the murder of a reproductive health care provider dr bernard slepian more recently four new york city police officers killed amadou diallo an unarmed immigrant in the lobby of an apartment building and another four officers brutally assaulted abner louima these are just a few of the cases that the division is reviewing the federal bureau of investigation stated that there are 10 461 law enforcement agencies across the united states reporting a staggering total of 8 049 hate crimes in 1998 alone these are conservative numbers though because the truth is many hate crimes go unreported because the victims fear retaliation and many police departments just do not collect such data now while law enforcement offices and agencies pursue the bulk of the offenders the justice department must train those agencies and prosecute those offenders the local officials car not with added funding the civi rights division can hire five just fiv more lawyers and assure that many c these perpetrators are brought to juc tice three prominent civil rights groupe the naacp the aclu and the na tional asian pacific american lega consortium have pointed out in a let ter to the house that one of the mos pressing issues for many americans i that of police misconduct the department has investigated th police departments of washington d c new york city new orleans and lo angeles and many others for numer ous offenses including excessive force prior investigations have led to con sent decrees with local police depart ments including steubenville ohio and pittsburgh pennsylvania foi using excessive force and impropei searches in december 1988 thejustice depart ment was conducting six public inves tigations with eight attorney throughout the country and in december 1999 the department was inves tigating at least 12police department with just the same number of attorneys as the previous year we cannot expect the department tc increase its workload in this mannei without adding additional resources andso this amendment would permit the division to hire three muchneeded attorneys to prosecute police misconduct and so my colleagues i urge my colleagues to support the serranoconyers amendment it adds modest funding to the civil rights division all to oftenthe majority gives our nations civil rightslaws mere lip serviceoffering us civil rights on the cheap the budget before us today confirms my worst fears if you look at the actual evidence in critical areas such as hate crimes police misconduct employment and housing you will see that there is overwhelming evidence of ongoing discrimination in our society yet the budget actually under funds the critical civil rights division to the tune of 11 million consider the problem in hate crimes our nation has only recently began the healing process in the aftermath of the tortures and deaths of james byrd jr and matthew shepard in laramie wyoming in the years 1991 through 1997 there were more than 50 000 hate crimes reported 1 this is why the conyersserrano amendment would allow the division to hire five new attorneys to help prosecute hate crimes and other civil rights crimes the incidence of police misconduct toward minorities is also growing dramatically in pittsburgh a police officer shot to death a black motorist who had slowed down and peered through his side window while observing a drug arrest in riverside california a 19yearold black woman was shot to death by a policeman in her car at agas station and we all know thatamadou diallo a west african immigrant was shot 41 times in the vestibule of his bronx apartment by four police officers at a time when the civil rights division is on the verge of being totally overwhelmed i our amendment would also allow the division il to retain three additional attorneys to fighl against police pattern and practice misof conduct the problem with regard to employment and housing discrimination is no better the number of employment discrimination cases in federal courts has almost tripled between 1 1990 and 1998 from 8 413 complaints to 1 23 735 the bipartisan glass ceiling commist sion recently found that 95 percent of top cors porate jobs in america are held by white males with africanamericans holding less e than 1 percent of top management jobs and i women holding 35 percentof senior level pos sitions just recently we learned of outrageous discriminatory conduct at texaco corp in cluding tapes of top management officials re ferring to africanamerican workers as black jelly beans in terms of housing tester programs by the r urban institute and others confirm that whites r are far more likely to be shown apartment and other rental units than similarly situated minori ties and it was only a few years ago that an elderly africanamerican man was literally s chased out of his apartment in vidor texas after he had moved there pursuant to a fed eral court order requiring that the allwhite housing complex in that city be desegregated this is why our amendment provides the funds to hire 13 additional civil rights attorneys r i believe this is the most

time of the house for something that should be settled in houston texas but i rise and feel the need to rise to explain what is going on here i have been involved in mobility around houston for 20 years i have been involved in the regional mobility plan and in developing that plan in the 1980s that we are now finishing i am very proud of the fact that the city of houston as my colleague says the fourth largest city in the country just does not do things like everybody else does we are a major city and a great city in this country because we do not just do it the same way we are the city that built the astrodome we are the city that has a port that is off the shores of texas and the second largest port in the nation we are a city that does not say that they are not a great city unless they have rail and the reason is and i might point out to my colleagues if they had been involved in all the rail systems as i have and the chairman has for over 15 years they would understand why l a is getting out of the rail business because it is a boondoggle and a black hole for a city that is spread out like l a i might say that houston has stepped outside of the box and developed a regional bus plan that is the model for major cities in america this bill has over 20 million in it finishing the last part of 500 million in building one of the best bus systems in the world because we did not grab ahold of the notion that in order to be a great city they have to have a rail system every line that the gentleman from texas talked about every one of those lines loses huge amounts of money and takes money away from mobility systems for those cities but they do get to take a picture of a nice train and put it in their brochures and it makes everybody feel good the problem here in this particular dispute is that the houston metro following the design of many other cities and the gentleman says no elections were held in those other cities it is because the other cities did not pay attention to the voters in those cities and developed the same strategy that is going on here in houston they developed the strategy of starting a little starter line and when it does not make money and becomes a huge hole for transit funds they go to the people and say we made this great investment but it does not work only because we do not have this other line and when that does not work they say well we are just going to build another line and then they wake up and develop what dallas now has dallas now has a rail line but now has surpassed houston in congestion because dallas is more concentrated on rail than they are for the mobility in dallas i do not want to see that happen in houston it is my responsibility as a member of this committee to make sure that the full funding grant by the fta the 500 million is finished what houston metro wanted to do is take money from the regional bus plan from our regional mobility plan and move it to a rail line that makes no sense whatsoever transportationwise my good colleague and friend the gentlewoman from texas says no criticism there is all kinds of criticism including houston metros own study that says this does not help mobility this does not help transportation and this does not help the environment this is an economic development project to build a signature main street in houston texas a very worthwhile project but this is not a transit system this will not carry anybody this will not get anybody off our freeways this will not get bubba i say to the gentleman from texas out of his pickup and put him on a rail system this is an economic development project my position is if they are going to build a huge rail system in the houston region then the people of the houston region ought to vote on it and decide whether they want a rail system or not instead of doing the back doorway that was done in dallas that was done in portland that was done in miami that was done in many other cities that i described there is no transit benefit here major transportation decisions like the proposal to build this system in houston should be decided by the whole community as things stand today houstonians cannot make an informed decision because metro does not have a comprehensive light rail system to take to the voters the people of houston cannot make an informed decision about what the role of this

international law including torture murder and kidnapping the united states is believed to house records that would corroborate the charges against gen pinochet those records should be reviewed

hundreds of political prisoners still being jailed and torturedkissinger told pinochet that the ford administration would not hold those human rights violations against him at a time when pinochet was the target of international censure for statesponsored torture disappearances and murders kissinger assured him that he was a victim of communist propaganda and urged him not to pay too much attention

victim of all left wing groups around the world and that your greatest sin was that you overthrew a government which was going communist kissinger decided that the international fight against communism justified the rape and torture of chilean women justified their mutilation justified their execution more than 20 years later new information about the unitedstates role in the coup and unitedstates knowledge about human rights violations by pinochet are still coming to light clearly there is more information that is housed in the intelligence communities warehouses and that

nearly all of the many dairy producing regions in this country 45 out of the 50 states as my colleague the gentleman from vermont pointed out this debate is very simple do you support a balanced program that is responsive to all regions of the country or do you seek to pull the rug out from under the farmers in those 45 states let me repeat 45 states lose money under theusda plan the federal dairy program is a reasonable industryfunded safety net that ensures fair treatment of farmers throughout the country even in the upper midwest that is why farmers by over 90 percent voted in support of the system we have an obligation to ensure that it is preserved the dairy program may be complex and many members will claim they do not understand it but my colleagues should know that their farmers understand very well the impacts these policies have on their livelihoods they know without passage of 1402 the dairy industry will become a monopolized disaster unfair to consumers and farmers i urge strong support for this rule and support for 1402"], [0.0007514357566833496, 0.49924856424331665, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume this motion asks the conferees to go
