course and making sure that we are here really speaking truth to power each and every week on behalf of the black caucus also to you congressman don payne thank you very much for your leadership and for really rising to the occasion on so many issues in the very short time that you have been here you have hit the ground running and really have made a tremendous difference i want to just speak for a few minutes as it relates to the review of the congressional black caucus for the last year or 2 years i have to just say that our leader mr butterfield has been a very bold and tremendous leader we have accomplished quite a bit and we have a lot more to do while 2015 has been very challenging i believe that the congressional black caucus has really stepped up and made a huge difference not only for the african american community and communities of color but for the entire country it has also been an inspiring year we have seen the birth and growth of the vital black lives matter movement we have also witnessed powerful and moving protests across the country in places like missouri new york and even in my district in oakland and in berkeley california with people of all backgrounds and ages coming together to demand justice to petition their government to exercise their democratic rights i am so proud of the young activists who are standing up and demanding an end to racism and injustice in many of our communities they are truly bringing the civil rights movement into the 21st century i want them to know that they have allies here in the peoples house for too long congress has ignored or brushed aside issues affecting the african american community and other communities of color it is past time that everyone steps up and does the good work that we were sent to washington to do that the congressional black caucus has done for many many decades we need to start by talking about and looking at what has happened with the voting rights act as you know this year marks the 50th anniversary of this landmark legislation the voting rights act was gutted by the supreme court in its shelby v holder decision and of course republican state legislators have fallen all over to restrict voting rights across the country everywhere these dangerous restrictions come in the form of voter id requirements elimination of sameday voter registration and really severe reduction in early voting efforts we must call these efforts for what they are republican attempts to take away one of our most fundamental rights but we will not let this happen i am so proud of the congressional black caucuscongresswoman terri sewell and john lewis and mr clyburn the entire congressional black caucus our bill h r 2867 the voting rights advancement act sponsored by congresswoman sewell who represents selma alabama would restore the preclearance provisions of the voting rights act for any state that has had 15 or more voting rights violations in the last 25 years in the preclearance process as dr king once said give us the ballot and we will fill our legislative halls with menand of course womenwith goodwill we can fill this body with those who really want to see democracy fulfilled so we need our young people to keep up the street heat and demand that congress act it is past time that we get serious about restoring the voting rights act and ensuring that all americansand that means all americanshave free and unobstructed access to the ballot box also the serious economic disparities that persist in the african american community are very very evident according to a report released earlier this year by the joint economic committee led by ranking member congresswoman carolyn maloney and the congressional black caucus we learned and it is very glaring that more than one in three black children are born into poverty and the african american poverty rate is three times that of white americans the cycle of poverty and inequality starts in our school systems where black students account for 42 percent of preschool student expulsions despite accounting for only 18 percent of enrollment now that is preschool expulsion every time i remember this and say this it really makes me very terrified about what is taking place with young black kids especially with young black boys because there is no way anybody no kids should be expelled from preschool that is ages 1 to 4 that is outrageous i am the mother yes of two fabulous great black men and i am the grandmother of two black boys and i find statistics like that very very troubling for african americans we have allowed our school system to be turned into a pipeline to prison we must act now to address systemic issues facing our education and our criminal justice systems i want to applaud congressman bobby scott and congressman conyers because they have worked for decades on criminal justice reform and we are beginning to see some progress as a result of their very diligent work our criminal justice system is broken it needs to be rebuilt from the ground up so alongside of our cbc colleagues once again we are calling for comprehensive criminal justice reform also i want to mention our effort which i cochair with chairman butterfield our tech 2020 initiative silicon valley is right next to my district in california there are great opportunities there for everyone however the tech industry has not been inclusive of hiring and contracting with and working with communities of color especially the african american community so i am very pleased that the tech 2020 of the congressional black caucus has been initiated we are working with our great leader reverend jesse jackson with an insideoutside strategy many of the tech companies understand what is taking place and that they need to be an industry that is inclusive of everyone so the black caucus along with rainbow push along with the tech industry are working on a variety of strategies to make sure that this industry which provides goodpaying jobs and opportunities is an industry that is inclusive that does not discriminate and that includes the diversity of this great country so i have to just say to congresswoman kelly and congressman payne thank you for giving us a chance to talk about so many of the issues that we have been working on when you look at the issue of poverty cutting poverty in half in 10 years we know how to do it we have legislation the half in ten act h r 258 to do that and the pathways out of poverty act h r 2721 we know how to provide opportunities the congressional black caucus once again is leading on all of these fronts it is a big agenda but it is an agenda that makes our country stronger so thank you congresswoman kelly and thank you congressman payne for the chance to be with you tonight"], [0.0012566447257995605, 0.9987433552742004, 1, "first let me thank congresswoman robin kelly and congressman donald payne jr for hosting this important special order i appreciate your leadership in organizing this important discussion on the state of black health in america every april we observe national minority health awareness month this year is particularly significant as we mark 30 years since the groundbreaking health and human services task force on black and minority health report this report sparked the first serious discussion in washington on addressing the deep racial health disparities that exist in this country this year also marks 50 years since the creation of medicare and medicaidprograms that have kept and continue to keep americans healthy we are also celebrating the fifth year anniversary of the passage of the affordable care actthe most significant legislation to improve the health of all americans in more than a generation these legislative achievements continue moving us closer to health equity for allhowever major health disparities still exist the zip code in which you are born still determines your likely life expectancy gross disparities exist from zip code to zip codeeven within the same city or county so today i rise to join my colleagues in the congressional black caucus to bring to light the state of black health in america and call for more action to address persistent and lingering disparities in health access treatment and care since the passage of the affordable care act access to care has dramatically expanded in communities of color the uninsured rate has declined 7 3 percent in the african american community and more people have access to affordable quality healthcareall thanks to the affordable care act when we were crafting the affordable care act i had the privilege of serving as chair of the congressional black caucus and let me tell you we worked day and night with our colleagues in the congressional hispanic caucus and congressional asian pacific american caucus to push congress and the administration to craft the best possible bill since its passage the affordable care act has improved the american health care system healthcare is now more affordable and accessible than ever women can no longer be discriminated against because they are a woman have a preexisting conditionsuch as hiv aidsor have been the victim of domestic violence young people can stay on their parents health insurance until they are 26 and people with serious conditions like cancer no longer face the real fear of hitting their lifetime cap and being denied lifesaving treatment the aca also expands the capacity of the healthcare delivery system to better serve those at risk for and living with hiv aids these are the facts the affordable care act has dramatically increased access to preventative care for women lowincome communities and people of color despite rabblerousing and grandstanding from the right this law is saving livesevery day in communities across americafrom maine to my district in the east bay during the last enrollment period 16 4 million americans obtained health insurance and more than half a million came from my home state of california make no mistakethe affordable care act is working african americans and latinos historically underinsured or uninsured groups have seen the greatest declines in their uninsured rates this is especially good news for african americans who are living with hiv where the key to halting the epidemic is access to affordable and quality care with this increase in coverage we are beginning to close the gap in racial and ethnic health disparities and access to care however much work remains to truly realize health equity in america right nowin america the richest and most powerful country in the worldafrican americans still suffer from disproportionately high numbers of preventable deaths disparities in access to quality health care and underrepresentation within the medical community african americans have the highest mortality rate of any racial and ethnic group from cancer furthermore africanamericans are 40 more likely to die from a stroke than whites and 30 more likely to die from heart disease than whites and while african americans are only 13 of the unitedstates population they account for nearly half of all new hiv infections african americans also account for the highest hivrelated deaths and hiv death rates madam speakerthis is unacceptable in an age where technology and innovation are paving the way to new medical breakthroughs these persistent disparities in healthcare cannot be allowed to continue that is why today i urge my colleagues lets work together and commit ourselves to passing legislation that will end racial and ethnic disparities and achieve health equity the affordable care act was a good start but more is needed for years the congressional tricaucus has championed this effort by introducing the health equity and accountability act heaa congresswoman robin kelly will have the honor in introducing this important legislation this congress and i am proud to colead this effort as cochair of the capac health task force this important legislation builds on the affordable care act and puts us on track to eliminate health disparities in our country the health equity and accountability act would address incidences of terminal and chronic diseases that disproportionally affect communities of color including cancer diabetes heart disease and hiv aids so in recognition of national minority health awareness month i urge my colleagues to support this important bill in order to truly achieve health equity for all the state of black health in america is improving but much work remains before us as our drum major for justice dr king told us of all the forms of inequality injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane i urge my colleagues to join us in securing health equity for all"], [0.0013057589530944824, 0.9986942410469055, 1, "i thank congresswoman kelly and congressman payne for organizing this special order and for your continued leadership on so many vital issues and for staying the course and holding down the fort for the congressional black caucus it is so important that our message of unity and our messagewhich really describes what many of the issues are that all of our communities are faced withthat that message goes out both of you have really been tremendous in this effort so i rise this evening to join this critical conversation on race relations in america and to challenge our colleagues to work with the congressional black caucus to realize progress for racial justice and equality i join congresswoman kelly and congressman payne in sending my condolences to the families and the victims of the horrific terrorist attacks in paris lebanon nigeria and also in egypt know that we join in this quest for global peace and security throughout the world now tonights special order is an important part of our work to address the discrimination and racism that still plagues our nation specifically as it relates to african americans but we know that it impacts all communities of color it is manifested in many ways and it affects our entire country as congressman payne said so eloquently we are the united states so when one is affected all are affected all across the country at universities like mizzou and yale in places like baltimore and ferguson and in high schools like spring valley high in columbia south carolina we are witnessing the painful impact of institutional racism in our communities very recently we saw this in my home district at berkley high school in one of the most progressive and enlightened cities in the country black students were subjected to threatening messages on campus but i am so proud of the students at berkley they walked offit was not only black students it was all studentsand marched out peacefully through the city to protest these terrible despicable messages this is unacceptable all students have a right to learn free from violence and from threats as long as black students and any student of color feels unsafe in their classrooms our work for justice remains incomplete this crisis isnt limited to our schools tragically people of color face institutional racism from the moment they are born according to a report released earlier this year by the joint economic committee and the congressional black caucus more than one in three black children are born into poverty this cycle of poverty and inequality continues in our school system where black students account for 42 percent of preschool student expulsions mind you now that is preschool that is students from about 2 years old to 4 years old black students account for 42 percent of preschool student expulsions despite accounting for only 18 percent of enrollment i cant figure out how any student aged 2 to 4 is expelled from school that is outrageous yet 42 percent of preschool student expulsions are african american babies these kids dont even get a start let alone a head start outside of the classroom african americans are overpoliced overcriminalized and underemployed a report published by the new york times in april found that there are an estimated 1 5 million black men between the ages of 24 to 54 who are missing from civic life just missing it these missing men who account for one in every six black men have been victims of mass incarceration or premature death and this crisis of inequality extends to the structures of the community and have persisted from generations over the past four decades the average unemployment rate for blacks has been double the rate for white americans for many black families it feels like this is a permanent recession this must be our call to action that is why i am so proud of our young people throughout the country and students who are standing up to racism and injustice in their communities it is time for congress to listen to the young people saying that black lives matter and black students matter earlier this month i held a forum on racial justice in my district to address these issues more than 300 east bay residents from all backgrounds attended and raised their voices for justice this was the second forum that i have held throughout the last 3 months now i have been able to reach over 1 000 east bay residents so tonight in this dialogue which congressman payne and congresswoman kelly have talked about this dialogue leads to action hopefully our colleagues would think about hosting these types of forums and listen to what people are saying listen to what the impact of some of our policies are on their daily lives we must be part of the conversation and the solution but we must listen we must hear the pain and the suffering that people are experiencing as a result of discrimination and racial injustice now the congress must act to start addressing the systemic racism that degrades our institutions and threatens our communities it is past time for us to get serious about us addressing the lack of opportunity for black and minority families in this country right now today in this chamber there is legislation that can start moving the needle forward we need to empower our communities to build greater trust between law enforcement and communities of color and we need to address chronic recidivism which would be a huge step toward returning some of our missing men to their families and communities to do this congress should pass the safe justice act sponsored by congressman sensenbrenner and congressman scott congress should also pass the stop militarizing law enforcement act h r 1232 to stop the militarization of our nations police forces we also should pass the police accountability act h r 1102 and the grand jury reform act h r 429 so we can ensure that deadly force cases are heard by a judge and that there is more accountability for police officers as we reform our broken criminal justice system and work to help repair those families hurt by mass incarceration we will be strengthening america we will have people who really can make a contribution not only to their families and their communities but to the entire country the federal government shouldnt continue to put up barriers to work for those trying to rebuild their lives after making a mistake and should ban the box totally by federal contractors and by federal agencies we also need to repeal the lifetime ban on pell grants for those formerly incarcerated as it relates to drug felonies the ineligibility for public assistance and food stamps we need to remove these barriers so that people of color primarily african american men and latino men can get back into society get a job and take care of their families once again this is an example of public policy that racism wreaks its ugly head in our own institutions and policies finally we must address the poverty that plagues communities of color all across the country we have the whips task force on poverty income inequality and opportunity which i am proud to chair with our whip mr hoyer we are working with more than 100 of our colleagues now to advance policies that give all families including african american families living below the poverty line both in urban communities and in rural communities a fair shot this effort includes our half in ten act h r 258 which calls for a national strategy to cut poverty in half in the next decade that is more than 22 million americans lifted out of poverty into the middle class in just the next 10 years by being strategic and coordinating our existing programs our pathway out of poverty act h r 2721 would create goodpaying jobs it would lift families out of poverty into the middle class while strengthening our safety net for those who are still struggling ultimately the only way to end institutional racism is to give african americans and people of color a seat at the table and we need to pass legislation and policies that begin to remove these barriers my mentor the honorable congresswoman shirley chisholm used to say if they dont give you a seat at the table bring in a folding chair that is what our young people are doing around the country so i want to thank all of the people across our country who are bringing in folding chairs and ensuring that these important conversations happen we hear you we support you and we will keep fighting for you for ensuring liberty and justice for all which means just that it means for all in doing so we will make the united states a stronger

representatives to beg the majority party just to debate and vote on commonsense gun legislation that the vast majority of americans demand we should not be living in a society where debate and even

standing up for the millions of americans who want congress to do something and honoring the thousands of americans who have lost their lives to gun violence here we are standing up for our constituents who are tired of the excuses and want to hear a debate and want to see us take action on gun violence and here we are today to represent the victims the list is so long orlando san

home a 98yearold grandmother was killed when a shooter came in and opened fire here in the united states you are 10 times more likely to be killed by a gun than in any other developed nation in the

are 50 times more likely to die of a gun death than in all of those other countries we have the most guns and we have the most gun violence we have the nra through fear intimidation and misinformation the nra has taken control over the debate on guns to such an extent that we cannot even vote in this chamber on whether we should keep guns out of the hands of terrorists right now someone can be on both the terrorist watch list and the nofly list in other words the fbi thinks you are a terrorist and the tsa bans you from flying but if you want to drive down to your local gun store and buy an assault rifle there is nothing anyone can do to stop you over the last 10 years people on the terrorist watch list tried to buy explosives or firearms 2 233 times over 90 percent of the time they were successful this is wrong the american people know it is wrong public health officials know it is wrong and nearly every single law enforcement association in america knows it is wrong which is why they are all in favor of closing the terrorist gun loophole in fact a recent poll by a republican pollster found 76 percent of gun owners and 71 percent of nra members said suspected terrorists should not be allowed to buy guns if you were to walk outside the house of representatives right now and stop someone walking down the street and ask the simple question should terrorists be allowed to buy guns you would get a very simple answer they would say no of course terrorists should not be allowed to buy guns but they can republicans here in the house wont even let us have a debate and a vote on it how did we get here mr speaker how has the debate shifted so far away from commonsense gun regulation that a proposal to close the terrorist gun loophole is this controversial why is it that here in the house debate is silenced and we are not allowed to vote the closest we came to a debate on gun legislation recently came last week when a controversy erupted about the standard procedure to observe a moment of silence on the house floor after a mass shooting it is shameful that we have allowed this country to get to a point where congress has to even have a standard procedure to observe

my colleague from ohio congresswoman joyce beatty who spoke on the floor about the 60th anniversary of what happened in montgomery when rosa parks with great courage refused to give up her seat on the bus the courage of that woman and all of those who supported her has made such an incredible difference in our country and it is indeed related to what i want to say about hiv and aids many of us had the privilege of knowing rosa parks when she worked for john conyers we honored her here in the house and are so proud that we have a statue of rosa parks in the capitol of the united states we think of her and we think of the courage she had which led to the civil rights act the voting rights act and that voting rights act and civil rights act led to our having a much more diverse congress of the united states from there came our congressional black caucus the hispanic caucus and the asian pacific caucus the black caucus directly related to mr conyers who was a founding member and rosa parks who was an inspiration they were responsible for so much change in the leadership of our congress and because so many issues spring from the congressional black caucus some say the conscience of the congress so the relationship from rosa parks through the caucus to now we are observing the 25th anniversary of world aids day the link is congresswoman barbara lee who has been such a champion in the congress on this subject we take great pride in the accomplishments she has had in her capacity as a member of congress but also as our representative to the united nations general assembly each year world aids day is observed internationally to reflect the progress that has been made in reaffirming our determination to banish aids to the annals of history we recognize that achieving an aidsfree generation requires our relentless energetic and undaunted commitment to testing treatment and finding a cure the world aids day theme this year the time to act is now challenges us to act with the urgency that this global epidemic demands aids as we know and the hiv virus is a ferocious and resourceful disease a resourceful virus evermutating to escape our efforts to destroy it therefore we have to be ferocious resourceful and adaptable in our effort to succeed to end hiv we must bring bold thinking and deep commitment to testing treatment and the search for a cure and a vaccine to prevent president bush with his pepfar initiative took a big advance in how we can help prevent the spread of aids in the rest of the world he and mrs bush with their pink ribbon red ribbon initiative to link cervical cancer prevention with hiv testing and treatment in africa was a remarkable initiative so we salute the bipartisanship we supported of course president bush with pepfar we wanted it bigger and he wanted it strong and there we were with something that has saved millions of lives and given hope to people i visited some of the clinics in africa where pepfar is being administered and some of the people i met there said i would never have come in to be tested before because there was no reason i had no hope that there would be any remedy or any maintaining of a quality of life that would have encouraged me to risk the stigma of saying that i was hivinfected so again it is all about the people in new york today bono will be observing the 10th anniversary of the one and red initiatives that have set out to alleviate poverty and eradicate disease with a heavy focus on hiv aids we know the work of the melinda and bill gates foundation and what they have done on this issue particularly in india i today also wish i could be in san francisco where amfar will be saluting the work at university of californiasan francisco on hiv aids by establishing a new initiative there i am just mentioning a few other observances of world aids day it is happening throughout the world if you go back a number of years when i came to congress we were going to two funerals a day it was the saddest thing now we are going to weddings and helping people make out their wills and all the rest because they have a longer life ahead the maintenance of life the quality of life is really important but we do want a cure so i said it was the 25th anniversary of world aids day i meant to say the 25th anniversary of the ryan white care act that young man whose name is something that is iconic to all of us left us but his mother carries on the tradition and it has made such a tremendous difference my colleague henry waxman who is no longer in the congress but is still a champion on hiv aids was so instrumental in leading us to passing that legislation so it has been bipartisan it is global it is personal it is urgent that we continue so that one day 50 years from now people will say what was aids what was that and the books will show that it was a terrible terrible tragedy that befell the worlds population regardless of status of wealth of gender or of race and something that is now buried in the news somewhere as a terrible memory but not a part of our future again as we observe world aids day may we all wear our red ribbons in sympathy with those who have lost their lives sadly before the science took us to a better place on this that is what we are counting on research and science to take us to a better place on this and also the enthusiasm determination and relentlessness of so many people throughout the world to make hiv aids a horrible horrible memory again but not part of our future"], [0.0013848543167114258, 0.9986151456832886, 1, "the horrific mass shooting that took place on june 12 at the pulse nightclub in orlando florida is a stark reminder of the urgent responsibility that we have to reduce gun violence in this country this monstrous attack on the lgbt community in a place of refuge and empowerment requires us to act the shooter in orlando used an assault rifle that is virtually identical to the ones used by mass killers in san bernardino umpqua community college aurora and sandy hook elementary school that is no coincidence out of the eight highprofile mass shootings that have taken place in the past year seven involved the use of an assault weapon when an assault weapon is used in a mass shooting the number of people shot increases by 153 percent and the number of people killed increases by 63 percent these are weapons of war that are designed to kill as many people as possible as quickly as possible they belong on a battlefield they dont belong in our communities and i will continue to fight to reinstate the assault weapons ban this morning i want to use the time that i have to talk about two proposals that the speaker should bring up for immediate vote no fly no buy and universal background checks this is really really simple if you are too dangerous to fly on an airplane then you are too dangerous to buy a gun but under the laws that we have in place today someone who is on the fbis terrorist watch list who is too dangerous to get on a plane can still walk into any gun store in america pass a background check and walk out with an assault weapon or any other gun he wants in fact from 2004 until 2014 more than 2 000 suspected terrorists bought firearms legally in this country and they are going to continue doing so until we stop them until 9 11 bombs were the weapon of choice for terrorists looking to strike the united states but in the 15 years since then 95 percent of terrorist deaths that took place in the united states resulted from gunfire it is impossibleimpossibleto understand that house republicans have now voted 13 times to block the no fly no buy proposal that congressman peter king and congressman mike thompson introduced to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists in this country why what are they afraid of that we might actually stop a terrorist from passing a background check before he buys an assault rifle at cabelas bring the no fly no buy bill to the floor today lets have an upordown vote let the american people hold us accountable for where we stand this should be a nobrainer more than 80 percent of americans believe we should prevent suspected terrorists from buying a gun and more than 90 percent of americans believe that a background check should be required on every firearm sale so we can keep guns out of the hands of criminals and those with such serious mental illness that possessing a gun would make them a danger to themselves or others bills are pending to fix our background check system and to require a background check on every gun sale this is one of the single most important and effective steps that we can take to reduce gun violence in this country right now anyone can go to a gun show or get on the internet and purchase a gun without a background check as many as two out of every five firearm transactions today are conducted without a background check it is too easy for a criminal a domestic abuser a terrorist or someone with a serious mental illness to buy a gun through this loophole every day background checks block 171 attempted purchases by felons 48 attempted purchases by domestic abusers and 19 attempted purchases by fugitives it is critical that we strengthen the background check system and require checks on all firearm sales so we can keep more dangerous individuals from acquiring these deadly weapons bring the fix gun checks act to the floor today we held a moment of silence last week for the victims in orlando i know that all of us have kept the victims and their loved ones and the people of orlando in our thoughts and prayers since june 12 but the best way to honor the lives lost in this horrific tragedy is to do something to prevent it from happening to others a moment of silence is not enough we need a moment of sustained action in this chamber and we need it today it will be an insult to the victims of this shooting and their families and every victim of every shooting in this

communities those of us in congress have the power to do something and it is long past time for us to act we can start with measures that have broad support among the american people ninety percent of americans support comprehensive background checks background checks would help reduce the flood of weapons that come into chicago from gun shows and online sales would it stop every shooting of course it wouldnt but would it save some lives absolutely my heart goes out to the families in dallas and orlando and chicago and so many other places that have had the lives of their loved ones stolen away by gun violence and we need to grieve but after that moment of silence we must direct our sadness and our anger into action the problem of violence in communities may seem insurmountable and no single policy will stop every death but we should start by passing commonsense gun legislation supported by the vast majority of the american people we need a vote on legislation to keep guns out of the wrong hands republicans and democrats and gun owners and nra members agree that background checks for every gun purchase and closing the gun show loopholes and all the other loopholes will help so

the families in flint michigan first i want to acknowledge many members of the michigan delegation led by flints representative congressman dan kildee who are fighting every day to bring justice to these families their work is essential to ensuring the people of flint have the resources that they need to recover the situation in flint is nothing short of a tragedy and a tragedy that could have been prevented michigan state officials sacrificed the health and futures of flints children in order to save a few dollars in water costs this really is a shame and a disgrace i have to ask would this have happened in a city where the residents had the advantage of wealth or do these gross breaches of public trust only happen in cities where politicians believe the residents are expendable sadly i think we all know the answer to that question after the incredible harm that has already been done to these families our elected officials are once again turning their backs on the people of flint these families deserve better the people of flint were already hurting before the water crisis the average family income in the city is just 24 834 a year no one can raise a family on that many of these courageous and resilient families struggle to find highquality child care access healthcare services and afford healthy food and now the costs of this crisis are mounting for families the schools and the entire community we can and we must do more for our fellow americans in their time of need two years since this tragedy began families are still relying on bottled water for daily life imagine using bottled water for everything from brushing your teeth to making a bottle for a hungry baby we can do better by these families they need support including health care nutrition specialized education and developmental care and we need to fix the root of the problem the degraded dangerous pipes and infrastructure that caused this tragedy the shortsighted dangerous actions of michigan officials have already caused unimaginable pain for these families we cannot allow congress to betray these families as well let me just say that i was part of a congressional delegation that traveled to flint michigan to listen to the residents regarding the horrendous impact of these government decisions that led to the poisoning of those children and families the environmental injustice in flint is an example of how many lowincome communities of color throughout our country not just in flint throughout the united states an example of how they are treated differently than affluent communities congressman dan kildee and members of the michigan delegation have introduced legislation that would help these families rebuild their lives and get the care they need for their children the families of flint act h r 4479 is a comprehensive plan to address their most urgent needs it would provide for critical investment in flints water system to replace the lead pipes that poisoned these families this legislation would also provide essential support services to the families of flint to help these children mitigate and overcome lead exposure these are simple commonsense measures for the people of flint addressing this tragedy really shouldnt be a partisan issue every member of this chamber should understand the need for urgent action it could happen in any of our communities yet congressional republicans have not held one single vote or even a hearing on this bill that is just simply outrageous and let me just say that flint is not the only public health crisis that congressional republicans have ignored there are 17 000 americansincluding almost 1 600 pregnant womenwho have contracted the zika virus the president submitted an emergency request of 1 9 billion for zika funding more than 6 months ago and the republicans have failed to act on it now if we dont act soon the cdc will be out of money to combat zika in a matter of weeks congressional republicans also failed to do their job on gun violence every day more than 90 million people die from gun violence this too is a public health crisis but congressional republicans once again have refused to take up any commonsense gun legislation even though 91 percent of americans support background checks to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists and criminals it is clear that the american people need

york where we have seen the convergence of poverty and the need for criminal justice reform converge i too want to offer my sympathy to the family of freddie gray we have watched them over the past couple of days in the midst of their mourning to be able to stand up and call for peace nonviolence nonviolent protests they should be honored and to those in baltimore and particularly my colleague from marylandi will call him congressman cummings with the bullhorn politics the bullhorn leadershiphe should be commended for the stunning and outstanding engagement that he touched the hearts and minds of his constituents walked those streets to be able to acknowledge the pain the poverty but that there is a better way that there is a way toward the stars that we all want our children to have and yes to ms graham who wanted better for her son michael i want him not to be embarrassed but to be proud that he had a mother with such deep love that she wanted to take him away from doing it wronglynot against protests not against the quiet marching of the spirit of dr king but to know that engaging in violence is intolerable and will not allow him to reach the very high heights that he can reach today i stand here to acknowledge the convergence of the need for criminal justice reform and the deep and abiding poverty in the african american community one in every six americans is living in poverty totaling 46 2 million people this is the highest number in 17 years children represent a disproportionate amount of the united states poor population it falls heavily on the african american community in my district there are 190 000plus living in poverty it falls heavily on the african american community this is not a standing invitation for the door to open and say lets blame president obama president obama has been a stellar leader on the questions of realizing the investment in people from the stimulus that brought us out of the depths of collapse of the markets and a complete imploding of the capitalistic system he provided the stimulus that moved us toward an economy where we were creating jobs but here we have in congress this dastardly sequester that is cutting head start seats not investing in infrastructure not creating jobs or providing opportunities for our young people so today i say that there needs to be a call for action that call for action is that this congress must get rid of sequester and must look at the baltimores and must look at the fergusons and houstons and l a s and new yorks and cities across america and realize that we are coming upon a summertime and if we dont act to invest in our children and to begin to give an agenda to release ourselves from poverty we will have doomed ourselves and i would offer to say that the inertia of moving toward criminal justice reform in this congress is unacceptable i call upon members to come together collectively to be able to pass legislation the cadet bill that i have introduced the build trust bill but more importantly i am calling upon our government to invest in our youth to get rid of the poverty to prepare them as they go into higher education as they go into upper grades we must have a program of summer jobs this summer and we must have a collaborative effort with corporate america wake up corporate america wake up corporate baltimore wake up corporate new york wake up corporate houston there must be an investment in summer jobs collaborating with the federal government to make a difference to lift families out of poverty we do know that summer jobs with young people elevate families ability to pay their bills and to provide resources for their families so if the story of baltimore is any it is one dont jump to conclusions dont jump to conclusions that freddie gray tried to hurt himself dont jump to conclusions that these young people dont mean well dont jump to conclusions that they shouldnt have done what they have done jump to the conclusions that these are young people who are hungry and looking for leadership and are in pain as congressman cummings said look for the opportunity for them help rebuild baltimore help give them jobs help tell them that the improved relationships between police and community are going to be moved forward as a number one agenda for the united states congress and this government that they call the united

extensive training they were ordinary patriotic americans doing their part to help in the war effort mr burns was a woodturner in a furniture factory before enlisting mr longmire worked as a sales clerk selling poultry nothing in their background prepared them for handling munitions and unfortunately the navy at that time did not provide adequate training for the men serving at port chicago so

calories all the time she does it better than i do but consumers are moving in that direction i have walked through various industries including dominos and have seen the amazing technological advances that they have that are putting their consumers first and giving them the ability to know this in a far more meaningful way than you can do on a menu board so i reject that argument absolutely in defense of the consumer as well as the industry mr chair again i appreciate the concern that my colleague expresses here yet i still stand in very strong support of giving this opportunity making sure that fda is pushed into a flexibility that i dont believe they are willing to go this is for the consumer in the end this allows advances to move within the market i think we will find that all concerns are met and addressed very well but we dont put unnecessary burdens upon businesses job providers and ultimately on the choice of citizens to have a better opportunity to make better choices and oh by the way we reaffirm in our country the desire to give people personal responsibility and personal choice together mr chair i yield back the balance of my time"],

having my grandmother marjorie and laverne born on the same day in the very same small town amidst the rice fields of northern california my grandmother marjorie and laverne spent many years together celebrating birthdays music life and friends we were blessed with my grandmother for 77 years but laverne in northern california we were blessed with for 100 years so lavernes loss indeed makes a big ripple she made a big ripple in her life with all the people she touched and her love of music indeed she was a talented musician and freely gave her time and her talent for decades through teaching music at yuba college participating in handels messiah for almost 75 years and playing the organ at marysvilles first presbyterian church for 20 years indeed when we lose somebody we have what we call a celebration of life her celebration of life was last november when she reached her 100th birthday and she had the best party i have ever seen with an orchestra cellos and everything she got on the keyboard herself and showed us what 100 years of life and vigor in northern california looks like we will miss her but we will always smile when we think of laverne grell"], [0.00127449631690979,

slaughter innocent people and inspire terror we stand with the french people and are all committed to redoubling our efforts to ensure we keep americans safe and intensify our efforts to eradicate these evil sinister forces that appear almost to be a different species it is important however that we think through clearly where we are what we have done and what makes sense going forward to protect americans and redouble our efforts against this enemy we must not jump to conclusions and do something before it is carefully planned and analyzed i was here in the aftermath of the horror of 9111 the killing of innocent americans in the twin towers and the pentagon and but for the bravery of passengers on united airlines flight 93 we might well have had our capitol destroyed the federal government acted after 9111 but it is not clear our actions were thought out the way they should we assembled a clumsy behemoth the department of homeland security the largest department we have created since 1947 in retrospect it is not clear that was the wisest course of action think about the excessive bureaucracy charges of waste fraud and inefficiency in that department look at the clumsy response to katrina we passed the patriot act instead of the bipartisan legislation produced by the committee on the judiciary look at the vast sprawling shadowy intelligence network so large nobody actually knows precisely how big it is remember the failure of 9111 to stop the attack was not for lack of intelligence it was a failure to be able to use the knowledge we have there is a danger at times of drowning in data the impulse to lash out led to the disastrous war in iraq the aftermath of that effort has done more to empower isis it not only drew people to the movement but we created a space where they can operate grow and lash out at us now we hear what can only be described as crazy talk in the republican presidential primaries not just about sealing the borders but having a religious test for refugees fleeing terror remember the 9111 attackers did not sneak across the borders but exploited weaknesses in our visa system even in europe it appears that most of the people involved with the attack did not sneak in hidden with syrian refugees they were actually people already in europe radicalized and moving freely about it is appropriate to be concerned angry and determined to protect innocent people to hunt down and eliminate these horrific threats i just hope that we learn from our past mistakes about impulse and overreach that may not produce its intended results but instead may leave us with more problems and vulnerability remember how a college dropout was able to expose vast amounts of sensitive american data edward snowden had been a private contractor who had worked for the government just a few months working in a highly charged political environment does not tend to bring out the best in congress we need to be careful about getting this right that we have the support of the american people and that congress in a really frustrating time in american politics takes the time and energy to craft effective action lets try and get on the same page rather than a rapid response which history shows is not necessarily the right response decidedly turning our back on syrian refugees is unamerican unpatriotic and morally weak turning our back on an entire population due to broadbrush characterizations of those who practice a certain faith goes against our core values as a country i think america is better than that seeking compassion for syrian refugees can be done securely the facts make that clear a failure to do so would put us on the wrong side of history it would be one of those mistakes we make under pressure and would only make us less safe rather than more"], [0.002428889274597168, 0.5024288892745972, 0, "on rollcall no 477 on passage of h r 5538 i am not recorded because i was representing constitutents on
