thoughtful consideration and care that he has shown to all of us but particularly to sala during the last several difficult months i have only been in this congress a relatively short period of time i am beginning my fifth year yet i cannot help but reflect that after one of the first weekends that my wife and i left town in our first term we came back to washington and saw a flag at halfmast and did not know why the flag was at halfmast and were shocked and deeply saddened to learn that it was as a result of the passing of one of the giants in politics and in legislative activity not just from california but from the country phil burton and today as i came into the office i saw the flags at halfmast again and was again very saddened to realize that these flags were flying at halfmast

last night but reflect during the few minutes that i happened to watch the end of the very impressive show about lbj i thought i was watching phil burton as the man who played lbj demonstrated such an extraordinary ability to influence individuals and such an extraordinary grasp of the legislative process since phil burtons death i have thought so often about the legacy that he has left and so many of us have been touched so personally and so deeply by the fact that sala in her own way has not only continued that legacy but has added in her own personal thoughtful caring fashion a very very personal touch to the lives of so many of us and to the legislative activities in this chamber sala had a visceral opposition to discrimination sala had a visceral concern for people in need sala had a visceral commitment to try to help those in this country and frankly around the globe who needed help and who needed assistance from the public sector sala knew in her own mind what was right she did not have to carefully thoughtfully methodically analyze and weigh issues in terms of where she was going to come out she knew she knew what was right and she fought for what was right she cared as deeply as any individual that i have known about people about people that she knew and about people that she would never know as others have indicated she was such an important influence on each of us as apparently was the case with so many of my colleagues and i who find it fascinating listening today to how many people sala expressed so beautifully a concern not just about them but about their families sala would always in her relations with me first ask me how jan was and how the kids were and it was something that sala cared very deeply about jan and i used to participate with sala periodically in a study group and sala would attend that group religiously not because it would provide sala with any political benefit or not because it provided sala with any significant legislative opportunities but because it gave sala an opportunity to participate in something that enriched her life personally and gave sala an opportunity to share with others of us who cared so much about her her own experiences and her own personal concerns so on a family level on a personal level on a legislative level it is going to be extraordinarily different around here with sala not being here physically but as others have mentioned the legacy that sala leaves the inspiration that sala provided the importance that sala had for each of us in her own way is something that has enriched all of

numerous archeological natural cultural and fish and wildlife resources particularly the flying foxes the park would encompass approximately 8 200 acres including large areas on the islands of tau and tutuila and a small coastal area on ofu when this legislation was introduced in june of this year i was pleased to join as an original cosponsor as i recognized the importance of preserving tropical forests and their unique wildlife i have been fortunate to deal with insular issues affecting samoa since i fiist came to congress my work has taken me to samoa where i have witnessed the beautiful and diverse flora and fauna of the islands and coastal areas i was equally impressed by the tospitable and proud people of the territory of american samoa they have good reason to be proud the tropical islands of samoa are an often overlooked scenic natural resource of the united states american samoa has one of only three tropical rain forests under unitedstates jurisdiction puerto rico has the beautiful el yunque hawaii has the highly vulnerable forest in the hawaii volcanoes national park and american samoa has the third the diminution of tropical forests worldwide is accelerating with numerous adverse impacts on our environment there exists a considerable amount of interest in the congress as well as elsewhere in the government and among private organizations to stem stop or even reverse the decline of world tropical forests it appears to me that we should first do whatever we can to preserve our own tropical forests a very important factor in sustaining the tropical forests of samoa is a small and often misunderstood animal pteropus samoenis or flying fox a symbiotic relationship exists between these little animals and the tropical forests they need each other to survive the flying fox helps to pollinate the trees and the forest provides safe refuge it is anticipated that a national park would help protect the forests and the flying foxes so that both will continue to thrive and contribute to the environment in our exuberance to establish a park and preserve the forest we have been careful to remember first and foremost the people of samoa they know their islands better than anyone the culture of samoa revolves around the land and respect for nature in agreeing to the cession of the samoan islands of tutuila aunuu and the manua group the chiefs requested that the indigenous ownership of lands by samoans be preserved therefore the legislation provides for the secretary of the interior and the governor of american samoa to enter into a 50year lease of the lands and waters in the park with the option to extend the lease on or before its expiration if the lease is not extended the administration of the park would be transferred to the governor the secretary and the governor would negotiate the amount of the lease payments which would be disbursed by the governor to the villages and families located within the park the high court of samoa would determine the amount of the payments to individuals thus the park would be established without federal ownership of the land prior to the establishment of unitedstates jurisdiction in samoa in 1900 the samoan people had inhabited the islands for thousands of years the people had long recognized the vulnerability of animal and sea life and had incorporated strict conservation methods as part of their way of life in addition it was customary for the chiefs to monitor the population sizes of various species of fish once the number of fish neared the threshold of endangering the continuing viability of the species a temporary ban on taking that type of fish would be instituted the ban which is called tapu in samoan would not be lifted until the chiefs determined that an adequate population base existed given the samoans historical concern for the environment it is not surprising that there is widespread support in samoa for a park that would continue to preserve the islands natural resources under h r 4818 the park will also seek to potect the traditions and customs of samoa subsistence farming and subsistence reef fishing as have been traditionally used in the past will be allowed to continue in addition the access to park areas will provide for the traditional subsistence harvesting of breadfruit coconuts yams kava wild fruits and vegetables and plants for medicinal purposes the park will also permit the careful and customarily limited extraction of native trees to be used in traditional samoan houses and ware as land in samoa is such an important issue the legislation provides that the boundaries of the proposed park area will be clearly defined and mutually agreed to by the governor and respective villages before publication of the park maps h r 4818 also requires the secretary of the interior to develop a program to train native american samoans to work in the park and to extend a hiring preference to these individuals to ensure that the park employees are familiar with the samoan islands the people language and traditions i am confident that there are adequate native american samoans as clearly defined in the bill qualified to meet the staffing needs of the park the real employment opportunities that the national park offers however will be generated from business established in samoa to support the increase of visitors the villages families and individuals of american samoa can provide tours food and lodging as well as other services to visitors to the national park of samoa a great deal of time and effort have been invested by many individuals and organizations to help make the dream of a national park of american samoa to become a reality the national park service conducted an excellent study and recently transmitted a superb draft report to congress with recommendations for the park the chairman of the subcommittee mr vento certainly deserves recognition for his hard work on this legislation as well the subcommittee traveled to samoa last year to inspect the areas of the proposed park hold a hearing on the issue and moot with several of the high chiefs and local officials to obtain their views concerning the park i would clearly be remiss if i did not commend dr paul cox and dr merlin tuttle renowned experts on the flying fox and tropical forests dr cox and dr tuttle along with mr verne

eloquent remarks and for the leadership that the gentleman has shown over the years in this issue yes as we all can see if we will allow our eyes and ears and our minds to see another year has come and gone and the cypriot problem persists with no solution to be had it was the early morning hours of july 20 1974 that turkish paratroopers began descending on the island republic on the pretext that they were undertaking a peace operation intended to protect the turkish cypriot minority in the wake of the political turmoil then enveloping the country this socalled peace operation however was codenamed attila and was effectively an unlawful invasion and occupation of an independent country in violation of every tenet of international law custom and behavior the fact is that attila was not a peace operation at all it was an operation undertaken in order to achieve the partitionist plans of the turkish and turkishcypriot people it was indeed successful in meeting that goal for attila and attila ii on august 14 1974 effectively took over almost 40 percent of the territory of the republic while killing thousands of greek cypriots raping others uprooting 200 000 of them from their homes and looting and stealing from the homes and churches that they were forced to leave behind to make matters worse not only were these atrocities carried out but they were carried out with the use of supplies and equipment provided turkey by the united statesin violation of the unitedstates foreign assistance act of 1962 which authorizes the use of american aid solely for defensive purposes thirteen years have passed since that time and the years have seen several initiatives undertaken toward a solution a solution however has not been attained the reason is not that one is unattainable rather the sad reason for the stalemate is that turkey and the turkish cypriots have not negotiated toward a solution in good faith and have in fact taken a series of steps intended to achieve the permanent partion of the republic of cyprus turkey and the turkishcypriot leadership in direct violation of relevant u n resolutions have indeed taken a series of actions subsequent to the 1974 invastion which are aimed at consolidating the occupation and division of the small mediterranean republic facts speak louder than words so i will cite the evidence first and foremost turkey refused and to date still refuses to comply with international requests and pertinent u n resolutions to remove its occupation troops from the republic of cyprus to add insult to injury not only do they refuse to withdraw their troops but turkey has recently begun a military buildup on cyprus in both manpower and equipment to where today there are an estimated 34 000 to 35 000 turkish troops on cyprus with the number of tanks having more than doubled for a total of over 300 furthermore in an effort to further consolidate their illegal presence on the island turkey has moved in more than 60 000 mainland settlers who are threatening to turn the turkish cypriots themselves into a minority while occupying the homes and properties that the greekcypriots were forced to leave behind when they were turned into refugees in their own land in addition turkey and the turkish cypriot leadership is subjecting the greek cypriots to further indignity by systematically and intentionally destroying the christian and hellenic cultural heritage in the turkish occupied part of the island yes the greek cypriots have since the landing of the mainland troops and to this day been subjected to the pillaging theft and destruction of the artifacts and works of art that tell the story of their identity they have seen their ancient churches used as stables and warehouses they have seen their icons and other works of religious art stolen and they have seen their hellenic antiquities sold to private collectors throughout the world in order no doubt to systematically remove any trace of the cultural heritage which represents the national identity of the occupied areas as if these facts were not enough the partitionist aims of the turkish and turkishcypriot leadership were made crystal clear to the world when as recently as november 15 1983 they undertook an attempt to create a new turkish political entity in occupied cyprus yes they declared the northern occupied part of cyprus to be an independent country and called this pseudostate the turkish republic of northern cyprus fortunately law and logic prevailed and the international community almost unanimously withheld their recognition of the pseudostate and criticized the action i say almost unanimously withheld for the one exception and i underline one exception was turkey for turkey was the only country in the world community to grant its recognition to this illegal entity how i ask can turkey possibly pretend that they want and work toward the return of peace and unity to the republic of cyprus when they are a party to such destructive actions to the process how can they pretend to want to work with the u n secretarygeneral to find a workable solution to the situation when they ignore his expressions of concern as well as those of the united states over the military buildup on cyprus that turkey is engaging in by replying as turkish foreign minister halefoglu did on june 6 1987 that the evidence is ridiculous and untrue and that turkey does not have to answer to anyone on the number of troops and military equipment it has on cyprus i declare that turkey does have to answer for its actions and further i maintain that they should answer to the people of the united states it is the united states after all as i said earlier that supplies and equips turkey with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of foreign aid each year and it is the united states that they are giving a slap in the face to when they knowingly and intentionally fail to comply with the restrictions we place on that assistance the unitedstates congress is on record with its sound conviction that there can be no resolution of the cyprus conflict unless and until the turkish troops are removed from the island rather than comply however turkey laughs in our faces and increases its military presence there and does so with no less than united states origin equipment even while both the house foreign affairs committee and the senate foreign relations committee report out legislation prohibiting the continued use of united states origin military equipment by the 35 000 illegal turkish occupation forces on cyprus congress position on the cyprus issue is clear both the house foreign affairs committee and the senate foreign relations committee have reported out legislation that would prohibit the continued use of united states origin military equipment by the 35 000 illegal turkish occupation forces on cyprus in the senate the foreign aid authorization bill contains the pell amendment prohibiting the transshipment of united statessupplied military equipment from turkey to cyprus in the house the foreign aid bill contains language broomfieldyatronsnowe amendment prohibiting the transshipment of united statessupplied arms from either turkey or greece to cyprus both bills also maintain the traditional 7 10 funding ratio between greece and turkey this legislation is anything but a radical approach to this critical problem instead it merely clarifies the intent of congress as expressed in the foreign assistance act i strongly support this legislation because i believe it would be repugnant to the rule of law that we talked about here earlier when the gentleman from california had his special order which is recognized in our constitution for the united states to support in a direct or indirect way this illegal occupation and division of cyprus i take this opportunity to ask my colleagues to likewise support this necessary legislation to make matters worse turkey has the unmitigated gall to inform the state department that it is reconsidering implementing the alreadyagreed to extension of our base rights agreement because of all things congress attitude on the cyprus issue heaven help us i think that the united states and we as legislators have been more than patient and have tolerated an intolerable situation more than long enough i believe that it is now time to implement action in order to force turkey to cease the actions that are preventing an appropriate resolution to the cypriot problem despite our security interests in a strong security interest in a strong relationship with turkey and god knows they are there and those of us who care about america are concerned with the fact that turkey is in a very strategic position as is the country of greece and as is the independent republic of cyprus we must no longer tolerate such intransigence by the leadership in ankara without strong united opposition by the united states to turkish efforts to ensure the permanent partition of cyprus we cannot expect peace to be achieved in that country in the near future cyprus has always been a good friend to the united states and we should do whatever we can to help bring about a just solution cyprus is after all not only strategically important to the peace of the region but it has proven itself time and again to be a good friend and ally of the united states it was for example cyprus not turkey that allowed the united states the use of its facilities to carry supplies to our dying marines in lebanonturkey refused it has furthermore offered us its unrestrictive assistance after the bombing of the marine barracks in beirut in 1983 the bombing of our embassy in beirut in 1984 and during the highjacking of twa flight 847 in 1985 and while we are at it it was the greeks who fought and died heroically in world war ii while turkey chose neutrality and though it is little known it was 38 greeks who joined 6 unitedstates marines to win a military victory in 1805 on the shores of tripoli the same victory i might add that is immortalized in the marine hymn from the halls of montezuma to the shores of tripoli and i ask what has turkey contributed to the security of the west that is an open question turkey for example during the 1973 middle east war granted moscow overflight rights and overland passage rights to resupply syria and egypt while refusing united states overflights rights to resupply israel and among other questionable acts allowed soviet aircraft carriers passage through the dardanelles in violation of the montreux convention of 1936 and over nato objections we as legislators and we as americans must therefore do all in our power to bring about a just and lasting solution to the cypriot issue we must condition aid to turkey on her genuine efforts to reach just such a solution and we must push to see that this solution meets certain minimum conditions of acceptability including first the immediate withdrawal of all turkish occupation forces and colonists from cyprus second the immediate return of all occupied areas to the republic of cyprus under u n auspices for the immediate resettlement of the 200 000 greek cypriot refugees third an agreement by turkey and the turkishcypriots to a constitutional arrangement based on the universally accepted democratic principle of majority rule with full minority rights guaranteed as well as freedom of movement settlement and ownership anywhere in cyprus after all should there be a green line there i think not fourth an agreement by turkey to full cooperation with the international red cross regarding investigation of the five abducted americans and the 1 614 missing greek cypriots i might add that this factor in the cypriot issue has unfortunately not received as much international attention and concern as it might have and rightfully deserves the fact is that much like the americans missing in vietnam 1 619 individuals including 5 americans have been missing since the turkish invasion of cyprus clearly any fair and appropriate resolution of the issue must fully and adequately address the fate of these unfortunate victims and their families and so in closing i say on behalf of all three nations over there on behalf of american security and american interests in that entire area let us all work in earnest to return peace and unity to the republic of cyprus the cards are after all largely in our hands let us deal a fair and appropriate hand"], [0.9946034550666809, 0.9946034550666809,

in actual commercial flights is extremely small posing no demonstrated risk to nonsmoking passengers or flight personnel the vast majority of airline passengers feel that the current policy of separating smokers from nonsmokers is a reasonable policy there is obviously no need for this amendment outlawing smoking in flights under 2 hours in duration it is simply another ill advised kick at
